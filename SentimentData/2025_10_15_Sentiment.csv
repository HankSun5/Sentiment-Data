The bank reported $22.09 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $21.09 billion, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.24, above the forecast of $1.90. Citi’s net income jumped 15% year-on-year to $3.8 billion, driven by robust performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. The services business delivered its best quarter ever, with revenue up 7% from the same period a year ago. The banking division recorded a 34% surge, while the markets unit posted its strongest third quarter, climbing 15%. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said, “Investments in new products, crypto, and AI are driving innovation and improved capabilities across the franchise. The relentless execution of our strategy is delivering stronger business performance quarter after quarter and improving our returns.” Citi pushes ahead with Banamex stake sale and faces higher costs Amid the upbeat earnings , Citi confirmed that it is selling a 25% equity stake in its Mexican arm, Banamex, ahead of a public stock offering. The planned sale, part of its broader restructuring strategy, lifted overall expenses by 9% last quarter due to transaction-related costs. Including the Banamex goodwill impairment charge, the bank’s profit jumped 23% to $1.86 billion from a year earlier. Despite the added costs, Citi’s stock has surged more than 40% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500, which has faced renewed market turbulence tied to trade disputes. The strong quarterly results underscore the bank’s continued progress in optimizing its structure while maintaining steady earnings growth. Wall Street ends mixed as trade tensions resurface Markets saw wild swings on Tuesday as investors reacted to both the solid banking results and another flare-up between Washington and Beijing. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower at 6,644.31, after falling as much as 1.5% and rising 0.4% during the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 202.88 points, or 0.4%, to close at 46,270.46, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8% to 22,521.70. Tech stocks stayed under pressure, with Nvidia dragging the Nasdaq lower after recent losses. Caterpillar led the gains on the Dow. The start of Wall Street’s Q3 earnings season helped offset some of the volatility as Citi climbed 3.9%, Wells Fargo jumped 7.2%, and both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs topped estimates but slipped slightly by the end of the day. The market turbulence came after President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of China, accusing Beijing of failing to purchase U.S. soybeans as promised. His comments pulled the S&P 500 into the red late in the day, following an earlier rally sparked by optimism over strong corporate earnings. Late last week, Trump had threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a move that sent the Dow plunging over 800 points on Friday, its largest drop since April 10 when Trump announced ‘Liberation Day.’ By Sunday, however, Trump took a softer tone on Truth Social, writing, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine.” Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) (Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge) hit a four-month high above 22 during the day before closing at 20.81, reflecting investor caution over potential future shocks.

Beverage company Safety Shot, Inc. has officially rebranded to Bonk, Inc., marking the first time a memecoin-linked brand has found a home on a major U.S. exchange. The firm began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ BNKK ” on Friday, October 10, 2025. Today, the BONK ecosystem officially has a home in the public markets!

Nom), a BONK core contributor and board member, emphasized that this move officially gives the BONK ecosystem a home in the public markets. BONK Down 17.98% but Holds $1.3B Market Cap The BONK token is currently trading at $0.00001629, down 17.98% over the past seven days following a market-wide liquidation flush. Despite the pullback, BONK maintains a market cap above $1.3 billion , ranking among the top 65 cryptocurrencies globally. Analysts suggest BONK’s recent weakness may be temporary, with the token showing signs of stabilization. Technical charts indicate that clearing resistance around $0.0000165 to $0.0000186 could trigger a move toward 2024 highs near $0.00005916, over 100% upside from current levels. BONK price prediction: Rounded Bottom Pattern Indicates Potential Trend Reversal After a volatile sell-off earlier this month, BONK appears to be staging a sharp recovery. The 2-day chart shows BONK bounced aggressively from the 0.00001134 USDT support zone, forming a rounded bottom pattern, a classic reversal indicator. BONK is now trading near 0.0000166 USDT, testing descending trendline resistance from its August highs. Source: TradingView A breakout above this line would signal trend reversal, supported by rising On-Balance Volume (OBV), suggesting strong accumulation at lower levels. The next key zone lies between 0.00001764 and 0.00001870 USDT. A sustained close above this level could trigger a rally toward 0.00002607 USDT and potentially 0.00003000 USDT.

Right now, it is holding the $0.20 zone, and most analysts’ price predictions for Dogecoin remain bullish for a rebound, even though a short-term correction seems likely. At the same time, Wall Street’s interest in crypto has been strong lately. Despite the chaos, House of Doge , the business arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, went public to push DOGE further into mainstream finance and traditional commerce. Dogecoin Hits Nasdaq Through House of Doge—Here’s Why It Matters House of Doge is about to hit Nasdaq after a reverse takeover by Brag House Holdings (ticker: TBH), a college-focused gaming and streaming company. TBH had already jumped more than 40% in the last two weeks before today’s announcement. The move could be a big win. With access to more capital, House of Doge can speed up its plan to build global payment rails for Dogecoin and expand much faster. The company is also backed by Elon Musk’s personal attorney and sees going public as another step toward making Dogecoin a universal payment method. Brag House is making history! We’ve signed a definitive merger agreement with House of Doge — the commercial arm of the Dogecoin Foundation — For the House of Doge to list on NASDAQ and bring payments, tokenization, gaming, and yield to crypto's most loyal community. pic.twitter.com/nLzcX6vkRW — Brag House (@BragHouse) October 13, 2025 Brag House targets Gen Z gamers, college esports, and interactive streaming, which already line up perfectly with crypto culture. Adding Dogecoin into tournaments, rewards, and creator payouts could make it a natural, everyday currency for gamers. It also unlocks real utility through payments and microtransactions. DOGE could become a go-to coin for buying digital goods, tipping creators, and paying for entry fees in competitions. And the Nasdaq listing gives Dogecoin a new level of visibility. Since Brag House is already a listed company, this merger gives DOGE a publicly traded link to Wall Street and opens the door for institutional investors who want DOGE exposure without holding crypto directly. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is $1 DOGE Finally Possible? Source: DOGEUSD / Tradingview Here’s the deal with this DOGE chart . The price broke down cleanly from that rising wedge, which had been flashing weakness for weeks. But with House of Doge going public and ETF hype heating up, this could be setting up for something pretty interesting. The dump below $0.20 confirmed the bearish break, and you can see how it wicked straight into that $0.18 zone before bouncing. The RSI sitting around 38 shows it’s still leaning bearish but still not oversold yet, so there’s room either way. If DOGE can reclaim $0.22 and hold, it might crawl back toward $0.30, maybe even $0.50 later if market momentum changes. But if it loses $0.18 again, $0.15’s next, that’s the make-or-break zone before it spirals lower. Right now, it’s just chilling in recovery mode, but still risky unless bulls show up with real volume. Forget Dogecoin, Meet the New Leading Memecoin: Maxi Doge Maxi Doge is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme market. Dogecoin might be holding strong, but the spotlight is starting to shift toward something new and wilder. Built on Ethereum, Maxi Doge brings back that same hype and humor that made Dogecoin iconic, but this time with smarter tokenomics, bigger rewards, and a community that feels hungry for another run. The project has already raised over 3.6 million in presale, and people are talking nonstop about it. Around forty percent of the supply went straight to the public with no insider allocations, so it avoids the usual whale dump drama that kills most meme coins early. On top of that, early stakers are earning up to 84% percent APY before launch, which is fueling even more interest. Maxi Doge fits right into the moment. It is basically the next evolution of Dogecoin energy, upgraded for the new crypto crowd and built to dominate this cycle.

Members of the current administration and the general public were warned by activist Laura Loomer not to fall for the alleged incoming efforts to whitewash the founder of the defunct FTX exchange that led to the market crash and subsequent bear market of 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried. SBF is pushing for a pardon Conservative activist and commentator Laura Loomer has alleged the existence of a “highly mobilized and well funded” effort to secure a presidential pardon for the disgraced founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. In a post shared on the social media platform X on March 11, 2025, Loomer claimed that political operatives and consultants within “Trump world” were being persuaded to advocate for Bankman-Fried’s release and that the effort was financially motivated. “There is a highly mobilized and well funded effort on the right to lobby Trump world to pardon crypto scammer @SBF_FTX Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote . “His family members are actively working with a firm to get the Trump admin to have Trump pardon SBF.” Loomer described the initiative as “deeply concerning,” and stressed that it was contradictory of conservative values to show support for a figure who was one of the Democratic Party’s largest financial backers before his downfall. Prior to his incarceration, Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to Democrats and contributed millions of dollars ahead of the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, the financier, George Soros, is the largest donor to Democrats. Federal prosecutors later revealed that many of these political contributions were made using misappropriated customer funds. In 2024, Bankman-Fried was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release and $11B in forfeiture. Laura Loomer doubles down on ‘Influence Campaign’ allegations In a more recent post on X, Loomer stated that the efforts to free SBF had intensified and that media narratives that are sympathetic to him are part of an organized influence campaign. “You’re going to start seeing a lot more in the news about Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote. “There is a massive and well-funded lobby effort to get this criminal pardoned. He’s going to pretend like he was a victim of Joe Biden and the Democrats after he funded all of the Left’s campaigns. Don’t fall for it.” She further claimed that certain online influencers belonging to the conservative group had begun portraying Bankman-Fried as a “victim” following reports that he was placed in solitary confinement after giving an interview to Tucker Carlson. Loomer described this change in tone as part of a deliberate “social media influence campaign.” There are no public records or official statements that confirm any of Loomer’s claims of an organized effort. The Trump campaign and Bankman-Fried’s legal representatives have also never commented on the allegations. Despite this, her allegations are a point of conversation within conservative circles. Loomer’s posts gained some traction on X, and users have both amplified her warnings and also questioned her sources. Some conservative commentators have echoed her concerns, arguing that granting clemency to Bankman-Fried would contradict the populist and anti-corruption rhetoric that is the foundation of Donald Trump’s politics. The controversy also underscores how cryptocurrency continues to shape political dynamics across both democratic and conservative parties.

The market remains fragile following the historic volatility from Friday’s crash, which erased billions in leveraged positions and triggered widespread uncertainty. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets While the price has managed to stabilize above key moving averages for now, momentum appears to be weakening as buyers struggle to absorb continued selling pressure. Some analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, a deeper correction toward the $105,000–$107,000 region could follow, marking another shakeout before a potential recovery. Top analyst Axel Adler shared new data shedding light on the magnitude of Friday’s event. According to his analysis, spot trading volume surged to $44 billion, nearing cycle highs, while futures volume hit $128 billion. More notably, open interest declined by $14 billion, yet only $1 billion of that was from BTC long liquidations. Adler explains this was a controlled deleveraging event, not a liquidation cascade — suggesting that market participants reduced risk manually rather than being forced out. Still, volatility remains elevated as Bitcoin fights to maintain structural support. A Controlled Reset Amid Growing Fear According to Axel Adler, the recent market crash revealed an important yet underappreciated aspect of Bitcoin’s maturity. Data shows that 93% of the $14 billion decline in open interest (OI) during Friday’s sell-off wasn’t forced — meaning it wasn’t the result of automatic liquidations. Instead, traders and institutions chose to reduce leverage manually, closing positions to protect capital. Adler describes this as a “controlled deleveraging”, a stark contrast to previous cycles where similar crashes often triggered chaotic cascades of liquidations. This behavior marks a turning point in Bitcoin’s market structure. It indicates that participants — especially institutional players — are managing risk more prudently, reinforcing a more stable and mature trading environment. In past cycles, sharp liquidations often caused extreme volatility, magnifying losses across the board. This time, however, the market handled unprecedented stress with relative discipline. Still, despite this sign of structural maturity, the emotional landscape has shifted dramatically. As Bitcoin loses value and hovers near the $110,000–$112,000 support zone, fear is spreading across the market. Many short-term traders are exiting positions, while long-term holders are reassessing exposure amid rising uncertainty. Adler notes that this phase — where fear peaks and confidence wanes — often defines the next market direction. If demand returns at these levels, Bitcoin could confirm a healthy reset before the next rally. But failure to hold support may test investors’ conviction, potentially pushing BTC into a deeper corrective phase before broader accumulation resumes. Related Reading: Ethereum OI Jumps +8.2% As Traders Chase The Pump: Leverage Fueling ETH Again Bitcoin Holds Key Support, But Momentum Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading around $110,300, sitting directly on a key support zone after another round of selling pressure hit the market. The 4-hour chart shows BTC struggling to maintain upward momentum after failing to break above the $116,000–$117,500 resistance range, a level that previously acted as strong demand during earlier rallies. The rejection from this area triggered a sharp pullback, pushing BTC below both the 50 EMA (blue line) and the 200 EMA (red line) — a sign of weakening short-term structure. The price is now testing horizontal support around $110,000, which aligns with the late September consolidation range. A clean breakdown below this level could expose Bitcoin to further downside, with the next potential support around $106,000–$107,000.

For a sustainable recovery, Bitcoin must reclaim $114,000 and re-establish itself above the short-term moving averages. Until then, the market remains in a fragile equilibrium — with bulls defending key support and bears maintaining control of short-term momentum. The next few sessions will be decisive for BTC’s direction.

The retreat cut short a market recovery that saw the flagship cryptocurrency briefly cross $116,000 on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $112,030. Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Register Heavy Outflows US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs registered a combined $755 million in outflows on October 13 as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. According to data from SoSoValue, US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $326.5 million in net outflows on Monday, with Grayscale’s GBTC accounting for the bulk of redemptions. GBTC saw $145.3 million in outflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $115.6 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC with $93.2 million. However, BlackRock’s IBIT registered $60 million in inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs registered $428.5 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s ETHA led the redemptions with $310 million. No Ethereum ETFs registered any inflows. Hyperliquid Trader Doubles Down On Bitcoin (BTC) Short The Hyperliquid whale, who netted $192 million after shorting the market, has doubled down on their new short position, loading up nearly half a billion over the past two days. According to data from Hypurrscan, the whale’s short position is currently worth $496 million at 10x leverage, and a Bitcoin liquidation price of $124,270. The whale doubled their bet over the past 24 hours, initially opening the position with $163 million. The investor first appeared on the crypto community’s radar two months ago, holding a staggering $11 billion in BTC . The trader opened up $900 million in short positions on BTC and ETH last week. The whale gained even more attention after opening a short position minutes before US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to a crash in the crypto market. The identity behind the whale is yet to be confirmed. However, blockchain investigators hinted at a potential connection with Garrett Jin, former CEO of BitForex, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange. On-chain investigator Eye alleged the whale was Jin, leading to Binance CEO reposting the thread. However, ZachXBT suggested it was likely one of Jin’s friends. Jin essentially confirmed the connection when he replied to Zhao, stating, “@cz_binance, thanks for sharing my personal and private information. To clarify, I have no connection with the Trump family or@DonaldJTrumpJr — this isn’t insider trading.” Only minutes later, Jin made another post, stating, “The fund isn’t mine — it’s my clients’. We run nodes and provide in-house insights for them.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp drop during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $109,945 before reclaiming $110,000 and moving to its current level of $111,288. The flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.96% on Saturday, settling at $110,768. However, it made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced volatility and selling pressure on Monday but ultimately registered a marginal increase, settling at $115,274. BTC is down nearly 4% during the ongoing session. The decline cut short BTC’s recovery, which had seen it reclaim $115,000. Markets were rattled as the latest trade war flashpoint showed few signs of easing. Beijing hit back at Washington, stating it was prepared to “fight to the end” in a trade war. China also accused the US of discriminatory trade prices. The latest escalation could undermine an earlier framework between the US and China. China also justified its export controls on rare earth minerals, and gave little indication of caving in to US pressure. While Beijing noted that working-level talks were ongoing, it warned against imposing more tariffs. An October 14 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee revealed that the BTC on centralized exchanges has fallen to around 2.4 million BTC , the lowest level since 2015. When fewer coins are available on exchanges, selling pressure tends to ease, often leading to major price rallies, as seen in 2020 and 2021. According to Lee’s analysis, while prices may appear weak in the short term, the underlying bullish structure is intact. If long-term holders, institutional investors, and ETFs transfer their assets into cold storage, the supply could get even more restricted. BTC traded in bullish territory last week, and began the previous week with a 1.41% increase to $122,318. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday before reaching an intraday high of $125,750 on Sunday. BTC ultimately ended the weekend at $123,520, up 0.87%. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.97% and settled at $124,720, but not before reaching an intraday high of $126.296. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 3% to $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC fell 1.32% to a low of $119,713 before settling at $121,714. BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was in retaliation for China's imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with BTC down nearly 4%, trading around $111,700. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Friday’s market crash wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars from the crypto market cap, with over $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. USDe Depeg Was Due To An Oracle Issue Guy Young, the CEO of USDe creator Ethena Labs , clarified that the USDe depeg on Binance occurred due to an internal oracle issue and not because of the underlying collateral. Young claimed that USDe minting and redeeming worked perfectly during Friday’s market crash, adding that traders redeemed $2 billion in USDe from various exchanges with minimal price deviations. Young stated that USDe fell from $1 to $0.65 on Binance during Friday’s crash because the exchange was using oracle data from its own orderbook, which offered thinner liquidity. Young had stated, “The severe price discrepancy was isolated to a single venue, which referenced the oracle index on its own orderbook, not the deepest pool of liquidity, and was facing deposit and withdrawal issues during the event, which did not allow market makers to close the loop. No one would have been liquidated on any money market with oracles referencing the deepest pools of liquidity for USDe globally.” The Disruption On Binance USDe’s drop created panic within the crypto community, with traders believing the stablecoin had depegged across the market. However, data revealed that the crash was confined to Binance, with prices stable on other trading platforms. Young clarified that the event was “isolated to a single venue,” highlighting that Binance faced deposit and withdrawal issues. A Coordinated Attack? Traders had speculated whether the depegging was part of a coordinated attack to exploit the “Unified Account” feature on Binance, which allows users to post assets, including USDe, as collateral. The feature uses Binance’s own order book instead of external price oracles. Many traders have described this as a major vulnerability. Binance had stated it would address the issue by October 14 and migrate to data from external oracles. Traders believe attackers took advantage of this window and dumped up to $90 million in USDe on Binance, lowering its value to $0.65 on the platform, leading to nearly $1 billion in liquidations. The attackers then opened short positions on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Hyperliquid, minutes before President Trump’s tariff announcement, which sent markets into meltdown. Binance Paid $283M In Compensation Binance reportedly paid around $283 million in compensation to users of three assets, including USDe. Executives apologized to users after Friday’s market crash, which caused three assets in Binance Earn markets, Ethena's stablecoin USDe, Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token BNSOL, and Wrapped Beacon liquid staking token WBETH to depeg. The exchange compensated futures, margin, and loan users who held USDE, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral, and were impacted by the crash between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC.

The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $902,686 so far. Fundraising remains strong despite markets falling back into bearish territory. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For Next Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which is set to occur in just over eighteen hours, as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the project’s fledgling community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. The project also crossed the $900,000 milestone last week after several delays as the cryptocurrency market struggled with volatility and selling pressure in September. As a result, fundraising slowed down before picking up again after markets rebounded. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $902,686 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Cryptocurrency Market Back In Bearish Territory Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market fell back into the red, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens registering substantial declines. BTC failed to capitalize on momentum after reclaiming $115,000 as selling pressure returned. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency registered a dramatic decline and is currently trading around $112,750. Ethereum (ETH) has also registered a notable decline, down almost 2%, trading around $4,071. Ripple (XRP) is down 1.50%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, trading around $0.202. Solana (SOL) has bucked the bearish trend, rising 3%, but Cardano (ADA) is down 1%, trading around $0.698. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines.

According to Coinomist Magazine data , BNB Chain processed over 500 million transactions in the past 30 days, marking a 151% month-over-month increase.

Sights are still set on its $1,650 target, leaving room for a further 40% upwards move. In the short term, market sentiment may catch up to BNB as momentum indicators signal a cooling phase. The RSI has reversed from overbought territory above 70, often marking a local top. Still, the MACD histogram’s wide gap above the signal line suggests the uptrend remains strong. A retest of psychological support around $1,000 stands as a credible local bottom. Looking ahead, U.S. interest rate cuts could reignite risk appetite into 2026. With growing capital rotation into meme coins, BNB could surge another 150% to $3,000 under stronger demand conditions. BestWallet: Storing Crypto Can Net You Gains Too Tired of missing early gems?

Per a report from the Russian media outlet Ren TV , illegal mining farms are “leaving Russians without power and hitting their wallets.” Illegal crypto miners in a Russian facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) Russia: Illegal Crypto Miners Cost Taxpayers Dearly The broadcaster reported that the fear of facing high taxes on their income and paying prohibitively high electricity costs is “driving many miners into the shadows.” Ren TV explained: “The annual budget losses from underground mining amount to billions of rubles.” Despite recent efforts to legalize the Russian crypto mining sector, so-called “gray-hat mining” has “become Russia’s newest epidemic,” the broadcaster continued. Moscow has ordered all industrial miners to report their operations, earnings, and energy usage data to the Federal Tax Service. In exchange, they have been granted legal “entrepreneurship” status, which allows big investors like banks to provide financing and investment. However, while this is attractive to the country’s biggest players – the likes of BitRiver and Intelion – smaller-scale miners are less keen. The outlet explained that in their quest to save money, crypto miners now “resort to fraud, deception, or under-the-table deals with energy companies.” This means that in many cases, ordinary household and commercial consumers “are forced to pay for crypto miners’ operations.” Southern Russia, the traditional stronghold of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry, has become Russia’s “Mecca of gray-hat mining,” the outlet explained. Hardware in an illegal crypto mining facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) ‘Number of Illegal Crypto Mining Farms Rising by the Day’ Ren TV reported that experts believe that there are almost 140,000 Bitcoin and altcoin mining farms operating in Russia. They also think this number is “growing constantly.” But power chiefs say that “the lion’s share” of crypto miners have not declared their operations and “remain underground.” Experts added that buying electricity at commercial and industrial rates “eats up to 80% of crypto miners’ profits.” Their response is often to “cut costs illegally.” Police have recently reported the arrest of an employee at the Omsk Thermal Power Plant who took a 500,000 ruble ($6,270) bribe to let local crypto miners steal power from the grid.

This led to the city’s power grid losing around half a billion rubles ($6.3 million). In Dagestan, meanwhile, power officials found a massive illegal crypto mining farm hidden in coolant tanks. Only when the grid began to suffer issues did power providers finally realize what was happening. A power supply employee said the farm’s total load was 100 kilowatts/hour, adding: “The illegal crypto mining farm was using more power than an entire five-story building.” Another expert explained the appeal of illegal and quasi-legal mining, saying: “With the right approach, taking into account the energy, equipment, premises, and so on, illegal mining is the most profitable type of activity out there.” A Ren TV reporter visited a thermal power plant in Sharya, Kostroma Oblast (Central West Russia), where he showed that a boiler house manager was secretly mining BTC.

(Source: Pianist [CC BY-SA 2.5]) The farm, the reporter continued, “isn’t the only one in the region: There are plenty of companies willing to help miners.” The broadcaster interviewed Sharya residents who said they were “convinced” that miners are responsible for “frequent power outages in their homes.” Russian bailiffs say they have developed new methods to help them convert Bitcoin (BTC) seized in criminal cases into cash for the state’s treasury. #Russia #Bitcoin https://t.co/a8ZnK7uvIX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 These outages “damage household appliances,” the residents said, as these “simply can’t withstand the power surges and break.” No one has compensated them for these damages, the residents complained. In his closing comments, the reporter said: “Crypto entrepreneurs’ illegal businesses are finding it easy to find allies working in energy supply companies. They reap large profits.

While the finding drew attention, it also raised questions about how accurately the data reflected real capital movement. XRP’s Performance During the Recent Market Crash On October 10 , the global cryptocurrency market suffered one of its steepest single-day selloffs, triggered by widespread liquidations exceeding $19 billion. This event marked the largest daily liquidation in crypto history. XRP was among the hardest-hit digital assets, recording roughly $700 million in total liquidations, including about $610 million from long positions. Within hours, XRP’s value fell sharply from $2.80 to $1.58, a decline of more than 43%. The token later stabilized and closed the day at $2.37 before inching higher to around $2.55. Following the event, Rector analyzed on-chain and exchange data to assess the magnitude of XRP’s price reaction relative to capital movement, a method he referred to as measuring the “market cap multiplier effect.” Rector’s 1,200x Multiplier Observation Rector’s findings were based on CoinGlass data tracking changes in market capitalization alongside reported exchange outflows. According to his analysis, during the most volatile hour of trading on October 10, XRP recorded net outflows of approximately $55.8 million while its market capitalization dropped from $152 billion to $83 billion, a decline of about $70 billion. From these figures, Rector calculated a market cap multiplier of roughly 1,254x. He described this as the highest ratio observed since he began monitoring such data in 2024. Extending the analysis over a four-hour timeframe, he estimated total outflows of $64.9 million and a market cap decrease from $162 billion to $82 billion, producing a slightly smaller multiplier of around 1,215x. According to Rector , this level of sensitivity indicates that relatively small inflows or outflows can have an outsized impact on XRP’s valuation. He argued that XRP’s liquidity remains thin and heavily concentrated, leaving the market susceptible to large swings when significant buy or sell orders occur. Implications for Future Institutional Inflows Despite highlighting market fragility, Rector also pointed to the potential upside of such multiplier effects. He suggested that once institutional investment, such as from pending XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , enters the market, the same mechanism could amplify gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rector referenced projections from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, who estimated that XRP ETFs could attract between $5 billion and $10 billion in inflows within the first month of approval. Using conservative multipliers of 100x to 200x, Rector speculated that XRP’s market capitalization could expand by $500 billion to $1 trillion on top of its current valuation if such inflows materialise. Limitations of the Analysis While Rector’s figures generated widespread interest, they come with notable limitations. The data he relied upon reflects exchange flows, which represent the movement of XRP tokens between wallets and exchanges. This does not directly measure the flow of new capital into or out of the overall XRP market. A more precise metric for understanding real buying and selling pressure is the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net balance between executed buy and sell orders over time. CVD provides a clearer view of actual market demand and trading pressure compared to simple exchange movement data. For example, following the October 10 crash, XRP logged three consecutive days of price gains from October 11 to 13, despite mixed exchange flow readings. Exchanges recorded $6 million in outflows on October 11, $21.4 million in inflows on October 12, and $47 million in outflows on October 13, patterns that did not align with XRP’s steady recovery. This inconsistency highlights the flaw in using exchange flow data alone to infer capital inflows or outflows. However, Rector’s broader point, that minor net movements can have major effects on XRP’s market cap, remains valid. The key distinction is that actual capital movement is best captured through metrics like CVD rather than exchange netflows. Rector’s analysis sheds light on how market structure and liquidity can intensify XRP’s price movements. While his multiplier calculations illustrate potential sensitivity within the asset’s market, interpreting them as direct evidence of capital inflows or outflows is misleading. Still, his findings underline the potential impact of institutional money once regulated XRP ETFs enter the market, a factor that could significantly reshape the asset’s valuation landscape.

Scheduled for early November, the event will bring together top executives from across the payments and finance industries. Ripple Swell is our most important event of the year, and this November it returns to NYC. Swell is where leaders in crypto, payments, banking and policy come together to discuss what’s ahead for the future of finance. Request to attend → https://t.co/Iv2tfoBKkY Agenda →… pic.twitter.com/23obZnUauF — Ripple (@Ripple) September 12, 2025 Confirmed speakers include Adena Friedman , CEO of Nasdaq, along with digital asset leads from BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, and CME Group. On November 4, Ripple will present a live demo of stablecoin payments using the XRP Ledger, followed by a keynote from Brad Garlinghouse on the company’s next moves. XRP has dipped 5.4% in the past 24 hours, but with Swell around the corner, momentum could be building beneath the surface. XRP Price Prediction: Key Trend Line Support Held Well During Friday’s Flash Crash The daily chart shows XRP forming a symmetrical triangle , signaling a period of consolidation before its next big move. Last Friday’s flash crash saw the price touch a key support at $1.80 , which held firmly as buyers quickly stepped in — reinforcing its importance. If bearish momentum returns, this is the level to watch. However, the upcoming Swell conference could flip the script entirely if Ripple unveils new initiatives that boost ecosystem growth and adoption. A breakout above the $3 mark would confirm a move out of the triangle, setting the stage for a potential run toward $6 in the months ahead. As long as XRP holds above trend line support, the setup favors a bullish XRP price prediction . And while XRP gears up for a potential breakout, early-stage presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are catching investor attention.

The package is aimed at restoring user confidence and industry stability following a crash that saw some tokens depeg and billions wiped from the crypto derivatives market. The world’s largest crypto exchange said on Tuesday that the initiative, dubbed the “Together Initiative,” would provide both user compensation and institutional support as it works to rebuild trust after the disruption. The announcement comes days after Binance experienced a high-profile glitch that caused Ethena Labs’ USDe and two tokens, BNSOL and WBETH, to briefly lose their pegs, triggering forced liquidations and drawing widespread criticism. Binance had earlier pledged to compensate affected users. Binance promises compensation for affected users In its statement , Binance said that it will distribute up to $300 million in USDC stablecoin to individual traders who experienced forced liquidations between October 10 and 11, during the most volatile hours of the crash. Eligible users are those whose liquidation losses exceeded $50 and represented at least 30% of their net asset value at the time. Payouts, which the company said will begin within 24 hours and conclude within 96 hours, will be sent directly to spot accounts. In addition, Binance will establish a $100 million “Institutional Support Program” to offer low-interest loans to ecosystem partners and institutional clients hit hardest by the crash. The fund, designed to alleviate liquidity pressures and help firms resume trading operations, will be accessible to eligible VIP clients through their account managers. A glitch caused the weekend’s price distortions The new initiative follows Binance’s earlier October 11 announcement that it would fully compensate users affected by the depeg event, which occurred between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. During that window, a glitch caused price distortions for USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH. Binance said it has since completed a review and promised to reimburse all impacted users who experienced forced liquidations across Futures and Margin trading from 00:00 of October 10 to 23:59 UTC of October 11. The company also introduced several technical safeguards to prevent a repeat, including adding redemption prices into the price index weights of affected tokens, incorporating minimum price thresholds for USDe to improve stability, and conducting more frequent reviews of its risk parameters. Industry observers view Binance’s $400 million relief fund as a symbolic show of solidarity amid intensifying pressure and competition from other platforms. Binance’s handling of this episode positions it as an empathetic brand that takes responsibility for the challenges users faced when using the platform. The company said the relief package should not be confused as it taking liability for users’ losses. “We expect scrutiny, fair or unfair,” Binance said, adding that its users “are always our first priority.” According to the leading exchange, “It is critical to rebuild industry confidence” after a period of volatility and scrutiny. “This stems from our belief in the long-term development of the industry and our commitment to Binance’s User Focus values,” the company said in the statement.

All three coins have registered significant losses in the past 24 hours, yet their fundamental positions remain as positive as ever, with the arrival of altcoin ETFs later this year likely to ignite big rallies. Now may also be a great time to buy newer coins, with one presale token in particular showing strong potential for growth once it launches. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth to Help Alt Bounce from Massively Oversold Position The past few weeks have been very unkind to XRP, which has dropped from $3.09 at the start of October to $2.47 today. It’s down by 6% in 24 hours, 17% in a week and by 20% in a month, although it retains a very decent 360% increase in a year. There’s no denying that XRP has taken a battering recently, but this arguably sets it up for an even bigger surge in the not-too distant future. It’s currently waiting on more ETF launches than any other altcoin, with the launch of such funds ( possibly very soon ) set to boost its price massively. Source: TradingView Its chart today shows that it’s very close to hitting rock bottom, from which it can only bounce. Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are in heavily oversold positions, while its price is trading within a bullish pennant. This provides the foundation for a big rally in the coming weeks, while Ripple’s ongoing growth as a business puts XRP in a prime position to grow over the longer term. It could return to $3 in early November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – L1 Dominance Means ETH Will Lead Any Market-Wide Bull Rally ETH has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $3,999 marking a 14% decline in a week and a month. Ethereum does remain up by 58% in a year, which isn’t as impressive as XRP’s annual gain, but it does potentially mean that ETH will rally harder and compensate once an end-of-year rally gets into gear. The coin also boasts arguably the best fundamentals in crypto (save for BTC and maybe a handful of alts), meaning that it’s a prime position to ride any market-wide rally. And if we look at its chart, it too is in an oversold position from which it should recover very soon. Source: TradingView At the same time, the past few days have seen whales accumulating ETH , likely in the expectation of future gains. Given that Ethereum is still the biggest layer-one network by a wide margin , we can expect it to be one of the chief beneficiaries of any general growth in the crypto industry, including the growth of tokenisation and real-world assets (for example). We could therefore see the ETH price reach $4,500 by the end of the month, while it could enter 2026 at around $7,000. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Binance Dominance and CZ Pardon Could Send Alt to New All-Time Highs BNB is a similar coin to ETH, in the sense that its status as Binance’s utility token means it will lead any end-of-year bull rally. Binance is the biggest crypto-exchange in the world , and is likely to remain the biggest for the foreseeable future. As such, its utility token, BNB, will grow in parallel with the growth of the wider market. Its price currently stands at $1,200, which may represent an 11% loss in 24 hours, but which is also a 28% increase in a month. BNB has been growing steadily over the past few weeks, and its chart today suggests that it could be in for another spike soon. Source: TradingView Its recent momentum has been so strong that its RSI (yellow) has rebounded to 70 and above after falling only as low as 60 or 50. And given that it’s close to touching 50 today, we could see it and BNB’s price rallying again in the very near future. Boosting its fundamental position is also the fact that the Trump administration may soon grant a pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , who pleased guilty to anti-money laundering failures in November 2023. This would boost Binance’s business position, while by extension it would boost BNB. The altcoin is therefore on track to climb over $2,000 by the end of November, and will end the year even higher. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Attracts $1.8 Million in Popular Presale Traders preparing for an end-of-year rally may also want to consider diversifying into newer tokens, since the best new tokens can outperform the market. Some of the most promising new tokens on the market right now are currently holding their presales, which can often be a launchpad for rallies once they list. Possibly the most intriguing presale coins at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ICO. All in a days work.

At the same time, Dogecoin ETFs from issuers such as 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale are on the SEC’s docket, with early DOGE products already drawing over $30 million despite higher fees. A green light for lower-cost funds could funnel new, regulated demand into DOGE, historically a catalyst for liquidity and price discovery across crypto. Key levels: $0.20 support, $0.23–$0.25 and $0.29–$0.30 Resistance Dogecoin Price action remains balanced on a knife-edge. Traders flag $0.200 as critical support; losing it risks a slide toward $0.178. On the upside, initial resistance sits at $0.214 and $0.229, with a broader supply zone at $0.241–$0.254. A daily close above $0.25 opens a run at $0.29–$0.30, the area many watch for a breakout confirmation. Technically, DOGE recently printed hammer/morning star patterns off the lows, while momentum has cooled to neutral, often a staging zone before the next directional move. For swing traders, $0.18 (support) and $0.25 (resistance) are the immediate invalidation/continuation lines. Whales accumulate as Weekly Triangle Coils On-chain, whales soaked up roughly $42 million in DOGE during the dip, signaling confidence as price continues to coil inside a multi-month triangle on the weekly chart. Historically, DOGE’s long compressions have preceded outsized expansions.

53153416,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86385,1760486444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: The Storm Is Not Over Yet,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-storm-is-not-over-yet/,"Arthur, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has expressed concern about XRP’s recent market behavior, warning that the asset may not yet be out of danger following the latest market downturn. His remarks come after the severe selloff that occurred on October 10, which triggered widespread liquidations across major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. During the crash, XRP declined sharply by more than 43%, reaching a low of $1.58, its weakest level so far this year. Although the token has since rebounded above $2.50 , it remains down more than 13% over the past week, signaling ongoing market instability. XRP’s Technical Structure Raises Concern In his recent technical assessment, Arthur described XRP’s latest price movement as dangerous, emphasizing that the market may still be under significant selling pressure. The analyst noted that despite the impressive rebound from the post-crash bottom, indicators on the 4-hour chart suggest that the upward momentum is weakening. Dangerous move from $XRP , the storm might not be over yet… After a 200%+ bounce from the crash lows, structure is showing signs of exhaustion.

Join us on Telegram and stay ahead of the next move. … pic.twitter.com/dah7D1g4yJ — Arthur (@XrpArthur) October 14, 2025 For several weeks, XRP’s price had been moving within a symmetrical triangle pattern, with the $2.60 level serving as a key psychological threshold. However, the October 10 selloff forced the token below the triangle’s lower boundary and two additional support zones at $2.50 and $2.20. Although XRP managed to recover the $2.20 level almost immediately, it struggled to regain and sustain the $2.50 mark. When XRP attempted to reenter the symmetrical triangle, it encountered strong resistance along the lower trendline, which halted further progress. The token is currently trading around the $2.50 mark , though it has not yet broken convincingly above it. This shows some stabilization at the support band, but regaining the triangle cleanly would provide clearer confirmation that the prior breakdown has been reversed. Market Factors and Near-Term Outlook Arthur’s analysis also links the renewed volatility to broader geopolitical developments. Recent tensions following China’s response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats have contributed to renewed uncertainty in global markets, extending bearish sentiment across digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He stressed that XRP needs to recover and hold above $2.50 before attempting to reestablish its previous trading structure. A move back into the symmetrical triangle could indicate a reversal of the current downward momentum, while continued rejection below resistance may confirm a prolonged consolidation phase near recent lows. Mixed Opinions Among Analysts Despite Arthur’s caution, other analysts have presented more optimistic interpretations. Market researcher Xaif pointed out that XRP’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) fell to a six-month low during the crash, historically signaling potential recovery periods. According to him, the last instance of a similar drop preceded a 35% price rebound, suggesting that a comparable correction could occur in the near term. Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt has reiterated a constructive long-term outlook for XRP. He described the asset’s broader chart formation as structurally sound, implying that while short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term trend could still favor gradual appreciation. Overall, analysts remain divided on XRP’s immediate prospects. While Arthur maintains that the asset’s recent breakdown and failure to reenter its trading structure are signs of market fragility, others believe the selloff may be nearing exhaustion. In the coming days, XRP’s ability to trade above the $2.50 level will likely determine whether the market stabilizes or faces renewed pressure.

53155227,605626,1760486458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155227.jpeg,Extreme Fear Grips Altcoins As 90% Of Tokens Trade Below 200DMA: Perfect Time To Accumulate?,https://bitcoinist.com/extreme-fear-grips-altcoins-90-trade-below-200dma/,"Altcoins continue to face heavy pressure across the board after the historic crash that shook the crypto market on Friday. The sudden sell-off triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions within minutes. Even established blue chips such as Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX) saw their prices plunge more than 60% before partially recovering over the weekend. While prices have since stabilized at slightly higher levels, investor confidence remains fragile. The market is still reeling from the shock, and traders are cautious as volatility persists. According to top analyst Darkfost, the current market structure reflects deep disinterest and capitulation. He shared data showing that only 10% of altcoins listed on Binance are trading above their 200-day moving average — meaning that 90% of the altcoin market is below its long-term trend. This extreme reading highlights the magnitude of the sell-off and the lack of strong recovery momentum so far. Historically, such setups often precede accumulation phases, as smart money begins to position for the next cycle . However, with sentiment still fragile, the coming days will determine whether this is a true bottoming zone or simply a pause before another leg down. Market Exhaustion Could Signal the Next Rebound Darkfost explains that the current state of the altcoin market has historically marked moments of capitulation and opportunity. Throughout this cycle, similar configurations have occurred three times, each followed by a notable short-term rebound across major altcoins. These periods of extreme selling exhaustion often represent points where downside momentum fades, and patient investors begin accumulating high-quality assets at deep discounts. Darkfost emphasizes that these setups rarely last long. Once market sentiment stabilizes and traders recognize the excessive fear priced into altcoins, capital tends to flow back quickly, driving strong relief rallies. However, he warns that this is not a time for indiscriminate buying. The key, he says, lies in focusing on projects that have maintained liquidity, developer activity, and on-chain usage even amid the broader downturn. These factors often separate long-term survivors from speculative tokens that will struggle to recover. For investors who missed previous market cycles, this type of configuration could present one of the most favorable risk-reward setups in months. Yet timing remains crucial. As Darkfost notes, once the market realizes it has overcorrected, re-entry opportunities disappear quickly, often replaced by aggressive upward moves that reward those who acted decisively during peak fear. Altcoins Face Critical Support Test The total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 assets — a key indicator of broader altcoin performance — is currently hovering around $263 billion, reflecting a 2.3% decline over the week. This chart paints a clear picture of stress across the altcoin sector following last week’s market-wide crash, with prices retracing sharply from the $285 billion area after being rejected near multi-month resistance. Technically, the market cap remains above the 200-week moving average (red line), which has acted as a reliable support level throughout previous cycles. However, the recent volatility and long downside wick highlight strong selling pressure, suggesting that many investors have been forced to de-risk amid uncertainty. The 50-week MA (blue) and 100-week MA (green) are currently flattening, signaling the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase before any sustainable recovery begins. Historically, this structure — a deep correction into major moving averages — often precedes accumulation phases that mark macro bottoms. As long as the $250 billion level holds, the broader altcoin market could stabilize and gradually rebuild momentum. A weekly close below this support, however, would likely trigger another wave of liquidations, potentially retesting the $200 billion region — a level associated with previous cycle lows.

At the same time, Japan’s Metaplanet faces a sharp valuation drop despite holding over $3.5 billion in BTC. Yet, technical charts show BTC stabilizing near $111,000, with a triple-bottom pattern hinting at a possible breakout toward $130,000 as institutional demand strengthens. Elon Musk Calls Bitcoin “Energy-Based and Inflation-Proof” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, described Bitcoin as “energy-based” and “inflation-proof,” contrasting it with “fake fiat” currencies. He noted that BTC’s proof-of-work model prevents the creation of “fake energy,” unlike fiat money that governments can print at will. Musk made the remarks in response to analyst ZeroHedge, who linked rising Bitcoin and gold prices to government spending on artificial intelligence. This marks Musk’s most direct statement on Bitcoin in nearly three years, following his 2022 prediction of a prolonged bear market after the FTX collapse. His renewed endorsement underscores Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and its increasing relevance in an AI-driven economy, despite ongoing concerns about mining energy use.

IMF Warns of Global Market Risks The International Monetary Fund warned that global markets are becoming complacent about risks such as trade tensions, high debt levels, and inflated asset prices. It cautioned that a sudden loss of confidence could trigger a “disorderly” market downturn. The IMF just issued a stark warning: risk asset prices are ""well above fundamentals,"" raising the odds of a ""disorderly"" market correction. The International Monetary Fund's semiannual Global Financial Stability Report, released Tuesday morning, warns that investors have grown… pic.twitter.com/6BUOSaAWwQ — Aiime (@Aiime_ai) October 14, 2025 The warning followed renewed tariff threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump, which briefly pressured both Bitcoin and equity markets. The IMF urged governments to tighten oversight of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and reduce fiscal deficits. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s quick recovery suggests traders remain confident in its long-term resilience. Metaplanet’s Value Falls Below Its BTC Holdings Metaplanet, Japan’s leading Bitcoin treasury firm, has seen its enterprise value drop below the worth of its Bitcoin assets for the first time. The company’s market-to-Bitcoin net asset value (mNAV) fell to 0.99, indicating that the market now values Metaplanet at less than its 30,823 BTC holdings, currently worth about $3.5 billion. The decline comes after the company paused Bitcoin purchases for two weeks, despite its reputation as one of Asia’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin accumulators. Metaplanet’s stock has fallen 75% since June, reflecting investor caution and broader uncertainty around Bitcoin treasury strategies. Metaplanet’s market-to-Bitcoin NAV just dropped below 1 for the first time ever, meaning the company’s market value is now less than the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet is trading at a discount to its Bitcoin, a rare event for one of the largest public BTC holders. pic.twitter.com/yW8EKavdXX — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) October 14, 2025 Analysts, however, compare the reaction to early skepticism toward Tesla, arguing the selloff reflects market mispricing rather than weakness in Metaplanet’s model. They note that the company’s large Bitcoin reserve and long-term accumulation plan continue to support confidence in its balance sheet strength. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traded steadily around $113,000, as analysts said Metaplanet’s holdings reaffirm institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Setup Targets $130,000 Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup indicates selling pressure is easing while buyers gradually regain control. On the two-hour chart, the 100-period SMMA at $116,676 overlaps the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $116,108, forming a key resistance area that could restrict gains before a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels to 47, showing early bullish divergence and slowing downside momentum. A bullish engulfing candle above $114,500 would confirm the pattern and reinforce short-term buying strength. Bitcoin remains inside a descending channel, but the TradingView path projection suggests a breakout toward $119,800, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci level. A close above $120,000 would signal a shift from consolidation to recovery, targeting $125,000 and $130,000 next. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600 with stops below $109,500, eyeing $119,800 as the initial target. A move above the 100-SMA would confirm trend reversal potential. With volatility easing and institutional accumulation picking up, Bitcoin’s current base may serve as the foundation for a sustained Q4 rally. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53155229,605804,1760490010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155229.jpeg,Greatest Bitcoin Threat? Charles Edwards Predicts Quantum Break In 2–8 Years,https://bitcoinist.com/charles-edwards-bitcoin-quantum-break-2-8-years/,"At TOKEN2049 Singapore, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards set aside his well-known Bitcoin bullishness to deliver an unambiguous warning: a quantum “Q-Day” could arrive far sooner than most of the industry expects, with potentially existential consequences if Bitcoin’s core cryptography is not upgraded in time. “Within two to eight years, a quantum machine will break Bitcoin’s current encryption,” he told the audience, urging developers, companies and holders to treat the issue as urgent engineering, not distant theory. Edwards framed Q-Day as the moment a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can break widely-used classical cryptography such as RSA—and, by extension, the elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) underpinning Bitcoin’s public-private key model. “Q-day is the day in which a quantum machine will break classic encryption,” he said, adding that once that threshold is crossed, anything protected by those primitives—from financial networks to “sensitive data” and “of course Bitcoin”—is at risk. He asserted that Bitcoin’s ECC would likely fall sooner than RSA when the industry approaches that breakpoint. Quantum Computing Could Break Bitcoin Within 8 Years Pushing back on the common refrain that practical quantum attacks are decades away, Edwards argued the timeline has materially compressed, citing both rapid technical progress and a collective incentive among states and large firms to accelerate. “Even quantum years away. If you ask ChatGPT or Grok, it’ll tell you 10, 20, 30 years away. It’s rubbish,” he said. He pointed to quantum computer access already available via major cloud providers—AWS, Google and Azure—and its use cases in “drug discovery, defense, [and] optimizing bond yields,” presenting these as markers of real-world traction rather than laboratory demos. Edwards anchored his 2–8 year forecast to a convergence of views he described as independent and sober. He referenced security specialist Jameson Lopp as assigning “50% risk in four to nine years,” a “math PhD doctor specializing in quantum” at “2 to six years for Bitcoin,” and McKinsey’s estimate for RSA-level Q-Day in “2 to 10 years,” reiterating his belief that “Bitcoin breaks years earlier than that.” He also drew attention to a 2017 “Bitcoin quantum paper” that, in his reading, suggests “you only need 2,300 qubits—logical qubits—to break Bitcoin’s ECC,” noting its authorship by researchers affiliated with Microsoft, IonQ and Meta. While those numbers and affiliations were presented as evidence, his central message was less about any single study and more about the overall direction of travel: a multilateral “quantum arms race” that he said has already attracted “$55 billion” in commitments, with China “spending double the US.” In Edwards’ telling, technological trendlines are compounding that investment wave. He described qubit growth as “basically a straight line in a log chart,” claiming it is “progressing faster than Moore’s law,” and likened today’s skepticism to the disbelief many held about AI adoption in 2021—right before chatbots went mainstream. “Imagine 2021 and thinking about AI… You thought it was years away. So ChatGPT happened. I think we’re in a similar moment with quantum. It’s ignored today, but it’s coming.” He also highlighted a perceived shift in sentiment from Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, saying that after downplaying quantum timelines early in the year, Huang later called quantum at “an inflection point” and has been “spending billions buying quantum companies.” For Edwards, the takeaway is simple: “As always, follow the money.” The operational risks Edwards outlined for Bitcoin were concrete and immediate. If adversaries can derive private keys from public keys exposed on-chain, coins sitting at addresses that have previously revealed public keys become vulnerable to theft. That set includes long-dormant “lost” coins and, potentially, some portion of Satoshi-era holdings. “Satoshi’s coins will probably be market dumped,” he said starkly, not because their owner would necessarily act, but because the associated keys could be computed and the UTXOs swept once Q-Day arrives. He contrasted dormant addresses with actively maintained wallets, arguing that modern key management and timely migration would reduce exposure: “We want to keep active wallets… it’s good to maintain security upgrades and relevancy of the tech through time.” He referenced Michael Saylor ’s recent remark about doing “something ethically proper and burn[ing] his coins,” using it to underscore an inversion in perceived safety: “Actually burnt—the lost coins—the highest risk because no one has maintained that infrastructure.” Beyond the cryptographic break itself, Edwards emphasized the logistical constraints of any industry-wide upgrade. Bitcoin can only process so many transactions per day, meaning a migration to quantum-safe addresses cannot be done overnight. “We have long lead times to upgrade Bitcoin,” he said. “For Bitcoin itself it takes at least a month if you ignore all other transactions on the network to simply move everyone across to new wallets… so we’re looking at at least basically 6 to 12 months to fix this.” On that basis, he argued work on a concrete migration path cannot wait: “We need to be solving this really next year—2026—in order to get a solution before 2027.” Edwards pointed to ongoing technical efforts as a starting point rather than a finished plan. “There’s solutions to protect crypto… There’s a few BIPs for example like this one… by Jameson Lopp . So there are solutions. We can solve this but there is an urgency to it.” Quantum will break Bitcoin and Satoshi’s coins will market dump. We must act in 2026. Watch this video to understand why. https://t.co/46Cqlv5RSH — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) October 13, 2025 He called on developers to evaluate proposals for quantum-resistant schemes and on the broader community to “get talking to [the] community, your social media, get involved in the Bitcoin improvement proposals. Review them, give feedback, just get talking.” The subtext was that governance friction—social consensus, client implementation, wallet support, exchange coordination—becomes the gating factor once a candidate scheme is chosen, and that delay is itself a security risk if adversaries are on a clock of their own.

While the multi-billion-dollar liquidation event sent prices plunging across the board, Solana demonstrated remarkable resilience, whereas the Ethereum network and liquidity thinned during the peak volatility. Why Solana High-Performance Design Continues To Shine In an X post, the Nasdaq-listed go-to Solana Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), DefDevCorp, has revealed that when the largest liquidation event in crypto history hit last Friday, most of the market froze, and Ethereum stumbled. However, Solana didn’t flinch, powering through one of the most chaotic trading sessions ever recorded. Related Reading: Solana Shines Bright: Network Excels Amid Largest Crypto Liquidation Event At the peak of volatility, Solana sustained 1,225 transactions per second, finalized blocks in just 350 milliseconds, and saw transaction fees briefly rise to $0.25 before normalizing below $0.01. Meanwhile, ETH’s infrastructure buckled under demand as the network struggled to process beyond 26 TPS. Its block times extended to 15 seconds, and saw average gas fees explode to $616, effectively locking out users and rendering the chain unusable during the crisis. ETH became unreliable, impractical, and effectively unusable during the chaos. As DefiDevCorp noted, when users are priced out and transactions can’t clear, the network might as well be offline. In moments of high load, the core promise of a blockchain to remain accessible, affordable, and reliable must hold. However, after nearly 20 months of uninterrupted uptime, weathering its busiest moments, it’s abundantly clear that SOL’s continued upgrades and optimizations have paid off dramatically. DefiDevCorp concluded that no other chain currently comes close to handling global value transfer at this scale, under such extreme conditions, with the same level of performance. The takeaway from the firm’s post is that only SOL stays fast, cheap, and usable, even when global markets melt down. Why SOL Price Doesn’t Match Its Reliability A Researcher at alphapleaseHQ and Advisor at KaminoFinance, Aylo, has also mentioned that he had assets and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) positions open on both Solana and Ethereum when the crypto market collapsed last Friday. During this time, he had zero issues using the SOL network, while the ETH network was unusable due to the costs, which often led to market crashes, and the Rabby wallet also went down. Related Reading: No Chain Comes Close: Solana Leads With 2.5x Ethereum’s Revenue Aylo added that the ETH maxis should be much angrier about the performance of their L1. With this development, SOL continues to prove it’s the most performant and reliable blockchain under real-world pressure that we have in crypto. He pointed out that SOL’s valuation doesn’t reflect the resilience it is proving in the digital world.
