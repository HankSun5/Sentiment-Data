The bank reported $22.09 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $21.09 billion, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.24, above the forecast of $1.90. Citi’s net income jumped 15% year-on-year to $3.8 billion, driven by robust performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. The services business delivered its best quarter ever, with revenue up 7% from the same period a year ago. The banking division recorded a 34% surge, while the markets unit posted its strongest third quarter, climbing 15%. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said, “Investments in new products, crypto, and AI are driving innovation and improved capabilities across the franchise. The relentless execution of our strategy is delivering stronger business performance quarter after quarter and improving our returns.” Citi pushes ahead with Banamex stake sale and faces higher costs Amid the upbeat earnings , Citi confirmed that it is selling a 25% equity stake in its Mexican arm, Banamex, ahead of a public stock offering. The planned sale, part of its broader restructuring strategy, lifted overall expenses by 9% last quarter due to transaction-related costs. Including the Banamex goodwill impairment charge, the bank’s profit jumped 23% to $1.86 billion from a year earlier. Despite the added costs, Citi’s stock has surged more than 40% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500, which has faced renewed market turbulence tied to trade disputes. The strong quarterly results underscore the bank’s continued progress in optimizing its structure while maintaining steady earnings growth. Wall Street ends mixed as trade tensions resurface Markets saw wild swings on Tuesday as investors reacted to both the solid banking results and another flare-up between Washington and Beijing. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower at 6,644.31, after falling as much as 1.5% and rising 0.4% during the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 202.88 points, or 0.4%, to close at 46,270.46, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8% to 22,521.70. Tech stocks stayed under pressure, with Nvidia dragging the Nasdaq lower after recent losses. Caterpillar led the gains on the Dow. The start of Wall Street’s Q3 earnings season helped offset some of the volatility as Citi climbed 3.9%, Wells Fargo jumped 7.2%, and both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs topped estimates but slipped slightly by the end of the day. The market turbulence came after President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of China, accusing Beijing of failing to purchase U.S. soybeans as promised. His comments pulled the S&P 500 into the red late in the day, following an earlier rally sparked by optimism over strong corporate earnings. Late last week, Trump had threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a move that sent the Dow plunging over 800 points on Friday, its largest drop since April 10 when Trump announced ‘Liberation Day.’ By Sunday, however, Trump took a softer tone on Truth Social, writing, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine.” Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) (Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge) hit a four-month high above 22 during the day before closing at 20.81, reflecting investor caution over potential future shocks.

Beverage company Safety Shot, Inc. has officially rebranded to Bonk, Inc., marking the first time a memecoin-linked brand has found a home on a major U.S. exchange. The firm began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ BNKK ” on Friday, October 10, 2025. Today, the BONK ecosystem officially has a home in the public markets!

Nom), a BONK core contributor and board member, emphasized that this move officially gives the BONK ecosystem a home in the public markets. BONK Down 17.98% but Holds $1.3B Market Cap The BONK token is currently trading at $0.00001629, down 17.98% over the past seven days following a market-wide liquidation flush. Despite the pullback, BONK maintains a market cap above $1.3 billion , ranking among the top 65 cryptocurrencies globally. Analysts suggest BONK’s recent weakness may be temporary, with the token showing signs of stabilization. Technical charts indicate that clearing resistance around $0.0000165 to $0.0000186 could trigger a move toward 2024 highs near $0.00005916, over 100% upside from current levels. BONK price prediction: Rounded Bottom Pattern Indicates Potential Trend Reversal After a volatile sell-off earlier this month, BONK appears to be staging a sharp recovery. The 2-day chart shows BONK bounced aggressively from the 0.00001134 USDT support zone, forming a rounded bottom pattern, a classic reversal indicator. BONK is now trading near 0.0000166 USDT, testing descending trendline resistance from its August highs. Source: TradingView A breakout above this line would signal trend reversal, supported by rising On-Balance Volume (OBV), suggesting strong accumulation at lower levels. The next key zone lies between 0.00001764 and 0.00001870 USDT. A sustained close above this level could trigger a rally toward 0.00002607 USDT and potentially 0.00003000 USDT.

Right now, it is holding the $0.20 zone, and most analysts’ price predictions for Dogecoin remain bullish for a rebound, even though a short-term correction seems likely. At the same time, Wall Street’s interest in crypto has been strong lately. Despite the chaos, House of Doge , the business arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, went public to push DOGE further into mainstream finance and traditional commerce. Dogecoin Hits Nasdaq Through House of Doge—Here’s Why It Matters House of Doge is about to hit Nasdaq after a reverse takeover by Brag House Holdings (ticker: TBH), a college-focused gaming and streaming company. TBH had already jumped more than 40% in the last two weeks before today’s announcement. The move could be a big win. With access to more capital, House of Doge can speed up its plan to build global payment rails for Dogecoin and expand much faster. The company is also backed by Elon Musk’s personal attorney and sees going public as another step toward making Dogecoin a universal payment method. Brag House is making history! We’ve signed a definitive merger agreement with House of Doge — the commercial arm of the Dogecoin Foundation — For the House of Doge to list on NASDAQ and bring payments, tokenization, gaming, and yield to crypto's most loyal community. pic.twitter.com/nLzcX6vkRW — Brag House (@BragHouse) October 13, 2025 Brag House targets Gen Z gamers, college esports, and interactive streaming, which already line up perfectly with crypto culture. Adding Dogecoin into tournaments, rewards, and creator payouts could make it a natural, everyday currency for gamers. It also unlocks real utility through payments and microtransactions. DOGE could become a go-to coin for buying digital goods, tipping creators, and paying for entry fees in competitions. And the Nasdaq listing gives Dogecoin a new level of visibility. Since Brag House is already a listed company, this merger gives DOGE a publicly traded link to Wall Street and opens the door for institutional investors who want DOGE exposure without holding crypto directly. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is $1 DOGE Finally Possible? Source: DOGEUSD / Tradingview Here’s the deal with this DOGE chart . The price broke down cleanly from that rising wedge, which had been flashing weakness for weeks. But with House of Doge going public and ETF hype heating up, this could be setting up for something pretty interesting. The dump below $0.20 confirmed the bearish break, and you can see how it wicked straight into that $0.18 zone before bouncing. The RSI sitting around 38 shows it’s still leaning bearish but still not oversold yet, so there’s room either way. If DOGE can reclaim $0.22 and hold, it might crawl back toward $0.30, maybe even $0.50 later if market momentum changes. But if it loses $0.18 again, $0.15’s next, that’s the make-or-break zone before it spirals lower. Right now, it’s just chilling in recovery mode, but still risky unless bulls show up with real volume. Forget Dogecoin, Meet the New Leading Memecoin: Maxi Doge Maxi Doge is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme market. Dogecoin might be holding strong, but the spotlight is starting to shift toward something new and wilder. Built on Ethereum, Maxi Doge brings back that same hype and humor that made Dogecoin iconic, but this time with smarter tokenomics, bigger rewards, and a community that feels hungry for another run. The project has already raised over 3.6 million in presale, and people are talking nonstop about it. Around forty percent of the supply went straight to the public with no insider allocations, so it avoids the usual whale dump drama that kills most meme coins early. On top of that, early stakers are earning up to 84% percent APY before launch, which is fueling even more interest. Maxi Doge fits right into the moment. It is basically the next evolution of Dogecoin energy, upgraded for the new crypto crowd and built to dominate this cycle.

Members of the current administration and the general public were warned by activist Laura Loomer not to fall for the alleged incoming efforts to whitewash the founder of the defunct FTX exchange that led to the market crash and subsequent bear market of 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried. SBF is pushing for a pardon Conservative activist and commentator Laura Loomer has alleged the existence of a “highly mobilized and well funded” effort to secure a presidential pardon for the disgraced founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. In a post shared on the social media platform X on March 11, 2025, Loomer claimed that political operatives and consultants within “Trump world” were being persuaded to advocate for Bankman-Fried’s release and that the effort was financially motivated. “There is a highly mobilized and well funded effort on the right to lobby Trump world to pardon crypto scammer @SBF_FTX Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote . “His family members are actively working with a firm to get the Trump admin to have Trump pardon SBF.” Loomer described the initiative as “deeply concerning,” and stressed that it was contradictory of conservative values to show support for a figure who was one of the Democratic Party’s largest financial backers before his downfall. Prior to his incarceration, Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to Democrats and contributed millions of dollars ahead of the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, the financier, George Soros, is the largest donor to Democrats. Federal prosecutors later revealed that many of these political contributions were made using misappropriated customer funds. In 2024, Bankman-Fried was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release and $11B in forfeiture. Laura Loomer doubles down on ‘Influence Campaign’ allegations In a more recent post on X, Loomer stated that the efforts to free SBF had intensified and that media narratives that are sympathetic to him are part of an organized influence campaign. “You’re going to start seeing a lot more in the news about Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote. “There is a massive and well-funded lobby effort to get this criminal pardoned. He’s going to pretend like he was a victim of Joe Biden and the Democrats after he funded all of the Left’s campaigns. Don’t fall for it.” She further claimed that certain online influencers belonging to the conservative group had begun portraying Bankman-Fried as a “victim” following reports that he was placed in solitary confinement after giving an interview to Tucker Carlson. Loomer described this change in tone as part of a deliberate “social media influence campaign.” There are no public records or official statements that confirm any of Loomer’s claims of an organized effort. The Trump campaign and Bankman-Fried’s legal representatives have also never commented on the allegations. Despite this, her allegations are a point of conversation within conservative circles. Loomer’s posts gained some traction on X, and users have both amplified her warnings and also questioned her sources. Some conservative commentators have echoed her concerns, arguing that granting clemency to Bankman-Fried would contradict the populist and anti-corruption rhetoric that is the foundation of Donald Trump’s politics. The controversy also underscores how cryptocurrency continues to shape political dynamics across both democratic and conservative parties.

The market remains fragile following the historic volatility from Friday’s crash, which erased billions in leveraged positions and triggered widespread uncertainty. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets While the price has managed to stabilize above key moving averages for now, momentum appears to be weakening as buyers struggle to absorb continued selling pressure. Some analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, a deeper correction toward the $105,000–$107,000 region could follow, marking another shakeout before a potential recovery. Top analyst Axel Adler shared new data shedding light on the magnitude of Friday’s event. According to his analysis, spot trading volume surged to $44 billion, nearing cycle highs, while futures volume hit $128 billion. More notably, open interest declined by $14 billion, yet only $1 billion of that was from BTC long liquidations. Adler explains this was a controlled deleveraging event, not a liquidation cascade — suggesting that market participants reduced risk manually rather than being forced out. Still, volatility remains elevated as Bitcoin fights to maintain structural support. A Controlled Reset Amid Growing Fear According to Axel Adler, the recent market crash revealed an important yet underappreciated aspect of Bitcoin’s maturity. Data shows that 93% of the $14 billion decline in open interest (OI) during Friday’s sell-off wasn’t forced — meaning it wasn’t the result of automatic liquidations. Instead, traders and institutions chose to reduce leverage manually, closing positions to protect capital. Adler describes this as a “controlled deleveraging”, a stark contrast to previous cycles where similar crashes often triggered chaotic cascades of liquidations. This behavior marks a turning point in Bitcoin’s market structure. It indicates that participants — especially institutional players — are managing risk more prudently, reinforcing a more stable and mature trading environment. In past cycles, sharp liquidations often caused extreme volatility, magnifying losses across the board. This time, however, the market handled unprecedented stress with relative discipline. Still, despite this sign of structural maturity, the emotional landscape has shifted dramatically. As Bitcoin loses value and hovers near the $110,000–$112,000 support zone, fear is spreading across the market. Many short-term traders are exiting positions, while long-term holders are reassessing exposure amid rising uncertainty. Adler notes that this phase — where fear peaks and confidence wanes — often defines the next market direction. If demand returns at these levels, Bitcoin could confirm a healthy reset before the next rally. But failure to hold support may test investors’ conviction, potentially pushing BTC into a deeper corrective phase before broader accumulation resumes. Related Reading: Ethereum OI Jumps +8.2% As Traders Chase The Pump: Leverage Fueling ETH Again Bitcoin Holds Key Support, But Momentum Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading around $110,300, sitting directly on a key support zone after another round of selling pressure hit the market. The 4-hour chart shows BTC struggling to maintain upward momentum after failing to break above the $116,000–$117,500 resistance range, a level that previously acted as strong demand during earlier rallies. The rejection from this area triggered a sharp pullback, pushing BTC below both the 50 EMA (blue line) and the 200 EMA (red line) — a sign of weakening short-term structure. The price is now testing horizontal support around $110,000, which aligns with the late September consolidation range. A clean breakdown below this level could expose Bitcoin to further downside, with the next potential support around $106,000–$107,000.

For a sustainable recovery, Bitcoin must reclaim $114,000 and re-establish itself above the short-term moving averages. Until then, the market remains in a fragile equilibrium — with bulls defending key support and bears maintaining control of short-term momentum. The next few sessions will be decisive for BTC’s direction.

The retreat cut short a market recovery that saw the flagship cryptocurrency briefly cross $116,000 on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $112,030. Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Register Heavy Outflows US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs registered a combined $755 million in outflows on October 13 as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. According to data from SoSoValue, US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $326.5 million in net outflows on Monday, with Grayscale’s GBTC accounting for the bulk of redemptions. GBTC saw $145.3 million in outflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $115.6 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC with $93.2 million. However, BlackRock’s IBIT registered $60 million in inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs registered $428.5 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s ETHA led the redemptions with $310 million. No Ethereum ETFs registered any inflows. Hyperliquid Trader Doubles Down On Bitcoin (BTC) Short The Hyperliquid whale, who netted $192 million after shorting the market, has doubled down on their new short position, loading up nearly half a billion over the past two days. According to data from Hypurrscan, the whale’s short position is currently worth $496 million at 10x leverage, and a Bitcoin liquidation price of $124,270. The whale doubled their bet over the past 24 hours, initially opening the position with $163 million. The investor first appeared on the crypto community’s radar two months ago, holding a staggering $11 billion in BTC . The trader opened up $900 million in short positions on BTC and ETH last week. The whale gained even more attention after opening a short position minutes before US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to a crash in the crypto market. The identity behind the whale is yet to be confirmed. However, blockchain investigators hinted at a potential connection with Garrett Jin, former CEO of BitForex, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange. On-chain investigator Eye alleged the whale was Jin, leading to Binance CEO reposting the thread. However, ZachXBT suggested it was likely one of Jin’s friends. Jin essentially confirmed the connection when he replied to Zhao, stating, “@cz_binance, thanks for sharing my personal and private information. To clarify, I have no connection with the Trump family or@DonaldJTrumpJr — this isn’t insider trading.” Only minutes later, Jin made another post, stating, “The fund isn’t mine — it’s my clients’. We run nodes and provide in-house insights for them.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp drop during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $109,945 before reclaiming $110,000 and moving to its current level of $111,288. The flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.96% on Saturday, settling at $110,768. However, it made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced volatility and selling pressure on Monday but ultimately registered a marginal increase, settling at $115,274. BTC is down nearly 4% during the ongoing session. The decline cut short BTC’s recovery, which had seen it reclaim $115,000. Markets were rattled as the latest trade war flashpoint showed few signs of easing. Beijing hit back at Washington, stating it was prepared to “fight to the end” in a trade war. China also accused the US of discriminatory trade prices. The latest escalation could undermine an earlier framework between the US and China. China also justified its export controls on rare earth minerals, and gave little indication of caving in to US pressure. While Beijing noted that working-level talks were ongoing, it warned against imposing more tariffs. An October 14 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee revealed that the BTC on centralized exchanges has fallen to around 2.4 million BTC , the lowest level since 2015. When fewer coins are available on exchanges, selling pressure tends to ease, often leading to major price rallies, as seen in 2020 and 2021. According to Lee’s analysis, while prices may appear weak in the short term, the underlying bullish structure is intact. If long-term holders, institutional investors, and ETFs transfer their assets into cold storage, the supply could get even more restricted. BTC traded in bullish territory last week, and began the previous week with a 1.41% increase to $122,318. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday before reaching an intraday high of $125,750 on Sunday. BTC ultimately ended the weekend at $123,520, up 0.87%. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.97% and settled at $124,720, but not before reaching an intraday high of $126.296. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 3% to $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC fell 1.32% to a low of $119,713 before settling at $121,714. BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was in retaliation for China's imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with BTC down nearly 4%, trading around $111,700. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Friday’s market crash wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars from the crypto market cap, with over $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. USDe Depeg Was Due To An Oracle Issue Guy Young, the CEO of USDe creator Ethena Labs , clarified that the USDe depeg on Binance occurred due to an internal oracle issue and not because of the underlying collateral. Young claimed that USDe minting and redeeming worked perfectly during Friday’s market crash, adding that traders redeemed $2 billion in USDe from various exchanges with minimal price deviations. Young stated that USDe fell from $1 to $0.65 on Binance during Friday’s crash because the exchange was using oracle data from its own orderbook, which offered thinner liquidity. Young had stated, “The severe price discrepancy was isolated to a single venue, which referenced the oracle index on its own orderbook, not the deepest pool of liquidity, and was facing deposit and withdrawal issues during the event, which did not allow market makers to close the loop. No one would have been liquidated on any money market with oracles referencing the deepest pools of liquidity for USDe globally.” The Disruption On Binance USDe’s drop created panic within the crypto community, with traders believing the stablecoin had depegged across the market. However, data revealed that the crash was confined to Binance, with prices stable on other trading platforms. Young clarified that the event was “isolated to a single venue,” highlighting that Binance faced deposit and withdrawal issues. A Coordinated Attack? Traders had speculated whether the depegging was part of a coordinated attack to exploit the “Unified Account” feature on Binance, which allows users to post assets, including USDe, as collateral. The feature uses Binance’s own order book instead of external price oracles. Many traders have described this as a major vulnerability. Binance had stated it would address the issue by October 14 and migrate to data from external oracles. Traders believe attackers took advantage of this window and dumped up to $90 million in USDe on Binance, lowering its value to $0.65 on the platform, leading to nearly $1 billion in liquidations. The attackers then opened short positions on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Hyperliquid, minutes before President Trump’s tariff announcement, which sent markets into meltdown. Binance Paid $283M In Compensation Binance reportedly paid around $283 million in compensation to users of three assets, including USDe. Executives apologized to users after Friday’s market crash, which caused three assets in Binance Earn markets, Ethena's stablecoin USDe, Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token BNSOL, and Wrapped Beacon liquid staking token WBETH to depeg. The exchange compensated futures, margin, and loan users who held USDE, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral, and were impacted by the crash between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC.

The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $902,686 so far. Fundraising remains strong despite markets falling back into bearish territory. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For Next Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which is set to occur in just over eighteen hours, as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the project’s fledgling community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. The project also crossed the $900,000 milestone last week after several delays as the cryptocurrency market struggled with volatility and selling pressure in September. As a result, fundraising slowed down before picking up again after markets rebounded. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $902,686 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Cryptocurrency Market Back In Bearish Territory Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market fell back into the red, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens registering substantial declines. BTC failed to capitalize on momentum after reclaiming $115,000 as selling pressure returned. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency registered a dramatic decline and is currently trading around $112,750. Ethereum (ETH) has also registered a notable decline, down almost 2%, trading around $4,071. Ripple (XRP) is down 1.50%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, trading around $0.202. Solana (SOL) has bucked the bearish trend, rising 3%, but Cardano (ADA) is down 1%, trading around $0.698. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines.

According to Coinomist Magazine data , BNB Chain processed over 500 million transactions in the past 30 days, marking a 151% month-over-month increase.

Sights are still set on its $1,650 target, leaving room for a further 40% upwards move. In the short term, market sentiment may catch up to BNB as momentum indicators signal a cooling phase. The RSI has reversed from overbought territory above 70, often marking a local top. Still, the MACD histogram’s wide gap above the signal line suggests the uptrend remains strong. A retest of psychological support around $1,000 stands as a credible local bottom. Looking ahead, U.S. interest rate cuts could reignite risk appetite into 2026. With growing capital rotation into meme coins, BNB could surge another 150% to $3,000 under stronger demand conditions. BestWallet: Storing Crypto Can Net You Gains Too Tired of missing early gems?

Per a report from the Russian media outlet Ren TV , illegal mining farms are “leaving Russians without power and hitting their wallets.” Illegal crypto miners in a Russian facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) Russia: Illegal Crypto Miners Cost Taxpayers Dearly The broadcaster reported that the fear of facing high taxes on their income and paying prohibitively high electricity costs is “driving many miners into the shadows.” Ren TV explained: “The annual budget losses from underground mining amount to billions of rubles.” Despite recent efforts to legalize the Russian crypto mining sector, so-called “gray-hat mining” has “become Russia’s newest epidemic,” the broadcaster continued. Moscow has ordered all industrial miners to report their operations, earnings, and energy usage data to the Federal Tax Service. In exchange, they have been granted legal “entrepreneurship” status, which allows big investors like banks to provide financing and investment. However, while this is attractive to the country’s biggest players – the likes of BitRiver and Intelion – smaller-scale miners are less keen. The outlet explained that in their quest to save money, crypto miners now “resort to fraud, deception, or under-the-table deals with energy companies.” This means that in many cases, ordinary household and commercial consumers “are forced to pay for crypto miners’ operations.” Southern Russia, the traditional stronghold of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry, has become Russia’s “Mecca of gray-hat mining,” the outlet explained. Hardware in an illegal crypto mining facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) ‘Number of Illegal Crypto Mining Farms Rising by the Day’ Ren TV reported that experts believe that there are almost 140,000 Bitcoin and altcoin mining farms operating in Russia. They also think this number is “growing constantly.” But power chiefs say that “the lion’s share” of crypto miners have not declared their operations and “remain underground.” Experts added that buying electricity at commercial and industrial rates “eats up to 80% of crypto miners’ profits.” Their response is often to “cut costs illegally.” Police have recently reported the arrest of an employee at the Omsk Thermal Power Plant who took a 500,000 ruble ($6,270) bribe to let local crypto miners steal power from the grid.

This led to the city’s power grid losing around half a billion rubles ($6.3 million). In Dagestan, meanwhile, power officials found a massive illegal crypto mining farm hidden in coolant tanks. Only when the grid began to suffer issues did power providers finally realize what was happening. A power supply employee said the farm’s total load was 100 kilowatts/hour, adding: “The illegal crypto mining farm was using more power than an entire five-story building.” Another expert explained the appeal of illegal and quasi-legal mining, saying: “With the right approach, taking into account the energy, equipment, premises, and so on, illegal mining is the most profitable type of activity out there.” A Ren TV reporter visited a thermal power plant in Sharya, Kostroma Oblast (Central West Russia), where he showed that a boiler house manager was secretly mining BTC.

(Source: Pianist [CC BY-SA 2.5]) The farm, the reporter continued, “isn’t the only one in the region: There are plenty of companies willing to help miners.” The broadcaster interviewed Sharya residents who said they were “convinced” that miners are responsible for “frequent power outages in their homes.” Russian bailiffs say they have developed new methods to help them convert Bitcoin (BTC) seized in criminal cases into cash for the state’s treasury. #Russia #Bitcoin https://t.co/a8ZnK7uvIX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 These outages “damage household appliances,” the residents said, as these “simply can’t withstand the power surges and break.” No one has compensated them for these damages, the residents complained. In his closing comments, the reporter said: “Crypto entrepreneurs’ illegal businesses are finding it easy to find allies working in energy supply companies. They reap large profits.

While the finding drew attention, it also raised questions about how accurately the data reflected real capital movement. XRP’s Performance During the Recent Market Crash On October 10 , the global cryptocurrency market suffered one of its steepest single-day selloffs, triggered by widespread liquidations exceeding $19 billion. This event marked the largest daily liquidation in crypto history. XRP was among the hardest-hit digital assets, recording roughly $700 million in total liquidations, including about $610 million from long positions. Within hours, XRP’s value fell sharply from $2.80 to $1.58, a decline of more than 43%. The token later stabilized and closed the day at $2.37 before inching higher to around $2.55. Following the event, Rector analyzed on-chain and exchange data to assess the magnitude of XRP’s price reaction relative to capital movement, a method he referred to as measuring the “market cap multiplier effect.” Rector’s 1,200x Multiplier Observation Rector’s findings were based on CoinGlass data tracking changes in market capitalization alongside reported exchange outflows. According to his analysis, during the most volatile hour of trading on October 10, XRP recorded net outflows of approximately $55.8 million while its market capitalization dropped from $152 billion to $83 billion, a decline of about $70 billion. From these figures, Rector calculated a market cap multiplier of roughly 1,254x. He described this as the highest ratio observed since he began monitoring such data in 2024. Extending the analysis over a four-hour timeframe, he estimated total outflows of $64.9 million and a market cap decrease from $162 billion to $82 billion, producing a slightly smaller multiplier of around 1,215x. According to Rector , this level of sensitivity indicates that relatively small inflows or outflows can have an outsized impact on XRP’s valuation. He argued that XRP’s liquidity remains thin and heavily concentrated, leaving the market susceptible to large swings when significant buy or sell orders occur. Implications for Future Institutional Inflows Despite highlighting market fragility, Rector also pointed to the potential upside of such multiplier effects. He suggested that once institutional investment, such as from pending XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , enters the market, the same mechanism could amplify gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rector referenced projections from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, who estimated that XRP ETFs could attract between $5 billion and $10 billion in inflows within the first month of approval. Using conservative multipliers of 100x to 200x, Rector speculated that XRP’s market capitalization could expand by $500 billion to $1 trillion on top of its current valuation if such inflows materialise. Limitations of the Analysis While Rector’s figures generated widespread interest, they come with notable limitations. The data he relied upon reflects exchange flows, which represent the movement of XRP tokens between wallets and exchanges. This does not directly measure the flow of new capital into or out of the overall XRP market. A more precise metric for understanding real buying and selling pressure is the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net balance between executed buy and sell orders over time. CVD provides a clearer view of actual market demand and trading pressure compared to simple exchange movement data. For example, following the October 10 crash, XRP logged three consecutive days of price gains from October 11 to 13, despite mixed exchange flow readings. Exchanges recorded $6 million in outflows on October 11, $21.4 million in inflows on October 12, and $47 million in outflows on October 13, patterns that did not align with XRP’s steady recovery. This inconsistency highlights the flaw in using exchange flow data alone to infer capital inflows or outflows. However, Rector’s broader point, that minor net movements can have major effects on XRP’s market cap, remains valid. The key distinction is that actual capital movement is best captured through metrics like CVD rather than exchange netflows. Rector’s analysis sheds light on how market structure and liquidity can intensify XRP’s price movements. While his multiplier calculations illustrate potential sensitivity within the asset’s market, interpreting them as direct evidence of capital inflows or outflows is misleading. Still, his findings underline the potential impact of institutional money once regulated XRP ETFs enter the market, a factor that could significantly reshape the asset’s valuation landscape.

Scheduled for early November, the event will bring together top executives from across the payments and finance industries. Ripple Swell is our most important event of the year, and this November it returns to NYC. Swell is where leaders in crypto, payments, banking and policy come together to discuss what’s ahead for the future of finance. Request to attend → https://t.co/Iv2tfoBKkY Agenda →… pic.twitter.com/23obZnUauF — Ripple (@Ripple) September 12, 2025 Confirmed speakers include Adena Friedman , CEO of Nasdaq, along with digital asset leads from BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, and CME Group. On November 4, Ripple will present a live demo of stablecoin payments using the XRP Ledger, followed by a keynote from Brad Garlinghouse on the company’s next moves. XRP has dipped 5.4% in the past 24 hours, but with Swell around the corner, momentum could be building beneath the surface. XRP Price Prediction: Key Trend Line Support Held Well During Friday’s Flash Crash The daily chart shows XRP forming a symmetrical triangle , signaling a period of consolidation before its next big move. Last Friday’s flash crash saw the price touch a key support at $1.80 , which held firmly as buyers quickly stepped in — reinforcing its importance. If bearish momentum returns, this is the level to watch. However, the upcoming Swell conference could flip the script entirely if Ripple unveils new initiatives that boost ecosystem growth and adoption. A breakout above the $3 mark would confirm a move out of the triangle, setting the stage for a potential run toward $6 in the months ahead. As long as XRP holds above trend line support, the setup favors a bullish XRP price prediction . And while XRP gears up for a potential breakout, early-stage presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are catching investor attention.

The package is aimed at restoring user confidence and industry stability following a crash that saw some tokens depeg and billions wiped from the crypto derivatives market. The world’s largest crypto exchange said on Tuesday that the initiative, dubbed the “Together Initiative,” would provide both user compensation and institutional support as it works to rebuild trust after the disruption. The announcement comes days after Binance experienced a high-profile glitch that caused Ethena Labs’ USDe and two tokens, BNSOL and WBETH, to briefly lose their pegs, triggering forced liquidations and drawing widespread criticism. Binance had earlier pledged to compensate affected users. Binance promises compensation for affected users In its statement , Binance said that it will distribute up to $300 million in USDC stablecoin to individual traders who experienced forced liquidations between October 10 and 11, during the most volatile hours of the crash. Eligible users are those whose liquidation losses exceeded $50 and represented at least 30% of their net asset value at the time. Payouts, which the company said will begin within 24 hours and conclude within 96 hours, will be sent directly to spot accounts. In addition, Binance will establish a $100 million “Institutional Support Program” to offer low-interest loans to ecosystem partners and institutional clients hit hardest by the crash. The fund, designed to alleviate liquidity pressures and help firms resume trading operations, will be accessible to eligible VIP clients through their account managers. A glitch caused the weekend’s price distortions The new initiative follows Binance’s earlier October 11 announcement that it would fully compensate users affected by the depeg event, which occurred between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. During that window, a glitch caused price distortions for USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH. Binance said it has since completed a review and promised to reimburse all impacted users who experienced forced liquidations across Futures and Margin trading from 00:00 of October 10 to 23:59 UTC of October 11. The company also introduced several technical safeguards to prevent a repeat, including adding redemption prices into the price index weights of affected tokens, incorporating minimum price thresholds for USDe to improve stability, and conducting more frequent reviews of its risk parameters. Industry observers view Binance’s $400 million relief fund as a symbolic show of solidarity amid intensifying pressure and competition from other platforms. Binance’s handling of this episode positions it as an empathetic brand that takes responsibility for the challenges users faced when using the platform. The company said the relief package should not be confused as it taking liability for users’ losses. “We expect scrutiny, fair or unfair,” Binance said, adding that its users “are always our first priority.” According to the leading exchange, “It is critical to rebuild industry confidence” after a period of volatility and scrutiny. “This stems from our belief in the long-term development of the industry and our commitment to Binance’s User Focus values,” the company said in the statement.

All three coins have registered significant losses in the past 24 hours, yet their fundamental positions remain as positive as ever, with the arrival of altcoin ETFs later this year likely to ignite big rallies. Now may also be a great time to buy newer coins, with one presale token in particular showing strong potential for growth once it launches. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth to Help Alt Bounce from Massively Oversold Position The past few weeks have been very unkind to XRP, which has dropped from $3.09 at the start of October to $2.47 today. It’s down by 6% in 24 hours, 17% in a week and by 20% in a month, although it retains a very decent 360% increase in a year. There’s no denying that XRP has taken a battering recently, but this arguably sets it up for an even bigger surge in the not-too distant future. It’s currently waiting on more ETF launches than any other altcoin, with the launch of such funds ( possibly very soon ) set to boost its price massively. Source: TradingView Its chart today shows that it’s very close to hitting rock bottom, from which it can only bounce. Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are in heavily oversold positions, while its price is trading within a bullish pennant. This provides the foundation for a big rally in the coming weeks, while Ripple’s ongoing growth as a business puts XRP in a prime position to grow over the longer term. It could return to $3 in early November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – L1 Dominance Means ETH Will Lead Any Market-Wide Bull Rally ETH has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $3,999 marking a 14% decline in a week and a month. Ethereum does remain up by 58% in a year, which isn’t as impressive as XRP’s annual gain, but it does potentially mean that ETH will rally harder and compensate once an end-of-year rally gets into gear. The coin also boasts arguably the best fundamentals in crypto (save for BTC and maybe a handful of alts), meaning that it’s a prime position to ride any market-wide rally. And if we look at its chart, it too is in an oversold position from which it should recover very soon. Source: TradingView At the same time, the past few days have seen whales accumulating ETH , likely in the expectation of future gains. Given that Ethereum is still the biggest layer-one network by a wide margin , we can expect it to be one of the chief beneficiaries of any general growth in the crypto industry, including the growth of tokenisation and real-world assets (for example). We could therefore see the ETH price reach $4,500 by the end of the month, while it could enter 2026 at around $7,000. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Binance Dominance and CZ Pardon Could Send Alt to New All-Time Highs BNB is a similar coin to ETH, in the sense that its status as Binance’s utility token means it will lead any end-of-year bull rally. Binance is the biggest crypto-exchange in the world , and is likely to remain the biggest for the foreseeable future. As such, its utility token, BNB, will grow in parallel with the growth of the wider market. Its price currently stands at $1,200, which may represent an 11% loss in 24 hours, but which is also a 28% increase in a month. BNB has been growing steadily over the past few weeks, and its chart today suggests that it could be in for another spike soon. Source: TradingView Its recent momentum has been so strong that its RSI (yellow) has rebounded to 70 and above after falling only as low as 60 or 50. And given that it’s close to touching 50 today, we could see it and BNB’s price rallying again in the very near future. Boosting its fundamental position is also the fact that the Trump administration may soon grant a pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , who pleased guilty to anti-money laundering failures in November 2023. This would boost Binance’s business position, while by extension it would boost BNB. The altcoin is therefore on track to climb over $2,000 by the end of November, and will end the year even higher. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Attracts $1.8 Million in Popular Presale Traders preparing for an end-of-year rally may also want to consider diversifying into newer tokens, since the best new tokens can outperform the market. Some of the most promising new tokens on the market right now are currently holding their presales, which can often be a launchpad for rallies once they list. Possibly the most intriguing presale coins at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ICO. All in a days work.

At the same time, Dogecoin ETFs from issuers such as 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale are on the SEC’s docket, with early DOGE products already drawing over $30 million despite higher fees. A green light for lower-cost funds could funnel new, regulated demand into DOGE, historically a catalyst for liquidity and price discovery across crypto. Key levels: $0.20 support, $0.23–$0.25 and $0.29–$0.30 Resistance Dogecoin Price action remains balanced on a knife-edge. Traders flag $0.200 as critical support; losing it risks a slide toward $0.178. On the upside, initial resistance sits at $0.214 and $0.229, with a broader supply zone at $0.241–$0.254. A daily close above $0.25 opens a run at $0.29–$0.30, the area many watch for a breakout confirmation. Technically, DOGE recently printed hammer/morning star patterns off the lows, while momentum has cooled to neutral, often a staging zone before the next directional move. For swing traders, $0.18 (support) and $0.25 (resistance) are the immediate invalidation/continuation lines. Whales accumulate as Weekly Triangle Coils On-chain, whales soaked up roughly $42 million in DOGE during the dip, signaling confidence as price continues to coil inside a multi-month triangle on the weekly chart. Historically, DOGE’s long compressions have preceded outsized expansions.

53153416,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86385,1760486444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: The Storm Is Not Over Yet,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-storm-is-not-over-yet/,"Arthur, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has expressed concern about XRP’s recent market behavior, warning that the asset may not yet be out of danger following the latest market downturn. His remarks come after the severe selloff that occurred on October 10, which triggered widespread liquidations across major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. During the crash, XRP declined sharply by more than 43%, reaching a low of $1.58, its weakest level so far this year. Although the token has since rebounded above $2.50 , it remains down more than 13% over the past week, signaling ongoing market instability. XRP’s Technical Structure Raises Concern In his recent technical assessment, Arthur described XRP’s latest price movement as dangerous, emphasizing that the market may still be under significant selling pressure. The analyst noted that despite the impressive rebound from the post-crash bottom, indicators on the 4-hour chart suggest that the upward momentum is weakening. Dangerous move from $XRP , the storm might not be over yet… After a 200%+ bounce from the crash lows, structure is showing signs of exhaustion.

Join us on Telegram and stay ahead of the next move. … pic.twitter.com/dah7D1g4yJ — Arthur (@XrpArthur) October 14, 2025 For several weeks, XRP’s price had been moving within a symmetrical triangle pattern, with the $2.60 level serving as a key psychological threshold. However, the October 10 selloff forced the token below the triangle’s lower boundary and two additional support zones at $2.50 and $2.20. Although XRP managed to recover the $2.20 level almost immediately, it struggled to regain and sustain the $2.50 mark. When XRP attempted to reenter the symmetrical triangle, it encountered strong resistance along the lower trendline, which halted further progress. The token is currently trading around the $2.50 mark , though it has not yet broken convincingly above it. This shows some stabilization at the support band, but regaining the triangle cleanly would provide clearer confirmation that the prior breakdown has been reversed. Market Factors and Near-Term Outlook Arthur’s analysis also links the renewed volatility to broader geopolitical developments. Recent tensions following China’s response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats have contributed to renewed uncertainty in global markets, extending bearish sentiment across digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He stressed that XRP needs to recover and hold above $2.50 before attempting to reestablish its previous trading structure. A move back into the symmetrical triangle could indicate a reversal of the current downward momentum, while continued rejection below resistance may confirm a prolonged consolidation phase near recent lows. Mixed Opinions Among Analysts Despite Arthur’s caution, other analysts have presented more optimistic interpretations. Market researcher Xaif pointed out that XRP’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) fell to a six-month low during the crash, historically signaling potential recovery periods. According to him, the last instance of a similar drop preceded a 35% price rebound, suggesting that a comparable correction could occur in the near term. Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt has reiterated a constructive long-term outlook for XRP. He described the asset’s broader chart formation as structurally sound, implying that while short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term trend could still favor gradual appreciation. Overall, analysts remain divided on XRP’s immediate prospects. While Arthur maintains that the asset’s recent breakdown and failure to reenter its trading structure are signs of market fragility, others believe the selloff may be nearing exhaustion. In the coming days, XRP’s ability to trade above the $2.50 level will likely determine whether the market stabilizes or faces renewed pressure.

53155227,605626,1760486458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155227.jpeg,Extreme Fear Grips Altcoins As 90% Of Tokens Trade Below 200DMA: Perfect Time To Accumulate?,https://bitcoinist.com/extreme-fear-grips-altcoins-90-trade-below-200dma/,"Altcoins continue to face heavy pressure across the board after the historic crash that shook the crypto market on Friday. The sudden sell-off triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions within minutes. Even established blue chips such as Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX) saw their prices plunge more than 60% before partially recovering over the weekend. While prices have since stabilized at slightly higher levels, investor confidence remains fragile. The market is still reeling from the shock, and traders are cautious as volatility persists. According to top analyst Darkfost, the current market structure reflects deep disinterest and capitulation. He shared data showing that only 10% of altcoins listed on Binance are trading above their 200-day moving average — meaning that 90% of the altcoin market is below its long-term trend. This extreme reading highlights the magnitude of the sell-off and the lack of strong recovery momentum so far. Historically, such setups often precede accumulation phases, as smart money begins to position for the next cycle . However, with sentiment still fragile, the coming days will determine whether this is a true bottoming zone or simply a pause before another leg down. Market Exhaustion Could Signal the Next Rebound Darkfost explains that the current state of the altcoin market has historically marked moments of capitulation and opportunity. Throughout this cycle, similar configurations have occurred three times, each followed by a notable short-term rebound across major altcoins. These periods of extreme selling exhaustion often represent points where downside momentum fades, and patient investors begin accumulating high-quality assets at deep discounts. Darkfost emphasizes that these setups rarely last long. Once market sentiment stabilizes and traders recognize the excessive fear priced into altcoins, capital tends to flow back quickly, driving strong relief rallies. However, he warns that this is not a time for indiscriminate buying. The key, he says, lies in focusing on projects that have maintained liquidity, developer activity, and on-chain usage even amid the broader downturn. These factors often separate long-term survivors from speculative tokens that will struggle to recover. For investors who missed previous market cycles, this type of configuration could present one of the most favorable risk-reward setups in months. Yet timing remains crucial. As Darkfost notes, once the market realizes it has overcorrected, re-entry opportunities disappear quickly, often replaced by aggressive upward moves that reward those who acted decisively during peak fear. Altcoins Face Critical Support Test The total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 assets — a key indicator of broader altcoin performance — is currently hovering around $263 billion, reflecting a 2.3% decline over the week. This chart paints a clear picture of stress across the altcoin sector following last week’s market-wide crash, with prices retracing sharply from the $285 billion area after being rejected near multi-month resistance. Technically, the market cap remains above the 200-week moving average (red line), which has acted as a reliable support level throughout previous cycles. However, the recent volatility and long downside wick highlight strong selling pressure, suggesting that many investors have been forced to de-risk amid uncertainty. The 50-week MA (blue) and 100-week MA (green) are currently flattening, signaling the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase before any sustainable recovery begins. Historically, this structure — a deep correction into major moving averages — often precedes accumulation phases that mark macro bottoms. As long as the $250 billion level holds, the broader altcoin market could stabilize and gradually rebuild momentum. A weekly close below this support, however, would likely trigger another wave of liquidations, potentially retesting the $200 billion region — a level associated with previous cycle lows.

At the same time, Japan’s Metaplanet faces a sharp valuation drop despite holding over $3.5 billion in BTC. Yet, technical charts show BTC stabilizing near $111,000, with a triple-bottom pattern hinting at a possible breakout toward $130,000 as institutional demand strengthens. Elon Musk Calls Bitcoin “Energy-Based and Inflation-Proof” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, described Bitcoin as “energy-based” and “inflation-proof,” contrasting it with “fake fiat” currencies. He noted that BTC’s proof-of-work model prevents the creation of “fake energy,” unlike fiat money that governments can print at will. Musk made the remarks in response to analyst ZeroHedge, who linked rising Bitcoin and gold prices to government spending on artificial intelligence. This marks Musk’s most direct statement on Bitcoin in nearly three years, following his 2022 prediction of a prolonged bear market after the FTX collapse. His renewed endorsement underscores Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and its increasing relevance in an AI-driven economy, despite ongoing concerns about mining energy use.

IMF Warns of Global Market Risks The International Monetary Fund warned that global markets are becoming complacent about risks such as trade tensions, high debt levels, and inflated asset prices. It cautioned that a sudden loss of confidence could trigger a “disorderly” market downturn. The IMF just issued a stark warning: risk asset prices are ""well above fundamentals,"" raising the odds of a ""disorderly"" market correction. The International Monetary Fund's semiannual Global Financial Stability Report, released Tuesday morning, warns that investors have grown… pic.twitter.com/6BUOSaAWwQ — Aiime (@Aiime_ai) October 14, 2025 The warning followed renewed tariff threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump, which briefly pressured both Bitcoin and equity markets. The IMF urged governments to tighten oversight of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and reduce fiscal deficits. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s quick recovery suggests traders remain confident in its long-term resilience. Metaplanet’s Value Falls Below Its BTC Holdings Metaplanet, Japan’s leading Bitcoin treasury firm, has seen its enterprise value drop below the worth of its Bitcoin assets for the first time. The company’s market-to-Bitcoin net asset value (mNAV) fell to 0.99, indicating that the market now values Metaplanet at less than its 30,823 BTC holdings, currently worth about $3.5 billion. The decline comes after the company paused Bitcoin purchases for two weeks, despite its reputation as one of Asia’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin accumulators. Metaplanet’s stock has fallen 75% since June, reflecting investor caution and broader uncertainty around Bitcoin treasury strategies. Metaplanet’s market-to-Bitcoin NAV just dropped below 1 for the first time ever, meaning the company’s market value is now less than the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet is trading at a discount to its Bitcoin, a rare event for one of the largest public BTC holders. pic.twitter.com/yW8EKavdXX — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) October 14, 2025 Analysts, however, compare the reaction to early skepticism toward Tesla, arguing the selloff reflects market mispricing rather than weakness in Metaplanet’s model. They note that the company’s large Bitcoin reserve and long-term accumulation plan continue to support confidence in its balance sheet strength. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traded steadily around $113,000, as analysts said Metaplanet’s holdings reaffirm institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Setup Targets $130,000 Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup indicates selling pressure is easing while buyers gradually regain control. On the two-hour chart, the 100-period SMMA at $116,676 overlaps the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $116,108, forming a key resistance area that could restrict gains before a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels to 47, showing early bullish divergence and slowing downside momentum. A bullish engulfing candle above $114,500 would confirm the pattern and reinforce short-term buying strength. Bitcoin remains inside a descending channel, but the TradingView path projection suggests a breakout toward $119,800, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci level. A close above $120,000 would signal a shift from consolidation to recovery, targeting $125,000 and $130,000 next. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600 with stops below $109,500, eyeing $119,800 as the initial target. A move above the 100-SMA would confirm trend reversal potential. With volatility easing and institutional accumulation picking up, Bitcoin’s current base may serve as the foundation for a sustained Q4 rally. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been popular based on its meme appeal and fast price fluctuations, but long-term viability beyond user sentiment remains a concern. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , on the other hand, is becoming a serious contender based on substance, not speculation. With Phase 6 currently active and with more than 65% already sold, MUTM’s decentralized finance innovation, solid tokenomics, and actual use cases have kept it as one of the strongest altcoins in 2025. Whereas PEPE is based on short-term hype, Mutuum Finance is the strategic, utility-based growth potential long-term investors are looking for. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Price Prediction: Can There Be Another Rise? The price of Pepe Coin (PEPE) has dropped by 24.2% within the last 24 hours, reflecting the bearish sentiment across the wider market prompted by Bitcoin’s latest correction and a precipitous fall in speculation-based demand for meme cryptocurrencies. Despite the brisk sell-off, PEPE currently trades at or near its historical demand area, a point that sparked a triple-digit advance earlier this year. PEPE has found its way back to this area a concern for hopeful bulls that a short-term bounce back is possible with a resurgence in buying interest. Nevertheless, as sentiment across the market moves away from hype and toward value based on utility, many investors are also starting to look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a better bet with long-term growth and sustainable foundations. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance is getting strong uproar amongst DeFi investors in its presale where over 17,000 investors have been enrolled to have raised over $17.3 million to-date. Phase 6 where the price of the token is at $0.035 is already sold out 65%. The level is seeing strong demand from investors. Lending and Borrowing Protocol The protocol will be launching their new lending and borrowing protocol according to their latest announcement. The first version will be launching live on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have underlying feature sets with the liquidity pools, with the mtTokens, with the debt tokens, and with the liquidator bot. ETH along with USDT will be accommodated for collaterals, for lending, and also for the borrowing, and the ultimate result will be a seamless, multi-asset, and secure DeFi experience. In order to balance proportionate with secure lending, the protocol uses risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV), with the maximum collateral per asset depending on the risk level. The protocol also uses buffer reserves where riskier properties are required to hold larger reserves. This approach insulates the users from the volatility from the market as well as overall health of the ecosystem, so the platform will be surprised but will not affect the health. Mutuum Finance is the Standout Strategic Choice for 2025 While Pepe Coin (PEPE) is still a beneficiary of hype bursts and short-term price fluctuations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a more fundamentally sound and utility-driven play. With over 17,000 investors investing more than $17.3 million during Phase 6 of its presale and 65% already subscribed, the traction for MUTM is a testament to growing conviction in its long-term outlook. Its upcoming lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with ETH and USDT collateral, liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot will provide a secure, scalable, and usable DeFi experience. Investors interested in sustainable growth and early access to a high-potential project must invest in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today and put themselves in contention for a top 2025 crypto opportunity.

53155229,605804,1760490010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155229.jpeg,Greatest Bitcoin Threat? Charles Edwards Predicts Quantum Break In 2–8 Years,https://bitcoinist.com/charles-edwards-bitcoin-quantum-break-2-8-years/,"At TOKEN2049 Singapore, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards set aside his well-known Bitcoin bullishness to deliver an unambiguous warning: a quantum “Q-Day” could arrive far sooner than most of the industry expects, with potentially existential consequences if Bitcoin’s core cryptography is not upgraded in time. “Within two to eight years, a quantum machine will break Bitcoin’s current encryption,” he told the audience, urging developers, companies and holders to treat the issue as urgent engineering, not distant theory. Edwards framed Q-Day as the moment a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can break widely-used classical cryptography such as RSA—and, by extension, the elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) underpinning Bitcoin’s public-private key model. “Q-day is the day in which a quantum machine will break classic encryption,” he said, adding that once that threshold is crossed, anything protected by those primitives—from financial networks to “sensitive data” and “of course Bitcoin”—is at risk. He asserted that Bitcoin’s ECC would likely fall sooner than RSA when the industry approaches that breakpoint. Quantum Computing Could Break Bitcoin Within 8 Years Pushing back on the common refrain that practical quantum attacks are decades away, Edwards argued the timeline has materially compressed, citing both rapid technical progress and a collective incentive among states and large firms to accelerate. “Even quantum years away. If you ask ChatGPT or Grok, it’ll tell you 10, 20, 30 years away. It’s rubbish,” he said. He pointed to quantum computer access already available via major cloud providers—AWS, Google and Azure—and its use cases in “drug discovery, defense, [and] optimizing bond yields,” presenting these as markers of real-world traction rather than laboratory demos. Edwards anchored his 2–8 year forecast to a convergence of views he described as independent and sober. He referenced security specialist Jameson Lopp as assigning “50% risk in four to nine years,” a “math PhD doctor specializing in quantum” at “2 to six years for Bitcoin,” and McKinsey’s estimate for RSA-level Q-Day in “2 to 10 years,” reiterating his belief that “Bitcoin breaks years earlier than that.” He also drew attention to a 2017 “Bitcoin quantum paper” that, in his reading, suggests “you only need 2,300 qubits—logical qubits—to break Bitcoin’s ECC,” noting its authorship by researchers affiliated with Microsoft, IonQ and Meta. While those numbers and affiliations were presented as evidence, his central message was less about any single study and more about the overall direction of travel: a multilateral “quantum arms race” that he said has already attracted “$55 billion” in commitments, with China “spending double the US.” In Edwards’ telling, technological trendlines are compounding that investment wave. He described qubit growth as “basically a straight line in a log chart,” claiming it is “progressing faster than Moore’s law,” and likened today’s skepticism to the disbelief many held about AI adoption in 2021—right before chatbots went mainstream. “Imagine 2021 and thinking about AI… You thought it was years away. So ChatGPT happened. I think we’re in a similar moment with quantum. It’s ignored today, but it’s coming.” He also highlighted a perceived shift in sentiment from Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, saying that after downplaying quantum timelines early in the year, Huang later called quantum at “an inflection point” and has been “spending billions buying quantum companies.” For Edwards, the takeaway is simple: “As always, follow the money.” The operational risks Edwards outlined for Bitcoin were concrete and immediate. If adversaries can derive private keys from public keys exposed on-chain, coins sitting at addresses that have previously revealed public keys become vulnerable to theft. That set includes long-dormant “lost” coins and, potentially, some portion of Satoshi-era holdings. “Satoshi’s coins will probably be market dumped,” he said starkly, not because their owner would necessarily act, but because the associated keys could be computed and the UTXOs swept once Q-Day arrives. He contrasted dormant addresses with actively maintained wallets, arguing that modern key management and timely migration would reduce exposure: “We want to keep active wallets… it’s good to maintain security upgrades and relevancy of the tech through time.” He referenced Michael Saylor ’s recent remark about doing “something ethically proper and burn[ing] his coins,” using it to underscore an inversion in perceived safety: “Actually burnt—the lost coins—the highest risk because no one has maintained that infrastructure.” Beyond the cryptographic break itself, Edwards emphasized the logistical constraints of any industry-wide upgrade. Bitcoin can only process so many transactions per day, meaning a migration to quantum-safe addresses cannot be done overnight. “We have long lead times to upgrade Bitcoin,” he said. “For Bitcoin itself it takes at least a month if you ignore all other transactions on the network to simply move everyone across to new wallets… so we’re looking at at least basically 6 to 12 months to fix this.” On that basis, he argued work on a concrete migration path cannot wait: “We need to be solving this really next year—2026—in order to get a solution before 2027.” Edwards pointed to ongoing technical efforts as a starting point rather than a finished plan. “There’s solutions to protect crypto… There’s a few BIPs for example like this one… by Jameson Lopp . So there are solutions. We can solve this but there is an urgency to it.” Quantum will break Bitcoin and Satoshi’s coins will market dump. We must act in 2026. Watch this video to understand why. https://t.co/46Cqlv5RSH — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) October 13, 2025 He called on developers to evaluate proposals for quantum-resistant schemes and on the broader community to “get talking to [the] community, your social media, get involved in the Bitcoin improvement proposals.

While the multi-billion-dollar liquidation event sent prices plunging across the board, Solana demonstrated remarkable resilience, whereas the Ethereum network and liquidity thinned during the peak volatility. Why Solana High-Performance Design Continues To Shine In an X post, the Nasdaq-listed go-to Solana Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), DefDevCorp, has revealed that when the largest liquidation event in crypto history hit last Friday, most of the market froze, and Ethereum stumbled. However, Solana didn’t flinch, powering through one of the most chaotic trading sessions ever recorded. Related Reading: Solana Shines Bright: Network Excels Amid Largest Crypto Liquidation Event At the peak of volatility, Solana sustained 1,225 transactions per second, finalized blocks in just 350 milliseconds, and saw transaction fees briefly rise to $0.25 before normalizing below $0.01. Meanwhile, ETH’s infrastructure buckled under demand as the network struggled to process beyond 26 TPS. Its block times extended to 15 seconds, and saw average gas fees explode to $616, effectively locking out users and rendering the chain unusable during the crisis. ETH became unreliable, impractical, and effectively unusable during the chaos. As DefiDevCorp noted, when users are priced out and transactions can’t clear, the network might as well be offline. In moments of high load, the core promise of a blockchain to remain accessible, affordable, and reliable must hold. However, after nearly 20 months of uninterrupted uptime, weathering its busiest moments, it’s abundantly clear that SOL’s continued upgrades and optimizations have paid off dramatically. DefiDevCorp concluded that no other chain currently comes close to handling global value transfer at this scale, under such extreme conditions, with the same level of performance. The takeaway from the firm’s post is that only SOL stays fast, cheap, and usable, even when global markets melt down. Why SOL Price Doesn’t Match Its Reliability A Researcher at alphapleaseHQ and Advisor at KaminoFinance, Aylo, has also mentioned that he had assets and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) positions open on both Solana and Ethereum when the crypto market collapsed last Friday. During this time, he had zero issues using the SOL network, while the ETH network was unusable due to the costs, which often led to market crashes, and the Rabby wallet also went down. Related Reading: No Chain Comes Close: Solana Leads With 2.5x Ethereum’s Revenue Aylo added that the ETH maxis should be much angrier about the performance of their L1. With this development, SOL continues to prove it’s the most performant and reliable blockchain under real-world pressure that we have in crypto. He pointed out that SOL’s valuation doesn’t reflect the resilience it is proving in the digital world.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, he wrote: “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China.” China has been the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans for years, importing about 27 million metric tons valued at roughly $12.8 billion in 2024.But since May, Beijing has refused to purchase a single shipment. The halt came as the trade war between Washington and Beijing heated up again, with tariffs driving prices higher for Chinese importers.Instead, China began sourcing soybeans from Argentina and other South American producers. Coincidentally, Argentina lifted export taxes on the same day Trump’s administration announced a $20 billion currency swap with Buenos Aires. Hours later, Argentina’s President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House. By the end of the day, the U.S. president had unleashed his public rebuke against China. Markets drop after Trump’s trade warning The timing of Trump’s post sent markets tumbling. The S&P 500 fell sharply by the end of the day, closing lower after a volatile session. Traders were already on edge following Trump’s warning on Friday that he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports in response to Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth minerals. Hours after that threat, he said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1. But by Sunday, he changed tone, posting, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” Meanwhile, data showed China’s exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, and the U.S. accounted for 43% of the total. That number added to Washington’s frustration as Trump considered cutting ties in the cooking oil trade altogether. His comments deepened doubts about ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, already stalled after months of tit-for-tat measures. Beijing responded by introducing its own round of economic measures. It started collecting special port fees on U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels, while exempting Chinese-built ships. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV explained that the new fees would apply to a vessel’s first port of entry for a single voyage or up to five voyages per year, with exceptions for empty ships entering for repairs. The move mirrored the U.S. policy announced earlier this year, when Trump’s administration approved similar fees on China-linked vessels to boost the U.S. shipbuilding sector. China hits back with sanctions and maritime countermeasures The standoff extended beyond soybeans and tariffs into the shipping industry.An investigation that began during the Biden administration had concluded that China used unfair practices to dominate global shipping and shipbuilding. That finding gave Trump the authority to impose penalties aimed at reducing Beijing’s control. China fired back by introducing identical port charges on U.S.-linked vessels the same day America’s fees took effect. Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers said in a research note that the situation created a “spiral of maritime taxation” between the two economies, warning of disruptions to global freight flows. Shipping analyst Ed Finley-Richardson said operators were scrambling to reroute ships to avoid Chinese ports. He said some U.S. shipowners were trying to sell their cargo mid-voyage so vessels could divert elsewhere. Analysts estimated China’s state-owned COSCO would take the hardest hit, bearing almost half of the $3.2 billion in extra costs expected by 2026. Major international carriers like Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, and CMA CGM reduced exposure by pulling China-linked ships off U.S. trade routes. American trade officials later lowered the proposed port fees after backlash from agriculture, energy, and shipping industries, which argued that the tariffs would raise costs for consumers and exporters alike. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry responded Tuesday, saying, “If the U.S. chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.” Hours later, Beijing announced sanctions against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of supporting a U.S. investigation into China’s trade practices. Hanwha, which owns Philly Shipyard in the U.S. and builds Navy vessels, confirmed it was monitoring the situation after its stock plunged nearly 6%, as Cryptopolitan reported .

China’s model of export-led growth is running out of steam as demand from abroad cools and prices for manufactured goods collapse, the International Monetary Fund said in its latest World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday. The IMF warned that the second-largest economy in the world should rebalance its focus to prioritize domestic demand, or it would stagnate in the long term. China is still producing a large volume of goods for export, but weak global demand has depressed prices, said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist at the IMF. The renewed calls come as Western policymakers increasingly urge the IMF to take a tougher stance on China’s economic policies . The IMF message is not new, but the timing matters. The Chinese economy’s recovery remains fragile after years of pandemic disruptions, turmoil in the real estate industry, and consumer confidence that has yet to recover. Sluggish domestic demand hampers recovery The IMF described China’s prospects as “worrisome,” citing mounting financial stability risks and tepid consumer spending . The economy is hovering on the edge of a debt-deflation trap, Gourinchas said, with property values falling, anemic credit demand, and corporate borrowing constraints dragging the rebound. The property crisis in China — once a giant source of urban wealth — still looms large. Many developers are struggling to complete housing projects, banks are saddled with bad loans, and households are holding back from spending or investing. The uncertainty that resulted has dragged down confidence among consumers and businesses alike. The IMF also noted that, although Beijing’s heavy spending on strategic industries, including electric vehicles and renewable energy, has been lucrative in some sectors, it could be misallocating resources and contributing to fiscal pressures. Subsidies and state-directed investment, the Fund said, can distort competition and block out small private firms. The IMF suggested that China embark on a so-called “transitional fiscal expansion and permanent fiscal recomposition”, which it said would entail temporarily raising government spending to lift private household consumption before transitioning long-term fiscal priorities toward social safety nets and income support. China’s export growth, too, has started to sputter. While overall exports in September rose from the period a year earlier, shipments to the United States plummeted more than 27% from a year ago, according to data provided by China’s customs authority. Analysts say one reason, apart from geopolitical factors, is lower overall global demand. At the same time, concern has been rising in both the European Union and the United States about an influx of low-cost Chinese goods — primarily electric vehicles and solar panels — that are undercutting domestic industries. Such an outcome, the IMF warned, could exacerbate trade frictions unless China’s domestic market creates enough demand to soak up more of its output. Beijing faces tough policy choices China’s leaders have recognized the challenge. Premier Li Qiang recently told officials that expanding domestic demand is crucial for maintaining sustainable growth and promised targeted fiscal support for households and small businesses. However, economists argue that much deeper structural reforms are necessary in 2020 to make this a reality. These measures could be increasing household income, reforming social security to lower precautionary savings, and providing greater flexibility to the private sector, which would play a role in both innovation and employment. The IMF’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, expressed a similar sentiment this year when she said that the Fund has been very vocal about China needing to change its economic model. She emphasized that measures to boost consumer confidence and increase transparency in the financial industry were also crucial for sustainable growth. Yet Beijing must make painful political and social choices. Slowing growth in the short term may also require reducing state-led industrial investment. However, without reform, the IMF argues, China could remain stuck in a cycle of low demand, low prices, and rising debts.

This executive order permits the inclusion of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies, in 401(k) retirement accounts. Downing’s efforts began when he officially presented a draft bill to the House Financial Services Committee. Following this act, reliable sources anticipated a high likelihood that this would grant Executive Order 14330 legal power. Notably, Trump issued this order on August 7 this year. It highlights that all Americans currently saving for retirement should be eligible for funds that include alternative assets. However, this is only applicable when appropriate based on a plan fiduciary. Downing’s sparks optimism in the crypto ecosystem for a new crypto-friendly law Alternative assets include private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure initiatives, lifetime income strategies, and digital assets, all of which are managed via active investment vehicles . On the other hand, an executive order highlights government priorities in a manner that differs from that of a law. Additionally, future leaders or courts can reverse it. Therefore, for a policy to become permanent, Congress must approve the bill in both chambers. This action takes place before the bill is signed into law. However, for Trump’s executive order concerning retirement assets to become law, it requires the attention of three key parts of the US government. This includes the Department of Labor, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Treasury Secretary, who are assigned the role of reviewing the order and providing prioritized guidance for 401(k) plans within six months. Interestingly, the bill was introduced despite the ongoing US government shutdown. This was made possible because Congress can bring up and still discuss legislation during a funding gap. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the push to incorporate alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, into US retirement accounts has been gaining momentum over the past few months. Trump’s executive order sparks controversy among individuals Concerning Trump’s executive order, the US Department of Labor withdrew the Biden administration’s previous guidance to fiduciaries in May. This guidance encouraged fiduciaries to exercise extreme caution when adding crypto exposure to 401(k) retirement plans. No sooner had Trump issued his executive order than, in September, nine members of Congress from the US wrote a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. In this letter, they called for the agency to accelerate the implementation of the order and assist 90 million Americans currently locked out of investing in alternative assets, enabling them to secure a dignified and comfortable retirement. The 401(k) plan is one of the widespread retirement savings programs employers offer, particularly in the US. To support this claim, reports from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) regarding the US retirement market in the second quarter of this year illustrated that Americans had saved around $9.3 trillion in their 401(k) accounts by June 30. While some financial professionals believe that using retirement savings to invest in crypto and digital assets is risky, several individuals in the cryptocurrency community support the idea. An example is André Dragosch, the head of European research at Bitwise, who in August stated that integrating cryptocurrency into US retirement plans could be a game-changer for Bitcoin adoption and potentially introduce billions of dollars’ worth of new investment.

During the company’s annual Dreamforce 2025 conference in San Francisco, Benioff told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that Salesforce is not just a cloud software company anymore — it is an “AI-first” enterprise. Benioff said that many people did not realize Agentforce was essentially Salesforce itself, adding that it had become the center of everything the company was building and the platform on which all its products were based. The comment highlights a significant shift for Salesforce, which is making substantial investments, and AI will be the driving force behind the next decade of business transformation. The company’s most recent upgrades and partnerships aim to integrate AI agents into its customers’ daily lives. Agentforce transforms into Salesforce’s backbone. Originally designed to automate mundane tasks within enterprises, the platform has evolved into a full-fledged AI OS. It now powers everything from sales forecasting and marketing campaigns to customer service chatbots and predictive analytics. Agentforce 360, as the second generation of the idea, was announced at Dreamforce 2025 by Salesforce. The upgraded version combines AI agents, real-time data, and human workflows into a single, consistent experience. It plugs into the Salesforce orbit — which now includes messaging app Slack, data visualization software Tableau, and Data Cloud — so companies can deploy AI agents that illuminate every corner of their businesses in real-time and take action autonomously. It’s no longer a side project, according to Benioff, emphasizing that Agentforce was now at the heart of Salesforce’s suite of software. The company had already cleared tens of thousands of instances, and customers were starting to reap productivity gains as they geared up for the next level of execution, he said. Salesforce’s AI tools have been adopted by leading enterprises, including Dell, Williams-Sonoma, and PepsiCo, to drive operational efficiencies and gain unprecedented insights, thereby transforming their businesses. The startup is changing the way that sales gets done in enterprises, transforming customer relationship management, which Benioff describes as “agentive relationship management.” Salesforce has strengthened its connections with top AI developers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, whose massive language models are being incorporated into Agentforce. The partnership enables customers to safely leverage generative AI within Salesforce’s trusted ecosystem, combining sophisticated automation with enterprise-grade data governance. Benioff argued that companies needed trusted partners to navigate the complexity and ethical challenges of enterprise AI, noting that Salesforce held a unique advantage in that regard. He added that enterprises were no longer simply seeking access to AI but were now demanding AI systems they could trust, ones that were safe, reliable, and accountable. Investors wary even as mega bets on AI roll in Despite the hype around AI, Salesforce’s financial performance has been met with pressure. The company’s stock has declined by more than 28% since the beginning of the year, as investors worry about slowing revenue growth and increasing competition. Analysts have noted that while Salesforce is moving fast and innovating, converting that innovation into profit will take time. Still, Benioff remains confident. He says the grass-roots move to an AI-oriented model is necessary for long-term success. Most industry analysts agree that Salesforce is preparing itself for the next great wave of business evolution. With AI integrated into every product, the company is betting that demand will increasingly be driven by organizations seeking to automate complex processes and keep human decision-making at the forefront. Benioff has used the term “agentic enterprise” to describe companies in which AI agents become tightly integrated into workflow. These businesses run everything, from customer service to supply chain logistics, on Agentforce, with agents able to make recommendations, take actions, and continually learn from the results. Benioff described his vision as ambitious, one in which companies would no longer use software but instead collaborate with AI partners that understood their data, goals, and customers. He said it was not just another platform but the beginning of a new way of doing business.

The Tesla CEO replied to a viral ZeroHedge thread that framed artificial intelligence as a government-funded arms race that will turbocharge monetary debasement. “True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy,” Musk wrote, aligning BTC’s value proposition with physical power constraints. Minutes later, when community account Sir Doge of the Coin (@dogeofficialceo) added, “Dogecoin is also based on energy,” Musk replied with a simple “💯,” his first explicit nod toward DOGE in a while, rekindling a long-running price-sensitivity question around his posts. Dogecoin is also based on energy pic.twitter.com/E8BMmAIdm9 — Sir Doge of the Coin ⚔️ (@dogeofficialceo) October 14, 2025 The market reaction, however, was muted. As of press time, Dogecoin traded near $0.196, lower on the day alongside broader crypto risk, with Bitcoin and Ethereum also in the red. Bitcoin was down on the session near $111k, while Ethereum slipped below $4k, underscoring a risk-off tape that likely blunted any “Musk effect” impulse. Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup and Handle Holds A Secret Few Are Seeing Musk’s DOGE remarks arrive amid a separate swirl of Dogecoin-adjacent headlines that caught Washington’s and Wall Street’s attention over the last 48 hours. Representative Matt Gaetz amplified a viral thread, asking, “Is DOGE about to become the world’s great utility token? After being a meme?!” — a rhetorical riff that referenced news circulating about a planned public-markets pivot by House of Doge as the “corporate arm” of the Dogecoin Foundation. Is DOGE about to become the world’s great utility token? After being a meme?! https://t.co/wVXO7eijss — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) October 13, 2025 House of Doge intends to list on Nasdaq via a merger with Brag House Holdings under the ticker TBH, and they also tie House of Doge to a growing Dogecoin treasury effort at CleanCore Solutions, newly branded on the NYSE American as ZONE. The October 13 releases further assert that CleanCore now holds 730 million+ DOGE, targeting up to 1 billion DOGE in the near term and, longer-run, “up to 5%” of circulating supply. Why Hasn’t The Dogecoin Price Reacted Positively? Historically, Musk’s DOGE interactions have triggered sharp, if often fleeting, price responses. During late 2024, for example, a single “true” reply in a payments-context thread coincided with a pop as traders extrapolated X-payments tie-ins, and the October 2024 launch of a dedicated account for its payments initiative on X. Related Reading: What The Weekend Liquidation Event Meant For The Dogecoin Price, And What Could Happen Next More recently, in June 2025, DOGE jumped 3% after Musk defused a political spat. The common denominator: reflexive liquidity and headline-driven order flow that fades unless there’s a real impact on the meme coin. Today’s sequence fits that pattern — a high-engagement Musk quip, immediate social virality, but price constrained by macro tape and the absence of a concurrent, verifiable product or policy reveal. So why didn’t DOGE “go to the moon” on the 💯? First, the tape matters. With majors heavy, meme-beta typically underperforms. Second, the information content of the post is modest: Musk endorsed an energy-based framing and acknowledged a community meme — not a new X Payments feature, not a Tesla-commerce integration, not a tangible DOGE settlement rail. Markets have learned to differentiate between tone and transaction. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19862.

Within minutes, XRP wiped out over 50% of its value, dropping down to $0.77 before partially rebounding, marking one of its steepest intraday losses in history. While early reports blamed political tensions following US President Donald Trump’s sudden tariff on Chinese imports , data now suggests that the crash was amplified by a major glitch in Binance’s internal pricing system, and other contributing technical factors. Catalysts Behind The XRP Price Crash And Crypto And Bitcoin Meltdown Between October 10 and 11, XRP experienced a violent flash crash on Binance , plunging over 54% in a single 30-minute candle. In less than 24 hours, over a million traders were also liquidated. This unprecedented drop came during what analysts are now calling “the worst crypto liquidation event in crypto history,” with nearly $19.3 billion in open positions wiped out in a single day. At first, much of the blame was directed at Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese tech imports , which triggered a wave of panic across global risk assets. However, the XRP and broader market collapse went far beyond normal macro-driven volatility. On-chain analysts traced the sequence to a $60 million spot market dump on Binance, which set off an internal pricing malfunction . Binance’s oracle system, which marks collateral values such as wBETH, BNSOL, and USDe, momentarily failed, possibly leading to forced liquidations across XRP and other major crypto assets. This oracle mispricing allegedly turned a $60 million order into a $19 billion loss. XRP, being one of Binance’s most heavily leveraged assets, absorbed a significant amount of the impact as margin calls liquidated thousands of positions within minutes. A whale had reportedly opened $1 billion in short positions just before the Trump tariff announcement, adding more suspicion and fuel to the collapse. Binance later confirmed abnormal pricing and paid $283 million in restitution, but the damage to XRP and the broader market was already done. A Deeper Dive Into The Market-Wide Crash Analysts say that the root cause of the $19 billion crypto market crash was Binance’s “Unified Account” system, which priced collateral using internal data instead of decentralized oracles. Between October 6 and 14, Binance was transitioning to oracle-based pricing, creating an exploitable 8-day gap. During that period, coordinated actors reportedly dumped $60 million to $90 million in USDe exclusively on Binance, driving its price to $0.65 while it stayed near $1 on other exchanges. This artificial depeg within Binance’s system triggered widespread panic, as attackers were said to hold $1.1 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum shorts on decentralized exchanges, profiting about $192 million as prices plunged. Analysts noted that Ethena’s USDe remained fully collateralized on all other exchanges, proving that the issue allegedly stemmed from Binance’s infrastructure, not the stablecoin. The combination of technical flaws, alleged manipulation , and tariff-driven fear transformed a contained exploit into a market-wide catastrophe. Despite the chaos, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about XRP’s recovery , predicting a strong rally to new ATHs soon.",XRP|binance|BNSOL|Ethena|ripple|USDe|wBETH|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 02:00:50

The new products will feature 160 GB of LPDDR5X onboard memory, characterized by relatively low power consumption. The tech company said the new inference-optimized Data Center GPU will utilize its Xe3P Celestial microarchitecture once it hits the market in the second half of next year. Intel acknowledged that its Xe3P architecture is a performance-enhanced version of the Xe3 architecture used in the Core Ultra 300-series ‘Panther Lake’ processors for laptops and compact desktops. The architecture will also be featured for clients on a next-gen Arc family, the Arc C-Series. Crescent Island supports a number of data types Intel $INTC just officially introduced its new Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island pic.twitter.com/1DNYUjH9Du — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 14, 2025 According to Intel’s report, the Crescent Island GPU will support a flurry of data types relevant for inference workloads and cloud providers. The tech firm didn’t mention the estimated performance of the product, but there are still some hints in Intel’s press release. The 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory suggests the use of multiple LPDDR5X devices, as it’s significantly more than one typically expects from a graphics card. The Crescent Island GPU could use an LPDDR5X DRAM IC, which features two 16-bit channels, so its total interface width is 32 bits. The highest-capacity LPDDR5X chip is 32 GB (8 GB), meaning that 20 such chips are required to equip a graphics card with 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Other companies, such as Nvidia and AMD, use top-grade HBM memory for their data centers, including HBM3E. They are also already discussing HBM4 for next-gen parts, such as Rubin and MI400. Intel revealed that Crescent Island will be air-cooled and cost-optimized. The tech company is currently working to refine its open-source software stack for the new data center by utilizing current-generation Arc Pro B-Series GPUs. The initiative follows the firm’s currently ongoing enhancements for the Arc Pro B-Series, including the ongoing Project Battlematrix Linux driver improvements, the Intel Compute Runtime, and the Intel Xe Linux driver. The tech firm unveiled its Arc Pro family in May this year at Computex 2025, which it said has larger memory configurations and expanded software support. Intel unveiled the graphics processing units for workstations and AI inference, marking 40 years of collaboration with local ecosystem partners in Taipei, Taiwan. “For the past 40 years, the power of our partnership with the Taiwan ecosystem has fueled innovation that has changed our world for the better. This week, we are renewing our commitment to our partners as we work to build a new Intel for the future. Together, we will create great products that delight our customers.” – Lip-Bu Tan , CEO of Intel. On October 9, the tech firm also highlighted Xeon 6+ (Clearwater Forest), Intel’s first server processor based on the 18A process. The processor is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2026. Intel unveils details for its Panther Lake processor Intel also revealed new architectural details for its upcoming Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processor, code-named Panther Lake. The new processor will be the first product built on Intel’s 18A, the firm’s most advanced semiconductor processor, and the first of its kind to be manufactured in the U.S. The firm stated that it anticipates the chips to begin shipping this year as it continues to make efforts to reassert its leadership in high-performance computing and advanced manufacturing. Intel said it’s producing both processors and future 18A-based products at Fab 52, its new state-of-the-art facility in Chandler, Arizona. The firm confirmed that the facility is now fully operational and on track to achieve high-volume production of 18A chips later this year. The tech firm has invested more than $20 million into the new fab and hopes it will produce its chips in the U.S. for the first time in nearly a decade. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Nikkei reported Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) will gain powers to probe suspicious crypto trades. Under the plan, it can recommend surcharge orders and refer serious violations for criminal prosecution. This marks a major shift, as insider trading rules under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act currently do not apply to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Services Agency, which oversees the SESC, plans to finalize the rules through a working group by the end of the year. After that, it aims to submit amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act during the next regular parliamentary session. Japan Moves Toward Stricter Crypto Oversight Beyond Industry Self-Regulation Currently, exchanges and the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) are expected to self-regulate. However, critics note that the transaction monitoring system remains inadequate, leaving room for unfair practices. BREAKING: Japan's top financial regulator will introduce regulations to ban insider trading of cryptocurrencies, per Nikkei. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) October 15, 2025 Under the proposed framework, the FIEA will clearly ban trading cryptocurrencies based on nonpublic or undisclosed information. Next, the FSA will issue detailed guidelines to explain which behaviors fall under this rule. For example, it may cover trades made using private knowledge about a token’s upcoming listing. Similarly, acting on information about an exchange’s security flaw before it becomes public would also likely count as a violation. Defining Crypto Insiders Remains Complex As Many Tokens Lack Clear Issuers Japan faces a distinct challenge as many cryptocurrencies lack a clear issuer, making it difficult to determine who qualifies as an insider. This ambiguity has kept enforcement in crypto largely untested compared with traditional securities. In Asia, the push for clearer rules around digital assets has gained momentum. Japan now stands out, having recorded on-chain value received growth of 120% year-on-year as of June 2025, outpacing South Korea, India and Vietnam. Forecasts Point To 19M Japanese Crypto Holders By Year-End Crypto adoption in Japan is rising fast. As of May 2025, about 12.41m Japanese owned cryptocurrencies. That’s roughly 15% of adults, up from 9.17m the previous year. Meanwhile, forecasts suggest the number could reach 19.43m by year’s end. Clearer regulations and growing institutional participation are driving this growth. As a result, pressure is mounting on the government to act. Policymakers now face the task of shaping rules that balance innovation with investor protection. If successful, a transparent and trustworthy regulatory framework could help crypto shed its image as a risky frontier and evolve into a credible investment class in Japan.

After Friday’s massive crash, which wiped out billions in leveraged positions, bulls are struggling to regain control and establish a stable recovery. The broader market remains cautious, as traders weigh whether the current level can hold or if another wave of selling could push prices lower. Despite the pressure, some analysts see potential signs of resilience if Bitcoin can maintain support in this zone. According to top analyst Maartunn, recent on-chain activity reveals an important shift in market behavior. Over the last 24 hours, Short-Term Holders (STHs) have sent 46,524 BTC to exchanges, signaling active repositioning after the latest downturn. Such behavior often marks a short-term reset, allowing the market to absorb profit-taking and capitulation simultaneously. As Bitcoin hovers around key support, holding this range could determine whether the market is preparing for stabilization or another leg down. Bitcoin Enters New Phase As Market Seeks Direction According to Maartunn, the latest on-chain data reveals a critical rebalancing phase among Short-Term Holders (STHs) following the recent market crash. In the past 24 hours, these investors sent 46,524 BTC to exchanges, marking one of the largest movements in recent weeks. Of that total, 32,279 BTC were sent in profit, while 14,245 BTC were moved at a loss. This pattern reflects a market dynamic in which some investors are locking in gains after the latest recovery attempt, while others are cutting losses to reduce exposure amid uncertainty. Maartunn notes that such activity is typical in the aftermath of sharp corrections. It often signals the process of cleansing excess leverage and emotional trading — an essential step toward restoring equilibrium in the market. This type of rebalancing phase usually precedes the formation of a short-term or mid-term bottom, as selling pressure from both profit-takers and panic sellers gets absorbed by stronger hands. The coming days will be decisive in determining whether Bitcoin can stabilize near the $110,000–$112,000 range and build the foundation for a recovery. If the price holds, it could indicate that the market has found a sustainable floor, paving the way for renewed accumulation and confidence among investors. However, a breakdown below this zone could reignite fear and lead to another round of liquidations. Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading near $110,800, testing a crucial support zone after failing to hold above the $115,000–$116,000 resistance range. The 12-hour chart shows that BTC continues to struggle with downward pressure following last week’s crash, as market sentiment remains fragile and volatility persists. The rejection from the $117,500 level — a major supply zone that has capped rallies since early September — triggered renewed selling, pushing the price back below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This breakdown highlights weakening short-term momentum, with the 200-day MA (red) now positioned near $111,000, acting as the last significant line of defense for bulls. If Bitcoin closes decisively below this level, it could signal a deeper correction toward $107,000–$108,000, an area of previous accumulation. On the other hand, maintaining support here could set the stage for a rebound attempt toward $114,000–$115,000, where the next resistance cluster sits. The chart reflects a neutral-to-bearish structure, with bulls needing a strong push to reclaim lost ground. The coming sessions will be crucial, as sustained weakness below moving averages could extend the consolidation phase — while a bounce from current levels might confirm short-term stabilization before any broader recovery.

Traders said the move followed a failure to hold above the $0.23–$0.24 range and a break below a short-term rising channel that had been supporting prices earlier in October. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Breaks 13-Year Silence, Moves $33 Million To Exchange Technical Weakness Deepens The price action on the daily chart points to weakening momentum. Dogecoin could not defend $0.22, and that breach opened the door to faster selling that sent the token to its lowest level in over three weeks. The 20-day and 50-day EMAs sit around $0.23 and are now acting as overhead resistance. The Parabolic SAR has flipped to a bearish signal, which many traders see as confirmation that the recent uptrend has paused. If buyers cannot steady the market above $0.20, a deeper drop may test the $0.17–$0.18 band — a zone where a lot of accumulation occurred in late summer. A clear break under that area would put the $0.12 handle back in focus. On the upside, reclaiming $0.22 would be the first sign buyers are trying to push prices back up and could open a move toward $0.25. On-Chain Flows Signal Caution According to exchange flow data, a sizable amount of DOGE left trading platforms on October 14. Reports show over close to $57 million exited exchanges that day. Heavy outflows like that are often seen when holders move tokens off exchanges to custody or when distribution is taking place, and in this case market participants interpreted the flows as more aligned with selling pressure than fresh buying. Social media buzz over Dogecoin’s prospects has not translated into sustained inflows, and the meme coin group as a whole has felt weaker in recent sessions. 🚨 DOGECOIN: House of Doge plans to list on NASDAQ through a merger with Brag House, holding 837M $DOGE and $50M in funding. https://t.co/4hb03BxD5u pic.twitter.com/134tmh3HKd — Tesla Model Ðoge (@TeslaModelDoge) October 13, 2025 House Of Doge Merger Draws Attention In the meantime, in light of recent volatility and disappointing overall market conditions, the House of Doge announced plans to merge with Brag House Holdings Inc., which aims to create a public vehicle in the Dogecoin ecosystem. The combination of the companies will reportedly have 837 million DOGE along with $50 million in cash for investments. The announcement briefly lifted sentiment online, but price gains were short-lived as broader market weakness weighed on the token. The merged group plans to pursue tokenization, yield products, and payment tools, and its backers say the plan could bring more institutional interest to Dogecoin.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might rise further toward the $4,350 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,020 levels. The price is trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,200. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,950 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price formed a base and was able to recover above the $4,000 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,290 swing high to the $3,890 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $4,120 pivot level. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,140 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,200 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,290 swing high to the $3,890 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,290 level. A clear move above the $4,290 resistance might send the price toward the $4,380 resistance. An upside break above the $4,380 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,200 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,000 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,880 zone. A clear move below the $3,880 support might push the price toward the $3,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,750 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,640.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-ledger-is-the-foundation-for-whats-next/,"Max Avery, a well-known figure in crypto and finance circles, recently shared his views on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its growing relevance in the evolving tokenization landscape. His comments provided a grounded perspective on what many XRP holders believe to be a significant turning point for the network. While the digital asset market continues to fluctuate, Avery’s remarks stand out for their focus on tangible growth rather than relying on speculation and investor optimism. Institutional Integration and Real Utility Avery stated that “every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use.” His point highlights a growing movement among blockchain projects to attract institutional adoption, but in XRP’s case, the focus is firmly on practical utility rather than speculation. Over the past few years, Ripple’s work with the XRPL has progressed steadily toward creating a framework capable of handling institutional-grade asset tokenization . As markets worldwide transition into the digital age, XRP is poised to dominate the emerging tokenization space. For XRP holders, the upside’s obvious. Every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use Ripple’s been focused on turning the XRPL into the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets with… — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) October 11, 2025 Ripple’s Infrastructure Vision Ripple has been positioning the XRPL as the infrastructure backbone for the digitization and tokenization of real-world assets, which is the next phase of global finance. According to Avery, Ripple’s focus is directed toward transforming the ledger into “the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets.” This statement aligns with the company’s long-term vision of embedding XRP within financial systems that require speed, compliance, and interoperability. What separates XRP from competing digital assets is its readiness for institutional use. The XRPL’s performance and scalability have been tested across multiple pilot programs and partnerships involving central bank digital currencies and tokenized commodities. These efforts have established a foundation that supports Avery’s perspective that the XRPL is not an experimental blockchain but one designed for real-world financial integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Perception and Institutional Reality Despite Ripple’s progress, skepticism continues to shape public perception of XRP. Much of the market still views it primarily through a speculative lens rather than as a piece of financial infrastructure. Avery’s comments address this disconnect, suggesting that many fail to see or acknowledge the progress taking place in real time. He noted that XRP’s next-generation infrastructure is already taking shape in real-time, emphasizing that adoption is not a distant goal but an active process underway. Institutional participation has quietly expanded in sectors such as cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Each new integration of the XRPL into real-world use cases strengthens its position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain systems .

According to CryptoQuant analyst COINDREAM, it means that short-term confidence has fallen following last week’s historic market crash. Market Metrics Signal Waning Confidence COINDREAM’s analysis revealed that three key indicators on Binance are flashing warning signs. First, the exchange’s funding rates for perpetual futures contracts have been negative for three days in a row, which hasn’t been a normal occurrence this year. “When the exchange with the largest derivatives trading volume shows bearish sentiment, it can have a negative impact on the overall market,” noted the expert. Secondly, he mentioned that the average number of deposits to the exchange is going up, according to a 7-day moving average. This increase in deposit volume is happening even as prices go down, leading the analyst to conclude that more downward pressure could emerge if the movement fails to find support from strong demand. The third and maybe most telling metric is the percentage of market sell orders, which is quite high. Usually, the sell volume goes down near price bottoms and shoots above 0.52 around market tops. Given that the Binance market sell ratio is over the 0.52 mark even after last week’s big price drops, the observer said it could mean that selling sentiment among traders on the platform is becoming stronger. Recovery Stalls Amid Uncertainty in the Economy The current cautious stance should come as no surprise, given the crypto market just experienced its worst liquidation event in history on October 10. The downturn took more than $19 billion from the market, affecting more than 1.6 million traders. Even though platforms like Binance have since compensated affected users and markets have made up some of their losses, many observers viewed the event as a big reset. One of them, Doctor Profit, said that the extreme leverage that had been built in the system has now been taken away, putting both bulls and bears on a more equal footing. However, the shift in Binance’s trader behavior suggests that many remain cautious about re-entering the market too soon. Bitcoin and most major altcoins have bounced back a little, but they are still far below where they were before the crash. Crypto commentators now say the next directional cue will be based on broader economic indicators, like how U.S. stocks will perform in the near future.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.47 Market Cap $1.87B Trading Volume $84.95M Circulating Supply 539.22M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.63 24-h Low $3.39 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.36% 14-Day RSI 38.97 50-Day SMA $4.61 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 38 (Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.31 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish below $3.50, with weak momentum. The coin’s supports sit at $3.30 and $3.11, while upside resistance lies near $3.95–$4.10. A break above $3.60 could trigger a short-lived recovery, but sentiment remains cautious. ICP 1-day price analysis ICP’s daily chart for October 15 shows a soft bearish continuation following rejection around $3.55, with the current price at $3.47, down 1.67%. The Bollinger Bands are compressing between the lower band at $3.11 and the upper resistance at $4.11, indicating reduced volatility but also a possible breakout soon. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram stays slightly negative, with both the signal and MACD lines below zero, signaling weak buying pressure. The RSI stands at 41.77, indicating a slight oversold condition but not yet showing strong accumulation. If ICP drops below $3.40, it could retest $3.20–$3.11, while recovery above $3.70 may open a push toward $4.10. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP continues to range between $3.46 and $3.58 with limited direction. The Alligator indicator is flattening, with all three lines converging near the current price, signaling market indecision and likely upcoming volatility. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD shows mild bullish attempts, hovering around the zero line, but the weak crossover suggests bulls are losing grip. Volume remains steady near 16.5 million, reflecting a lack of conviction for a larger move. If ICP reclaims $3.58–$3.60, short-term buyers could push toward $3.70, but a break below $3.42 would likely trigger selling down to $3.30.

Unless the price breaks firmly above $3.60, the trend remains vulnerable, and a further decline toward $3.30 or even $3.10 is likely. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

Henry Aguda, the government is taking concrete steps to test whether blockchain can make the Philippine national budget more open and traceable. He told the Malacañang Press Corps that a working prototype will be shown to senators and representatives to prove the idea can work. The move comes as lawmakers push a bill that would put budget documents and transaction records on a distributed ledger for public verification. DICT Moves To Build Prototype Aguda said the country has “a lot of experts on blockchain,” and that one of his tasks is to provide a minimum viable product so lawmakers can see a live demo before any full rollout. He also mentioned that the DICT has been experimenting with stablecoin systems to trace peso transactions in banks. Reports say he will ask President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to certify the related bill as urgent, signaling that the executive branch may press for faster action. Senate Bill 1330, titled the “Philippine National Budget Blockchain Act,” would require the executive branch, Congress, and local governments to upload and publish their budget transactions on a blockchain . If enacted, citizens would be able to follow allocations, bids, disbursements, and contracts on a publicly visible chain. The bill also aims to borrow features from the Full Disclosure Bill so people can compare contracts and expense reports. On Transparency & Security At a Senate hearing on SB1330, the Committee on Science and Technology discussed how blockchain might help expose delays or anomalies in spending. Sen. Bam Aquino told the panel that placing records on a public ledger could make budget processes “transparent, honest, and secure.” Advocates say the visible chain would let ordinary citizens track where funds move and spot mismatches faster than current systems allow. Legal Expert Casts Doubt On Blockchain Budget Push Not everyone is sold on the idea. Florin Hilbay, former Solicitor General and now dean at Silliman University College of Law, asked plainly: “Do we really need to put the budget on a blockchain?” He warned that what starts as a promise of openness could turn into a centralized database held on a few servers run by contractors. Hilbay also pointed to cost concerns, saying the plan allocates PhP500 million ($8.6 million) as an initial expense, and he argued that smart contracts and validator nodes add complexity and new technical risks. Aguda said the DICT will not tap public funds for the prototype and that private groups have already offered help.

After a period of correction, technical indicators, structural signals, and price action now suggest the potential for a renewed bullish move. Ethereum Slips Below Key $4,060 Support Ted, in a recent update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum has slipped below its crucial $4,060 support level, a move that may hint at a short-term bearish phase for the asset. This breakdown has drawn traders’ attention to lower support regions, as Ethereum’s next moves will likely determine whether the market stabilizes or faces further pressure. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Price Might Have Reached ‘Wave 4’ Bottom — Path To $5,000? According to Ted, the next major support sits around $3,800, a level that has recently served as a strong demand zone. If Ethereum fails to defend this region, it could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $3,400–$3,600 range, where a stronger accumulation phase might form. Such a decline would likely shake out weak hands and allow for a more sustainable base to build upon for the next major move. However, Ted also noted a possible bullish scenario where Ethereum could reclaim the $4,060 and $4,250 levels. A successful recovery above these zones could confirm that the recent drop was merely a correction within a larger bullish structure, potentially paving the way for a powerful rally as the market regains confidence. Bullish Structure Confirmed As ETH Holds Key Demand Zone According to Nadezhada on X, Ethereum’s chart is looking increasingly bullish, showing signs of strength after recent market movements. The analyst noted that a Break of Structure (BOS) has been confirmed, signaling that Ethereum may be preparing for its next significant upward move. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Bullish After Multi-Year Breakout — $7,000 May Be Imminent Nadezhada highlighted a key demand zone between $3,910 and $3,800, which aligns with both a Fair Value Gap (FVG) and an Order Block (OB) on the chart. This area represents a strong region of buyer interest, where liquidity could build up. Thus, maintaining stability within this zone may set the foundation for the next rally. If Ethereum manages to hold the $3,910–$3,800 support area, Nadezhada believes it could act as a springboard for a sharp move toward $4,550 and beyond. Such a rebound would mark a strong continuation of the broader uptrend, with buyers firmly back in control. The crypto analyst concluded by emphasizing that buyers appear to be positioning for the next leg higher, as technical signals continue to align in their favor. With structure, demand, and sentiment converging, Ethereum seems ready to attempt another breakout if market conditions remain supportive.

In the following lines, we will raise the alarm about the latest threat that users should stay alert for. Scammers Drain Wallets The X account Shibarium Trustwatch recently warned that scammers have created a malicious website impersonating Shiba Inu’s official platform. The fake one includes “special” promotions and false claims of partnerships and presale bonuses whose goal is to lure people into connecting their wallets. “Once connected, the site can initiate unauthorised transactions and drain your assets,” the team behind the X account alerted. Shiba Inu users are advised to rely only on the official website of the project, where they can find trustworthy information about the whole ecosystem. They should never connect their wallets to unknown sites, double-check URLs, and report suspicious activity. But that’s not all. Scammers have also spread to popular social media and messaging applications like Discord, Telegram, and X. “Their goal? To trick unsuspecting holders into connecting wallets, sharing seed phrases, or clicking malicious links,” Shibarium Trustwatch stated. The Previous Threat Earlier this month, the team issued another warning related to a malicious Shiba Inu airdrop. It revealed that real SHIB tokens have been distributed to some users’ wallets; however, malicious actors have attached a deceptive message urging people to visit a suspicious website to claim rewards. This was a classic example of a phishing scam. “The token itself may be valid, but the message is designed to lure users into connecting their wallets to a fake site,” Shibarium Trustwatch said. As usual, the team provided some vital steps that users must follow to stay safe. These measures include verifying all token activity through Shiba Inu’s official channels, disregarding embedded messages in token names and airdrops, and avoiding unknown websites that promote such offers.

The price is now showing positive signs and could aim for more gains above the $2.620 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.60 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh surge if it clears the $2.60 resistance. XRP Price Set To Surge? XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.220, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.320 and $2.40 levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the bears are still active near the $2.60 and $2.620 levels. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.60 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level and the trend line. The main hurdle could be near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low at $2.660. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.750 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.50 level. The next major support is near the $2.420 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.420 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.250 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.50 and $2.420.

In his video, he highlighted XRP’s brief fall below $2 before rebounding, and he believes the way investors reacted during the drop is a key signal for what may come next. According to the analyst, “panic was driven by derivatives liquidations, not investors selling,” as XRP’s exchange supply remained nearly unchanged throughout the event. This stability in exchange reserves indicates that long-term holders maintained confidence during the downturn. The analyst emphasized that the crash appeared to be largely technical, not driven by large-scale selling. This observation aligns with his interpretation of the gray line on the chart, representing XRP’s exchange supply, which showed no notable decline while prices fell sharply. I HAVE VERY CRAZY NEWS FOR #XRP TODAY!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/OXalJoiAFK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 13, 2025 Technical Signals Suggest Recovery Potential Steph also revisited a bearish divergence that developed on XRP’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) since late 2023. The pattern, where prices made higher highs while RSI formed lower highs, suggested weakening momentum and preceded the recent decline. He noted a similar situation occurred between 2020 and 2021, leading to a steep fall followed by a strong rebound of about 170%. Based on that historical pattern, he believes another major recovery could be underway. He compared XRP’s current position to its behavior during the 2021 bull run, when the price dropped precisely to the 50-week simple moving average before rallying. Steph pointed out that XRP once again touched this same level during the latest sell-off . If the weekly candle closes above the moving average, he argued, the market could be positioned for a significant upside move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch for Confirmation The analyst also discussed the importance of XRP’s reaction to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, often seen as a critical support zone. He noted that the recent crash reached this level with near-perfect accuracy and believes this move may mark the end of the correction phase. Steph identified $2.72 as a decisive resistance point. A sustained break above that level would confirm a shift toward bullish continuation . On the daily chart, XRP remains below the EMA ribbons. This means the market still carries residual bearish momentum. However, he added that the daily RSI has now dipped into oversold territory, a condition that has historically signaled strong recovery phases for XRP. He cited past examples in 2022 and 2023 where similar RSI readings led to double-bottom formations and eventual rallies. Steph concluded that “either the bottom is in or we are very close to the bottom,” suggesting that current holders could benefit from patience as momentum gradually rebuilds.

DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears $0.2180. DOGE price started a fresh upward move above $0.20 and $0.2050. The price is trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1980 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for more gains if it remains stable above $0.1880. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Upside Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1880, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.20 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2050 and $0.2120. A high was formed at $0.2182 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.1787 swing low to the $0.2182 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1980 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2085 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2120 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2180 level. A close above the $0.2180 resistance might send the price toward $0.2320. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2620. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2120 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.20 level. The next major support is near the $0.1980 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.1880. If there is a downside break below the $0.1880 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1720 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1980 and $0.1880.

Operating under the mayor’s administration, it aims to coordinate blockchain innovation across city agencies, enhance public understanding of digital assets, and draw world-class talent to New York’s expanding tech ecosystem. This comes as the Mayor recently announced that he is leaving his re-election bid. The race will now likely be between Democrat Zohran Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. In a post last month, Adams said, “Despite all we’ve achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign.”Data from public opinion polls showed that Adams had been running far behind Mamdani and Cuomo, who were contesting as independents. The polls indicated Mamdani has a sizeable lead before the November 4 election in the most populous city in the United States. New York City builds a blockchain office to drive innovation and growth Mayor Eric Adams announced the establishment of the new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain, which will help New York become a global leader in digital assets and demonstrate the city’s readiness to welcome the future. “Our first-in-the-nation Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain will help make us the global capital of digital assets.” He added that such new technology will create more jobs, bring new investment, and build new opportunities for people from every background. The city’s Chief Technology Officer, Matt Fraser, will lead the office as it collaborates with the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation and fosters strong partnerships with private companies, investors, and community groups. The office will connect the city government and the digital assets industry, enabling businesses to share their ideas and challenges directly with policymakers. It will also teach people about digital assets and help them understand how to use them safely. The office will run public education campaigns to help New Yorkers understand the risks and benefits of digital currencies clearly and straightforwardly. It will teach residents how to protect their wallets, spot fake websites or messages, and avoid common online fraud. This educational effort will also support financial inclusion, as it will reach communities that have been traditionally excluded from banking services. Mayor Adams said he wants New York City to lead by example and demonstrate to the world how technology can serve people, rather than replace them. Mayor Adams picks Moises Rendon to lead the new digital assets office Mayor Eric Adams picked Moises Rendon as the first executive director of New York City’s new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain. Rendon has been part of the city’s Office of Technology and Innovation since 2024. He has also spent many years collaborating with international organizations, government agencies, and private companies to develop fair and modern regulations for the expanding digital finance sector. Rendon said he feels deeply honored to take on this new role and called it a “historic moment for New York City.” He explained that the office is about helping people understand and benefit from new technology. One of the first major steps he will take as the head of the office is to establish a new commission composed of experts who will advise the city on its strategy regarding digital assets. Their task will be to debate ideas, share insights, and ensure that the city’s policies enable progress while safeguarding people’s safety and privacy. The task group will also examine how blockchain can be utilized in government services, including maintaining records in a secure and accessible manner, enhancing public information access, and facilitating faster payments for SMEs.

Georgieva argued that financial systems should adapt to this transformation rather than resist it and manage risks. The IMF issued significant warnings to central banks in its latest assessment. The institution emphasized the need to be vigilant against inflation risks stemming from customs duties and emphasized the need to avoid excessive easing of monetary policy. The IMF warned that such easing could lead to further increases in risky asset prices. Related News: Binance Responds to Claims of Altcoin Dumping and Listing Fee Demands The statement noted that central bank independence is critical to balancing market expectations and ensuring institutions effectively fulfill their mandates. However, the IMF did not name any countries or institutions in this assessment. The agency also called for “urgent fiscal adjustment” to control budget deficits and maintain the resilience of bond markets. The IMF report also warned that increasing linkages between banks and less regulated non-financial institutions could exacerbate shocks in areas like private credit and cryptocurrencies. The IMF urged policymakers to assess these “hidden risks” more comprehensively and, in particular, closely monitor risk pass-through between banks and non-bank financial institutions. *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade went live on the Sepolia testnet. The upgrade raises the block gas limit and introduces PeerDAS technology, and is expected to prepare the network for its mainnet launch in December. Ethereum Could Hit $10K BitMine chair Tom Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes are holding firm on their bullish Ethereum predictions. They maintain that the cryptocurrency will reach $10,000 before the end of the year despite a turbulent market and less than three months remaining in 2025. On the Bankless podcast , Lee said he expects Ethereum to land somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000, while Hayes is confident in a $10,000 target. He said he intends to “stay consistent” with his forecast. With Ethereum currently trading around $4,094, the projection represents a potential 140+% gain, which is a bold call given the market’s recent volatility. Lee argued that such a move will not be irrational exuberance but rather a natural progression after years of consolidation. He described Ethereum as having been “basing” since 2021, and pointed out that it spent almost four years in a wide range after peaking at $4,878 that year. According to Lee, Ethereum’s recent price action shows it just broke out of that long-term range, paving the way for what he calls “price discovery at a new level.” He added that while a move to $10,000 will be a major milestone, it would likely not be the ultimate top for Ethereum, but rather a “happy level” on the path to future growth. Hayes and Lee’s forecasts were made shortly after a sharp market crash that wiped out over $19 billion in leveraged positions across the crypto landscape. Ethereum has since shown resilience by recovering from around $4,350 before the drop to just below $4,100. However, historical data paints a more modest picture. Ethereum quarterly returns (Source: CoinGlass ) According to CoinGlass , Ethereum’s average return in the fourth quarter since 2016 stands at 21.36%. If that pattern holds, Ethereum could end the year near $5,000 — which is still far below Hayes and Lee’s projection. Other analysts, including Tesseract CEO James Harris and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, are also optimistic. Harris predicted a year-end target near $6,500 and van de Poppe suggested the ETH/BTC pair’s recent drop offers an ideal setup for a push toward new highs. Fusaka Upgrade Hits Ethereum Testnet Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade successfully went live on the Sepolia testnet, which is a huge milestone in the network’s mission to boost scalability and efficiency. This activation is the second stage of a three-phase rollout, following the earlier deployment on the Holesky testnet on Oct. 1. Developers are now stress testing Fusaka’s enhanced data-availability system and higher block gas limits before moving to the final Hoodi testnet later this month. Once complete, the upgrade is expected to pave the way for a mainnet release in December. The Fusaka roadmap introduces several performance and consensus improvements that are designed to make Ethereum faster and more capable of handling complex activity. A key feature of the upgrade is the planned increase of the block gas limit to 60 million, which will enable each block to process more transactions and smart contract operations. (Source: Datawallet ) Ethereum developers are using Sepolia to evaluate whether nodes can handle this higher capacity without compromising stability or network security. Gabriel Trintinalia , a protocol engineer at Consensys and a core developer for the Besu client, said that the client teams worked extensively to make sure the current node setups can manage the heavier load of 60 million gas blocks without triggering instability. Another major innovation under Fusaka is Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), a new system that allows validators to verify transaction data by sampling small portions from multiple peers instead of downloading all the data themselves. This greatly reduces the data burden on nodes and improves scalability and maintaining decentralization. Paul Harris, a core developer at Consensys’ Teku client, explained that PeerDAS is a fundamental shift in how Ethereum handles data availability as it allows scaling “beyond what was possible before.” (Source: Datawallet ) The Ethereum Foundation announced the Fusaka testnet rollout plan in late September, and described this upgrade as the next step after the Pectra update earlier this year. Pectra introduced new functionality for externally owned accounts, raised the validator staking limit, and expanded data capacity per block. It followed other key milestones, including Dencun in March of 2024, and The Merge in 2022, which transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 05:30:00

Representative Troy Downing presented the draft bill before the House Financial Services Committee, aiming to codify Executive Order 14330 and give it lasting legal authority. The move, first reported by Politico, would mark a significant step toward integrating digital assets into mainstream retirement investment options. Trump’s Executive Order on Retirement Options Executive Order 14330, signed by Trump on August 7, directs that every American planning for retirement should have access to funds that include “alternative assets” when deemed suitable by a fiduciary overseeing the plan. The order defines alternative assets broadly — including private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure projects, lifetime income strategies, and digital assets through actively managed investment vehicles. Although executive orders set federal priorities, they do not carry the permanence of law and can be overturned by subsequent administrations or court rulings. To make such policies enduring, Congress must pass a bill approved by both chambers and have it signed into law. Legislative Push Continues Despite Shutdown Despite an ongoing government shutdown, Congress remains able to introduce and debate new legislation. Trump’s executive order also instructed the Department of Labor, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Treasury Secretary to review and prioritize new guidance for 401(k) plans within six months. The goal is to expand access to diversified retirement investment strategies, including exposure to digital and alternative assets. Expanding Crypto Access for Retirement The initiative to include digital assets in US retirement accounts has been building momentum throughout 2025. Earlier this year, the Department of Labor withdrew Biden-era guidance warning fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” about including crypto in retirement portfolios. In September, shortly after Trump’s executive order took effect, nine lawmakers sent a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins urging faster implementation. They argued that doing so could “help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.” According to data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI), Americans held $9.3 trillion in 401(k) assets as of June 30, 2025 — highlighting the potential scale of impact if digital assets become a standard investment option. Industry Divided on Crypto’s Role in 401(k)s The proposal has sparked debate among financial experts. Critics warn that crypto’s volatility could endanger retirement savings, while supporters see it as an important step toward financial modernization. André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, told Cointelegraph in August that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US retirement plans “could mark a major step for Bitcoin adoption and attract billions in new capital.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-15 05:35:27

The people who noticed the structure, vision, and timing back then became the early winners. Today, many investors watching the crypto charts are asking why is crypto going up again after the $20B liquidations. The answer might soon include a name that keeps coming up in growing circles — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This project, now in its Phase 6 presale, is being seen by some analysts as the next major success story before the next bull wave begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the type of ecosystem that attracts both retail users and professional investors. Its mix of lending innovation, stablecoin design, and strong technical roots gives it a real use case. The ongoing presale has already raised around $17.35 million across earlier phases. Phase 6 is moving fast, with 68% of the 170 million tokens already sold at a price of $0.035. The next step is $0.040, which means a 15% price jump is near. With over 17,100 holders already joining, the community is forming even before any potential exchange exposure begins. The total supply stands at 4 billion MUTM, showing strong participation in a short time. Post launch some of the experts have predicted that this project will go beyond a 1,000% level because of the utility embedded and real use case delivery in fast Layer-2 and CertiK approved environments. The lending engine that builds constant demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will power a new lending and borrowing model that keeps funds moving on-chain. Its design includes two connected parts: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. Together, these two areas are expected to make the protocol’s ecosystem active and liquid. In the P2C side, lenders will deposit assets such as USDT or ETH into audited smart contracts. These pools will make it easy for others to borrow. Once lenders deposit, they will receive mtTokens in return, like mtUSDT, which represent their pool share. As borrowing grows, these mtTokens will earn interest, giving lenders an attractive annual yield. For example, a lender adding $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT one-to-one and will earn around 15% yearly returns. Borrowers will join from the other side. They will post collateral, like ETH, and borrow up to 75% of its value. Suppose a borrower posts $1,000 in ETH; they will unlock around $750 to use, depending on the asset’s loan-to-value (LTV). The platform will use automatic liquidations and stability checks to protect both sides. The first version of this protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, starting with ETH and USDT assets. This version will include key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operations. These practical features will give users a chance to experience the platform before the full launch. As users explore and gain confidence in the system, investor interest is likely to grow, potentially increasing demand and pushing the token’s price higher than expected. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also building its own decentralized stablecoin, pegged to $1. This coin will only be created when users borrow against assets like ETH and will be burned once loans are repaid. Each issuer will have capped limits, and borrowing rates will adjust through governance to help the stablecoin hold its peg. For example, when the stablecoin trades below $1, rates will rise to balance it. This design will create steady, long-term borrowing demand and turn Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a working financial network rather than just a trading token. Strong technical framework and anticipated listings Behind every fast-growing crypto project is a reliable pricing and security system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, and DEX-based time-weighted prices (TWAPs) to ensure accurate valuations for assets. This will reduce risk for lenders, keep liquidations fair, and make the protocol safer. When investors feel secure, they lock more capital. That means higher liquidity, more borrowing, and more rewards for those who stake mtTokens. This steady loop of activity is what turns a project into a long-term ecosystem. The excitement around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also connects to possible exchange listings after the presale. History shows that tokens like Solana and Polygon saw massive jumps — between 700% and 1,200% — within months of their first exchange listings. A well-known crypto analyst, who accurately called Bitcoin’s 2017 rally, expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach around $0.60 from its projected listing region near $0.06. That would be a 1,000% gain — the kind of growth early investors dream of when scanning the crypto charts for the next mover. The community building team is also running an active giveaway. A new update has been out for the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user in the top position will receive a $500 MUTM reward, provided they make at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC every day. Final verdict People are once again asking why crypto is going up as the crypto market comes back to life after the recent crash. A lot of people currently think that the next wave will be led by projects that have meaningful use cases and long-term demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has functional technology, stablecoin mechanics, a way to make actual money, and a clear plan for when it will be released. The timing is really important because Phase 6 is already 68% done and the price is about to go up to $0.040. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its early stages, just like Bitcoin was years ago. It’s a peaceful time until everyone notices. The focus will swiftly shift when the exchange listings come out. For those who are paying attention, this is the time before the crowd knows what’s being built.

This relief rally was primarily driven by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and positive corporate earnings in the U.S. Investors were comforted by Powell's remarks on Tuesday, where he acknowledged the U.S. economy's ""firmer footing"" but raised a caution about a ""notably softer labor market."" Despite the rally, sentiment remains fragile due to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, after President Trump threatened Beijing with a cooking oil embargo in response to China’s soybean boycott. Meanwhile, the euro advanced after France proposed suspending major pension reforms, while the yen strengthened as traders unwound the “Takaichi trade.” Adding to the optimism, the IMF raised South Korea’s 2025 growth forecast to 0.9%, citing a smaller-than-expected impact from recent US tariff measures and resilience in exports. Silver climbed back above $52 per ounce on Wednesday, holding close to record highs hit in the prior session as a global supply crunch fueled a historic rally. Gold prices climbed to around $4,180 per ounce on Wednesday, extending its bullish run to notch a fresh record. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.71% to above 47,000 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.8% to 3,160 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 151 per dollar on Wednesday, rising for the second straight session as markets remain uncertain whether ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader Sanae Takaichi will become the next prime minister following the coalition split with the Komeito party. Opposition parties are also holding talks today to secure enough backing to form a new government. Japan’s industrial production contracted 1.5% month-over-month in August 2025, steeper than the flash data of a 1.2% fall, which was also July's figure. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.49% to above 3,870, while the Shenzhen Component advanced 0.9% to 13,000 on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, and the offshore yuan rose to around 7.12 per dollar on Wednesday, snapping a three-session decline, as the People’s Bank of China reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining currency stability. China's consumer prices dropped 0.3% y/y in September 2025 , steeper than market estimates of a 0.1% decline but slightly less than a 0.4% fall in the previous month. Meanwhile, China’s producer prices fell 2.3% year-on-year in September 2025, easing from a 2.9% drop in the previous month. In a separate release, Premier Li Qiang reiterated calls to boost consumption and curb unfair competition among businesses. On the trade front, sentiment remained cautious after President Trump threatened Beijing with a cooking oil embargo in response to China’s soybean boycott. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.35% to 25,774 around noon on Wednesday, snapping a seven-session losing streak amid broad strength across sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.53% to 82,361 in morning trade on Wednesday, snapping a two-day losing streak. The International Monetary Fund has raised India’s growth forecast to 6.6% from 6.4% for FY2025/26, as the country’s strong growth momentum is expected to offset the impact of high US tariffs on Indian goods. Domestic sentiment was also boosted by India’s headline inflation data for September, which came in below the RBI's target range, raising hopes of a rate cut at the December policy meeting. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.03% climbed 0.9% to above 8,975 on Wednesday, marking its strongest daily gain in almost two weeks. The Australian dollar appreciated to around $0.650 on Wednesday, recovering some of the prior session’s losses. Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter noted that recent economic data has been slightly stronger than anticipated, indicating inflation in the third quarter may exceed earlier forecasts. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia was unchanged in September 2025, following a 0.1% decline in the previous month. Reserve Bank of New Zealand Chief Economist Paul Conway said the official cash rate of 2.5% is at the lower end of the neutral range, but the MPC remains open to further rate cuts if necessary. In the U.S. on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors balanced mostly positive bank earnings, Federal Reserve comments, and ongoing US-China trade tensions U.S. stock futures stabilized on Wednesday after the major averages swung sharply in the previous session: Dow +0.30% ; S&P 500 +0.46% ; Nasdaq +0.67% .

Analysts compare $0.035 coin to ETH’s 2018 levels,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/15/next-big-crypto-analysts-compare-0-035-coin-to-eths-2018-levels/,"In 2018, Ethereum was trading under $100 while most traders dismissed it as another fading altcoin. Yet behind the scenes, it was building the foundation for decentralized finance. Years later, that same “undervalued phase” turned early believers into millionaires. Analysts now see similar signs in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto protocol that is already developing a working lending ecosystem before its token even lists. With crypto prices today climbing across the market, this $0.035 presale is starting to look like Ethereum’s 2018 moment all over again. There is a new update on the 24-hour leaderboard where each day, the highest-ranked user will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC daily. The undervalued window before takeoff Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with 68% already sold and more than 17,100 holders. The project has raised about $17.35 million across all phases. Once this phase closes, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7, signaling the final discounted window before listing. Investors are taking notice of the numbers — the data shows growing momentum, and the timing aligns perfectly with rising DeFi interest. The project’s design sets it apart from typical presale tokens. Mutuum is planning that it will launch its live protocol and token at the same time. This means that from day one, users will interact with real lending pools, interest-earning mtTokens, and on-chain transactions that generate real revenue. Analysts view this “dual launch” model as a game-changer because it gives instant liquidity and organic trading volume that most presales lack. A complete DeFi ecosystem in motion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate two lending models that blend scalability with personalization. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C), where users will deposit assets such as USDT or ETH into audited smart contracts. These deposits will supply liquidity for borrowers while generating passive income. When a user lends, they will receive mtTokens, which represent their share in the pool plus interest. For example, someone lending $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT 1:1 and may earn about $2,250 in interest per year at an average 15% APY. On the borrower side, Mutuum’s overcollateralized model will ensure system safety. A borrower posting $1,000 worth of BTC will be able to access up to 75% of that amount, depending on the asset’s Loan-to-Value ratio. This controlled framework keeps the protocol liquid even in volatile conditions, maintaining fair exposure limits. The second lending model, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), will cater to tokens outside main liquidity pools — such as meme or niche assets. Here, lenders and borrowers will agree on custom terms. It’s a flexible layer that expands access without compromising core stability. Together, these two models will allow Mutuum to scale like a major DeFi network while staying user-driven. Upon the full release, users will be able to experience the real lending, borrowing and staking on Layer-2 setup. The flawless quickly executed transactions appreciate more participation and hence more liquidity will flow within the platform. More circulation means more demand for MUTM which will help increase the price in the longer run. Real utility, buybacks, and growth Unlike many early tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will tie its token utility directly to on-chain activity. Every loan, repayment, liquidation, and staking action will create demand for MUTM. The platform’s future stablecoin — pegged to $1 and minted only against collateral — will enhance liquidity while supporting price stability. Revenue from the platform will fund open-market MUTM buybacks, and these repurchased tokens will be redistributed to stakers. This process works like dividends in traditional finance, rewarding holders with a continuous value flow. Stakers will earn MUTM rewards on their mtTokens, reinforcing a cycle of yield and buyback that strengthens the ecosystem’s tokenomics over time. Mutuum’s progress also extends to its upcoming launch of V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will feature the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot with assets like ETH and USDT. This testnet will mark a visible milestone in the project’s roadmap, confirming that its technology development is moving in sync with its token growth. ROI math that grabs attention Early investors are already seeing the value curve. Someone who purchased $10,000 worth of MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.015 now holds 667K tokens valued at $23.5K in Phase 6 — a 2.3x value gain before listing. When analysts apply their crypto predictions based on ETH’s early trajectory, the case becomes even stronger. If MUTM repeats Ethereum’s early multiplier effect, the same investment would soon be worth $233K at $0.35. That’s the kind of upside that defines early-stage opportunity. A rare blend of progress and incentive Security and transparency remain key strengths. Mutuum has completed its CertiK audit with a TokenScan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. It also maintains a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage ongoing security testing. Beyond that, an active $100,000 giveaway — with 10 winners set to receive $10,000 each in MUTM — further boosts community engagement and visibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that DeFi can combine innovation, audit-backed safety, and direct value creation. With 68% of Phase 6 already sold and a 15% price jump ahead, this presale stands at a crucial turning point. For investors watching crypto prices today and looking for the next undervalued project with real mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may define the ETH-2018 moment of 2025.

Investors Are Withdrawing Their Stablecoins From Exchanges In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared about the latest trend in the Exchange Withdrawing Transactions for the Ethereum-based stablecoins . This indicator measures, as its name implies, the total number of transfers related to an asset or a group of assets flowing from wallets connected to centralized exchanges to self-custodial addresses. Generally, investors take their coins into self-custody when they are planning to hold them in the long term, or at least, not immediately looking to trade them away. As such, a high value of the Exchange Withdrawal Transactions can be a signal that investors aren’t looking to sell the cryptocurrency right now. Now, here is a chart that shows how the 30-day moving average (MA) of the stablecoin Exchange Withdrawing Transactions has fluctuated since 2020: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Withdrawing Transactions for the ERC-20 stablecoins has seen its 30-day MA value follow a sharp uptrend recently. This suggests an increasing amount of transfers are occurring to take stables away from the custody of exchanges. If a volatile asset like Bitcoin were involved here, this trend would have naturally been bullish for its price. But as stablecoins have their price constant around a fiat currency, selling or buying doesn’t affect their price in the same manner. Instead, what investors do with stables can have an effect on the volatile side of the market. When holders deposit these fiat-tied tokens to exchanges, it can be an indication that they are looking to buy into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, their shifting the coins away from exchanges can be a sign that they want to keep their capital still in the safety of the stablecoins for some period. Following the recent rapid growth in the stablecoin Exchange Withdrawal transactions, its value has reached the 67,384 mark, the highest level since May 2021. This previous spike in May 2021 occurred as holders sold Bitcoin for stables during the infamous crash that month. While the latest spike in the metric’s 30-day MA value is extraordinary in scale, it’s still just the first surge in demand for withdrawing stablecoins in the current cycle so far. The previous cycle witnessed several spikes of a similar scale before the music stopped for the bull run . BTC Price Bitcoin has seen another setback during the past day as its price has returned to the $110,900 level.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoin Exchange Outflows|Stablecoin Exchange Withdrawals|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 06:00:05

Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Struggle Amid Market Uncertainty",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-driving-the-drop-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-struggle-amid-market-uncertainty/,"After beginning the week above the critical $115,000 mark, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market initially showed signs of recovery. However, BTC has resumed its downward trajectory, experiencing a 4% decline over the past 24 hours. This downturn has had a cascading effect on other altcoins, particularly Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. BTC, ETH, XRP’s Plunge Explained With the Bitcoin drop, Ethereum recorded a 5% drop, once again losing the pivotal $4,000 support level, while XRP has suffered even greater losses, plummeting by 7% during the same timeframe. This decline has pushed XRP closer to $2.40 as of Tuesday, highlighting the volatility affecting altcoins in the current market environment. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency According to Bloomberg, this recent Bitcoin and crypto slide can be attributed to geopolitical tensions, specifically China’s imposition of restrictions on the American units of Hanwha Ocean Co., one of South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. This action is seen as a retaliatory measure against US sanctions targeting the Chinese shipping sector. Bitcoin and the crypto market were already reeling from a brutal selloff that began on October 10, which resulted in approximately $19 billion worth of leveraged positions being liquidated. This selloff, which saw the Bitcoin price drop toward $102,000 last Friday, was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s threats of increased tariffs on China in response to new export controls. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Market analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s performance, noting that a drop below the $110,000 threshold could initiate a test of the $104,000 to $108,000 liquidity band, according to Timothy Misir, head of research at digital-assets analytics platform BRN. “The market now enters a consolidation phase, characterized by renewed caution, selective risk-taking, and a more measured rebuilding of confidence across both spot and derivatives markets,” commented analytics firm Glassnode. Furthermore, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s trajectory over the short, mid, and long term on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation’s House Of Doge Announces NASDAQ Listing In the short term, covering the current month, the Bitcoin outlook is neutral. Although a slightly bullish sentiment was noted yesterday, it has reverted to neutral as new data emerges, emphasizing the need for more information to make a conclusive decision. For the mid-term outlook, spanning one to three months, the sentiment is bearish. The expert indicates that the market has recently entered the early stages of a bear phase. While there may be instances of dead cat bounces, he suggests that the overall direction for the mid-term appears to be downward. Looking further ahead, in the long term (three to twelve months), the analysis remains extremely bearish for Bitcoin and crypto as the macroeconomic environment indicates an impending global economic upheaval, which many believe is closer than it appears. When writing, Bitcoin trades just above its key support for the short-term at $110,300.

Stripe, which launched stablecoin payment support a year ago, has helped many fast-growing global technology and artificial intelligence (AI) companies increase their international revenues. According to the company's data, 19 of the top 20 AI companies using Stripe are based in the US, but generate 60% of their revenue outside the country. However, the slow, costly, and error-prone nature of cross-border payments has led some companies to turn to alternative solutions.

These transactions are completed almost instantly and at twice the cost of traditional methods. With the new feature, Stripe will allow businesses on its platform to: Offering its customers the opportunity to pay for subscriptions with stablecoins, Manage fiat and stablecoin-based payments through a single Stripe Dashboard, Provides full integration with Stripe Billing and Optimized Checkout Suite, It makes it possible to extend the advantages of stablecoins to the entire product range. Stripe developed a custom smart contract for this system that addresses one of the fundamental limitations of blockchain payments. This contract allows users to register their wallet as a payment method and authorize recurring payments without re-authorizing each transaction. The system supports over 400 cryptocurrency wallets. “Stablecoin payments help us lower our cost of revenue from global customers, attract more tech-savvy users, and reach audiences that lack access to traditional payment methods,” said Alex Mashrabov, CEO of Higgsfield, one of the first companies to implement stablecoin subscription payments with Stripe. *This is not investment advice.

The post highlights a 2020 report indicating that Russia’s central bank has been exploring the use of tokenization to let foreign investors buy shares in domestic companies. The same document outlines earlier research by the Bank of Russia into blockchain-based settlements that directly mention Ripple and XRP as potential tools for international transactions. According to Amelie, this development positions XRP as a likely candidate for Russia’s cross-border payment framework. She cited the Central Bank’s document, noting that it referenced experiments involving Ripple technology for cross-border settlements as early as 2018. The report’s technical section describes how Russia’s Novosibirsk laboratory conducted trials using Ripple’s platform to process payments between banks and national systems. BREAKING: Russia’s Central Bank wants to use tokenization solutions to grant foreign buyers access to shares in domestic companies! According to a document from the Central Bank of Russia dated 2020, they are most likely to use #XRP for cross-border payments! … pic.twitter.com/871ai2AmHU — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 13, 2025 Ripple’s Role in Russian Payment Systems The document provides detailed insight into how Ripple’s technology was evaluated for settlement operations. It states that the Ripple platform could serve as the foundation for a system of international transfers once legal and technical conditions were satisfied. The research discussed using XRP as a transfer medium or as a fiat currency equivalent between national banks. It also proposed a framework for reconciling balances between Ripple participants and national systems, using embedded cryptographic solutions on the Ripple network. Importantly, it included the idea of establishing procedures for “determining cross rates for the internal ‘currency’ of Ripple – XRP.” This indicates that the bank considered XRP not just as a tool for liquidity but as a standardized digital asset within an international framework. From Pilot Tests to Tokenization Amelie’s post ties this earlier Ripple research to the Central Bank’s current tokenization initiative. The document she referenced confirms Russia’s goal of allowing foreign investors to buy domestic securities through tokenized systems, signaling a wider shift toward blockchain integration.

The consistent mentions of Ripple throughout this project highlight a sustained interest in XRP’s functionality within regulated payment environments. Potential Benefits for XRP If the Central Bank of Russia moves forward with XRP as part of its cross-border payment and tokenization framework , it could significantly expand the token’s utility. XRP’s efficiency in facilitating instant, low-cost international transactions complements the central bank’s aim to modernize settlements and attract foreign investors. While no final decision has been publicly announced, the references to Ripple in official research documents and Amelie’s observations suggest XRP remains a viable option for Russia’s financial modernization strategy.

He points to XRP’s multi-year chart as a near-textbook example of technical precision, featuring symmetrical consolidations, breakout zones, and enduring support levels that mirror the principles of classical trading theory. Following its explosive 2017 rally and prolonged consolidation, the asset now exhibits a clean, symmetrical structure that hints at a major breakout with XRP’s price presently trading at $2.50. Brandt’s analysis underscores XRP’s exceptional technical integrity, its precise trendlines, disciplined retracements, and balanced formations, making it a textbook example of how long-term market cycles mature. In a market often driven by short-term speculation, Brandt’s recognition of XRP’s long-term chart underscores the lasting value of classical analysis. Beyond daily volatility, XRP appears to be shaping a historic case study in digital asset markets, one defined not by hype, but by technical precision and time-tested charting discipline. XRP Defies Market Turmoil with $61.6M Inflows for 18th Straight Week Despite last week’s widespread crypto market selloffs, institutional investors are doubling down on XRP, signaling growing confidence in the digital asset’s long-term prospects. According to CoinShares’ latest report, XRP recorded $61.6 million in inflows over the past week, marking its 18th consecutive week of positive institutional investment. This sustained streak stands out as one of the most impressive runs among major altcoins, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid volatility that rattled the broader market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced fluctuations in fund flows due to profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty, XRP continued attracting steady capital, a clear indicator of bullish institutional sentiment. Consistent inflows during market corrections often indicate strategic accumulation by institutional investors positioning for future gains, a quiet buildup that frequently precedes major market momentum. Ripple’s deepening collaborations with financial institutions, fintechs, and tokenization projects are strengthening confidence in XRP’s potential to anchor the next wave of blockchain finance. As Ripple pushes forward with its RLUSD stablecoin and global partnerships, the XRP ecosystem is emerging with unprecedented structural and institutional strength. Conclusion Peter Brandt’s recognition of XRP’s long-term chart highlights more than technical elegance; it signals the quiet maturity of an asset refined by years of volatility and scrutiny. If classical patterns mirror market psychology, XRP’s structure tells a story of resilience, steady accumulation, and readiness for its next decisive phase. Whether that leads to a breakout or extended consolidation, one thing stands out: XRP has become a textbook study in disciplined, long-term market behavior, where history, patience, and precision align. On the other hand, XRP’s 18-week streak of institutional inflows highlights a deeper story beneath crypto volatility, one of strategic confidence and long-term conviction.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 06:07:49

In a speech about the central bank’s balance sheet, Powell openly acknowledged the rising “downside risks to unemployment” in a dovish signal that the central bank is preparing to ease monetary policy. “Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,” he said before adding, “We judged it appropriate to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance at our September meeting.” “There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals.” There you have it, QT is over. Back up the fucking truck and buy everything. pic.twitter.com/kQbpBSOlOU — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 14, 2025 End of QT Is Good For BTC Powell indicated the Fed may approach the point of stopping balance sheet runoff in the coming months, suggesting the quantitative tightening phase is nearing its end, clearing the path for more rate cuts. The target rate probability for a 0.25% cut at the Fed’s Oct. 29 meeting is currently 95.7%, according to the CME futures markets. However, the probability of a similar cut in December has risen to 94.8% suggesting that rates are likely to be cut by 0.5% by the end of the year. “While there was little doubt the FOMC was angled to cut rates at its next meeting, today’s remarks were strong confirmation of that expectation,” said JPMorgan’s Chief Economist Michael Feroli. “We have a completely dovish Fed, with 125 bps of rate cuts already priced in, poised to end QT,” said Bitcoin entrepreneur Joe Consorti before adding: “BTC has been effectively rangebound since May. You know what happens next. Don’t overthink it.” In a separate post, he said that now that quantitative tightening is ending and the Fed’s policy rates are coming down to sub-3%, “BTC now has the tailwinds of easing at its back.” QT is when a central bank reduces the size of its balance sheet by allowing bonds and securities it owns to mature without replacing them. It is the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE), where the Fed buys securities to inject money and liquidity into the economy. Bitcoin is up 750% over the last 3 years (wow) as the Fed tightened monetary conditions. Fed Funds: 0.25% → 5.5% → 4.25% Balance Sheet: $9T → $6.5T Now that QT is ending and the Fed’s policy rates are coming down to sub-3%, BTC now has the tailwinds of easing at its back. https://t.co/4u7rKhSuQA pic.twitter.com/NbhLHz6A65 — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) October 14, 2025 No Market Reaction Yet Crypto markets are still jittery and reeling from the industry’s largest liquidation event over the weekend, so the reaction was muted.

On Wednesday, he posted on microblogging site GETTR that he had moved from a center-left stance in 2020 to a more centrist position in 2022, after observing aggressive crypto enforcement under SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the Justice Department. “By 2022—having seen Gensler/Biden’s DOJ on crypto—I was a centrist, and (privately) donated tens of millions to Republicans,” he wrote. gm @GETTRofficial https://t.co/GsY3bFkgKM — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 15, 2025 Bankman-Fried Claims Authorities Targeted Him Before Key Crypto Vote He claimed that weeks later, the SEC and DOJ “went after me,” timing his arrest just before a crypto bill he supported was due for a vote and only a day before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. At the time, House Republicans alleged the timing appeared intended “to prevent Sam Bankman-Fried from testifying,” and demanded that Gensler turn over internal communications. In his post, Bankman-Fried revived those suspicions, saying Gensler “conveniently lost” the relevant messages. SEC Confirms Gensler’s Phone Wipe Erased Nearly A Year Of Texts Last month, the SEC’s Office of Inspector General admitted that Gensler’s government-issued phone underwent an “enterprise wipe” that erased texts between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. The office said the phone stopped syncing to the agency system in July 2023 and was flagged “inactive” for 62 days, despite functioning normally. That deletion period overlapped with other major SEC enforcement steps against crypto firms, alongside FTX’s collapse in Nov. 2022 and Bankman-Fried’s December arrest in the Bahamas. Coinbase has since accused the SEC of deleting nearly a year of Gensler’s messages, calling for sanctions over what it described as “destruction of evidence.” Lawmakers Launch Inquiry Into SEC’s Handling Of Gensler’s Missing Messages House Republicans have also launched an investigation into the deletion of nearly a year’s worth of text messages from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, citing concerns about transparency, IT mismanagement, and compliance with federal record-keeping laws. Bankman-Fried remains imprisoned at FCI Terminal Island following his conviction in one of the largest financial fraud cases in history. Prosecutors said he diverted billions in customer funds to his hedge fund, Alameda Research, using them for risky trades, real estate, and political donations. Once hailed as a crypto prodigy and a major political donor, Bankman-Fried now faces years behind bars while continuing to insist his downfall was driven as much by politics as by mismanagement.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japan-prepares-to-ban-insider-trading-in-cryptocurrency-markets-here-are-the-details/,"Japan has begun preparing comprehensive regulations aimed at banning insider trading in cryptocurrency markets. Japan Prepares for Insider Trading Ban in Crypto Markets According to reports, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is planning to introduce regulations explicitly prohibiting cryptocurrency trading based on non-public information. The new law would impose fines proportional to the amount of illicit profits made by those violating the ban. The Securities and Exchange Supervision Commission (SESC) will also have the authority to investigate suspicious transactions and recommend fines or criminal penalties. The FSA reportedly aims to finalize the regulatory details by the end of the year and submit the proposed legislation to next year's regular parliamentary session. Currently, Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act does not contain provisions for insider trading for crypto assets, leaving oversight largely to the self-regulation of crypto exchanges and industry associations. However, regulators emphasize that defining insider trading in crypto assets is more complex than traditional securities. Many tokens don't have a specific issuer, making it difficult to define “insider.” Japan has recently begun tightening its cryptocurrency market. Last week, Binance Japan announced a capital and business partnership with payments giant PayPay Corporation, and it was announced that PayPay had acquired a 40% stake in the local stock exchange. This new step is considered part of Japan's effort to bring crypto markets closer to traditional financial standards. *This is not investment advice.

53166742,https://nulltx.com/?p=152361,1760511380,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Metaplanet’s Market Value Falls Below Its Bitcoin Holdings for the First Time,https://nulltx.com/metaplanets-market-value-falls-below-its-bitcoin-holdings-for-the-first-time/,"Metaplanet , often called “Japan’s MicroStrategy”, just hit a new and unwanted milestone. For the first time ever, the company’s market-to-Bitcoin net asset value (mNAV) has dropped below 1, meaning the market now values Metaplanet less than the worth of its Bitcoin holdings. According to Bloomberg, Metaplanet’s mNAV currently sits around 0.99x, signaling that investors are discounting the firm’s balance sheet, a reversal from months of premium trading. What Is mNAV and Why It Matters Market-to-Bitcoin NAV, or mNAV, measures how a Bitcoin-holding company trades relative to the value of its BTC reserves. It’s calculated by dividing the firm’s market capitalization by the value of its Bitcoin stack. mNAV > 1: The market values the company above its BTC holdings, a sign of growth confidence or trust in management. mNAV For Metaplanet, that ratio falling below 1 marks a key sentiment shift. The market is effectively saying: “Your Bitcoin is worth more than your stock.” Japan’s “MicroStrategy of Asia” Metaplanet earned its nickname, “Japan’s MicroStrategy”, after aggressively accumulating Bitcoin on its balance sheet throughout 2024 and 2025. Like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy in the U.S., Metaplanet positioned itself as a corporate vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, attracting investors looking for BTC-linked equity plays in Asia. As of Q4 2025, the firm’s holdings stand at several thousand BTC, making it one of the largest public Bitcoin holders globally. But that strategy cuts both ways. When Bitcoin rises, Metaplanet’s valuation soars. When Bitcoin drops, as it did recently, the company’s market cap collapses even faster. Bitcoin’s Fall Below $110K Slashes Treasury Value The latest shock came as Bitcoin slipped below $110,000, erasing billions in market value and trimming corporate treasuries across the board. Metaplanet’s BTC reserves lost a significant portion of their paper value within days. That decline, combined with investor profit-taking after a strong summer rally, sent Metaplanet’s share price tumbling more than 70% from its yearly highs. The company, once trading at a heavy premium to its BTC stash, is now sitting at a historic discount, a reversal that few analysts expected this early in the bull cycle. Investor confidence appears to be fading. Traders on Tokyo’s stock exchange have begun pricing in the risks of holding a company that mirrors Bitcoin’s volatility but carries added equity risk, such as dilution or capital management uncertainty. When mNAV dips below 1, it often signals deeper investor caution. It implies that shareholders see more downside in the company’s structure, governance, or execution than upside from its Bitcoin exposure. The move could make raising capital significantly harder for Metaplanet. Investors may hesitate to fund a company whose equity trades at a discount to its underlying assets. And that’s not just sentiment, it’s math. Issuing new shares while mNAV CEO Promised Buybacks, Will He Deliver? Earlier this year, Metaplanet’s CEO publicly stated that if the company’s mNAV ever dropped below 1, management would consider share buybacks to restore confidence and correct undervaluation. That moment has now arrived. Whether the firm can act on that promise remains to be seen. Buybacks would require liquid capital or the sale of BTC, both sensitive moves in a volatile market. Still, such an intervention could help close the discount gap if executed decisively. Investors are watching closely to see whether management follows through. If not, the discount could widen further as trust erodes. Metaplanet’s decline comes amid a broader cooling in crypto equities. MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), and other publicly listed crypto firms have all seen steep pullbacks since Bitcoin’s last local high. According to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC is down over 3% in the past 30 days, pressuring corporate treasuries and sentiment alike. However, few firms have seen such a clear-cut divergence between asset value and market price as Metaplanet, where the discount is now a measurable, structural signal of waning confidence. Bloomberg analysts suggest that Japanese investors, typically more conservative, may be less tolerant of Bitcoin’s drawdowns than U.S. or European peers. A Test of Faith for Bitcoin Corporates For Bitcoin-holding companies, mNAV It challenges the belief that “stacking BTC” automatically drives shareholder value. Instead, it exposes whether a company’s management, strategy, and balance sheet discipline can justify a premium beyond the coins they hold. Metaplanet’s situation echoes MicroStrategy’s past, when MSTR also traded at a discount during deep Bitcoin drawdowns, before recovering strongly as market confidence returned. If the crypto market stabilizes or rebounds, the same could happen here. A discount can quickly flip back to a premium once sentiment turns. The Road Ahead For now, Metaplanet’s leadership faces a tough balancing act. They must reassure investors, defend their BTC strategy, and potentially act on the buyback promise, all while navigating a volatile Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, traders are weighing whether this discount represents an opportunity or a warning sign. If Bitcoin stabilizes above $110K and sentiment improves, Metaplanet could quickly reclaim its premium. But if BTC slips further, mNAV could drift even lower, tightening liquidity and shaking investor faith. Metaplanet’s mNAV drop below 1 marks a symbolic moment for Asia’s Bitcoin corporate movement. For the first time, Japan’s biggest BTC proxy trades at a discount to its own stack, a clear signal that markets demand more than just “number go up.” It’s now a question of confidence, not just coins. And in the high-stakes world of Bitcoin treasuries, confidence is the most volatile asset of all. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet even as traders were liquidated and markets swung violently, protocol activity surged. Lending fees topped $20 million in one day, DEX volumes hit $177 billion for the week, and stETH yields spiked past 7%, underscoring a liquidity storm that tested every corner of decentralized finance. $12 Billion in Leverage Wiped from Perp DEXs The sharp drop in open interest across perpetual exchanges marked one of the most significant onchain deleveraging events of 2025. According to DeFiLlama, Perp DEX open interest fell from $26 billion to below $14 billion, reflecting mass unwinding across leading derivatives platforms including dYdX, GMX, Hyperliquid , and Aevo. Market analysts linked the crash to cascading liquidations triggered by sudden sell pressure in BTC and ETH markets, combined with thin weekend liquidity. In total, over $12 billion in open interest vanished, one of the largest onchain deleverages since 2022. The scale mirrored centralized market liquidations earlier in the week, where Coinglass data recorded more than $19 billion in positions cleared in 24 hours, underscoring how deeply correlated CEX and DEX markets have become. Lending Protocol Fees Hit All-Time Highs While leveraged traders faced record liquidations, lending protocols enjoyed their most profitable day ever. DeFiLlama data shows lending platforms generated over $20 million in fees on Friday, marking a new all-time high for the sector. Protocols like Aave, Compound, and Morpho saw borrowing costs spike as traders rushed to cover margin calls or reposition into stablecoins during the volatility. The sudden demand for liquidity pushed utilization rates higher across lending pools, particularly for USDC, USDT, and ETH, creating a fee bonanza for lenders and protocol treasuries alike. The surge in lending activity highlighted a key dynamic in DeFi: even in extreme downturns, protocol revenue can soar when volatility drives borrowing and liquidations. Weekly DEX Volume Hits $177 Billion, A New Record Despite the turmoil, trading activity across decentralized exchanges hit unprecedented levels. DeFiLlama reported that weekly DEX volume surpassed $177 billion, setting a new record for decentralized trading. That figure represents nearly a 30% increase over the previous week’s total, signaling how traders flocked to onchain venues during the selloff. Uniswap, Curve, and Jupiter led the surge, while perpetual DEXs like Hyperliquid and dYdX contributed heavily to derivative flows. The record-breaking week further solidifies DEXs as a liquidity backbone for DeFi, even under market stress. On-chain observers noted that while spot DEX trading saw a spike in slippage and gas fees, execution remained stable, with no major outages, a sharp contrast to the system-wide halts often seen in centralized venues during similar events. Total Borrowed Falls Below $50 Billion Amid the volatility, overall borrowing across lending protocols dropped sharply. Total borrowed funds across DeFi lending platforms fell below $50 billion, marking the first time since August that total onchain debt slipped under that threshold. The retreat reflected a broad deleveraging as users repaid loans, unwound yield strategies, or moved collateral into stable positions. For major lenders like Aave and Compound, outstanding debt positions fell by more than 10% day-over-day, signaling that traders were actively reducing exposure in the wake of extreme volatility. Still, the rapid repayment of loans contributed to network congestion and heightened gas fees, especially on Ethereum, where liquidation bots competed to close risky positions. stETH APY Spikes Above 7% One of the more surprising side effects of the crash came from Ethereum staking yields. According to DeFiLlama, stETH APY briefly spiked over 7%, its highest level in months, as validator rewards surged due to heavy transaction volume and elevated priority fees. The APY jump drew renewed attention to liquid staking tokens, which remain a core yield source across DeFi. For context, Lido’s stETH, the largest liquid staking derivative, typically offers around 3.5–4.5% APY. The spike to 7% reflected extreme network demand as traders arbitraged positions, repaid debt, and bridged assets between chains. Analysts expect yields to normalize in the coming days, but the brief surge underscored how DeFi rewards can fluctuate sharply during volatile market conditions. DeFi Volatility, Onchain Strength Despite the flash crash’s chaos, DeFi infrastructure showed resilience. Perp DEXs, lending markets, and staking protocols all absorbed record transaction loads without major outages or oracle failures, an improvement from the system weaknesses exposed in earlier drawdowns. While total value locked (TVL) dipped temporarily, network activity metrics such as fees, volume, and user counts remained elevated. Market watchers say this may mark a turning point for DeFi maturity: higher volatility now drives more protocol revenue, not less. DeFiLlama’s aggregated data supports this trend, the same crash that erased $12 billion in leverage also created all-time highs for fees and trading activity. That dynamic underscores a growing separation between price pain and protocol health, while token prices drop, the underlying infrastructure profits from volatility. The Oct. 11 flash crash reminded traders that crypto’s decentralized layer is both fragile and antifragile. Open interest can halve in hours, yet DeFi protocols thrive under pressure. With Perp DEX leverage cut in half, fees at record highs, and stETH yields surging past 7%, the ecosystem continues to prove its adaptive strength. If anything, DeFiLlama’s data confirms one thing: decentralized markets are now too large, too liquid, and too resilient to ignore, even when the market burns.

According to government and blockchain sources, the move aims to anchor identity attestations on a public chain while keeping private personal data off the ledger. What The Shift Involves Based on reports , the National Digital Identity (NDI) platform will serve roughly 800,000 people and the full migration of credentials is expected to be completed by Q1 2026. Officials say the change follows earlier platform updates and is meant to strengthen how identity claims are verified across services. The government previously moved its self-sovereign identity system from Hyperledger Indy to Polygon in 2024, a step taken to improve scalability and performance before the latest integration with Ethereum. That earlier migration is part of the technical background now guiding the current switch. 1/ Today, Bhutan celebrates a historic milestone, becoming the first nation to anchor its national digital identity system on Ethereum. @VitalikButerin and I were honored to join the launch ceremony on behalf of the Ethereum community, graced by His Royal Highness. pic.twitter.com/KA4tOYbsJ4 — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) October 13, 2025 Ceremony And Leaders Reports have disclosed that the launch event drew high-profile figures from the Ethereum community and Bhutan’s leadership. Ethereum co-founders and foundation representatives were present at the announcement, and local officials described the day as a landmark in the country’s plans for digital services. Technically, the government and its tech partners say the system will avoid placing private identity data directly on chain. Instead, cryptographic proofs or hashes will be used to confirm identity claims while personal records remain stored off chain under government control. That approach is intended to balance verification with privacy protections, according to public statements from project leads. What This Means For Citizens For many users, the change should be invisible day to day. Verifiers — banks, agencies, and service providers — will be able to check credentials against the public proof without receiving raw personal data. This is how officials describe the model in plain terms: keys and proofs on a public ledger, private data kept elsewhere under rules and legal guardrails. Still, practical questions remain. How will the government handle costs tied to public chain transactions? Which apps or wallets will citizens use? How will the system work in remote areas with limited internet? Those are the sorts of operational issues that the NDI team has said it will address as migration continues toward the Q1 2026 target. Global Context And Caution Experts say Bhutan’s move is notable because national identity systems are usually run on closed networks or permissioned ledgers. Anchoring proofs on a widely used public chain like Ethereum is uncommon at scale. Observers praise the transparency potential, but they also warn about long-term costs, governance, and the need for clear legal protections for citizens’ data.

Bitcoin At The Risk Of Losing Momentum? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Bitcoin’s Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) has been trending lower, confirming that inter-exchange activity is slowly fading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Dominate On Binance As CVD Confirmation Nears 0.9, Signaling $130K Target Zone For the uninitiated, the IFP measures liquidity as it moves between crypto exchanges. In essence, it can be considered a proxy to determine how active arbitrage and market-making really are. To explain, arbitrage refers to the practice of buying an asset for a lower price on one platform and selling it at a higher price on another, thus benefiting from the price differential. In simple terms, arbitrage refers to profiting from inefficiencies. When such inefficiencies exist in the market and are actually executable, liquidity tends to start moving fast. At the same time, trading bots begin shuttling funds across platforms, market spreads begin to realign again, and the market starts to feel “alive.” This is when the IFP rises. Although there is greater market volatility due to a rising IFP, it is generally considered healthy for the market as it confirms that BTC is likely experiencing a bullish momentum. However, since the IFP reading has turned lower in recent weeks, traders are finding it harder to arbitrage price discrepancies even though they might still be appearing. TeddyVision noted: Price discrepancies still appear, but they’re harder to arbitrage – liquidity is thinner, latency is higher, and risk-adjusted opportunities are drying up. Traders find fewer setups worth taking, and less capital circulates between venues. The analyst emphasized that liquidity is not leaving the market, it is just not circulating like earlier. While such a slowdown in liquidity does not crash the market, it does drain the energy out of it. To conclude, the market is not collapsing, it is just “too efficient” at the moment for traders to find any meaningful arbitrage opportunities that they can benefit from. When inefficiencies leave the market, the underlying asset is likely at risk of losing its momentum. A Healthy Correction For BTC? The market crash on October 9 led to the largest single-day liquidation ever in the history of the crypto industry, totalling a mammoth $19 billion. While the overall optimism has receded, some analysts are still hopeful of a quick sentiment turnaround.

Prominent crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has released an updated chart highlighting $2.65 as a critical level for the asset. According to his analysis, this price point, which previously acted as strong support before XRP’s crash , has now become a resistance zone that the asset must overcome to regain its upward momentum. The chart he shared outlines the current positioning of XRP against key exponential moving averages (EMAs), including the 9, 21, 50, 100, and 200 EMAs. The asset is presently trading below $2.65 but remains above the 200 EMA, signaling a possible stabilization phase. The asset’s decline pushed it below $2 for the first time since June , but the quick rebound marked on the chart suggests a repeated pattern where XRP finds support before attempting another push higher. #XRP Update: $2.65 – Again A Key Level But This Time Resistant : What was once strong support has now turned into a formidable resistance level. $2.65 is playing a major role again! If we can flip it into support on the 3-day timeframe with a full body candle, we’ll be in a… https://t.co/7HONwm4EMZ pic.twitter.com/Pc8ji5igOw — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 13, 2025 The $2.65 Level and Its Technical Significance EGRAG CRYPTO described $2.65 as a key level playing a major role, noting that “what was once strong support has now turned into a formidable resistance level.” The chart shows that each time XRP experienced a similar dip, a recovery followed. However, this time, the key difference lies in whether the price can close above $2.65 with confirmation on higher timeframes. He added that flipping this level into support on the three-day timeframe “with a full body candle” would be a positive signal for XRP’s next phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Targets and Future Outlook Such a move would indicate market strength and potentially validate a new support base. The analyst recently pointed out the importance of the $2.65 level , and according to his updated analysis, breaching this level would set the next technical target at $2.85, aligning with the 21 EMA, as shown in his chart. The chart also identifies subsequent targets beyond $2.65 and $2.85. If bullish conditions persist, EGRAG outlines $3.13 and $3.44 as potential levels to monitor. These upper boundaries remain within the projected trend channel, placing XRP just below its all-time high , and offering potential benchmarks for traders tracking medium-term growth. Despite the market’s recent turbulence, XRP continues to maintain support around the $2.30 region, which corresponds closely with the 100 EMA. If XRP manages to close decisively above $2.65, it could mark the beginning of another rally. Until then, $2.65 remains the central test defining whether momentum will shift back in favor of the bulls. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Roger Ver settled with the US DOJ, admitting he hid Bitcoin holdings when renouncing US citizenship in 2014. He paid nearly $50 million in back taxes and penalties, leading the government to drop its indictment. Ver’s case ties into Trump-linked lobbying efforts as speculation about a potential pardon. According to the DOJ , Ver, the early Bitcoin advocate famously known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, agreeing to pay nearly $50 million in back taxes, penalties, and interest to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). US Drops Indictment After Roger Ver Pays $50M in Tax Settlement Prosecutors said his omission caused a $16.9 million loss to the US government. In exchange for the payment, the government has moved to dismiss the indictment against him. “Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli in a statement on Tuesday. Ver, who became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, was arrested in Spain last year and extradited to the United States. His case was led by the IRS Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit, which investigates tax evasion involving digital assets. The settlement confirms reports that Ver and the DOJ had been finalizing a resolution to the $48 million tax-evasion case. Meanwhile, speculative trading on Polymarket briefly pushed odds of a Trump pardon for Ver to 50% before falling back to around 13% following the DOJ’s announcement. Roger Ver is facing life in prison for revealing how the US government worked secretly to subvert cryptocurrency and prevent economic freedom. More people should hear this story.

Earlier this year, he paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone to lobby against the tax provisions central to his case. Lobbying records also show that Ver hired attorneys Christopher Kise and Brian Ballard, both of whom have long-standing ties to Trump’s political network. The Justice Department accused Ver of hiding the true value of his Bitcoin holdings. The filings were connected to his decision to renounce US citizenship. At that time, Americans were required to pay an “exit tax” on all global assets, including cryptocurrency. Prosecutors argued that by concealing his holdings, Ver deprived the US of millions in taxes. White House Weighs Pardon for Binance Founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao The White House has reportedly intensified discussions over a potential presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to an October 12 New York Post report. Sources cited by Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino claim that President Donald Trump is “leaning toward a pardon,” despite concerns among advisors about how it could appear given his financial ties to the crypto industry. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain adequate anti-money laundering controls at Binance, leading to his resignation as CEO. The talks come nearly a year after Zhao publicly hinted he “wouldn’t mind a pardon” following President Joe Biden’s controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, in 2024. The potential pardon has already sparked backlash from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sent a letter to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, warning that Zhao’s request raises “urgent concerns about the integrity of the justice system.” The post ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver Settles $50M Tax Case With US DOJ Over Undeclared Holdings appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|DOJ|Regulation|Roger Ver,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-15 07:04:11

In 2028, it will range between $4.55 and $5.20, with an average price of $4.87. In 2031, it will range between $7.80 and $8.45, with an average price of $8.12. SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Let’s get into the SNX price prediction and technical analysis.

Cryptocurrency loses 5.6% of its value. SNX coin may find support around $1.85. As of October 15, 2025, Synthetix price analysis reveals a bearish trend. The altcoin’s price decreased to $2.01 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 5.6% of its value as it corrects following the sharp spike to $2.57. However, buyer support was observed a few hours ago, when a slight price increase was noted, but at the time of writing, the altcoin is falling again. SNX/USD 1-day chart: SNX faces strong accumulation The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend as it continues its bearish slide as investors divest. The cryptocurrency price has decreased to $2.01 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility for the coming days. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the broken resistance, has shifted to $2.05. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.559. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve has entered the neutral area, currently at 69.36. This situation suggests that sellers have control of the SNX price, and further instability in the market can be expected if the bears sustain their momentum. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin also signals selling pressure on the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price decreased to $2.01 in the past few hours. The high volatility levels suggest an increased probability of an upcoming reversal or more price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.70, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.961, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value decreased to 61 over the past four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an imbalanced trading environment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively unbalanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin price has decreased to $2.01 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $1.85 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.36 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $2.01, losing 5.6% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.95 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.45, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.45 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX is trading above $1, as the current sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 07:12:39
53168353,https://invezz.com/?p=2925400,1760512455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,The next big crypto to explode in 2025 according to analysts,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/15/the-next-big-crypto-to-explode-in-2025-according-to-analysts/,"Analysts and DeFi veterans are calling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the next crypto to explode in 2025. Their optimism comes from one clear reason — Mutuum’s design connects real revenue, sustainable yield, and token buybacks into one economic engine. As crypto coins regain momentum and investors ask why is crypto going up again, Mutuum stands out as a project preparing for a breakout year driven by real product expansion and growing liquidity. A final sub-$0.04 opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the middle of its presale and continues to attract strong attention from both retail and institutional investors. The project has already raised around $17.35 million and gathered more than 17,100 holders. Its total token supply is capped at 4 billion MUTM. Phase 6 is now live, with 68% of its 170 million tokens already sold at a price of $0.035. Once this round ends, Phase 7 will begin at $0.040 — a 15% jump that marks the final sub-$0.04 window before broader market exposure. Market analysts describe this phase as the ideal entry point before Mutuum’s upcoming beta release and potential exchange listings create higher visibility. The price difference between $0.035 and $1 reflects not just speculation but the economic logic of a platform that earns, buys back, and redistributes for its own token value. Dual lending model creating a powerful economic flywheel Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on two integrated lending systems designed to cover both institutional and retail markets. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will target stablecoin lenders and institutions seeking steady returns. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will attract risk-seeking users and meme-coin holders looking for higher yield opportunities. Together, these two engines will generate two continuous streams of revenue that fuel the protocol’s buyback and reward mechanism. The same logic applies to borrowers. Those posting collateral, such as ETH, will gain liquidity while keeping their assets’ market exposure. Borrowers will pay interest, generating revenue for the platform. That income, combined with platform fees, will later fund open-market MUTM buybacks. The cycle repeats: lending creates revenue, revenue funds buybacks, and buybacks reward stakers — a self-sustaining loop that increases both utility and value over time. Testnet launch fueling 2025 growth The Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s team has recently announced the launch of V1 of the protocol on its Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, including ETH and USDT, mtToken accounting, and an automated liquidator bot. This early testnet will build community trust through real-time testing and transparent results before the full mainnet rollout. Projects with successful testnets often achieve a 5× to 10× increase in total value locked within months, and analysts expect Mutuum’s audited beta to generate a similar response. An investor who entered during Phase 5 at $0.030 with $20,000 received 667K tokens. At the current $0.035 price, that holding is worth $23K. When the price reaches $0.50, that same position will be valued at $333K — more than 16X the initial investment. This growth is based on platform economics, not speculative trading, making it one of the few crypto coins built for sustained appreciation. Mutuum’s dashboard will display live return tracking, and its Top-50 leaderboard is already introducing a gamified environment that encourages huge investors. Each day, the highest-ranked user will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC daily. This combination of visibility and rewards will strengthen community loyalty and keep circulating supply low — a key factor behind price stability. The year of Mutuum As more investors return to the market wondering why is crypto going up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as a standout answer. It connects real yield, strong tokenomics, and an active community into one expanding ecosystem. With Phase 6 already 68% sold and the next round priced higher, this is the most attractive window before mainnet buzz begins. 2025 will be the year when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters its public phase, proving that sustainable yield, audited systems, and community-driven economics can turn a presale token into a top-performing crypto. Those who act before this phase ends will secure the most favorable cost basis ahead of what analysts call the next major DeFi breakout of the year.

He said that the company has started focusing on “moving away from traditional financial assets by ‘re-potting’ them in a digital manner.” This way, investors could stay within the digital ecosystem, he added. Next Wave of Opportunity Fink envisions bringing some of the $4 trillion crypto market investment into traditional assets such as exchange-traded funds by tokenizing them and making them easier to access. “There’s $4.1 trillion of money sitting globally in digital wallets,” he said before adding that a lot of that money is outside the United States.” “If we could tokenize an ETF, you know, digitize that ETF, we could have investors who are just beginning to invest in markets through, let’s say, crypto. They’re investing in it, but now we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products.” He added that this was the “next wave of opportunity” for BlackRock over the next ten years.

It has the largest tokenized cash money market fund called BUIDL, which has $2.8 billion in assets under management. It also has the world’s largest and fastest-growing Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which has now surpassed $100 billion in AUM. “It’s not about if the market’s going up or down, or if there’s a bubble in crypto or if there’s a bubble in technology … It’s about being in the market throughout the cycle,” he told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. RWA Sector Outlook The real-world asset tokenization sector is at an all-time high of $33.8 billion in on-chain value, according to RWA.xyz. That figure has grown 115% since the beginning of this year, and around half of it is tokenized private credit. Despite all of the FUD, Ethereum remains the industry leader and standard for asset tokenization. It has a market share of 57%, which climbs to 78% if Ethereum Virtual Machine and layer-2 networks such as ZKsync, Polygon, and Arbitrum are included. Many believe that BlackRock will continue to use Ethereum to bring its assets on-chain rather than reinventing the wheel.

The asset stood at around $112,100 at press time, down slightly over the past 24 hours and down 8% over the past week. Though short-term performance is weak, some technical and on-chain indicators are pointing to possible strength building in the background. Log Curve and RSI Near Crucial Levels Bitcoin’s price is approaching the top of its long-term logarithmic curve, a level that has acted as a ceiling in previous cycles. According to EtherNasyonaL, BTC “ hasn’t even broken above the logarithmic curve resistance yet ,” and the market tends to gain speed when this resistance is crossed.

Back in 2017, the RSI broke this same trendline shortly before the price moved sharply higher. The current setup shows the price and RSI are close to similar conditions again, though no breakout has been confirmed so far. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, Trader Tardigrade noted that Bitcoin is forming a double bottom pattern. The second low is higher than the first, which often signals that sellers are losing strength and buyers may be returning. The resistance line, or neckline, of this pattern is around $116,000. A move above this level would confirm the setup. Until that happens, the pattern remains unconfirmed. This type of structure has previously led to upward moves, but only once the neckline is cleared with volume. Source: Trader Tardigrade/X Pricing Bands Mark $119K as Key Level The MVRV pricing model from Glassnode places the current Bitcoin price just below the +0.5 standard deviation band, which is at around $119,000. Analyst Ali Martinez said, Bitcoin $BTC must reclaim $119,000 to keep bullish momentum alive! Otherwise, the Pricing Bands signal a correction toward $96,530. pic.twitter.com/I7IGhKcXjX — Ali (@ali_charts) October 15, 2025 If not, a move down toward the model’s mean at $96,526 is possible. These pricing bands are used to map past tops and bottoms. Bitcoin is now in the middle range, with no clear direction until it breaks above or falls below one of these thresholds. On-Chain Data Shows Shift in Market Behavior Data from XWIN Research Japan suggests Bitcoin is now in a later stage of the cycle. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) sits at +0.52. In past years, this level marked a shift from growing optimism to more speculative behavior. Around 97% of the supply is now in profit. Short-term holders now represent 44% of Bitcoin’s realized capitalization. This is the highest level recorded. It shows that many long-term holders are selling into strength while newer buyers step in. According to XWIN, “ This time the structure appears different ,” pointing to ETF inflows and broader liquidity as stabilizing forces. As long as the price stays below resistance, the breakout is still unconfirmed. A move above $119,000, along with a break in RSI, could signal that the trend is continuing.

During September, U.S. ETFs gathered $152.50 billion in net inflows, the second-highest monthly total on record, bringing year-to-date inflows to $951.27 billion—already surpassing last year’s full-year record of $740.78 billion. Assets have now posted 41 consecutive months of net inflows, ETFGI said, highlighting sustained investor demand even amid higher rates and market volatility. The continued growth and demand shows the dominance of ETFs as the preferred vehicle for both institutional and retail investors. Volatility, Commodities and Crypto Lead September Inflows The top 10 U.S. exchange-traded products (ETPs) by net new assets collectively added $803 million during September. The largest single inflow came from the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX US), which pulled in $272.99 million, reflecting renewed hedging demand as equity volatility resurfaced. Close behind were crypto-related funds, which continued to rank among the month’s biggest asset gatherers. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC US) recorded $140.66 million in September inflows, while its sister product, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH US), attracted $78.54 million. Together, the two vehicles brought in nearly $220 million, showing investor interest in digital-asset exposure through regulated instruments. The VanEck Merk Gold ETF (OUNZ US) added $101.66 million, reinforcing gold’s continued role as a hedge alongside crypto. Meanwhile, commodity-linked funds such as the United States Copper Index Fund (CPER US) and ProShares Ultra DJ-UBS Natural Gas (BOIL US) benefited from cyclical demand for raw-material exposure. Crypto ETFs Cement Their Place in Mainstream Portfolios ETFGI’s data highlight how digital-asset ETFs have matured from speculative novelty to permanent fixture. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF now oversees $5.46 billion, while the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETFmanages $3.00 billion. Their steady inflows contrast with outflows seen across leveraged and inverse products, suggesting investors are treating Bitcoin and Ethereum as longer-term growth plays rather than short-term trades. With more than $1.38 trillion in net inflows over the past 12 months, ETFGI said the industry remains on pace to finish 2025 at another all-time high. Rising adoption of spot crypto products and tokenization-themed ETFs could provide an additional tailwind in the fourth quarter. Volatility Shares Files 27 Leveraged ETFs Targeting Crypto New ETF launches in the U.S. continue to accelerate, with issuers introducing products across equities, commodities, and digital assets to meet growing investor demand. Recently Volatility Shares filed for 27 new leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming to deliver 3x and 5x exposure to a mix of leading technology and digital asset-related equities. The proposed lineup includes single-stock and crypto-linked ETFs tied to firms such as Nvidia, Tesla, MicroStrategy, Palantir, and Coinbase, as well as digital assets like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and XRP. The products, which would expand Volatility Shares’ footprint in the leveraged ETF segment, are slated for an effective date of December 29, 2025, with tickers and fees yet to be disclosed.

That explosive growth made early investors major profits and sealed the fate of Solana as one of the most promising projects of the decade. Traders are now perceiving similar potential in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project currently sits at $0.035 and is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with over 65% sold out. Mutuum Finance has had over $17.35 million raised in presale and is a next-gen DeFi token with a compelling roadmap, innovative technologies, and the type of early momentum that could see it achieve breakout success to give it the moniker “Solana 2.0” among investors looking to the future. Solana’s 2021 Meteoric Rise Becomes the New Benchmark of the Next Crypto Giant In 2021, Solana (SOL) shocked the crypto market with one of the greatest rallies in market history. Beginning the year at approximately $1.50, SOL soared to a new all-time high above $258 within months based on the strength of its lightning-fast transactions, fees as low as possible, and growing ecosystem of decentralized apps and NFTs. This explosive growth made early investors major winners and made Solana’s name synonymous with innovation and scalability within the world of blockchain technology. As traders now look to the future to 2025, most are still looking to find the next project with the potential to produce the same kind of trajectory, and growing interest is turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), that is beginning to generate the same kind of early eagerness that once existed towards Solana. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Goes Mainstream Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making the headlines among investors this week with a big jump in Phase 6 of the presale. The tokens are now offered at $0.035, a 16.17% jump from the previous one. More than 17,040 investors already made the purchase thus making a sum of over $17.35 million, healthfully indicating a growing market belief in the bright future of Mutuum Finance in the DeFi market. More than 65% already sold in Phase 6 alone, early investors making their buy-ins ahead of the next hike. Even collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. In the case of stable, proper prices as well as risk valuation, oracles used are the Chainlink oracles for AVAX, MATIC, ETH, as well as USD feeds. Fallback oracles, sophisticated data feeds, as well as distributed exchange TWAPS prevent valuation based on a protocol’s record-record volatility or illiquidity remaining incorrect. Mutuum lending and borrowing protocol will be released at any time this quarter. Version 1(V1) of the same will be released on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4, 2025, and will consist of principal constituents as follows: liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be offered at the initiation for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will provide the users with the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. Floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools are also offered by the platform and regulate the supply against the demand for the liquids along with stabilizing the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance Might be the Following “Solana Moment” in 2025 Solana’s 2021 surge, a jump from $1.50 to over $250, is one of crypto’s most storied success stories based on trailblazing scalability, lightning-fast transactions, and a flourishing DeFi ecosystem. The same kind of early-stage momentum and disruption is current around Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now at $0.035 during Phase 6 of the presale, with raised funds over $17.35 million and 17,000+ investors on board, MUTM is exhibiting the same kind of momentum that once surrounded the growth of Solana. Potential investors looking for the “next Solana-style” performer should seriously consider joining the Mutuum Finance presale today and get ahead of the pack before the next momentum surge in the DeFi market.

The exchange discredited CJ’s allegations as false and defamatory and threatened to pursue legal action against the executive for his unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications with Binance officials. Binance acknowledged that it was aware of CJ’s claims and clarified that it does not charge any fees for token listings. It also emphasized that allegations of token dumping by the company and its founders are untrue and unsubstantiated. The exchange stated that it was surprised by CJ’s revelation of sensitive information, which compromised the integrity of what the crypto community considers confidential. The exchange explained that cash or token security deposits are refundable in one to two years. It also asserted that the token allocations are for its users and security deposits are for their protection. The exchange claimed that CJ’s allegations are designed to mislead the community and attack the integrity of its listing process. CJ shares listing offer from Binance offer from @binance : > 1% airdrop on day 1, alpha listing > 3% further airdrops in 6 months > 1% for ""marketing"" at Binance full discretion > provide 100% of TVL for token pool on Pancake Swap ($1M+) > $250k security deposit > 3% reserved for BNB HODLer programme > $200k… — CJ (@cjhtech) October 14, 2025 The Limitless Labs boss claimed that Binance requires alpha listings to set aside 1% of their token supply for an airdrop on the first day. An additional 3% is expected to be airdropped in the first six months, and 1% is for marketing at Binance’s discretion. CJ also disclosed that the exchange requires project owners to provide 100% of the $1M+ TVL for the token pool on Pancake Swap. He revealed that Binance requested a $250,000 security deposit and $2 million worth of BNB tokens as collateral for a spot listing. The CEO further stated that Binance required him to reserve 3% of his tokens for the BNB HODLer program. He also claimed that the exchange wanted $200,000 worth of tokens at the MFN price for its affiliate marketers. Ultimately, CJ was required to distribute 8% of his project’s token supply to Binance users through airdrops and other activities. In support of CJ’s allegations, 6MV founder Mike Dudas confirmed that he had seen Binance’s listing proposals in the past month, which looked exactly like CJ’s. Dudas said he was not required to sign an NDA, so he could not be sued for publicly discussing the details. He claimed that Binance has been running the same playbook for years. Peng criticizes CJ for being immature Crypto Analyst and former Head of Collectibles at TVM Ventures, Howard Peng, clapped at CJ, calling him immature for his unwarranted rant. He said the Limitless boss has no principles and wondered why he casually spoke about Binance’s terms as if it were not a big deal. Peng asked CJ to refuse the deal and move on if he did not like the offer. He then suggested that the disgruntled boss try his luck getting listed on Kraken or Coinbase and see how that works for him. Responding to CJ’s claim that Base was better, the analyst emphasized that Base-related projects are launched in a disorganized way. He pointed out that most of the projects listed on Base dropped by as much as 90% after listing, leaving him wondering what the point of bringing up the network was. “Don’t overestimate yourself — if it weren’t for @KaitoAI Launchpad’s oversubscribed funding, do you really think your product is that great? Have you even tried using your own product?” – Howard Peng , Crypto Analyst Peng also believes that Coinbase listings have lost their retail appeal and that some listings have no trading volume. He believes that it makes no big difference whether an exchange has one more project or one less project. However, he clarified that he was not representing Binance in his personal views.

Here Are Expert Opinions!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/experienced-investor-peter-brandt-predicts-one-last-drop-before-bitcoin-rises-here-are-expert-opinions/,"Following the recent market fluctuations, crypto analysts predict that the current volatility is temporary and that Bitcoin will enter an uptrend again in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Could Experience One Last Drop Before New High: Peter Brandt Experienced investor Peter Brandt said that Bitcoin could retest the $125,100 all-time high (ATH) in the short term, but a significant correction wave could occur in the process. “Either there will be a major shakeout followed by a new ATH within a week, or a breakdown of the parabolic structure could lead to a drop of up to 75%,” Brandt said. Brandt stated that the 80% declines seen in the past will not be repeated, but the price could fall to the $50,000-$60,000 range. More than $19 billion was liquidated in the crypto market after US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday. Bitcoin's price fell from $121,000 to $102,000. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, called the surge a warning about leveraged trading. “Even leverage above 1.5x is dangerous,” he said. “You always have to consider the long-term risks,” he said. Edwards added that his outlook for the coming weeks was “bullish.” BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes wrote on his X account, “Bring the truck back and buy everything,” after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced the end of quantitative tightening. According to Hayes, the period of quantitative easing creates a positive environment for crypto markets because cheaper credit and increased liquidity support investment flows. Pav Hundal, chief analyst at Swyftx, also said that the economic data is sending positive signals for Bitcoin: “With falling oil prices and a weakening labor market, it seems inevitable that the Fed will cut interest rates this month. This could be a golden period for Bitcoin.” Macroeconomist Lyn Alden said in her latest statement, “I think the next quarter will be quite favorable for Bitcoin.” While short-term corrections are possible, Bitcoin could reach new records before the year is out, according to experts. *This is not investment advice.

53169063,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836280,1760515200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53169063.jpeg,RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter warned inflation may be stronger than expected for Q3,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/rba-says-hot-inflation-may-delay-cuts/,"Australia’s central bank has cautioned that persistently high inflation could delay or halt interest rate cuts, despite earlier signs of easing. At the Citi Australia & New Zealand Investment Conference in Sydney on Wednesday, RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter said inflation for July–September is likely stronger than expected, reinforcing market fears that the bank’s rate-cutting cycle could be paused for longer. Reserve Bank of Australia staff are actively reviewing and analysing the latest economic trends as they prepare updated forecasts for the November Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter said. Hunter noted that as the RBA looked ahead, a variety of potential outcomes remained uncertain and that the bank’s approach would continue to be data-dependent. She added that the RBA board would continue to monitor developments and make further adjustments to monetary policy as needed, reaffirming the central bank’s cautious stance as it assessed upcoming inflation data and economic indicators. The RBA’s third-quarter inflation numbers, scheduled for release on Oct. 29, will be a crucial test of the central bank’s belief that inflation is heading back to target. RBA warns inflation could prove tougher to tame Hunter’s remarks follow upside surprises in recent monthly inflation readings for July and August, which indicate that price pressures across services and housing have remained heightened. The RBA, which has cut the cash rate three times already this year to 3.6%, held steady last month, citing the need for more data. Hunter said the RBA aimed to keep inflation, on average across the cycle, around the 2.5% midpoint of the target band in underlying terms. However, she cautioned that persistent inflation, especially in labour-intensive sectors, could delay the target return. Asked about the RBA’s projected neutral rate (the level that doesn’t slow growth), Hunter didn’t offer a specific figure and said it was “a range rather than a point number.” The quarterly CPI will be a key driver for when the next policy shift will come, economists say. Markets are now split: while some participants continue to anticipate a cut at the RBA’s Nov. 3-4 meeting, others regard the decision as too close to call. Traders have also revised down expectations of aggressive easing by early 2026. Economic resilience complicates easing plans Recent data indicate that household spending is holding up better than forecast, supported by more jobs and a rebound in the housing market. The labor market, meanwhile, is tight: Unemployment remains close to 4%. These developments are adding to the arguments for rate stability in an effort to avoid rekindling inflation. The RBA has repeatedly stated that it aims to ensure inflation remains sustainable within its 2-3% target band before cutting rates again. Services inflation in particular has been stubborn, with higher costs of wages and strong demand for goods from sectors such as health, education, and hospitality, the central bank added. In her speech titled “Why Productivity Matters for Central Bankers,” Hunter addressed a deeper structural challenge: sluggish productivity growth. She said Australia’s medium-term productivity outlook had been revised down, with trend growth now expected at 0.7%, compared with 1% previously. That shift implies Australia’s so-called potential growth rate, which is the speed at which it can grow without inflation spiking, is to be a shade lower at 2% a year rather than 2.25%. Hunter said some of the deceleration could be attributed to growth in the care economy, softer mining output, and underinvestment in technology. Hunter conceded that the RBA’s updated assumption for productivity growth might still be too high. She added that, conversely, rapid advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence could develop faster than expected and deliver stronger productivity gains. The lagging productivity trend presents a dilemma for policymakers. Slower productivity implies that any given level of demand would generate more inflation, so the RBA has less comfort in stimulating the economy through rate cuts.

The pullback follows last week’s tariff-driven shock and Monday’s fade from resistance, with traders eyeing whether the dip sets up the next leg higher, or a deeper test of support. Bitcoin Price Rejected at $116K, Liquidations Flush Leverage After rebounding more than $15,000 off the weekend low, the Bitcoin price stalled near $111,500, a level that’s repeatedly attracted seller interest and profit-taking. As price rolled over, a wave of long liquidations swept through derivatives venues, wiping out overleveraged positions and cooling overheated funding. Short-term, $111,000 has emerged as an initial demand zone, with deeper supports clustered near $110,000 and the psychological $105,000–$108,000 band. A decisive daily close back above $116,000 would reassert bullish control and put the prior high back in focus. Macro headlines continue to frame intraday swings. Tariff uncertainty recently amplified volatility across risk assets, though a softer tone from both Washington and Beijing has tempered worst-case fears. That shift helped stabilize crypto broadly, but BTC’s latest rejection shows bulls still need a clean catalyst to reclaim the trend. Sentiment Capitulation: “Buy-the-Fear” Signal? On-chain and social gauges flash a familiar pattern: retail FUD peaked into the drop while “smart money” accumulated, according to market analysts. Santiment’s Brian Q. noted that spikes in negative retail sentiment have repeatedly preceded short-term reversals this cycle, from spring tariff scares to summer geopolitical headlines. Several technicians also highlight a bullish MACD cross on higher time frames, a setup that appeared before previous alt-season advances, even as near-term chop persists. Strategists point to improving market structure after the liquidation sweep: lower funding, cleansed leverage, and still-elevated spot participation. That mix often precedes range rebuilds and trend continuation, provided key supports hold and macro rhetoric doesn’t re-ignite broad de-risking. What to Watch Next Key technical levels remain clear for traders. Immediate support is seen between $110,500–$111,000, followed by a deeper cushion at $110,000. A decisive close above $116,000 would confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $110,000 could expose Bitcoin to the $105,000–$108,000 range. Beyond Bitcoin price action, attention turns to Bitcoin ETF net flows and stablecoin liquidity, which signal broader market participation. Sustained inflows would strengthen the buy-the-dip narrative, while macro factors, such as tariff headlines or surprise data, could still trigger volatility.

However, the announcement has sparked significant criticism within the crypto community. Many users, particularly those on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), have voiced concerns that the criteria for eligibility have not aligned with the developments, leaving several traders, including those from Hyperliquid (HYPE), ineligible for the airdrop. Hyperliquid And HypurrNFT Users Left In The Lurch At the time of the announcement, it was stated that users of Hyperliquid, Phantom perps, and holders of HypurrNFT would be eligible to receive the MON airdrop. Despite this, reports indicate that very few HypurrNFT holders qualify, with some users claiming that their substantial trading volumes—over 200 million on perps—did not meet the eligibility requirements. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency These frustrations have led to comments such as, “this airdrop is a joke,” highlighting the disconnect between the expectations set by Monad and the reality faced by its community. According to the outlined criteria, Monad plans to distribute tokens to over 235,500 users, including active community members who have consistently supported the project on social media and engaged in various initiatives. The criteria also encompass traders with high trading volumes on decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid, long-term holders of popular NFTs (such as CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins), participants in DAO voting on Ethereum-based platforms, contributors to ecosystem development through various roles, and developers actively creating products on Monad and participating in project hackathons. Critics Question Monad’s Commitment To Users Critics, including DeFi researcher Coin Metrika, have sharply criticized Monad’s airdrop strategy. Metrika pointed out that the published eligibility criteria shocked many within the crypto community, revealing that only 5,500 wallets are considered eligible—representing just 0.74% of Monad’s Discord users. Related Reading: Tether Resolves Celsius Lawsuit With Major $300 Million Settlement Deal Meanwhile, the project is distributing airdrops to 225,000 addresses outside of its community, many of whom may not even be aware of Monad or the impending claim deadline. In a sarcastic commentary, Coin Metrika summarized the situation, stating: If you haven’t figured it out yet, here’s a summary of #MonadAirdrop criteria: You have roles in Discord that are difficult to obtain—thank you, we’re not interested in you because you’re poor! You participated in our testnet—thank you for helping us test the product for free, which we sold to investors for a lot of money. Dressed up in clown costumes and shot viral videos to promote the @monad brand—thank you, we laughed out loud at you. You have money that you’ve shown on the blockchain—let’s be friends, here’s your airdrop! This highlights the increasing dissatisfaction within the Hyperliquid, HypurrNFT and wider crypto communities regarding how Monad has handled its airdrop initiative, raising questions about its commitment to its users. At the time of writing, HYPE trades at $39, recording losses of 13% over the past seven days.

Bitcoin Is Making Yet Another Retest Of The STH Realized Price As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin could be at the fourth step of the short-term holder (STH) Realized Price cycle. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that measures the average cost basis of the investors on the BTC network. When the value of this metric is greater than the spot price, it means the overall market is carrying a net unrealized loss. On the other hand, it being below BTC’s value suggests the average holder is in the green. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Unlike LUNA & FTX Collapses, Says Glassnode: Here’s Why In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a specific segment of investors is of interest: the STHs. These are the BTC holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This group is considered to include the fickle-minded bunch of the sector, prone to making panic moves during volatile periods. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price of the STHs over the last couple of months: As is visible in the above graph, Bitcoin has made a few retests of the STH Realized Price during the last few weeks and each time, the level has held so far. The reason behind the indicator acting as support lies in how investor psychology tends to work. As the analyst has broken down in the chart, STHs typically follow a five-step cycle during bullish phases. The first three steps involve some degree of buying from the group upon retests of their cost basis from above. These holders consider the retraces to their break-even level as dip-buying opportunities. By the fourth retest, however, they can become exhausted, and may decide to stop their accumulation. This is when the level stops providing support to the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BNB Shoots Up 6%: Is This Just The Start Of A Run To $2,400? From the chart, it’s visible that the latest retrace in Bitcoin has once again brought its value near the STH Realized Price. Given that this is the fourth retest, Maartunn has noted that this could potentially be the fourth step in the STH cycle. It will now be interesting to see how the asset’s price develops in the coming days. A sustained move below the level may confirm a breakdown of support and lead to the fifth and final step of the STH cycle, where these investors start looking at their break-even level as an opportunity to exit the market instead, thus turning what was once support into resistance. BTC Price Bitcoin dropped to $110,000 earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back to $113,000.

The document, published online in February 2023, discusses how blockchain is reshaping the financial sector and names several institutional examples. Within that discussion, it explicitly refers to “the American Express instant blockchain-based payment system, which was developed on the Ripple platform.” The excerpt attached by SMQKE presents blockchain as a transformative force within finance, healthcare, education, and other industries, emphasizing its ability to deliver fast, secure, and transparent data transactions at reduced cost. It cites the Interbank Information Network, led by J.P. Morgan, Australia–New Zealand Banking Group, and the Royal Bank of Canada, as one of the largest blockchain networks in operation. The mention of American Express’s system appears immediately after, identifying it as a frequently used blockchain payment application built upon Ripple’s distributed ledger technology. Ripple developed a blockchain-based platform that is “frequently used” by American Express. See for yourself. https://t.co/Aq7FXU9Kh0 pic.twitter.com/tgZumIfvf6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 13, 2025 Implications of the Document The document offers more than speculation; it provides a verified academic acknowledgment of Ripple’s practical integration within the financial industry. It indicates that American Express utilized Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure to enable instant payments, confirming the platform’s use in mainstream economic systems. The academic citation carries weight, as peer-reviewed works undergo rigorous evaluation before publication, suggesting the information originated from verifiable sources available at the time of writing. The excerpt also notes that Ripple functions as a distributed ledger incorporating servers and crypto tokens known as XRP . This description aligns with Ripple’s established framework, where transactions are validated across a decentralized network to achieve high-speed settlement. The academic context reinforces Ripple’s status as a technology provider that has contributed to tangible blockchain applications within the global banking ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Context in Financial Technology Blockchain adoption among major financial institutions has accelerated as firms seek faster and more cost-effective solutions for cross-border settlements. By citing both the Interbank Information Network and the American Express–Ripple collaboration, the publication cites these initiatives as leading examples of blockchain integration in finance. These cases demonstrate that blockchain technology has moved beyond experimental stages and into real-world payment operations among globally recognized institutions. Although the excerpt does not elaborate on current transaction volumes or the operational scale of American Express’s use of Ripple , the acknowledgment alone substantiates that such an implementation occurred and was actively recognized in academic literature. It further supports the view that Ripple’s infrastructure has played a direct role in enhancing payment efficiency within major financial networks. SMQKE’s post is grounded in documented academic evidence that American Express developed an instant blockchain-based payment system on Ripple’s platform. The source not only verifies Ripple’s involvement but also highlights its integration into the practical operations of a global payments leader.

SOPR Hits 6-Month Low — $2.50 Crosshair,https://coinpaper.com/11678/xrp-rebound-imminent-sopr-hits-6-month-low-2-50-crosshair,"XRP’s SOPR Hits 6-Month Low: Could History Repeat Itself? According to market commentator Xaif Crypto, XRP’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has just dropped to 0.95, marking its lowest level in six months. SOPR, a key on-chain metric used to gauge investor behavior, indicates whether coins moved on a particular day were sold at a profit or loss. Values below 1 suggest that holders are selling at a loss, often signaling potential market capitulation and setting the stage for a rebound. XRP’s SOPR has historically signaled early price reversals. When it last hit 0.92 on April 7, XRP jumped 35%, soaring from $1.90 to $2.58 in days. Traders are now watching closely, as a repeat scenario may be in play. Xaif Crypto added, “Now with a low near $2.38, next potential target: $3.10–$3.35.” XRP is presently trading at $2.50 , just above recent lows. If history repeats, analysts see potential upside to $3.10–$3.35, signaling a notable gain that’s drawing both retail and institutional interest. Notably, XRP’s SOPR has hit a six-month low, signaling a potential market turning point. Historically, such levels have preceded strong rebounds, with targets around $3.10–$3.35. Traders and investors may be looking at one of the most attractive risk-reward setups in crypto right now. XRP Eyes Critical Bounce as Market Reacts to ABC Pattern According to market analyst Lingrid, XRP is showing signs of reactive buying pressure, hinting at a potential squeeze as the recent pullback evolves into an ABC corrective pattern. Therefore, this technical setup is capturing traders’ attention, as the coin approaches crucial support and resistance zones that could define its next directional move. Lingrid highlights the $2.50 level as the key support that must hold to maintain bullish momentum. A failure to defend this zone could open the door to further downside, with a potential fade toward $2.30. On the flip side, if buyers manage to defend this level, XRP may see a trend resumption, with initial resistance at $2.85–$2.90 acting as the first “lid” for gains. Surpassing this range could pave the way toward the $3.18 target line, signaling a more pronounced rebound. Therefore, XRP is showing signs of a reactive market, with short-term bids testing support ahead of a potential squeeze. The ABC corrective pattern suggests that holding above $2.50 could reignite bullish momentum, while a drop below risks sharper losses. Key levels now define clear opportunities for risk management and strategic entries or exits. XRP sits at a critical technical juncture. Key support at $2.50 must hold, while resistance at $2.85–$2.90 and the $3.18 target mark define upside potential. Traders should watch price and volume closely to assess whether a bullish continuation or deeper correction is likely. Conclusion XRP’s SOPR hitting a six-month low signals a potential market turning point. Capitulation at $2.38 historically precedes sharp rebounds, with past rallies surging 35% and technical targets pointing to $3.10–$3.35, giving traders a clear roadmap for potential opportunities.

The Mayor signed an executive order on Tuesday, strengthening the City’s bid to become the global crypto capital. The new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain aims to promote “responsible innovation” and alignment across stakeholders. Mayor Adams has appointed crypto policy expert Moises Rendon to lead the office as executive director. “Mayor Adams’ creation of this new office proves that the future is now for digital assets and blockchain in New York City,” said Rendon. We're embracing the technologies of tomorrow, today! With our new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain, we'll be able to grow our economy and attract world-class talent through cryptocurrency and blockchain tech: https://t.co/7yIrfdLPZN — NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) October 14, 2025 Digital Assets Office to Strengthen City’s Role in Crypto The municipal office for crypto will develop strategies to strengthen the city’s role as a hub for the industry, per an official statement from the NYC Mayor’s office. Besides, it will evaluate new digital assets and develop initiatives that educate the public. Further, the establishment will coordinate efforts across agencies to ensure alignment of policies, services, and digital asset initiatives “The age of digital assets is here, and with it comes the chance to grow our economy, attract world-class talent, expand opportunities for underbanked communities, and make government more user-friendly,” said Mayor Adams. Mayor Adams has embraced crypto way before America’s current pro-crypto outlook. He received his first three mayoral paychecks – worth $30,000 roughly at the time – in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in January 2022. Later the same year, the mayor said he still held the two popular cryptos, despite extreme market turbulence. The crypto paycheck stunt earned him the title ‘Bitcoin Mayor.’ ‘Pro-Crypto’ Mayor Adams Ends Reelection Capaign – Who’s Next? Last month, Mayor Adams ended his reelection campaign , citing financial struggles. Zohran Mamdani, who won the New York mayoral primary election on June 24, will face off against other candidates, including former governor Andrew Cuomo, in November. Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race, has largely remained silent on crypto. In June, Tyler Winklevoss called New York City a “broken kleptocracy.” Regarding Mamdani’s surging popularity in the mayoral election, he said, “It appears things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.” The post NYC Mayor Establishes ‘Nation’s-First’ Crypto-Centric Office Ahead of His Exit appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|New York|NYC Mayor,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-15 08:18:51
