The bank reported $22.09 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $21.09 billion, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.24, above the forecast of $1.90. Citi’s net income jumped 15% year-on-year to $3.8 billion, driven by robust performance in its services, banking, and markets segments. The services business delivered its best quarter ever, with revenue up 7% from the same period a year ago. The banking division recorded a 34% surge, while the markets unit posted its strongest third quarter, climbing 15%. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said, “Investments in new products, crypto, and AI are driving innovation and improved capabilities across the franchise. The relentless execution of our strategy is delivering stronger business performance quarter after quarter and improving our returns.” Citi pushes ahead with Banamex stake sale and faces higher costs Amid the upbeat earnings , Citi confirmed that it is selling a 25% equity stake in its Mexican arm, Banamex, ahead of a public stock offering. The planned sale, part of its broader restructuring strategy, lifted overall expenses by 9% last quarter due to transaction-related costs. Including the Banamex goodwill impairment charge, the bank’s profit jumped 23% to $1.86 billion from a year earlier. Despite the added costs, Citi’s stock has surged more than 40% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500, which has faced renewed market turbulence tied to trade disputes. The strong quarterly results underscore the bank’s continued progress in optimizing its structure while maintaining steady earnings growth. Wall Street ends mixed as trade tensions resurface Markets saw wild swings on Tuesday as investors reacted to both the solid banking results and another flare-up between Washington and Beijing. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower at 6,644.31, after falling as much as 1.5% and rising 0.4% during the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 202.88 points, or 0.4%, to close at 46,270.46, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8% to 22,521.70. Tech stocks stayed under pressure, with Nvidia dragging the Nasdaq lower after recent losses. Caterpillar led the gains on the Dow. The start of Wall Street’s Q3 earnings season helped offset some of the volatility as Citi climbed 3.9%, Wells Fargo jumped 7.2%, and both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs topped estimates but slipped slightly by the end of the day. The market turbulence came after President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of China, accusing Beijing of failing to purchase U.S. soybeans as promised. His comments pulled the S&P 500 into the red late in the day, following an earlier rally sparked by optimism over strong corporate earnings. Late last week, Trump had threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a move that sent the Dow plunging over 800 points on Friday, its largest drop since April 10 when Trump announced ‘Liberation Day.’ By Sunday, however, Trump took a softer tone on Truth Social, writing, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine.” Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) (Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge) hit a four-month high above 22 during the day before closing at 20.81, reflecting investor caution over potential future shocks.

Beverage company Safety Shot, Inc. has officially rebranded to Bonk, Inc., marking the first time a memecoin-linked brand has found a home on a major U.S. exchange. The firm began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ BNKK ” on Friday, October 10, 2025. Today, the BONK ecosystem officially has a home in the public markets!

Nom), a BONK core contributor and board member, emphasized that this move officially gives the BONK ecosystem a home in the public markets. BONK Down 17.98% but Holds $1.3B Market Cap The BONK token is currently trading at $0.00001629, down 17.98% over the past seven days following a market-wide liquidation flush. Despite the pullback, BONK maintains a market cap above $1.3 billion , ranking among the top 65 cryptocurrencies globally. Analysts suggest BONK’s recent weakness may be temporary, with the token showing signs of stabilization. Technical charts indicate that clearing resistance around $0.0000165 to $0.0000186 could trigger a move toward 2024 highs near $0.00005916, over 100% upside from current levels. BONK price prediction: Rounded Bottom Pattern Indicates Potential Trend Reversal After a volatile sell-off earlier this month, BONK appears to be staging a sharp recovery. The 2-day chart shows BONK bounced aggressively from the 0.00001134 USDT support zone, forming a rounded bottom pattern, a classic reversal indicator. BONK is now trading near 0.0000166 USDT, testing descending trendline resistance from its August highs. Source: TradingView A breakout above this line would signal trend reversal, supported by rising On-Balance Volume (OBV), suggesting strong accumulation at lower levels. The next key zone lies between 0.00001764 and 0.00001870 USDT. A sustained close above this level could trigger a rally toward 0.00002607 USDT and potentially 0.00003000 USDT.

Right now, it is holding the $0.20 zone, and most analysts’ price predictions for Dogecoin remain bullish for a rebound, even though a short-term correction seems likely. At the same time, Wall Street’s interest in crypto has been strong lately. Despite the chaos, House of Doge , the business arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, went public to push DOGE further into mainstream finance and traditional commerce. Dogecoin Hits Nasdaq Through House of Doge—Here’s Why It Matters House of Doge is about to hit Nasdaq after a reverse takeover by Brag House Holdings (ticker: TBH), a college-focused gaming and streaming company. TBH had already jumped more than 40% in the last two weeks before today’s announcement. The move could be a big win. With access to more capital, House of Doge can speed up its plan to build global payment rails for Dogecoin and expand much faster. The company is also backed by Elon Musk’s personal attorney and sees going public as another step toward making Dogecoin a universal payment method. Brag House is making history! We’ve signed a definitive merger agreement with House of Doge — the commercial arm of the Dogecoin Foundation — For the House of Doge to list on NASDAQ and bring payments, tokenization, gaming, and yield to crypto's most loyal community. pic.twitter.com/nLzcX6vkRW — Brag House (@BragHouse) October 13, 2025 Brag House targets Gen Z gamers, college esports, and interactive streaming, which already line up perfectly with crypto culture. Adding Dogecoin into tournaments, rewards, and creator payouts could make it a natural, everyday currency for gamers. It also unlocks real utility through payments and microtransactions. DOGE could become a go-to coin for buying digital goods, tipping creators, and paying for entry fees in competitions. And the Nasdaq listing gives Dogecoin a new level of visibility. Since Brag House is already a listed company, this merger gives DOGE a publicly traded link to Wall Street and opens the door for institutional investors who want DOGE exposure without holding crypto directly. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is $1 DOGE Finally Possible? Source: DOGEUSD / Tradingview Here’s the deal with this DOGE chart . The price broke down cleanly from that rising wedge, which had been flashing weakness for weeks. But with House of Doge going public and ETF hype heating up, this could be setting up for something pretty interesting. The dump below $0.20 confirmed the bearish break, and you can see how it wicked straight into that $0.18 zone before bouncing. The RSI sitting around 38 shows it’s still leaning bearish but still not oversold yet, so there’s room either way. If DOGE can reclaim $0.22 and hold, it might crawl back toward $0.30, maybe even $0.50 later if market momentum changes. But if it loses $0.18 again, $0.15’s next, that’s the make-or-break zone before it spirals lower. Right now, it’s just chilling in recovery mode, but still risky unless bulls show up with real volume. Forget Dogecoin, Meet the New Leading Memecoin: Maxi Doge Maxi Doge is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme market. Dogecoin might be holding strong, but the spotlight is starting to shift toward something new and wilder. Built on Ethereum, Maxi Doge brings back that same hype and humor that made Dogecoin iconic, but this time with smarter tokenomics, bigger rewards, and a community that feels hungry for another run. The project has already raised over 3.6 million in presale, and people are talking nonstop about it. Around forty percent of the supply went straight to the public with no insider allocations, so it avoids the usual whale dump drama that kills most meme coins early. On top of that, early stakers are earning up to 84% percent APY before launch, which is fueling even more interest. Maxi Doge fits right into the moment. It is basically the next evolution of Dogecoin energy, upgraded for the new crypto crowd and built to dominate this cycle.

Members of the current administration and the general public were warned by activist Laura Loomer not to fall for the alleged incoming efforts to whitewash the founder of the defunct FTX exchange that led to the market crash and subsequent bear market of 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried. SBF is pushing for a pardon Conservative activist and commentator Laura Loomer has alleged the existence of a “highly mobilized and well funded” effort to secure a presidential pardon for the disgraced founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. In a post shared on the social media platform X on March 11, 2025, Loomer claimed that political operatives and consultants within “Trump world” were being persuaded to advocate for Bankman-Fried’s release and that the effort was financially motivated. “There is a highly mobilized and well funded effort on the right to lobby Trump world to pardon crypto scammer @SBF_FTX Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote . “His family members are actively working with a firm to get the Trump admin to have Trump pardon SBF.” Loomer described the initiative as “deeply concerning,” and stressed that it was contradictory of conservative values to show support for a figure who was one of the Democratic Party’s largest financial backers before his downfall. Prior to his incarceration, Bankman-Fried was the second-largest donor to Democrats and contributed millions of dollars ahead of the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, the financier, George Soros, is the largest donor to Democrats. Federal prosecutors later revealed that many of these political contributions were made using misappropriated customer funds. In 2024, Bankman-Fried was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release and $11B in forfeiture. Laura Loomer doubles down on ‘Influence Campaign’ allegations In a more recent post on X, Loomer stated that the efforts to free SBF had intensified and that media narratives that are sympathetic to him are part of an organized influence campaign. “You’re going to start seeing a lot more in the news about Sam Bankman-Fried,” Loomer wrote. “There is a massive and well-funded lobby effort to get this criminal pardoned. He’s going to pretend like he was a victim of Joe Biden and the Democrats after he funded all of the Left’s campaigns. Don’t fall for it.” She further claimed that certain online influencers belonging to the conservative group had begun portraying Bankman-Fried as a “victim” following reports that he was placed in solitary confinement after giving an interview to Tucker Carlson. Loomer described this change in tone as part of a deliberate “social media influence campaign.” There are no public records or official statements that confirm any of Loomer’s claims of an organized effort. The Trump campaign and Bankman-Fried’s legal representatives have also never commented on the allegations. Despite this, her allegations are a point of conversation within conservative circles. Loomer’s posts gained some traction on X, and users have both amplified her warnings and also questioned her sources. Some conservative commentators have echoed her concerns, arguing that granting clemency to Bankman-Fried would contradict the populist and anti-corruption rhetoric that is the foundation of Donald Trump’s politics. The controversy also underscores how cryptocurrency continues to shape political dynamics across both democratic and conservative parties.

The market remains fragile following the historic volatility from Friday’s crash, which erased billions in leveraged positions and triggered widespread uncertainty. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets While the price has managed to stabilize above key moving averages for now, momentum appears to be weakening as buyers struggle to absorb continued selling pressure. Some analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, a deeper correction toward the $105,000–$107,000 region could follow, marking another shakeout before a potential recovery. Top analyst Axel Adler shared new data shedding light on the magnitude of Friday’s event. According to his analysis, spot trading volume surged to $44 billion, nearing cycle highs, while futures volume hit $128 billion. More notably, open interest declined by $14 billion, yet only $1 billion of that was from BTC long liquidations. Adler explains this was a controlled deleveraging event, not a liquidation cascade — suggesting that market participants reduced risk manually rather than being forced out. Still, volatility remains elevated as Bitcoin fights to maintain structural support. A Controlled Reset Amid Growing Fear According to Axel Adler, the recent market crash revealed an important yet underappreciated aspect of Bitcoin’s maturity. Data shows that 93% of the $14 billion decline in open interest (OI) during Friday’s sell-off wasn’t forced — meaning it wasn’t the result of automatic liquidations. Instead, traders and institutions chose to reduce leverage manually, closing positions to protect capital. Adler describes this as a “controlled deleveraging”, a stark contrast to previous cycles where similar crashes often triggered chaotic cascades of liquidations. This behavior marks a turning point in Bitcoin’s market structure. It indicates that participants — especially institutional players — are managing risk more prudently, reinforcing a more stable and mature trading environment. In past cycles, sharp liquidations often caused extreme volatility, magnifying losses across the board. This time, however, the market handled unprecedented stress with relative discipline. Still, despite this sign of structural maturity, the emotional landscape has shifted dramatically. As Bitcoin loses value and hovers near the $110,000–$112,000 support zone, fear is spreading across the market. Many short-term traders are exiting positions, while long-term holders are reassessing exposure amid rising uncertainty. Adler notes that this phase — where fear peaks and confidence wanes — often defines the next market direction. If demand returns at these levels, Bitcoin could confirm a healthy reset before the next rally. But failure to hold support may test investors’ conviction, potentially pushing BTC into a deeper corrective phase before broader accumulation resumes. Related Reading: Ethereum OI Jumps +8.2% As Traders Chase The Pump: Leverage Fueling ETH Again Bitcoin Holds Key Support, But Momentum Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading around $110,300, sitting directly on a key support zone after another round of selling pressure hit the market. The 4-hour chart shows BTC struggling to maintain upward momentum after failing to break above the $116,000–$117,500 resistance range, a level that previously acted as strong demand during earlier rallies. The rejection from this area triggered a sharp pullback, pushing BTC below both the 50 EMA (blue line) and the 200 EMA (red line) — a sign of weakening short-term structure. The price is now testing horizontal support around $110,000, which aligns with the late September consolidation range. A clean breakdown below this level could expose Bitcoin to further downside, with the next potential support around $106,000–$107,000.

For a sustainable recovery, Bitcoin must reclaim $114,000 and re-establish itself above the short-term moving averages. Until then, the market remains in a fragile equilibrium — with bulls defending key support and bears maintaining control of short-term momentum. The next few sessions will be decisive for BTC’s direction.

The retreat cut short a market recovery that saw the flagship cryptocurrency briefly cross $116,000 on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $112,030. Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Register Heavy Outflows US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs registered a combined $755 million in outflows on October 13 as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. According to data from SoSoValue, US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $326.5 million in net outflows on Monday, with Grayscale’s GBTC accounting for the bulk of redemptions. GBTC saw $145.3 million in outflows, followed by Bitwise’s BITB with $115.6 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC with $93.2 million. However, BlackRock’s IBIT registered $60 million in inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs registered $428.5 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s ETHA led the redemptions with $310 million. No Ethereum ETFs registered any inflows. Hyperliquid Trader Doubles Down On Bitcoin (BTC) Short The Hyperliquid whale, who netted $192 million after shorting the market, has doubled down on their new short position, loading up nearly half a billion over the past two days. According to data from Hypurrscan, the whale’s short position is currently worth $496 million at 10x leverage, and a Bitcoin liquidation price of $124,270. The whale doubled their bet over the past 24 hours, initially opening the position with $163 million. The investor first appeared on the crypto community’s radar two months ago, holding a staggering $11 billion in BTC . The trader opened up $900 million in short positions on BTC and ETH last week. The whale gained even more attention after opening a short position minutes before US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to a crash in the crypto market. The identity behind the whale is yet to be confirmed. However, blockchain investigators hinted at a potential connection with Garrett Jin, former CEO of BitForex, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange. On-chain investigator Eye alleged the whale was Jin, leading to Binance CEO reposting the thread. However, ZachXBT suggested it was likely one of Jin’s friends. Jin essentially confirmed the connection when he replied to Zhao, stating, “@cz_binance, thanks for sharing my personal and private information. To clarify, I have no connection with the Trump family or@DonaldJTrumpJr — this isn’t insider trading.” Only minutes later, Jin made another post, stating, “The fund isn’t mine — it’s my clients’. We run nodes and provide in-house insights for them.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp drop during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $109,945 before reclaiming $110,000 and moving to its current level of $111,288. The flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.96% on Saturday, settling at $110,768. However, it made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced volatility and selling pressure on Monday but ultimately registered a marginal increase, settling at $115,274. BTC is down nearly 4% during the ongoing session. The decline cut short BTC’s recovery, which had seen it reclaim $115,000. Markets were rattled as the latest trade war flashpoint showed few signs of easing. Beijing hit back at Washington, stating it was prepared to “fight to the end” in a trade war. China also accused the US of discriminatory trade prices. The latest escalation could undermine an earlier framework between the US and China. China also justified its export controls on rare earth minerals, and gave little indication of caving in to US pressure. While Beijing noted that working-level talks were ongoing, it warned against imposing more tariffs. An October 14 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee revealed that the BTC on centralized exchanges has fallen to around 2.4 million BTC , the lowest level since 2015. When fewer coins are available on exchanges, selling pressure tends to ease, often leading to major price rallies, as seen in 2020 and 2021. According to Lee’s analysis, while prices may appear weak in the short term, the underlying bullish structure is intact. If long-term holders, institutional investors, and ETFs transfer their assets into cold storage, the supply could get even more restricted. BTC traded in bullish territory last week, and began the previous week with a 1.41% increase to $122,318. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday before reaching an intraday high of $125,750 on Sunday. BTC ultimately ended the weekend at $123,520, up 0.87%. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.97% and settled at $124,720, but not before reaching an intraday high of $126.296. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 3% to $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC fell 1.32% to a low of $119,713 before settling at $121,714. BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was in retaliation for China's imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with BTC down nearly 4%, trading around $111,700. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Friday’s market crash wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars from the crypto market cap, with over $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. USDe Depeg Was Due To An Oracle Issue Guy Young, the CEO of USDe creator Ethena Labs , clarified that the USDe depeg on Binance occurred due to an internal oracle issue and not because of the underlying collateral. Young claimed that USDe minting and redeeming worked perfectly during Friday’s market crash, adding that traders redeemed $2 billion in USDe from various exchanges with minimal price deviations. Young stated that USDe fell from $1 to $0.65 on Binance during Friday’s crash because the exchange was using oracle data from its own orderbook, which offered thinner liquidity. Young had stated, “The severe price discrepancy was isolated to a single venue, which referenced the oracle index on its own orderbook, not the deepest pool of liquidity, and was facing deposit and withdrawal issues during the event, which did not allow market makers to close the loop. No one would have been liquidated on any money market with oracles referencing the deepest pools of liquidity for USDe globally.” The Disruption On Binance USDe’s drop created panic within the crypto community, with traders believing the stablecoin had depegged across the market. However, data revealed that the crash was confined to Binance, with prices stable on other trading platforms. Young clarified that the event was “isolated to a single venue,” highlighting that Binance faced deposit and withdrawal issues. A Coordinated Attack? Traders had speculated whether the depegging was part of a coordinated attack to exploit the “Unified Account” feature on Binance, which allows users to post assets, including USDe, as collateral. The feature uses Binance’s own order book instead of external price oracles. Many traders have described this as a major vulnerability. Binance had stated it would address the issue by October 14 and migrate to data from external oracles. Traders believe attackers took advantage of this window and dumped up to $90 million in USDe on Binance, lowering its value to $0.65 on the platform, leading to nearly $1 billion in liquidations. The attackers then opened short positions on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Hyperliquid, minutes before President Trump’s tariff announcement, which sent markets into meltdown. Binance Paid $283M In Compensation Binance reportedly paid around $283 million in compensation to users of three assets, including USDe. Executives apologized to users after Friday’s market crash, which caused three assets in Binance Earn markets, Ethena's stablecoin USDe, Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token BNSOL, and Wrapped Beacon liquid staking token WBETH to depeg. The exchange compensated futures, margin, and loan users who held USDE, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral, and were impacted by the crash between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC.

The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project has also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone and has raised $902,686 so far. Fundraising remains strong despite markets falling back into bearish territory. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For Next Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which is set to occur in just over eighteen hours, as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00021485 to $0.00021548. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the project’s fledgling community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. The project also crossed the $900,000 milestone last week after several delays as the cryptocurrency market struggled with volatility and selling pressure in September. As a result, fundraising slowed down before picking up again after markets rebounded. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $902,686 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Cryptocurrency Market Back In Bearish Territory Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market fell back into the red, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens registering substantial declines. BTC failed to capitalize on momentum after reclaiming $115,000 as selling pressure returned. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency registered a dramatic decline and is currently trading around $112,750. Ethereum (ETH) has also registered a notable decline, down almost 2%, trading around $4,071. Ripple (XRP) is down 1.50%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, trading around $0.202. Solana (SOL) has bucked the bearish trend, rising 3%, but Cardano (ADA) is down 1%, trading around $0.698. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines.

According to Coinomist Magazine data , BNB Chain processed over 500 million transactions in the past 30 days, marking a 151% month-over-month increase.

Sights are still set on its $1,650 target, leaving room for a further 40% upwards move. In the short term, market sentiment may catch up to BNB as momentum indicators signal a cooling phase. The RSI has reversed from overbought territory above 70, often marking a local top. Still, the MACD histogram’s wide gap above the signal line suggests the uptrend remains strong. A retest of psychological support around $1,000 stands as a credible local bottom. Looking ahead, U.S. interest rate cuts could reignite risk appetite into 2026. With growing capital rotation into meme coins, BNB could surge another 150% to $3,000 under stronger demand conditions. BestWallet: Storing Crypto Can Net You Gains Too Tired of missing early gems?

Per a report from the Russian media outlet Ren TV , illegal mining farms are “leaving Russians without power and hitting their wallets.” Illegal crypto miners in a Russian facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) Russia: Illegal Crypto Miners Cost Taxpayers Dearly The broadcaster reported that the fear of facing high taxes on their income and paying prohibitively high electricity costs is “driving many miners into the shadows.” Ren TV explained: “The annual budget losses from underground mining amount to billions of rubles.” Despite recent efforts to legalize the Russian crypto mining sector, so-called “gray-hat mining” has “become Russia’s newest epidemic,” the broadcaster continued. Moscow has ordered all industrial miners to report their operations, earnings, and energy usage data to the Federal Tax Service. In exchange, they have been granted legal “entrepreneurship” status, which allows big investors like banks to provide financing and investment. However, while this is attractive to the country’s biggest players – the likes of BitRiver and Intelion – smaller-scale miners are less keen. The outlet explained that in their quest to save money, crypto miners now “resort to fraud, deception, or under-the-table deals with energy companies.” This means that in many cases, ordinary household and commercial consumers “are forced to pay for crypto miners’ operations.” Southern Russia, the traditional stronghold of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry, has become Russia’s “Mecca of gray-hat mining,” the outlet explained. Hardware in an illegal crypto mining facility. (Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot) ‘Number of Illegal Crypto Mining Farms Rising by the Day’ Ren TV reported that experts believe that there are almost 140,000 Bitcoin and altcoin mining farms operating in Russia. They also think this number is “growing constantly.” But power chiefs say that “the lion’s share” of crypto miners have not declared their operations and “remain underground.” Experts added that buying electricity at commercial and industrial rates “eats up to 80% of crypto miners’ profits.” Their response is often to “cut costs illegally.” Police have recently reported the arrest of an employee at the Omsk Thermal Power Plant who took a 500,000 ruble ($6,270) bribe to let local crypto miners steal power from the grid.

This led to the city’s power grid losing around half a billion rubles ($6.3 million). In Dagestan, meanwhile, power officials found a massive illegal crypto mining farm hidden in coolant tanks. Only when the grid began to suffer issues did power providers finally realize what was happening. A power supply employee said the farm’s total load was 100 kilowatts/hour, adding: “The illegal crypto mining farm was using more power than an entire five-story building.” Another expert explained the appeal of illegal and quasi-legal mining, saying: “With the right approach, taking into account the energy, equipment, premises, and so on, illegal mining is the most profitable type of activity out there.” A Ren TV reporter visited a thermal power plant in Sharya, Kostroma Oblast (Central West Russia), where he showed that a boiler house manager was secretly mining BTC.

(Source: Pianist [CC BY-SA 2.5]) The farm, the reporter continued, “isn’t the only one in the region: There are plenty of companies willing to help miners.” The broadcaster interviewed Sharya residents who said they were “convinced” that miners are responsible for “frequent power outages in their homes.” Russian bailiffs say they have developed new methods to help them convert Bitcoin (BTC) seized in criminal cases into cash for the state’s treasury. #Russia #Bitcoin https://t.co/a8ZnK7uvIX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 These outages “damage household appliances,” the residents said, as these “simply can’t withstand the power surges and break.” No one has compensated them for these damages, the residents complained. In his closing comments, the reporter said: “Crypto entrepreneurs’ illegal businesses are finding it easy to find allies working in energy supply companies. They reap large profits.

While the finding drew attention, it also raised questions about how accurately the data reflected real capital movement. XRP’s Performance During the Recent Market Crash On October 10 , the global cryptocurrency market suffered one of its steepest single-day selloffs, triggered by widespread liquidations exceeding $19 billion. This event marked the largest daily liquidation in crypto history. XRP was among the hardest-hit digital assets, recording roughly $700 million in total liquidations, including about $610 million from long positions. Within hours, XRP’s value fell sharply from $2.80 to $1.58, a decline of more than 43%. The token later stabilized and closed the day at $2.37 before inching higher to around $2.55. Following the event, Rector analyzed on-chain and exchange data to assess the magnitude of XRP’s price reaction relative to capital movement, a method he referred to as measuring the “market cap multiplier effect.” Rector’s 1,200x Multiplier Observation Rector’s findings were based on CoinGlass data tracking changes in market capitalization alongside reported exchange outflows. According to his analysis, during the most volatile hour of trading on October 10, XRP recorded net outflows of approximately $55.8 million while its market capitalization dropped from $152 billion to $83 billion, a decline of about $70 billion. From these figures, Rector calculated a market cap multiplier of roughly 1,254x. He described this as the highest ratio observed since he began monitoring such data in 2024. Extending the analysis over a four-hour timeframe, he estimated total outflows of $64.9 million and a market cap decrease from $162 billion to $82 billion, producing a slightly smaller multiplier of around 1,215x. According to Rector , this level of sensitivity indicates that relatively small inflows or outflows can have an outsized impact on XRP’s valuation. He argued that XRP’s liquidity remains thin and heavily concentrated, leaving the market susceptible to large swings when significant buy or sell orders occur. Implications for Future Institutional Inflows Despite highlighting market fragility, Rector also pointed to the potential upside of such multiplier effects. He suggested that once institutional investment, such as from pending XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , enters the market, the same mechanism could amplify gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rector referenced projections from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, who estimated that XRP ETFs could attract between $5 billion and $10 billion in inflows within the first month of approval. Using conservative multipliers of 100x to 200x, Rector speculated that XRP’s market capitalization could expand by $500 billion to $1 trillion on top of its current valuation if such inflows materialise. Limitations of the Analysis While Rector’s figures generated widespread interest, they come with notable limitations. The data he relied upon reflects exchange flows, which represent the movement of XRP tokens between wallets and exchanges. This does not directly measure the flow of new capital into or out of the overall XRP market. A more precise metric for understanding real buying and selling pressure is the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net balance between executed buy and sell orders over time. CVD provides a clearer view of actual market demand and trading pressure compared to simple exchange movement data. For example, following the October 10 crash, XRP logged three consecutive days of price gains from October 11 to 13, despite mixed exchange flow readings. Exchanges recorded $6 million in outflows on October 11, $21.4 million in inflows on October 12, and $47 million in outflows on October 13, patterns that did not align with XRP’s steady recovery. This inconsistency highlights the flaw in using exchange flow data alone to infer capital inflows or outflows. However, Rector’s broader point, that minor net movements can have major effects on XRP’s market cap, remains valid. The key distinction is that actual capital movement is best captured through metrics like CVD rather than exchange netflows. Rector’s analysis sheds light on how market structure and liquidity can intensify XRP’s price movements. While his multiplier calculations illustrate potential sensitivity within the asset’s market, interpreting them as direct evidence of capital inflows or outflows is misleading. Still, his findings underline the potential impact of institutional money once regulated XRP ETFs enter the market, a factor that could significantly reshape the asset’s valuation landscape.

Scheduled for early November, the event will bring together top executives from across the payments and finance industries. Ripple Swell is our most important event of the year, and this November it returns to NYC. Swell is where leaders in crypto, payments, banking and policy come together to discuss what’s ahead for the future of finance. Request to attend → https://t.co/Iv2tfoBKkY Agenda →… pic.twitter.com/23obZnUauF — Ripple (@Ripple) September 12, 2025 Confirmed speakers include Adena Friedman , CEO of Nasdaq, along with digital asset leads from BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, and CME Group. On November 4, Ripple will present a live demo of stablecoin payments using the XRP Ledger, followed by a keynote from Brad Garlinghouse on the company’s next moves. XRP has dipped 5.4% in the past 24 hours, but with Swell around the corner, momentum could be building beneath the surface. XRP Price Prediction: Key Trend Line Support Held Well During Friday’s Flash Crash The daily chart shows XRP forming a symmetrical triangle , signaling a period of consolidation before its next big move. Last Friday’s flash crash saw the price touch a key support at $1.80 , which held firmly as buyers quickly stepped in — reinforcing its importance. If bearish momentum returns, this is the level to watch. However, the upcoming Swell conference could flip the script entirely if Ripple unveils new initiatives that boost ecosystem growth and adoption. A breakout above the $3 mark would confirm a move out of the triangle, setting the stage for a potential run toward $6 in the months ahead. As long as XRP holds above trend line support, the setup favors a bullish XRP price prediction . And while XRP gears up for a potential breakout, early-stage presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are catching investor attention.

The package is aimed at restoring user confidence and industry stability following a crash that saw some tokens depeg and billions wiped from the crypto derivatives market. The world’s largest crypto exchange said on Tuesday that the initiative, dubbed the “Together Initiative,” would provide both user compensation and institutional support as it works to rebuild trust after the disruption. The announcement comes days after Binance experienced a high-profile glitch that caused Ethena Labs’ USDe and two tokens, BNSOL and WBETH, to briefly lose their pegs, triggering forced liquidations and drawing widespread criticism. Binance had earlier pledged to compensate affected users. Binance promises compensation for affected users In its statement , Binance said that it will distribute up to $300 million in USDC stablecoin to individual traders who experienced forced liquidations between October 10 and 11, during the most volatile hours of the crash. Eligible users are those whose liquidation losses exceeded $50 and represented at least 30% of their net asset value at the time. Payouts, which the company said will begin within 24 hours and conclude within 96 hours, will be sent directly to spot accounts. In addition, Binance will establish a $100 million “Institutional Support Program” to offer low-interest loans to ecosystem partners and institutional clients hit hardest by the crash. The fund, designed to alleviate liquidity pressures and help firms resume trading operations, will be accessible to eligible VIP clients through their account managers. A glitch caused the weekend’s price distortions The new initiative follows Binance’s earlier October 11 announcement that it would fully compensate users affected by the depeg event, which occurred between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. During that window, a glitch caused price distortions for USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH. Binance said it has since completed a review and promised to reimburse all impacted users who experienced forced liquidations across Futures and Margin trading from 00:00 of October 10 to 23:59 UTC of October 11. The company also introduced several technical safeguards to prevent a repeat, including adding redemption prices into the price index weights of affected tokens, incorporating minimum price thresholds for USDe to improve stability, and conducting more frequent reviews of its risk parameters. Industry observers view Binance’s $400 million relief fund as a symbolic show of solidarity amid intensifying pressure and competition from other platforms. Binance’s handling of this episode positions it as an empathetic brand that takes responsibility for the challenges users faced when using the platform. The company said the relief package should not be confused as it taking liability for users’ losses. “We expect scrutiny, fair or unfair,” Binance said, adding that its users “are always our first priority.” According to the leading exchange, “It is critical to rebuild industry confidence” after a period of volatility and scrutiny. “This stems from our belief in the long-term development of the industry and our commitment to Binance’s User Focus values,” the company said in the statement.

All three coins have registered significant losses in the past 24 hours, yet their fundamental positions remain as positive as ever, with the arrival of altcoin ETFs later this year likely to ignite big rallies. Now may also be a great time to buy newer coins, with one presale token in particular showing strong potential for growth once it launches. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth to Help Alt Bounce from Massively Oversold Position The past few weeks have been very unkind to XRP, which has dropped from $3.09 at the start of October to $2.47 today. It’s down by 6% in 24 hours, 17% in a week and by 20% in a month, although it retains a very decent 360% increase in a year. There’s no denying that XRP has taken a battering recently, but this arguably sets it up for an even bigger surge in the not-too distant future. It’s currently waiting on more ETF launches than any other altcoin, with the launch of such funds ( possibly very soon ) set to boost its price massively. Source: TradingView Its chart today shows that it’s very close to hitting rock bottom, from which it can only bounce. Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are in heavily oversold positions, while its price is trading within a bullish pennant. This provides the foundation for a big rally in the coming weeks, while Ripple’s ongoing growth as a business puts XRP in a prime position to grow over the longer term. It could return to $3 in early November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – L1 Dominance Means ETH Will Lead Any Market-Wide Bull Rally ETH has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $3,999 marking a 14% decline in a week and a month. Ethereum does remain up by 58% in a year, which isn’t as impressive as XRP’s annual gain, but it does potentially mean that ETH will rally harder and compensate once an end-of-year rally gets into gear. The coin also boasts arguably the best fundamentals in crypto (save for BTC and maybe a handful of alts), meaning that it’s a prime position to ride any market-wide rally. And if we look at its chart, it too is in an oversold position from which it should recover very soon. Source: TradingView At the same time, the past few days have seen whales accumulating ETH , likely in the expectation of future gains. Given that Ethereum is still the biggest layer-one network by a wide margin , we can expect it to be one of the chief beneficiaries of any general growth in the crypto industry, including the growth of tokenisation and real-world assets (for example). We could therefore see the ETH price reach $4,500 by the end of the month, while it could enter 2026 at around $7,000. Crypto Price Prediction: BNB Coin ($BNB) – Binance Dominance and CZ Pardon Could Send Alt to New All-Time Highs BNB is a similar coin to ETH, in the sense that its status as Binance’s utility token means it will lead any end-of-year bull rally. Binance is the biggest crypto-exchange in the world , and is likely to remain the biggest for the foreseeable future. As such, its utility token, BNB, will grow in parallel with the growth of the wider market. Its price currently stands at $1,200, which may represent an 11% loss in 24 hours, but which is also a 28% increase in a month. BNB has been growing steadily over the past few weeks, and its chart today suggests that it could be in for another spike soon. Source: TradingView Its recent momentum has been so strong that its RSI (yellow) has rebounded to 70 and above after falling only as low as 60 or 50. And given that it’s close to touching 50 today, we could see it and BNB’s price rallying again in the very near future. Boosting its fundamental position is also the fact that the Trump administration may soon grant a pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , who pleased guilty to anti-money laundering failures in November 2023. This would boost Binance’s business position, while by extension it would boost BNB. The altcoin is therefore on track to climb over $2,000 by the end of November, and will end the year even higher. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Attracts $1.8 Million in Popular Presale Traders preparing for an end-of-year rally may also want to consider diversifying into newer tokens, since the best new tokens can outperform the market. Some of the most promising new tokens on the market right now are currently holding their presales, which can often be a launchpad for rallies once they list. Possibly the most intriguing presale coins at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ICO. All in a days work.

At the same time, Dogecoin ETFs from issuers such as 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale are on the SEC’s docket, with early DOGE products already drawing over $30 million despite higher fees. A green light for lower-cost funds could funnel new, regulated demand into DOGE, historically a catalyst for liquidity and price discovery across crypto. Key levels: $0.20 support, $0.23–$0.25 and $0.29–$0.30 Resistance Dogecoin Price action remains balanced on a knife-edge. Traders flag $0.200 as critical support; losing it risks a slide toward $0.178. On the upside, initial resistance sits at $0.214 and $0.229, with a broader supply zone at $0.241–$0.254. A daily close above $0.25 opens a run at $0.29–$0.30, the area many watch for a breakout confirmation. Technically, DOGE recently printed hammer/morning star patterns off the lows, while momentum has cooled to neutral, often a staging zone before the next directional move. For swing traders, $0.18 (support) and $0.25 (resistance) are the immediate invalidation/continuation lines. Whales accumulate as Weekly Triangle Coils On-chain, whales soaked up roughly $42 million in DOGE during the dip, signaling confidence as price continues to coil inside a multi-month triangle on the weekly chart. Historically, DOGE’s long compressions have preceded outsized expansions.

53153416,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86385,1760486444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: The Storm Is Not Over Yet,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-storm-is-not-over-yet/,"Arthur, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has expressed concern about XRP’s recent market behavior, warning that the asset may not yet be out of danger following the latest market downturn. His remarks come after the severe selloff that occurred on October 10, which triggered widespread liquidations across major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. During the crash, XRP declined sharply by more than 43%, reaching a low of $1.58, its weakest level so far this year. Although the token has since rebounded above $2.50 , it remains down more than 13% over the past week, signaling ongoing market instability. XRP’s Technical Structure Raises Concern In his recent technical assessment, Arthur described XRP’s latest price movement as dangerous, emphasizing that the market may still be under significant selling pressure. The analyst noted that despite the impressive rebound from the post-crash bottom, indicators on the 4-hour chart suggest that the upward momentum is weakening. Dangerous move from $XRP , the storm might not be over yet… After a 200%+ bounce from the crash lows, structure is showing signs of exhaustion.

Join us on Telegram and stay ahead of the next move. … pic.twitter.com/dah7D1g4yJ — Arthur (@XrpArthur) October 14, 2025 For several weeks, XRP’s price had been moving within a symmetrical triangle pattern, with the $2.60 level serving as a key psychological threshold. However, the October 10 selloff forced the token below the triangle’s lower boundary and two additional support zones at $2.50 and $2.20. Although XRP managed to recover the $2.20 level almost immediately, it struggled to regain and sustain the $2.50 mark. When XRP attempted to reenter the symmetrical triangle, it encountered strong resistance along the lower trendline, which halted further progress. The token is currently trading around the $2.50 mark , though it has not yet broken convincingly above it. This shows some stabilization at the support band, but regaining the triangle cleanly would provide clearer confirmation that the prior breakdown has been reversed. Market Factors and Near-Term Outlook Arthur’s analysis also links the renewed volatility to broader geopolitical developments. Recent tensions following China’s response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats have contributed to renewed uncertainty in global markets, extending bearish sentiment across digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He stressed that XRP needs to recover and hold above $2.50 before attempting to reestablish its previous trading structure. A move back into the symmetrical triangle could indicate a reversal of the current downward momentum, while continued rejection below resistance may confirm a prolonged consolidation phase near recent lows. Mixed Opinions Among Analysts Despite Arthur’s caution, other analysts have presented more optimistic interpretations. Market researcher Xaif pointed out that XRP’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) fell to a six-month low during the crash, historically signaling potential recovery periods. According to him, the last instance of a similar drop preceded a 35% price rebound, suggesting that a comparable correction could occur in the near term. Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt has reiterated a constructive long-term outlook for XRP. He described the asset’s broader chart formation as structurally sound, implying that while short-term volatility remains a concern, the long-term trend could still favor gradual appreciation. Overall, analysts remain divided on XRP’s immediate prospects. While Arthur maintains that the asset’s recent breakdown and failure to reenter its trading structure are signs of market fragility, others believe the selloff may be nearing exhaustion. In the coming days, XRP’s ability to trade above the $2.50 level will likely determine whether the market stabilizes or faces renewed pressure.

53155227,605626,1760486458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155227.jpeg,Extreme Fear Grips Altcoins As 90% Of Tokens Trade Below 200DMA: Perfect Time To Accumulate?,https://bitcoinist.com/extreme-fear-grips-altcoins-90-trade-below-200dma/,"Altcoins continue to face heavy pressure across the board after the historic crash that shook the crypto market on Friday. The sudden sell-off triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions within minutes. Even established blue chips such as Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX) saw their prices plunge more than 60% before partially recovering over the weekend. While prices have since stabilized at slightly higher levels, investor confidence remains fragile. The market is still reeling from the shock, and traders are cautious as volatility persists. According to top analyst Darkfost, the current market structure reflects deep disinterest and capitulation. He shared data showing that only 10% of altcoins listed on Binance are trading above their 200-day moving average — meaning that 90% of the altcoin market is below its long-term trend. This extreme reading highlights the magnitude of the sell-off and the lack of strong recovery momentum so far. Historically, such setups often precede accumulation phases, as smart money begins to position for the next cycle . However, with sentiment still fragile, the coming days will determine whether this is a true bottoming zone or simply a pause before another leg down. Market Exhaustion Could Signal the Next Rebound Darkfost explains that the current state of the altcoin market has historically marked moments of capitulation and opportunity. Throughout this cycle, similar configurations have occurred three times, each followed by a notable short-term rebound across major altcoins. These periods of extreme selling exhaustion often represent points where downside momentum fades, and patient investors begin accumulating high-quality assets at deep discounts. Darkfost emphasizes that these setups rarely last long. Once market sentiment stabilizes and traders recognize the excessive fear priced into altcoins, capital tends to flow back quickly, driving strong relief rallies. However, he warns that this is not a time for indiscriminate buying. The key, he says, lies in focusing on projects that have maintained liquidity, developer activity, and on-chain usage even amid the broader downturn. These factors often separate long-term survivors from speculative tokens that will struggle to recover. For investors who missed previous market cycles, this type of configuration could present one of the most favorable risk-reward setups in months. Yet timing remains crucial. As Darkfost notes, once the market realizes it has overcorrected, re-entry opportunities disappear quickly, often replaced by aggressive upward moves that reward those who acted decisively during peak fear. Altcoins Face Critical Support Test The total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 assets — a key indicator of broader altcoin performance — is currently hovering around $263 billion, reflecting a 2.3% decline over the week. This chart paints a clear picture of stress across the altcoin sector following last week’s market-wide crash, with prices retracing sharply from the $285 billion area after being rejected near multi-month resistance. Technically, the market cap remains above the 200-week moving average (red line), which has acted as a reliable support level throughout previous cycles. However, the recent volatility and long downside wick highlight strong selling pressure, suggesting that many investors have been forced to de-risk amid uncertainty. The 50-week MA (blue) and 100-week MA (green) are currently flattening, signaling the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase before any sustainable recovery begins. Historically, this structure — a deep correction into major moving averages — often precedes accumulation phases that mark macro bottoms. As long as the $250 billion level holds, the broader altcoin market could stabilize and gradually rebuild momentum. A weekly close below this support, however, would likely trigger another wave of liquidations, potentially retesting the $200 billion region — a level associated with previous cycle lows.

At the same time, Japan’s Metaplanet faces a sharp valuation drop despite holding over $3.5 billion in BTC. Yet, technical charts show BTC stabilizing near $111,000, with a triple-bottom pattern hinting at a possible breakout toward $130,000 as institutional demand strengthens. Elon Musk Calls Bitcoin “Energy-Based and Inflation-Proof” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, described Bitcoin as “energy-based” and “inflation-proof,” contrasting it with “fake fiat” currencies. He noted that BTC’s proof-of-work model prevents the creation of “fake energy,” unlike fiat money that governments can print at will. Musk made the remarks in response to analyst ZeroHedge, who linked rising Bitcoin and gold prices to government spending on artificial intelligence. This marks Musk’s most direct statement on Bitcoin in nearly three years, following his 2022 prediction of a prolonged bear market after the FTX collapse. His renewed endorsement underscores Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and its increasing relevance in an AI-driven economy, despite ongoing concerns about mining energy use.

IMF Warns of Global Market Risks The International Monetary Fund warned that global markets are becoming complacent about risks such as trade tensions, high debt levels, and inflated asset prices. It cautioned that a sudden loss of confidence could trigger a “disorderly” market downturn. The IMF just issued a stark warning: risk asset prices are ""well above fundamentals,"" raising the odds of a ""disorderly"" market correction. The International Monetary Fund's semiannual Global Financial Stability Report, released Tuesday morning, warns that investors have grown… pic.twitter.com/6BUOSaAWwQ — Aiime (@Aiime_ai) October 14, 2025 The warning followed renewed tariff threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump, which briefly pressured both Bitcoin and equity markets. The IMF urged governments to tighten oversight of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and reduce fiscal deficits. Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s quick recovery suggests traders remain confident in its long-term resilience. Metaplanet’s Value Falls Below Its BTC Holdings Metaplanet, Japan’s leading Bitcoin treasury firm, has seen its enterprise value drop below the worth of its Bitcoin assets for the first time. The company’s market-to-Bitcoin net asset value (mNAV) fell to 0.99, indicating that the market now values Metaplanet at less than its 30,823 BTC holdings, currently worth about $3.5 billion. The decline comes after the company paused Bitcoin purchases for two weeks, despite its reputation as one of Asia’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin accumulators. Metaplanet’s stock has fallen 75% since June, reflecting investor caution and broader uncertainty around Bitcoin treasury strategies. Metaplanet’s market-to-Bitcoin NAV just dropped below 1 for the first time ever, meaning the company’s market value is now less than the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet is trading at a discount to its Bitcoin, a rare event for one of the largest public BTC holders. pic.twitter.com/yW8EKavdXX — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) October 14, 2025 Analysts, however, compare the reaction to early skepticism toward Tesla, arguing the selloff reflects market mispricing rather than weakness in Metaplanet’s model. They note that the company’s large Bitcoin reserve and long-term accumulation plan continue to support confidence in its balance sheet strength. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traded steadily around $113,000, as analysts said Metaplanet’s holdings reaffirm institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Setup Targets $130,000 Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup indicates selling pressure is easing while buyers gradually regain control. On the two-hour chart, the 100-period SMMA at $116,676 overlaps the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $116,108, forming a key resistance area that could restrict gains before a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels to 47, showing early bullish divergence and slowing downside momentum. A bullish engulfing candle above $114,500 would confirm the pattern and reinforce short-term buying strength. Bitcoin remains inside a descending channel, but the TradingView path projection suggests a breakout toward $119,800, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci level. A close above $120,000 would signal a shift from consolidation to recovery, targeting $125,000 and $130,000 next. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600 with stops below $109,500, eyeing $119,800 as the initial target. A move above the 100-SMA would confirm trend reversal potential. With volatility easing and institutional accumulation picking up, Bitcoin’s current base may serve as the foundation for a sustained Q4 rally. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been popular based on its meme appeal and fast price fluctuations, but long-term viability beyond user sentiment remains a concern. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , on the other hand, is becoming a serious contender based on substance, not speculation. With Phase 6 currently active and with more than 65% already sold, MUTM’s decentralized finance innovation, solid tokenomics, and actual use cases have kept it as one of the strongest altcoins in 2025. Whereas PEPE is based on short-term hype, Mutuum Finance is the strategic, utility-based growth potential long-term investors are looking for. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Price Prediction: Can There Be Another Rise? The price of Pepe Coin (PEPE) has dropped by 24.2% within the last 24 hours, reflecting the bearish sentiment across the wider market prompted by Bitcoin’s latest correction and a precipitous fall in speculation-based demand for meme cryptocurrencies. Despite the brisk sell-off, PEPE currently trades at or near its historical demand area, a point that sparked a triple-digit advance earlier this year. PEPE has found its way back to this area a concern for hopeful bulls that a short-term bounce back is possible with a resurgence in buying interest. Nevertheless, as sentiment across the market moves away from hype and toward value based on utility, many investors are also starting to look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a better bet with long-term growth and sustainable foundations. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance is getting strong uproar amongst DeFi investors in its presale where over 17,000 investors have been enrolled to have raised over $17.3 million to-date. Phase 6 where the price of the token is at $0.035 is already sold out 65%. The level is seeing strong demand from investors. Lending and Borrowing Protocol The protocol will be launching their new lending and borrowing protocol according to their latest announcement. The first version will be launching live on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have underlying feature sets with the liquidity pools, with the mtTokens, with the debt tokens, and with the liquidator bot. ETH along with USDT will be accommodated for collaterals, for lending, and also for the borrowing, and the ultimate result will be a seamless, multi-asset, and secure DeFi experience. In order to balance proportionate with secure lending, the protocol uses risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV), with the maximum collateral per asset depending on the risk level. The protocol also uses buffer reserves where riskier properties are required to hold larger reserves. This approach insulates the users from the volatility from the market as well as overall health of the ecosystem, so the platform will be surprised but will not affect the health. Mutuum Finance is the Standout Strategic Choice for 2025 While Pepe Coin (PEPE) is still a beneficiary of hype bursts and short-term price fluctuations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a more fundamentally sound and utility-driven play. With over 17,000 investors investing more than $17.3 million during Phase 6 of its presale and 65% already subscribed, the traction for MUTM is a testament to growing conviction in its long-term outlook. Its upcoming lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with ETH and USDT collateral, liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot will provide a secure, scalable, and usable DeFi experience. Investors interested in sustainable growth and early access to a high-potential project must invest in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale today and put themselves in contention for a top 2025 crypto opportunity.

53155229,605804,1760490010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53155229.jpeg,Greatest Bitcoin Threat? Charles Edwards Predicts Quantum Break In 2–8 Years,https://bitcoinist.com/charles-edwards-bitcoin-quantum-break-2-8-years/,"At TOKEN2049 Singapore, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards set aside his well-known Bitcoin bullishness to deliver an unambiguous warning: a quantum “Q-Day” could arrive far sooner than most of the industry expects, with potentially existential consequences if Bitcoin’s core cryptography is not upgraded in time. “Within two to eight years, a quantum machine will break Bitcoin’s current encryption,” he told the audience, urging developers, companies and holders to treat the issue as urgent engineering, not distant theory. Edwards framed Q-Day as the moment a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can break widely-used classical cryptography such as RSA—and, by extension, the elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) underpinning Bitcoin’s public-private key model. “Q-day is the day in which a quantum machine will break classic encryption,” he said, adding that once that threshold is crossed, anything protected by those primitives—from financial networks to “sensitive data” and “of course Bitcoin”—is at risk. He asserted that Bitcoin’s ECC would likely fall sooner than RSA when the industry approaches that breakpoint. Quantum Computing Could Break Bitcoin Within 8 Years Pushing back on the common refrain that practical quantum attacks are decades away, Edwards argued the timeline has materially compressed, citing both rapid technical progress and a collective incentive among states and large firms to accelerate. “Even quantum years away. If you ask ChatGPT or Grok, it’ll tell you 10, 20, 30 years away. It’s rubbish,” he said. He pointed to quantum computer access already available via major cloud providers—AWS, Google and Azure—and its use cases in “drug discovery, defense, [and] optimizing bond yields,” presenting these as markers of real-world traction rather than laboratory demos. Edwards anchored his 2–8 year forecast to a convergence of views he described as independent and sober. He referenced security specialist Jameson Lopp as assigning “50% risk in four to nine years,” a “math PhD doctor specializing in quantum” at “2 to six years for Bitcoin,” and McKinsey’s estimate for RSA-level Q-Day in “2 to 10 years,” reiterating his belief that “Bitcoin breaks years earlier than that.” He also drew attention to a 2017 “Bitcoin quantum paper” that, in his reading, suggests “you only need 2,300 qubits—logical qubits—to break Bitcoin’s ECC,” noting its authorship by researchers affiliated with Microsoft, IonQ and Meta. While those numbers and affiliations were presented as evidence, his central message was less about any single study and more about the overall direction of travel: a multilateral “quantum arms race” that he said has already attracted “$55 billion” in commitments, with China “spending double the US.” In Edwards’ telling, technological trendlines are compounding that investment wave. He described qubit growth as “basically a straight line in a log chart,” claiming it is “progressing faster than Moore’s law,” and likened today’s skepticism to the disbelief many held about AI adoption in 2021—right before chatbots went mainstream. “Imagine 2021 and thinking about AI… You thought it was years away. So ChatGPT happened. I think we’re in a similar moment with quantum. It’s ignored today, but it’s coming.” He also highlighted a perceived shift in sentiment from Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, saying that after downplaying quantum timelines early in the year, Huang later called quantum at “an inflection point” and has been “spending billions buying quantum companies.” For Edwards, the takeaway is simple: “As always, follow the money.” The operational risks Edwards outlined for Bitcoin were concrete and immediate. If adversaries can derive private keys from public keys exposed on-chain, coins sitting at addresses that have previously revealed public keys become vulnerable to theft. That set includes long-dormant “lost” coins and, potentially, some portion of Satoshi-era holdings. “Satoshi’s coins will probably be market dumped,” he said starkly, not because their owner would necessarily act, but because the associated keys could be computed and the UTXOs swept once Q-Day arrives. He contrasted dormant addresses with actively maintained wallets, arguing that modern key management and timely migration would reduce exposure: “We want to keep active wallets… it’s good to maintain security upgrades and relevancy of the tech through time.” He referenced Michael Saylor ’s recent remark about doing “something ethically proper and burn[ing] his coins,” using it to underscore an inversion in perceived safety: “Actually burnt—the lost coins—the highest risk because no one has maintained that infrastructure.” Beyond the cryptographic break itself, Edwards emphasized the logistical constraints of any industry-wide upgrade. Bitcoin can only process so many transactions per day, meaning a migration to quantum-safe addresses cannot be done overnight. “We have long lead times to upgrade Bitcoin,” he said. “For Bitcoin itself it takes at least a month if you ignore all other transactions on the network to simply move everyone across to new wallets… so we’re looking at at least basically 6 to 12 months to fix this.” On that basis, he argued work on a concrete migration path cannot wait: “We need to be solving this really next year—2026—in order to get a solution before 2027.” Edwards pointed to ongoing technical efforts as a starting point rather than a finished plan. “There’s solutions to protect crypto… There’s a few BIPs for example like this one… by Jameson Lopp . So there are solutions. We can solve this but there is an urgency to it.” Quantum will break Bitcoin and Satoshi’s coins will market dump. We must act in 2026. Watch this video to understand why. https://t.co/46Cqlv5RSH — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) October 13, 2025 He called on developers to evaluate proposals for quantum-resistant schemes and on the broader community to “get talking to [the] community, your social media, get involved in the Bitcoin improvement proposals.

While the multi-billion-dollar liquidation event sent prices plunging across the board, Solana demonstrated remarkable resilience, whereas the Ethereum network and liquidity thinned during the peak volatility. Why Solana High-Performance Design Continues To Shine In an X post, the Nasdaq-listed go-to Solana Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), DefDevCorp, has revealed that when the largest liquidation event in crypto history hit last Friday, most of the market froze, and Ethereum stumbled. However, Solana didn’t flinch, powering through one of the most chaotic trading sessions ever recorded. Related Reading: Solana Shines Bright: Network Excels Amid Largest Crypto Liquidation Event At the peak of volatility, Solana sustained 1,225 transactions per second, finalized blocks in just 350 milliseconds, and saw transaction fees briefly rise to $0.25 before normalizing below $0.01. Meanwhile, ETH’s infrastructure buckled under demand as the network struggled to process beyond 26 TPS. Its block times extended to 15 seconds, and saw average gas fees explode to $616, effectively locking out users and rendering the chain unusable during the crisis. ETH became unreliable, impractical, and effectively unusable during the chaos. As DefiDevCorp noted, when users are priced out and transactions can’t clear, the network might as well be offline. In moments of high load, the core promise of a blockchain to remain accessible, affordable, and reliable must hold. However, after nearly 20 months of uninterrupted uptime, weathering its busiest moments, it’s abundantly clear that SOL’s continued upgrades and optimizations have paid off dramatically. DefiDevCorp concluded that no other chain currently comes close to handling global value transfer at this scale, under such extreme conditions, with the same level of performance. The takeaway from the firm’s post is that only SOL stays fast, cheap, and usable, even when global markets melt down. Why SOL Price Doesn’t Match Its Reliability A Researcher at alphapleaseHQ and Advisor at KaminoFinance, Aylo, has also mentioned that he had assets and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) positions open on both Solana and Ethereum when the crypto market collapsed last Friday. During this time, he had zero issues using the SOL network, while the ETH network was unusable due to the costs, which often led to market crashes, and the Rabby wallet also went down. Related Reading: No Chain Comes Close: Solana Leads With 2.5x Ethereum’s Revenue Aylo added that the ETH maxis should be much angrier about the performance of their L1. With this development, SOL continues to prove it’s the most performant and reliable blockchain under real-world pressure that we have in crypto. He pointed out that SOL’s valuation doesn’t reflect the resilience it is proving in the digital world.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, he wrote: “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China.” China has been the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans for years, importing about 27 million metric tons valued at roughly $12.8 billion in 2024.But since May, Beijing has refused to purchase a single shipment. The halt came as the trade war between Washington and Beijing heated up again, with tariffs driving prices higher for Chinese importers.Instead, China began sourcing soybeans from Argentina and other South American producers. Coincidentally, Argentina lifted export taxes on the same day Trump’s administration announced a $20 billion currency swap with Buenos Aires. Hours later, Argentina’s President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House. By the end of the day, the U.S. president had unleashed his public rebuke against China. Markets drop after Trump’s trade warning The timing of Trump’s post sent markets tumbling. The S&P 500 fell sharply by the end of the day, closing lower after a volatile session. Traders were already on edge following Trump’s warning on Friday that he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports in response to Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth minerals. Hours after that threat, he said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1. But by Sunday, he changed tone, posting, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” Meanwhile, data showed China’s exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, and the U.S. accounted for 43% of the total. That number added to Washington’s frustration as Trump considered cutting ties in the cooking oil trade altogether. His comments deepened doubts about ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, already stalled after months of tit-for-tat measures. Beijing responded by introducing its own round of economic measures. It started collecting special port fees on U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels, while exempting Chinese-built ships. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV explained that the new fees would apply to a vessel’s first port of entry for a single voyage or up to five voyages per year, with exceptions for empty ships entering for repairs. The move mirrored the U.S. policy announced earlier this year, when Trump’s administration approved similar fees on China-linked vessels to boost the U.S. shipbuilding sector. China hits back with sanctions and maritime countermeasures The standoff extended beyond soybeans and tariffs into the shipping industry.An investigation that began during the Biden administration had concluded that China used unfair practices to dominate global shipping and shipbuilding. That finding gave Trump the authority to impose penalties aimed at reducing Beijing’s control. China fired back by introducing identical port charges on U.S.-linked vessels the same day America’s fees took effect. Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers said in a research note that the situation created a “spiral of maritime taxation” between the two economies, warning of disruptions to global freight flows. Shipping analyst Ed Finley-Richardson said operators were scrambling to reroute ships to avoid Chinese ports. He said some U.S. shipowners were trying to sell their cargo mid-voyage so vessels could divert elsewhere. Analysts estimated China’s state-owned COSCO would take the hardest hit, bearing almost half of the $3.2 billion in extra costs expected by 2026. Major international carriers like Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, and CMA CGM reduced exposure by pulling China-linked ships off U.S. trade routes. American trade officials later lowered the proposed port fees after backlash from agriculture, energy, and shipping industries, which argued that the tariffs would raise costs for consumers and exporters alike. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry responded Tuesday, saying, “If the U.S. chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.” Hours later, Beijing announced sanctions against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of supporting a U.S. investigation into China’s trade practices. Hanwha, which owns Philly Shipyard in the U.S. and builds Navy vessels, confirmed it was monitoring the situation after its stock plunged nearly 6%, as Cryptopolitan reported .

China’s model of export-led growth is running out of steam as demand from abroad cools and prices for manufactured goods collapse, the International Monetary Fund said in its latest World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday. The IMF warned that the second-largest economy in the world should rebalance its focus to prioritize domestic demand, or it would stagnate in the long term. China is still producing a large volume of goods for export, but weak global demand has depressed prices, said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist at the IMF. The renewed calls come as Western policymakers increasingly urge the IMF to take a tougher stance on China’s economic policies . The IMF message is not new, but the timing matters. The Chinese economy’s recovery remains fragile after years of pandemic disruptions, turmoil in the real estate industry, and consumer confidence that has yet to recover. Sluggish domestic demand hampers recovery The IMF described China’s prospects as “worrisome,” citing mounting financial stability risks and tepid consumer spending . The economy is hovering on the edge of a debt-deflation trap, Gourinchas said, with property values falling, anemic credit demand, and corporate borrowing constraints dragging the rebound. The property crisis in China — once a giant source of urban wealth — still looms large. Many developers are struggling to complete housing projects, banks are saddled with bad loans, and households are holding back from spending or investing. The uncertainty that resulted has dragged down confidence among consumers and businesses alike. The IMF also noted that, although Beijing’s heavy spending on strategic industries, including electric vehicles and renewable energy, has been lucrative in some sectors, it could be misallocating resources and contributing to fiscal pressures. Subsidies and state-directed investment, the Fund said, can distort competition and block out small private firms. The IMF suggested that China embark on a so-called “transitional fiscal expansion and permanent fiscal recomposition”, which it said would entail temporarily raising government spending to lift private household consumption before transitioning long-term fiscal priorities toward social safety nets and income support. China’s export growth, too, has started to sputter. While overall exports in September rose from the period a year earlier, shipments to the United States plummeted more than 27% from a year ago, according to data provided by China’s customs authority. Analysts say one reason, apart from geopolitical factors, is lower overall global demand. At the same time, concern has been rising in both the European Union and the United States about an influx of low-cost Chinese goods — primarily electric vehicles and solar panels — that are undercutting domestic industries. Such an outcome, the IMF warned, could exacerbate trade frictions unless China’s domestic market creates enough demand to soak up more of its output. Beijing faces tough policy choices China’s leaders have recognized the challenge. Premier Li Qiang recently told officials that expanding domestic demand is crucial for maintaining sustainable growth and promised targeted fiscal support for households and small businesses. However, economists argue that much deeper structural reforms are necessary in 2020 to make this a reality. These measures could be increasing household income, reforming social security to lower precautionary savings, and providing greater flexibility to the private sector, which would play a role in both innovation and employment. The IMF’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, expressed a similar sentiment this year when she said that the Fund has been very vocal about China needing to change its economic model. She emphasized that measures to boost consumer confidence and increase transparency in the financial industry were also crucial for sustainable growth. Yet Beijing must make painful political and social choices. Slowing growth in the short term may also require reducing state-led industrial investment. However, without reform, the IMF argues, China could remain stuck in a cycle of low demand, low prices, and rising debts.

This executive order permits the inclusion of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies, in 401(k) retirement accounts. Downing’s efforts began when he officially presented a draft bill to the House Financial Services Committee. Following this act, reliable sources anticipated a high likelihood that this would grant Executive Order 14330 legal power. Notably, Trump issued this order on August 7 this year. It highlights that all Americans currently saving for retirement should be eligible for funds that include alternative assets. However, this is only applicable when appropriate based on a plan fiduciary. Downing’s sparks optimism in the crypto ecosystem for a new crypto-friendly law Alternative assets include private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure initiatives, lifetime income strategies, and digital assets, all of which are managed via active investment vehicles . On the other hand, an executive order highlights government priorities in a manner that differs from that of a law. Additionally, future leaders or courts can reverse it. Therefore, for a policy to become permanent, Congress must approve the bill in both chambers. This action takes place before the bill is signed into law. However, for Trump’s executive order concerning retirement assets to become law, it requires the attention of three key parts of the US government. This includes the Department of Labor, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Treasury Secretary, who are assigned the role of reviewing the order and providing prioritized guidance for 401(k) plans within six months. Interestingly, the bill was introduced despite the ongoing US government shutdown. This was made possible because Congress can bring up and still discuss legislation during a funding gap. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the push to incorporate alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, into US retirement accounts has been gaining momentum over the past few months. Trump’s executive order sparks controversy among individuals Concerning Trump’s executive order, the US Department of Labor withdrew the Biden administration’s previous guidance to fiduciaries in May. This guidance encouraged fiduciaries to exercise extreme caution when adding crypto exposure to 401(k) retirement plans. No sooner had Trump issued his executive order than, in September, nine members of Congress from the US wrote a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. In this letter, they called for the agency to accelerate the implementation of the order and assist 90 million Americans currently locked out of investing in alternative assets, enabling them to secure a dignified and comfortable retirement. The 401(k) plan is one of the widespread retirement savings programs employers offer, particularly in the US. To support this claim, reports from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) regarding the US retirement market in the second quarter of this year illustrated that Americans had saved around $9.3 trillion in their 401(k) accounts by June 30. While some financial professionals believe that using retirement savings to invest in crypto and digital assets is risky, several individuals in the cryptocurrency community support the idea. An example is André Dragosch, the head of European research at Bitwise, who in August stated that integrating cryptocurrency into US retirement plans could be a game-changer for Bitcoin adoption and potentially introduce billions of dollars’ worth of new investment.

During the company’s annual Dreamforce 2025 conference in San Francisco, Benioff told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that Salesforce is not just a cloud software company anymore — it is an “AI-first” enterprise. Benioff said that many people did not realize Agentforce was essentially Salesforce itself, adding that it had become the center of everything the company was building and the platform on which all its products were based. The comment highlights a significant shift for Salesforce, which is making substantial investments, and AI will be the driving force behind the next decade of business transformation. The company’s most recent upgrades and partnerships aim to integrate AI agents into its customers’ daily lives. Agentforce transforms into Salesforce’s backbone. Originally designed to automate mundane tasks within enterprises, the platform has evolved into a full-fledged AI OS. It now powers everything from sales forecasting and marketing campaigns to customer service chatbots and predictive analytics. Agentforce 360, as the second generation of the idea, was announced at Dreamforce 2025 by Salesforce. The upgraded version combines AI agents, real-time data, and human workflows into a single, consistent experience. It plugs into the Salesforce orbit — which now includes messaging app Slack, data visualization software Tableau, and Data Cloud — so companies can deploy AI agents that illuminate every corner of their businesses in real-time and take action autonomously. It’s no longer a side project, according to Benioff, emphasizing that Agentforce was now at the heart of Salesforce’s suite of software. The company had already cleared tens of thousands of instances, and customers were starting to reap productivity gains as they geared up for the next level of execution, he said. Salesforce’s AI tools have been adopted by leading enterprises, including Dell, Williams-Sonoma, and PepsiCo, to drive operational efficiencies and gain unprecedented insights, thereby transforming their businesses. The startup is changing the way that sales gets done in enterprises, transforming customer relationship management, which Benioff describes as “agentive relationship management.” Salesforce has strengthened its connections with top AI developers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, whose massive language models are being incorporated into Agentforce. The partnership enables customers to safely leverage generative AI within Salesforce’s trusted ecosystem, combining sophisticated automation with enterprise-grade data governance. Benioff argued that companies needed trusted partners to navigate the complexity and ethical challenges of enterprise AI, noting that Salesforce held a unique advantage in that regard. He added that enterprises were no longer simply seeking access to AI but were now demanding AI systems they could trust, ones that were safe, reliable, and accountable. Investors wary even as mega bets on AI roll in Despite the hype around AI, Salesforce’s financial performance has been met with pressure. The company’s stock has declined by more than 28% since the beginning of the year, as investors worry about slowing revenue growth and increasing competition. Analysts have noted that while Salesforce is moving fast and innovating, converting that innovation into profit will take time. Still, Benioff remains confident. He says the grass-roots move to an AI-oriented model is necessary for long-term success. Most industry analysts agree that Salesforce is preparing itself for the next great wave of business evolution. With AI integrated into every product, the company is betting that demand will increasingly be driven by organizations seeking to automate complex processes and keep human decision-making at the forefront. Benioff has used the term “agentic enterprise” to describe companies in which AI agents become tightly integrated into workflow. These businesses run everything, from customer service to supply chain logistics, on Agentforce, with agents able to make recommendations, take actions, and continually learn from the results. Benioff described his vision as ambitious, one in which companies would no longer use software but instead collaborate with AI partners that understood their data, goals, and customers. He said it was not just another platform but the beginning of a new way of doing business.

The Tesla CEO replied to a viral ZeroHedge thread that framed artificial intelligence as a government-funded arms race that will turbocharge monetary debasement. “True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy,” Musk wrote, aligning BTC’s value proposition with physical power constraints. Minutes later, when community account Sir Doge of the Coin (@dogeofficialceo) added, “Dogecoin is also based on energy,” Musk replied with a simple “💯,” his first explicit nod toward DOGE in a while, rekindling a long-running price-sensitivity question around his posts. Dogecoin is also based on energy pic.twitter.com/E8BMmAIdm9 — Sir Doge of the Coin ⚔️ (@dogeofficialceo) October 14, 2025 The market reaction, however, was muted. As of press time, Dogecoin traded near $0.196, lower on the day alongside broader crypto risk, with Bitcoin and Ethereum also in the red. Bitcoin was down on the session near $111k, while Ethereum slipped below $4k, underscoring a risk-off tape that likely blunted any “Musk effect” impulse. Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup and Handle Holds A Secret Few Are Seeing Musk’s DOGE remarks arrive amid a separate swirl of Dogecoin-adjacent headlines that caught Washington’s and Wall Street’s attention over the last 48 hours. Representative Matt Gaetz amplified a viral thread, asking, “Is DOGE about to become the world’s great utility token? After being a meme?!” — a rhetorical riff that referenced news circulating about a planned public-markets pivot by House of Doge as the “corporate arm” of the Dogecoin Foundation. Is DOGE about to become the world’s great utility token? After being a meme?! https://t.co/wVXO7eijss — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) October 13, 2025 House of Doge intends to list on Nasdaq via a merger with Brag House Holdings under the ticker TBH, and they also tie House of Doge to a growing Dogecoin treasury effort at CleanCore Solutions, newly branded on the NYSE American as ZONE. The October 13 releases further assert that CleanCore now holds 730 million+ DOGE, targeting up to 1 billion DOGE in the near term and, longer-run, “up to 5%” of circulating supply. Why Hasn’t The Dogecoin Price Reacted Positively? Historically, Musk’s DOGE interactions have triggered sharp, if often fleeting, price responses. During late 2024, for example, a single “true” reply in a payments-context thread coincided with a pop as traders extrapolated X-payments tie-ins, and the October 2024 launch of a dedicated account for its payments initiative on X. Related Reading: What The Weekend Liquidation Event Meant For The Dogecoin Price, And What Could Happen Next More recently, in June 2025, DOGE jumped 3% after Musk defused a political spat. The common denominator: reflexive liquidity and headline-driven order flow that fades unless there’s a real impact on the meme coin. Today’s sequence fits that pattern — a high-engagement Musk quip, immediate social virality, but price constrained by macro tape and the absence of a concurrent, verifiable product or policy reveal. So why didn’t DOGE “go to the moon” on the 💯? First, the tape matters. With majors heavy, meme-beta typically underperforms. Second, the information content of the post is modest: Musk endorsed an energy-based framing and acknowledged a community meme — not a new X Payments feature, not a Tesla-commerce integration, not a tangible DOGE settlement rail. Markets have learned to differentiate between tone and transaction. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19862.

Within minutes, XRP wiped out over 50% of its value, dropping down to $0.77 before partially rebounding, marking one of its steepest intraday losses in history. While early reports blamed political tensions following US President Donald Trump’s sudden tariff on Chinese imports , data now suggests that the crash was amplified by a major glitch in Binance’s internal pricing system, and other contributing technical factors. Catalysts Behind The XRP Price Crash And Crypto And Bitcoin Meltdown Between October 10 and 11, XRP experienced a violent flash crash on Binance , plunging over 54% in a single 30-minute candle. In less than 24 hours, over a million traders were also liquidated. This unprecedented drop came during what analysts are now calling “the worst crypto liquidation event in crypto history,” with nearly $19.3 billion in open positions wiped out in a single day. At first, much of the blame was directed at Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese tech imports , which triggered a wave of panic across global risk assets. However, the XRP and broader market collapse went far beyond normal macro-driven volatility. On-chain analysts traced the sequence to a $60 million spot market dump on Binance, which set off an internal pricing malfunction . Binance’s oracle system, which marks collateral values such as wBETH, BNSOL, and USDe, momentarily failed, possibly leading to forced liquidations across XRP and other major crypto assets. This oracle mispricing allegedly turned a $60 million order into a $19 billion loss. XRP, being one of Binance’s most heavily leveraged assets, absorbed a significant amount of the impact as margin calls liquidated thousands of positions within minutes. A whale had reportedly opened $1 billion in short positions just before the Trump tariff announcement, adding more suspicion and fuel to the collapse. Binance later confirmed abnormal pricing and paid $283 million in restitution, but the damage to XRP and the broader market was already done. A Deeper Dive Into The Market-Wide Crash Analysts say that the root cause of the $19 billion crypto market crash was Binance’s “Unified Account” system, which priced collateral using internal data instead of decentralized oracles. Between October 6 and 14, Binance was transitioning to oracle-based pricing, creating an exploitable 8-day gap. During that period, coordinated actors reportedly dumped $60 million to $90 million in USDe exclusively on Binance, driving its price to $0.65 while it stayed near $1 on other exchanges. This artificial depeg within Binance’s system triggered widespread panic, as attackers were said to hold $1.1 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum shorts on decentralized exchanges, profiting about $192 million as prices plunged. Analysts noted that Ethena’s USDe remained fully collateralized on all other exchanges, proving that the issue allegedly stemmed from Binance’s infrastructure, not the stablecoin. The combination of technical flaws, alleged manipulation , and tariff-driven fear transformed a contained exploit into a market-wide catastrophe. Despite the chaos, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about XRP’s recovery , predicting a strong rally to new ATHs soon.",XRP|binance|BNSOL|Ethena|ripple|USDe|wBETH|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 02:00:50

The new products will feature 160 GB of LPDDR5X onboard memory, characterized by relatively low power consumption. The tech company said the new inference-optimized Data Center GPU will utilize its Xe3P Celestial microarchitecture once it hits the market in the second half of next year. Intel acknowledged that its Xe3P architecture is a performance-enhanced version of the Xe3 architecture used in the Core Ultra 300-series ‘Panther Lake’ processors for laptops and compact desktops. The architecture will also be featured for clients on a next-gen Arc family, the Arc C-Series. Crescent Island supports a number of data types Intel $INTC just officially introduced its new Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island pic.twitter.com/1DNYUjH9Du — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 14, 2025 According to Intel’s report, the Crescent Island GPU will support a flurry of data types relevant for inference workloads and cloud providers. The tech firm didn’t mention the estimated performance of the product, but there are still some hints in Intel’s press release. The 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory suggests the use of multiple LPDDR5X devices, as it’s significantly more than one typically expects from a graphics card. The Crescent Island GPU could use an LPDDR5X DRAM IC, which features two 16-bit channels, so its total interface width is 32 bits. The highest-capacity LPDDR5X chip is 32 GB (8 GB), meaning that 20 such chips are required to equip a graphics card with 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Other companies, such as Nvidia and AMD, use top-grade HBM memory for their data centers, including HBM3E. They are also already discussing HBM4 for next-gen parts, such as Rubin and MI400. Intel revealed that Crescent Island will be air-cooled and cost-optimized. The tech company is currently working to refine its open-source software stack for the new data center by utilizing current-generation Arc Pro B-Series GPUs. The initiative follows the firm’s currently ongoing enhancements for the Arc Pro B-Series, including the ongoing Project Battlematrix Linux driver improvements, the Intel Compute Runtime, and the Intel Xe Linux driver. The tech firm unveiled its Arc Pro family in May this year at Computex 2025, which it said has larger memory configurations and expanded software support. Intel unveiled the graphics processing units for workstations and AI inference, marking 40 years of collaboration with local ecosystem partners in Taipei, Taiwan. “For the past 40 years, the power of our partnership with the Taiwan ecosystem has fueled innovation that has changed our world for the better. This week, we are renewing our commitment to our partners as we work to build a new Intel for the future. Together, we will create great products that delight our customers.” – Lip-Bu Tan , CEO of Intel. On October 9, the tech firm also highlighted Xeon 6+ (Clearwater Forest), Intel’s first server processor based on the 18A process. The processor is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2026. Intel unveils details for its Panther Lake processor Intel also revealed new architectural details for its upcoming Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processor, code-named Panther Lake. The new processor will be the first product built on Intel’s 18A, the firm’s most advanced semiconductor processor, and the first of its kind to be manufactured in the U.S. The firm stated that it anticipates the chips to begin shipping this year as it continues to make efforts to reassert its leadership in high-performance computing and advanced manufacturing. Intel said it’s producing both processors and future 18A-based products at Fab 52, its new state-of-the-art facility in Chandler, Arizona. The firm confirmed that the facility is now fully operational and on track to achieve high-volume production of 18A chips later this year. The tech firm has invested more than $20 million into the new fab and hopes it will produce its chips in the U.S. for the first time in nearly a decade. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Nikkei reported Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) will gain powers to probe suspicious crypto trades. Under the plan, it can recommend surcharge orders and refer serious violations for criminal prosecution. This marks a major shift, as insider trading rules under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act currently do not apply to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Services Agency, which oversees the SESC, plans to finalize the rules through a working group by the end of the year. After that, it aims to submit amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act during the next regular parliamentary session. Japan Moves Toward Stricter Crypto Oversight Beyond Industry Self-Regulation Currently, exchanges and the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) are expected to self-regulate. However, critics note that the transaction monitoring system remains inadequate, leaving room for unfair practices. BREAKING: Japan's top financial regulator will introduce regulations to ban insider trading of cryptocurrencies, per Nikkei. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) October 15, 2025 Under the proposed framework, the FIEA will clearly ban trading cryptocurrencies based on nonpublic or undisclosed information. Next, the FSA will issue detailed guidelines to explain which behaviors fall under this rule. For example, it may cover trades made using private knowledge about a token’s upcoming listing. Similarly, acting on information about an exchange’s security flaw before it becomes public would also likely count as a violation. Defining Crypto Insiders Remains Complex As Many Tokens Lack Clear Issuers Japan faces a distinct challenge as many cryptocurrencies lack a clear issuer, making it difficult to determine who qualifies as an insider. This ambiguity has kept enforcement in crypto largely untested compared with traditional securities. In Asia, the push for clearer rules around digital assets has gained momentum. Japan now stands out, having recorded on-chain value received growth of 120% year-on-year as of June 2025, outpacing South Korea, India and Vietnam. Forecasts Point To 19M Japanese Crypto Holders By Year-End Crypto adoption in Japan is rising fast. As of May 2025, about 12.41m Japanese owned cryptocurrencies. That’s roughly 15% of adults, up from 9.17m the previous year. Meanwhile, forecasts suggest the number could reach 19.43m by year’s end. Clearer regulations and growing institutional participation are driving this growth. As a result, pressure is mounting on the government to act. Policymakers now face the task of shaping rules that balance innovation with investor protection. If successful, a transparent and trustworthy regulatory framework could help crypto shed its image as a risky frontier and evolve into a credible investment class in Japan.

After Friday’s massive crash, which wiped out billions in leveraged positions, bulls are struggling to regain control and establish a stable recovery. The broader market remains cautious, as traders weigh whether the current level can hold or if another wave of selling could push prices lower. Despite the pressure, some analysts see potential signs of resilience if Bitcoin can maintain support in this zone. According to top analyst Maartunn, recent on-chain activity reveals an important shift in market behavior. Over the last 24 hours, Short-Term Holders (STHs) have sent 46,524 BTC to exchanges, signaling active repositioning after the latest downturn. Such behavior often marks a short-term reset, allowing the market to absorb profit-taking and capitulation simultaneously. As Bitcoin hovers around key support, holding this range could determine whether the market is preparing for stabilization or another leg down. Bitcoin Enters New Phase As Market Seeks Direction According to Maartunn, the latest on-chain data reveals a critical rebalancing phase among Short-Term Holders (STHs) following the recent market crash. In the past 24 hours, these investors sent 46,524 BTC to exchanges, marking one of the largest movements in recent weeks. Of that total, 32,279 BTC were sent in profit, while 14,245 BTC were moved at a loss. This pattern reflects a market dynamic in which some investors are locking in gains after the latest recovery attempt, while others are cutting losses to reduce exposure amid uncertainty. Maartunn notes that such activity is typical in the aftermath of sharp corrections. It often signals the process of cleansing excess leverage and emotional trading — an essential step toward restoring equilibrium in the market. This type of rebalancing phase usually precedes the formation of a short-term or mid-term bottom, as selling pressure from both profit-takers and panic sellers gets absorbed by stronger hands. The coming days will be decisive in determining whether Bitcoin can stabilize near the $110,000–$112,000 range and build the foundation for a recovery. If the price holds, it could indicate that the market has found a sustainable floor, paving the way for renewed accumulation and confidence among investors. However, a breakdown below this zone could reignite fear and lead to another round of liquidations. Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading near $110,800, testing a crucial support zone after failing to hold above the $115,000–$116,000 resistance range. The 12-hour chart shows that BTC continues to struggle with downward pressure following last week’s crash, as market sentiment remains fragile and volatility persists. The rejection from the $117,500 level — a major supply zone that has capped rallies since early September — triggered renewed selling, pushing the price back below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This breakdown highlights weakening short-term momentum, with the 200-day MA (red) now positioned near $111,000, acting as the last significant line of defense for bulls. If Bitcoin closes decisively below this level, it could signal a deeper correction toward $107,000–$108,000, an area of previous accumulation. On the other hand, maintaining support here could set the stage for a rebound attempt toward $114,000–$115,000, where the next resistance cluster sits. The chart reflects a neutral-to-bearish structure, with bulls needing a strong push to reclaim lost ground. The coming sessions will be crucial, as sustained weakness below moving averages could extend the consolidation phase — while a bounce from current levels might confirm short-term stabilization before any broader recovery.

Traders said the move followed a failure to hold above the $0.23–$0.24 range and a break below a short-term rising channel that had been supporting prices earlier in October. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Breaks 13-Year Silence, Moves $33 Million To Exchange Technical Weakness Deepens The price action on the daily chart points to weakening momentum. Dogecoin could not defend $0.22, and that breach opened the door to faster selling that sent the token to its lowest level in over three weeks. The 20-day and 50-day EMAs sit around $0.23 and are now acting as overhead resistance. The Parabolic SAR has flipped to a bearish signal, which many traders see as confirmation that the recent uptrend has paused. If buyers cannot steady the market above $0.20, a deeper drop may test the $0.17–$0.18 band — a zone where a lot of accumulation occurred in late summer. A clear break under that area would put the $0.12 handle back in focus. On the upside, reclaiming $0.22 would be the first sign buyers are trying to push prices back up and could open a move toward $0.25. On-Chain Flows Signal Caution According to exchange flow data, a sizable amount of DOGE left trading platforms on October 14. Reports show over close to $57 million exited exchanges that day. Heavy outflows like that are often seen when holders move tokens off exchanges to custody or when distribution is taking place, and in this case market participants interpreted the flows as more aligned with selling pressure than fresh buying. Social media buzz over Dogecoin’s prospects has not translated into sustained inflows, and the meme coin group as a whole has felt weaker in recent sessions. 🚨 DOGECOIN: House of Doge plans to list on NASDAQ through a merger with Brag House, holding 837M $DOGE and $50M in funding. https://t.co/4hb03BxD5u pic.twitter.com/134tmh3HKd — Tesla Model Ðoge (@TeslaModelDoge) October 13, 2025 House Of Doge Merger Draws Attention In the meantime, in light of recent volatility and disappointing overall market conditions, the House of Doge announced plans to merge with Brag House Holdings Inc., which aims to create a public vehicle in the Dogecoin ecosystem. The combination of the companies will reportedly have 837 million DOGE along with $50 million in cash for investments. The announcement briefly lifted sentiment online, but price gains were short-lived as broader market weakness weighed on the token. The merged group plans to pursue tokenization, yield products, and payment tools, and its backers say the plan could bring more institutional interest to Dogecoin.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might rise further toward the $4,350 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,020 levels. The price is trading above $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,200. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,950 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price formed a base and was able to recover above the $4,000 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,290 swing high to the $3,890 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $4,120 pivot level. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,140 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,200 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,290 swing high to the $3,890 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,290 level. A clear move above the $4,290 resistance might send the price toward the $4,380 resistance. An upside break above the $4,380 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,200 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,000 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,880 zone. A clear move below the $3,880 support might push the price toward the $3,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,750 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,640.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-ledger-is-the-foundation-for-whats-next/,"Max Avery, a well-known figure in crypto and finance circles, recently shared his views on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its growing relevance in the evolving tokenization landscape. His comments provided a grounded perspective on what many XRP holders believe to be a significant turning point for the network. While the digital asset market continues to fluctuate, Avery’s remarks stand out for their focus on tangible growth rather than relying on speculation and investor optimism. Institutional Integration and Real Utility Avery stated that “every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use.” His point highlights a growing movement among blockchain projects to attract institutional adoption, but in XRP’s case, the focus is firmly on practical utility rather than speculation. Over the past few years, Ripple’s work with the XRPL has progressed steadily toward creating a framework capable of handling institutional-grade asset tokenization . As markets worldwide transition into the digital age, XRP is poised to dominate the emerging tokenization space. For XRP holders, the upside’s obvious. Every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use Ripple’s been focused on turning the XRPL into the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets with… — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) October 11, 2025 Ripple’s Infrastructure Vision Ripple has been positioning the XRPL as the infrastructure backbone for the digitization and tokenization of real-world assets, which is the next phase of global finance. According to Avery, Ripple’s focus is directed toward transforming the ledger into “the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets.” This statement aligns with the company’s long-term vision of embedding XRP within financial systems that require speed, compliance, and interoperability. What separates XRP from competing digital assets is its readiness for institutional use. The XRPL’s performance and scalability have been tested across multiple pilot programs and partnerships involving central bank digital currencies and tokenized commodities. These efforts have established a foundation that supports Avery’s perspective that the XRPL is not an experimental blockchain but one designed for real-world financial integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Perception and Institutional Reality Despite Ripple’s progress, skepticism continues to shape public perception of XRP. Much of the market still views it primarily through a speculative lens rather than as a piece of financial infrastructure. Avery’s comments address this disconnect, suggesting that many fail to see or acknowledge the progress taking place in real time. He noted that XRP’s next-generation infrastructure is already taking shape in real-time, emphasizing that adoption is not a distant goal but an active process underway. Institutional participation has quietly expanded in sectors such as cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Each new integration of the XRPL into real-world use cases strengthens its position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain systems .

According to CryptoQuant analyst COINDREAM, it means that short-term confidence has fallen following last week’s historic market crash. Market Metrics Signal Waning Confidence COINDREAM’s analysis revealed that three key indicators on Binance are flashing warning signs. First, the exchange’s funding rates for perpetual futures contracts have been negative for three days in a row, which hasn’t been a normal occurrence this year. “When the exchange with the largest derivatives trading volume shows bearish sentiment, it can have a negative impact on the overall market,” noted the expert. Secondly, he mentioned that the average number of deposits to the exchange is going up, according to a 7-day moving average. This increase in deposit volume is happening even as prices go down, leading the analyst to conclude that more downward pressure could emerge if the movement fails to find support from strong demand. The third and maybe most telling metric is the percentage of market sell orders, which is quite high. Usually, the sell volume goes down near price bottoms and shoots above 0.52 around market tops. Given that the Binance market sell ratio is over the 0.52 mark even after last week’s big price drops, the observer said it could mean that selling sentiment among traders on the platform is becoming stronger. Recovery Stalls Amid Uncertainty in the Economy The current cautious stance should come as no surprise, given the crypto market just experienced its worst liquidation event in history on October 10. The downturn took more than $19 billion from the market, affecting more than 1.6 million traders. Even though platforms like Binance have since compensated affected users and markets have made up some of their losses, many observers viewed the event as a big reset. One of them, Doctor Profit, said that the extreme leverage that had been built in the system has now been taken away, putting both bulls and bears on a more equal footing. However, the shift in Binance’s trader behavior suggests that many remain cautious about re-entering the market too soon. Bitcoin and most major altcoins have bounced back a little, but they are still far below where they were before the crash. Crypto commentators now say the next directional cue will be based on broader economic indicators, like how U.S. stocks will perform in the near future.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.47 Market Cap $1.87B Trading Volume $84.95M Circulating Supply 539.22M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.63 24-h Low $3.39 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 9.36% 14-Day RSI 38.97 50-Day SMA $4.61 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 38 (Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.31 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish below $3.50, with weak momentum. The coin’s supports sit at $3.30 and $3.11, while upside resistance lies near $3.95–$4.10. A break above $3.60 could trigger a short-lived recovery, but sentiment remains cautious. ICP 1-day price analysis ICP’s daily chart for October 15 shows a soft bearish continuation following rejection around $3.55, with the current price at $3.47, down 1.67%. The Bollinger Bands are compressing between the lower band at $3.11 and the upper resistance at $4.11, indicating reduced volatility but also a possible breakout soon. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram stays slightly negative, with both the signal and MACD lines below zero, signaling weak buying pressure. The RSI stands at 41.77, indicating a slight oversold condition but not yet showing strong accumulation. If ICP drops below $3.40, it could retest $3.20–$3.11, while recovery above $3.70 may open a push toward $4.10. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP continues to range between $3.46 and $3.58 with limited direction. The Alligator indicator is flattening, with all three lines converging near the current price, signaling market indecision and likely upcoming volatility. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD shows mild bullish attempts, hovering around the zero line, but the weak crossover suggests bulls are losing grip. Volume remains steady near 16.5 million, reflecting a lack of conviction for a larger move. If ICP reclaims $3.58–$3.60, short-term buyers could push toward $3.70, but a break below $3.42 would likely trigger selling down to $3.30.

Unless the price breaks firmly above $3.60, the trend remains vulnerable, and a further decline toward $3.30 or even $3.10 is likely. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

Henry Aguda, the government is taking concrete steps to test whether blockchain can make the Philippine national budget more open and traceable. He told the Malacañang Press Corps that a working prototype will be shown to senators and representatives to prove the idea can work. The move comes as lawmakers push a bill that would put budget documents and transaction records on a distributed ledger for public verification. DICT Moves To Build Prototype Aguda said the country has “a lot of experts on blockchain,” and that one of his tasks is to provide a minimum viable product so lawmakers can see a live demo before any full rollout. He also mentioned that the DICT has been experimenting with stablecoin systems to trace peso transactions in banks. Reports say he will ask President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to certify the related bill as urgent, signaling that the executive branch may press for faster action. Senate Bill 1330, titled the “Philippine National Budget Blockchain Act,” would require the executive branch, Congress, and local governments to upload and publish their budget transactions on a blockchain . If enacted, citizens would be able to follow allocations, bids, disbursements, and contracts on a publicly visible chain. The bill also aims to borrow features from the Full Disclosure Bill so people can compare contracts and expense reports. On Transparency & Security At a Senate hearing on SB1330, the Committee on Science and Technology discussed how blockchain might help expose delays or anomalies in spending. Sen. Bam Aquino told the panel that placing records on a public ledger could make budget processes “transparent, honest, and secure.” Advocates say the visible chain would let ordinary citizens track where funds move and spot mismatches faster than current systems allow. Legal Expert Casts Doubt On Blockchain Budget Push Not everyone is sold on the idea. Florin Hilbay, former Solicitor General and now dean at Silliman University College of Law, asked plainly: “Do we really need to put the budget on a blockchain?” He warned that what starts as a promise of openness could turn into a centralized database held on a few servers run by contractors. Hilbay also pointed to cost concerns, saying the plan allocates PhP500 million ($8.6 million) as an initial expense, and he argued that smart contracts and validator nodes add complexity and new technical risks. Aguda said the DICT will not tap public funds for the prototype and that private groups have already offered help.

After a period of correction, technical indicators, structural signals, and price action now suggest the potential for a renewed bullish move. Ethereum Slips Below Key $4,060 Support Ted, in a recent update shared on X, pointed out that Ethereum has slipped below its crucial $4,060 support level, a move that may hint at a short-term bearish phase for the asset. This breakdown has drawn traders’ attention to lower support regions, as Ethereum’s next moves will likely determine whether the market stabilizes or faces further pressure. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Price Might Have Reached ‘Wave 4’ Bottom — Path To $5,000? According to Ted, the next major support sits around $3,800, a level that has recently served as a strong demand zone. If Ethereum fails to defend this region, it could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $3,400–$3,600 range, where a stronger accumulation phase might form. Such a decline would likely shake out weak hands and allow for a more sustainable base to build upon for the next major move. However, Ted also noted a possible bullish scenario where Ethereum could reclaim the $4,060 and $4,250 levels. A successful recovery above these zones could confirm that the recent drop was merely a correction within a larger bullish structure, potentially paving the way for a powerful rally as the market regains confidence. Bullish Structure Confirmed As ETH Holds Key Demand Zone According to Nadezhada on X, Ethereum’s chart is looking increasingly bullish, showing signs of strength after recent market movements. The analyst noted that a Break of Structure (BOS) has been confirmed, signaling that Ethereum may be preparing for its next significant upward move. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Bullish After Multi-Year Breakout — $7,000 May Be Imminent Nadezhada highlighted a key demand zone between $3,910 and $3,800, which aligns with both a Fair Value Gap (FVG) and an Order Block (OB) on the chart. This area represents a strong region of buyer interest, where liquidity could build up. Thus, maintaining stability within this zone may set the foundation for the next rally. If Ethereum manages to hold the $3,910–$3,800 support area, Nadezhada believes it could act as a springboard for a sharp move toward $4,550 and beyond. Such a rebound would mark a strong continuation of the broader uptrend, with buyers firmly back in control. The crypto analyst concluded by emphasizing that buyers appear to be positioning for the next leg higher, as technical signals continue to align in their favor. With structure, demand, and sentiment converging, Ethereum seems ready to attempt another breakout if market conditions remain supportive.

In the following lines, we will raise the alarm about the latest threat that users should stay alert for. Scammers Drain Wallets The X account Shibarium Trustwatch recently warned that scammers have created a malicious website impersonating Shiba Inu’s official platform. The fake one includes “special” promotions and false claims of partnerships and presale bonuses whose goal is to lure people into connecting their wallets. “Once connected, the site can initiate unauthorised transactions and drain your assets,” the team behind the X account alerted. Shiba Inu users are advised to rely only on the official website of the project, where they can find trustworthy information about the whole ecosystem. They should never connect their wallets to unknown sites, double-check URLs, and report suspicious activity. But that’s not all. Scammers have also spread to popular social media and messaging applications like Discord, Telegram, and X. “Their goal? To trick unsuspecting holders into connecting wallets, sharing seed phrases, or clicking malicious links,” Shibarium Trustwatch stated. The Previous Threat Earlier this month, the team issued another warning related to a malicious Shiba Inu airdrop. It revealed that real SHIB tokens have been distributed to some users’ wallets; however, malicious actors have attached a deceptive message urging people to visit a suspicious website to claim rewards. This was a classic example of a phishing scam. “The token itself may be valid, but the message is designed to lure users into connecting their wallets to a fake site,” Shibarium Trustwatch said. As usual, the team provided some vital steps that users must follow to stay safe. These measures include verifying all token activity through Shiba Inu’s official channels, disregarding embedded messages in token names and airdrops, and avoiding unknown websites that promote such offers.

The price is now showing positive signs and could aim for more gains above the $2.620 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.60 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh surge if it clears the $2.60 resistance. XRP Price Set To Surge? XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.220, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.320 and $2.40 levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the bears are still active near the $2.60 and $2.620 levels. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.60 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level and the trend line. The main hurdle could be near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low at $2.660. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.750 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.50 level. The next major support is near the $2.420 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.420 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.250 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.50 and $2.420.

In his video, he highlighted XRP’s brief fall below $2 before rebounding, and he believes the way investors reacted during the drop is a key signal for what may come next. According to the analyst, “panic was driven by derivatives liquidations, not investors selling,” as XRP’s exchange supply remained nearly unchanged throughout the event. This stability in exchange reserves indicates that long-term holders maintained confidence during the downturn. The analyst emphasized that the crash appeared to be largely technical, not driven by large-scale selling. This observation aligns with his interpretation of the gray line on the chart, representing XRP’s exchange supply, which showed no notable decline while prices fell sharply. I HAVE VERY CRAZY NEWS FOR #XRP TODAY!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/OXalJoiAFK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 13, 2025 Technical Signals Suggest Recovery Potential Steph also revisited a bearish divergence that developed on XRP’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) since late 2023. The pattern, where prices made higher highs while RSI formed lower highs, suggested weakening momentum and preceded the recent decline. He noted a similar situation occurred between 2020 and 2021, leading to a steep fall followed by a strong rebound of about 170%. Based on that historical pattern, he believes another major recovery could be underway. He compared XRP’s current position to its behavior during the 2021 bull run, when the price dropped precisely to the 50-week simple moving average before rallying. Steph pointed out that XRP once again touched this same level during the latest sell-off . If the weekly candle closes above the moving average, he argued, the market could be positioned for a significant upside move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch for Confirmation The analyst also discussed the importance of XRP’s reaction to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, often seen as a critical support zone. He noted that the recent crash reached this level with near-perfect accuracy and believes this move may mark the end of the correction phase. Steph identified $2.72 as a decisive resistance point. A sustained break above that level would confirm a shift toward bullish continuation . On the daily chart, XRP remains below the EMA ribbons. This means the market still carries residual bearish momentum. However, he added that the daily RSI has now dipped into oversold territory, a condition that has historically signaled strong recovery phases for XRP. He cited past examples in 2022 and 2023 where similar RSI readings led to double-bottom formations and eventual rallies. Steph concluded that “either the bottom is in or we are very close to the bottom,” suggesting that current holders could benefit from patience as momentum gradually rebuilds.

DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears $0.2180. DOGE price started a fresh upward move above $0.20 and $0.2050. The price is trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1980 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for more gains if it remains stable above $0.1880. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Upside Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1880, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.20 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2050 and $0.2120. A high was formed at $0.2182 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.1787 swing low to the $0.2182 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1980 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2085 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2120 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2180 level. A close above the $0.2180 resistance might send the price toward $0.2320. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2620. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2120 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.20 level. The next major support is near the $0.1980 level and the trend line. The main support sits at $0.1880. If there is a downside break below the $0.1880 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1720 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1980 and $0.1880.

Operating under the mayor’s administration, it aims to coordinate blockchain innovation across city agencies, enhance public understanding of digital assets, and draw world-class talent to New York’s expanding tech ecosystem. This comes as the Mayor recently announced that he is leaving his re-election bid. The race will now likely be between Democrat Zohran Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. In a post last month, Adams said, “Despite all we’ve achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign.”Data from public opinion polls showed that Adams had been running far behind Mamdani and Cuomo, who were contesting as independents. The polls indicated Mamdani has a sizeable lead before the November 4 election in the most populous city in the United States. New York City builds a blockchain office to drive innovation and growth Mayor Eric Adams announced the establishment of the new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain, which will help New York become a global leader in digital assets and demonstrate the city’s readiness to welcome the future. “Our first-in-the-nation Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain will help make us the global capital of digital assets.” He added that such new technology will create more jobs, bring new investment, and build new opportunities for people from every background. The city’s Chief Technology Officer, Matt Fraser, will lead the office as it collaborates with the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation and fosters strong partnerships with private companies, investors, and community groups. The office will connect the city government and the digital assets industry, enabling businesses to share their ideas and challenges directly with policymakers. It will also teach people about digital assets and help them understand how to use them safely. The office will run public education campaigns to help New Yorkers understand the risks and benefits of digital currencies clearly and straightforwardly. It will teach residents how to protect their wallets, spot fake websites or messages, and avoid common online fraud. This educational effort will also support financial inclusion, as it will reach communities that have been traditionally excluded from banking services. Mayor Adams said he wants New York City to lead by example and demonstrate to the world how technology can serve people, rather than replace them. Mayor Adams picks Moises Rendon to lead the new digital assets office Mayor Eric Adams picked Moises Rendon as the first executive director of New York City’s new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain. Rendon has been part of the city’s Office of Technology and Innovation since 2024. He has also spent many years collaborating with international organizations, government agencies, and private companies to develop fair and modern regulations for the expanding digital finance sector. Rendon said he feels deeply honored to take on this new role and called it a “historic moment for New York City.” He explained that the office is about helping people understand and benefit from new technology. One of the first major steps he will take as the head of the office is to establish a new commission composed of experts who will advise the city on its strategy regarding digital assets. Their task will be to debate ideas, share insights, and ensure that the city’s policies enable progress while safeguarding people’s safety and privacy. The task group will also examine how blockchain can be utilized in government services, including maintaining records in a secure and accessible manner, enhancing public information access, and facilitating faster payments for SMEs.

Georgieva argued that financial systems should adapt to this transformation rather than resist it and manage risks. The IMF issued significant warnings to central banks in its latest assessment. The institution emphasized the need to be vigilant against inflation risks stemming from customs duties and emphasized the need to avoid excessive easing of monetary policy. The IMF warned that such easing could lead to further increases in risky asset prices. Related News: Binance Responds to Claims of Altcoin Dumping and Listing Fee Demands The statement noted that central bank independence is critical to balancing market expectations and ensuring institutions effectively fulfill their mandates. However, the IMF did not name any countries or institutions in this assessment. The agency also called for “urgent fiscal adjustment” to control budget deficits and maintain the resilience of bond markets. The IMF report also warned that increasing linkages between banks and less regulated non-financial institutions could exacerbate shocks in areas like private credit and cryptocurrencies. The IMF urged policymakers to assess these “hidden risks” more comprehensively and, in particular, closely monitor risk pass-through between banks and non-bank financial institutions. *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade went live on the Sepolia testnet. The upgrade raises the block gas limit and introduces PeerDAS technology, and is expected to prepare the network for its mainnet launch in December. Ethereum Could Hit $10K BitMine chair Tom Lee and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes are holding firm on their bullish Ethereum predictions. They maintain that the cryptocurrency will reach $10,000 before the end of the year despite a turbulent market and less than three months remaining in 2025. On the Bankless podcast , Lee said he expects Ethereum to land somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000, while Hayes is confident in a $10,000 target. He said he intends to “stay consistent” with his forecast. With Ethereum currently trading around $4,094, the projection represents a potential 140+% gain, which is a bold call given the market’s recent volatility. Lee argued that such a move will not be irrational exuberance but rather a natural progression after years of consolidation. He described Ethereum as having been “basing” since 2021, and pointed out that it spent almost four years in a wide range after peaking at $4,878 that year. According to Lee, Ethereum’s recent price action shows it just broke out of that long-term range, paving the way for what he calls “price discovery at a new level.” He added that while a move to $10,000 will be a major milestone, it would likely not be the ultimate top for Ethereum, but rather a “happy level” on the path to future growth. Hayes and Lee’s forecasts were made shortly after a sharp market crash that wiped out over $19 billion in leveraged positions across the crypto landscape. Ethereum has since shown resilience by recovering from around $4,350 before the drop to just below $4,100. However, historical data paints a more modest picture. Ethereum quarterly returns (Source: CoinGlass ) According to CoinGlass , Ethereum’s average return in the fourth quarter since 2016 stands at 21.36%. If that pattern holds, Ethereum could end the year near $5,000 — which is still far below Hayes and Lee’s projection. Other analysts, including Tesseract CEO James Harris and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, are also optimistic. Harris predicted a year-end target near $6,500 and van de Poppe suggested the ETH/BTC pair’s recent drop offers an ideal setup for a push toward new highs. Fusaka Upgrade Hits Ethereum Testnet Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade successfully went live on the Sepolia testnet, which is a huge milestone in the network’s mission to boost scalability and efficiency. This activation is the second stage of a three-phase rollout, following the earlier deployment on the Holesky testnet on Oct. 1. Developers are now stress testing Fusaka’s enhanced data-availability system and higher block gas limits before moving to the final Hoodi testnet later this month. Once complete, the upgrade is expected to pave the way for a mainnet release in December. The Fusaka roadmap introduces several performance and consensus improvements that are designed to make Ethereum faster and more capable of handling complex activity. A key feature of the upgrade is the planned increase of the block gas limit to 60 million, which will enable each block to process more transactions and smart contract operations. (Source: Datawallet ) Ethereum developers are using Sepolia to evaluate whether nodes can handle this higher capacity without compromising stability or network security. Gabriel Trintinalia , a protocol engineer at Consensys and a core developer for the Besu client, said that the client teams worked extensively to make sure the current node setups can manage the heavier load of 60 million gas blocks without triggering instability. Another major innovation under Fusaka is Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), a new system that allows validators to verify transaction data by sampling small portions from multiple peers instead of downloading all the data themselves. This greatly reduces the data burden on nodes and improves scalability and maintaining decentralization. Paul Harris, a core developer at Consensys’ Teku client, explained that PeerDAS is a fundamental shift in how Ethereum handles data availability as it allows scaling “beyond what was possible before.” (Source: Datawallet ) The Ethereum Foundation announced the Fusaka testnet rollout plan in late September, and described this upgrade as the next step after the Pectra update earlier this year. Pectra introduced new functionality for externally owned accounts, raised the validator staking limit, and expanded data capacity per block. It followed other key milestones, including Dencun in March of 2024, and The Merge in 2022, which transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 05:30:00

Representative Troy Downing presented the draft bill before the House Financial Services Committee, aiming to codify Executive Order 14330 and give it lasting legal authority. The move, first reported by Politico, would mark a significant step toward integrating digital assets into mainstream retirement investment options. Trump’s Executive Order on Retirement Options Executive Order 14330, signed by Trump on August 7, directs that every American planning for retirement should have access to funds that include “alternative assets” when deemed suitable by a fiduciary overseeing the plan. The order defines alternative assets broadly — including private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure projects, lifetime income strategies, and digital assets through actively managed investment vehicles. Although executive orders set federal priorities, they do not carry the permanence of law and can be overturned by subsequent administrations or court rulings. To make such policies enduring, Congress must pass a bill approved by both chambers and have it signed into law. Legislative Push Continues Despite Shutdown Despite an ongoing government shutdown, Congress remains able to introduce and debate new legislation. Trump’s executive order also instructed the Department of Labor, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Treasury Secretary to review and prioritize new guidance for 401(k) plans within six months. The goal is to expand access to diversified retirement investment strategies, including exposure to digital and alternative assets. Expanding Crypto Access for Retirement The initiative to include digital assets in US retirement accounts has been building momentum throughout 2025. Earlier this year, the Department of Labor withdrew Biden-era guidance warning fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” about including crypto in retirement portfolios. In September, shortly after Trump’s executive order took effect, nine lawmakers sent a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins urging faster implementation. They argued that doing so could “help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.” According to data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI), Americans held $9.3 trillion in 401(k) assets as of June 30, 2025 — highlighting the potential scale of impact if digital assets become a standard investment option. Industry Divided on Crypto’s Role in 401(k)s The proposal has sparked debate among financial experts. Critics warn that crypto’s volatility could endanger retirement savings, while supporters see it as an important step toward financial modernization. André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, told Cointelegraph in August that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US retirement plans “could mark a major step for Bitcoin adoption and attract billions in new capital.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-15 05:35:27

The people who noticed the structure, vision, and timing back then became the early winners. Today, many investors watching the crypto charts are asking why is crypto going up again after the $20B liquidations. The answer might soon include a name that keeps coming up in growing circles — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This project, now in its Phase 6 presale, is being seen by some analysts as the next major success story before the next bull wave begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the type of ecosystem that attracts both retail users and professional investors. Its mix of lending innovation, stablecoin design, and strong technical roots gives it a real use case. The ongoing presale has already raised around $17.35 million across earlier phases. Phase 6 is moving fast, with 68% of the 170 million tokens already sold at a price of $0.035. The next step is $0.040, which means a 15% price jump is near. With over 17,100 holders already joining, the community is forming even before any potential exchange exposure begins. The total supply stands at 4 billion MUTM, showing strong participation in a short time. Post launch some of the experts have predicted that this project will go beyond a 1,000% level because of the utility embedded and real use case delivery in fast Layer-2 and CertiK approved environments. The lending engine that builds constant demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will power a new lending and borrowing model that keeps funds moving on-chain. Its design includes two connected parts: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. Together, these two areas are expected to make the protocol’s ecosystem active and liquid. In the P2C side, lenders will deposit assets such as USDT or ETH into audited smart contracts. These pools will make it easy for others to borrow. Once lenders deposit, they will receive mtTokens in return, like mtUSDT, which represent their pool share. As borrowing grows, these mtTokens will earn interest, giving lenders an attractive annual yield. For example, a lender adding $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT one-to-one and will earn around 15% yearly returns. Borrowers will join from the other side. They will post collateral, like ETH, and borrow up to 75% of its value. Suppose a borrower posts $1,000 in ETH; they will unlock around $750 to use, depending on the asset’s loan-to-value (LTV). The platform will use automatic liquidations and stability checks to protect both sides. The first version of this protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, starting with ETH and USDT assets. This version will include key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operations. These practical features will give users a chance to experience the platform before the full launch. As users explore and gain confidence in the system, investor interest is likely to grow, potentially increasing demand and pushing the token’s price higher than expected. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also building its own decentralized stablecoin, pegged to $1. This coin will only be created when users borrow against assets like ETH and will be burned once loans are repaid. Each issuer will have capped limits, and borrowing rates will adjust through governance to help the stablecoin hold its peg. For example, when the stablecoin trades below $1, rates will rise to balance it. This design will create steady, long-term borrowing demand and turn Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a working financial network rather than just a trading token. Strong technical framework and anticipated listings Behind every fast-growing crypto project is a reliable pricing and security system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, and DEX-based time-weighted prices (TWAPs) to ensure accurate valuations for assets. This will reduce risk for lenders, keep liquidations fair, and make the protocol safer. When investors feel secure, they lock more capital. That means higher liquidity, more borrowing, and more rewards for those who stake mtTokens. This steady loop of activity is what turns a project into a long-term ecosystem. The excitement around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also connects to possible exchange listings after the presale. History shows that tokens like Solana and Polygon saw massive jumps — between 700% and 1,200% — within months of their first exchange listings. A well-known crypto analyst, who accurately called Bitcoin’s 2017 rally, expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach around $0.60 from its projected listing region near $0.06. That would be a 1,000% gain — the kind of growth early investors dream of when scanning the crypto charts for the next mover. The community building team is also running an active giveaway. A new update has been out for the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user in the top position will receive a $500 MUTM reward, provided they make at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC every day. Final verdict People are once again asking why crypto is going up as the crypto market comes back to life after the recent crash. A lot of people currently think that the next wave will be led by projects that have meaningful use cases and long-term demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has functional technology, stablecoin mechanics, a way to make actual money, and a clear plan for when it will be released. The timing is really important because Phase 6 is already 68% done and the price is about to go up to $0.040. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its early stages, just like Bitcoin was years ago. It’s a peaceful time until everyone notices. The focus will swiftly shift when the exchange listings come out. For those who are paying attention, this is the time before the crowd knows what’s being built.

This relief rally was primarily driven by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and positive corporate earnings in the U.S. Investors were comforted by Powell's remarks on Tuesday, where he acknowledged the U.S. economy's ""firmer footing"" but raised a caution about a ""notably softer labor market."" Despite the rally, sentiment remains fragile due to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, after President Trump threatened Beijing with a cooking oil embargo in response to China’s soybean boycott. Meanwhile, the euro advanced after France proposed suspending major pension reforms, while the yen strengthened as traders unwound the “Takaichi trade.” Adding to the optimism, the IMF raised South Korea’s 2025 growth forecast to 0.9%, citing a smaller-than-expected impact from recent US tariff measures and resilience in exports. Silver climbed back above $52 per ounce on Wednesday, holding close to record highs hit in the prior session as a global supply crunch fueled a historic rally. Gold prices climbed to around $4,180 per ounce on Wednesday, extending its bullish run to notch a fresh record. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.71% to above 47,000 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.8% to 3,160 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 151 per dollar on Wednesday, rising for the second straight session as markets remain uncertain whether ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader Sanae Takaichi will become the next prime minister following the coalition split with the Komeito party. Opposition parties are also holding talks today to secure enough backing to form a new government. Japan’s industrial production contracted 1.5% month-over-month in August 2025, steeper than the flash data of a 1.2% fall, which was also July's figure. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.49% to above 3,870, while the Shenzhen Component advanced 0.9% to 13,000 on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, and the offshore yuan rose to around 7.12 per dollar on Wednesday, snapping a three-session decline, as the People’s Bank of China reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining currency stability. China's consumer prices dropped 0.3% y/y in September 2025 , steeper than market estimates of a 0.1% decline but slightly less than a 0.4% fall in the previous month. Meanwhile, China’s producer prices fell 2.3% year-on-year in September 2025, easing from a 2.9% drop in the previous month. In a separate release, Premier Li Qiang reiterated calls to boost consumption and curb unfair competition among businesses. On the trade front, sentiment remained cautious after President Trump threatened Beijing with a cooking oil embargo in response to China’s soybean boycott. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.35% to 25,774 around noon on Wednesday, snapping a seven-session losing streak amid broad strength across sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.53% to 82,361 in morning trade on Wednesday, snapping a two-day losing streak. The International Monetary Fund has raised India’s growth forecast to 6.6% from 6.4% for FY2025/26, as the country’s strong growth momentum is expected to offset the impact of high US tariffs on Indian goods. Domestic sentiment was also boosted by India’s headline inflation data for September, which came in below the RBI's target range, raising hopes of a rate cut at the December policy meeting. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.03% climbed 0.9% to above 8,975 on Wednesday, marking its strongest daily gain in almost two weeks. The Australian dollar appreciated to around $0.650 on Wednesday, recovering some of the prior session’s losses. Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter noted that recent economic data has been slightly stronger than anticipated, indicating inflation in the third quarter may exceed earlier forecasts. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia was unchanged in September 2025, following a 0.1% decline in the previous month. Reserve Bank of New Zealand Chief Economist Paul Conway said the official cash rate of 2.5% is at the lower end of the neutral range, but the MPC remains open to further rate cuts if necessary. In the U.S. on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors balanced mostly positive bank earnings, Federal Reserve comments, and ongoing US-China trade tensions U.S. stock futures stabilized on Wednesday after the major averages swung sharply in the previous session: Dow +0.30% ; S&P 500 +0.46% ; Nasdaq +0.67% .

Analysts compare $0.035 coin to ETH’s 2018 levels,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/15/next-big-crypto-analysts-compare-0-035-coin-to-eths-2018-levels/,"In 2018, Ethereum was trading under $100 while most traders dismissed it as another fading altcoin. Yet behind the scenes, it was building the foundation for decentralized finance. Years later, that same “undervalued phase” turned early believers into millionaires. Analysts now see similar signs in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto protocol that is already developing a working lending ecosystem before its token even lists. With crypto prices today climbing across the market, this $0.035 presale is starting to look like Ethereum’s 2018 moment all over again. There is a new update on the 24-hour leaderboard where each day, the highest-ranked user will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC daily. The undervalued window before takeoff Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with 68% already sold and more than 17,100 holders. The project has raised about $17.35 million across all phases. Once this phase closes, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7, signaling the final discounted window before listing. Investors are taking notice of the numbers — the data shows growing momentum, and the timing aligns perfectly with rising DeFi interest. The project’s design sets it apart from typical presale tokens. Mutuum is planning that it will launch its live protocol and token at the same time. This means that from day one, users will interact with real lending pools, interest-earning mtTokens, and on-chain transactions that generate real revenue. Analysts view this “dual launch” model as a game-changer because it gives instant liquidity and organic trading volume that most presales lack. A complete DeFi ecosystem in motion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate two lending models that blend scalability with personalization. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C), where users will deposit assets such as USDT or ETH into audited smart contracts. These deposits will supply liquidity for borrowers while generating passive income. When a user lends, they will receive mtTokens, which represent their share in the pool plus interest. For example, someone lending $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT 1:1 and may earn about $2,250 in interest per year at an average 15% APY. On the borrower side, Mutuum’s overcollateralized model will ensure system safety. A borrower posting $1,000 worth of BTC will be able to access up to 75% of that amount, depending on the asset’s Loan-to-Value ratio. This controlled framework keeps the protocol liquid even in volatile conditions, maintaining fair exposure limits. The second lending model, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), will cater to tokens outside main liquidity pools — such as meme or niche assets. Here, lenders and borrowers will agree on custom terms. It’s a flexible layer that expands access without compromising core stability. Together, these two models will allow Mutuum to scale like a major DeFi network while staying user-driven. Upon the full release, users will be able to experience the real lending, borrowing and staking on Layer-2 setup. The flawless quickly executed transactions appreciate more participation and hence more liquidity will flow within the platform. More circulation means more demand for MUTM which will help increase the price in the longer run. Real utility, buybacks, and growth Unlike many early tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will tie its token utility directly to on-chain activity. Every loan, repayment, liquidation, and staking action will create demand for MUTM. The platform’s future stablecoin — pegged to $1 and minted only against collateral — will enhance liquidity while supporting price stability. Revenue from the platform will fund open-market MUTM buybacks, and these repurchased tokens will be redistributed to stakers. This process works like dividends in traditional finance, rewarding holders with a continuous value flow. Stakers will earn MUTM rewards on their mtTokens, reinforcing a cycle of yield and buyback that strengthens the ecosystem’s tokenomics over time. Mutuum’s progress also extends to its upcoming launch of V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will feature the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot with assets like ETH and USDT. This testnet will mark a visible milestone in the project’s roadmap, confirming that its technology development is moving in sync with its token growth. ROI math that grabs attention Early investors are already seeing the value curve. Someone who purchased $10,000 worth of MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.015 now holds 667K tokens valued at $23.5K in Phase 6 — a 2.3x value gain before listing. When analysts apply their crypto predictions based on ETH’s early trajectory, the case becomes even stronger. If MUTM repeats Ethereum’s early multiplier effect, the same investment would soon be worth $233K at $0.35. That’s the kind of upside that defines early-stage opportunity. A rare blend of progress and incentive Security and transparency remain key strengths. Mutuum has completed its CertiK audit with a TokenScan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. It also maintains a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage ongoing security testing. Beyond that, an active $100,000 giveaway — with 10 winners set to receive $10,000 each in MUTM — further boosts community engagement and visibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that DeFi can combine innovation, audit-backed safety, and direct value creation. With 68% of Phase 6 already sold and a 15% price jump ahead, this presale stands at a crucial turning point. For investors watching crypto prices today and looking for the next undervalued project with real mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may define the ETH-2018 moment of 2025.

Investors Are Withdrawing Their Stablecoins From Exchanges In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared about the latest trend in the Exchange Withdrawing Transactions for the Ethereum-based stablecoins . This indicator measures, as its name implies, the total number of transfers related to an asset or a group of assets flowing from wallets connected to centralized exchanges to self-custodial addresses. Generally, investors take their coins into self-custody when they are planning to hold them in the long term, or at least, not immediately looking to trade them away. As such, a high value of the Exchange Withdrawal Transactions can be a signal that investors aren’t looking to sell the cryptocurrency right now. Now, here is a chart that shows how the 30-day moving average (MA) of the stablecoin Exchange Withdrawing Transactions has fluctuated since 2020: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Withdrawing Transactions for the ERC-20 stablecoins has seen its 30-day MA value follow a sharp uptrend recently. This suggests an increasing amount of transfers are occurring to take stables away from the custody of exchanges. If a volatile asset like Bitcoin were involved here, this trend would have naturally been bullish for its price. But as stablecoins have their price constant around a fiat currency, selling or buying doesn’t affect their price in the same manner. Instead, what investors do with stables can have an effect on the volatile side of the market. When holders deposit these fiat-tied tokens to exchanges, it can be an indication that they are looking to buy into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, their shifting the coins away from exchanges can be a sign that they want to keep their capital still in the safety of the stablecoins for some period. Following the recent rapid growth in the stablecoin Exchange Withdrawal transactions, its value has reached the 67,384 mark, the highest level since May 2021. This previous spike in May 2021 occurred as holders sold Bitcoin for stables during the infamous crash that month. While the latest spike in the metric’s 30-day MA value is extraordinary in scale, it’s still just the first surge in demand for withdrawing stablecoins in the current cycle so far. The previous cycle witnessed several spikes of a similar scale before the music stopped for the bull run . BTC Price Bitcoin has seen another setback during the past day as its price has returned to the $110,900 level.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoin Exchange Outflows|Stablecoin Exchange Withdrawals|Stablecoins|Stables,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 06:00:05

Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Struggle Amid Market Uncertainty",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-driving-the-drop-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-struggle-amid-market-uncertainty/,"After beginning the week above the critical $115,000 mark, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market initially showed signs of recovery. However, BTC has resumed its downward trajectory, experiencing a 4% decline over the past 24 hours. This downturn has had a cascading effect on other altcoins, particularly Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. BTC, ETH, XRP’s Plunge Explained With the Bitcoin drop, Ethereum recorded a 5% drop, once again losing the pivotal $4,000 support level, while XRP has suffered even greater losses, plummeting by 7% during the same timeframe. This decline has pushed XRP closer to $2.40 as of Tuesday, highlighting the volatility affecting altcoins in the current market environment. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency According to Bloomberg, this recent Bitcoin and crypto slide can be attributed to geopolitical tensions, specifically China’s imposition of restrictions on the American units of Hanwha Ocean Co., one of South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. This action is seen as a retaliatory measure against US sanctions targeting the Chinese shipping sector. Bitcoin and the crypto market were already reeling from a brutal selloff that began on October 10, which resulted in approximately $19 billion worth of leveraged positions being liquidated. This selloff, which saw the Bitcoin price drop toward $102,000 last Friday, was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s threats of increased tariffs on China in response to new export controls. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Market analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s performance, noting that a drop below the $110,000 threshold could initiate a test of the $104,000 to $108,000 liquidity band, according to Timothy Misir, head of research at digital-assets analytics platform BRN. “The market now enters a consolidation phase, characterized by renewed caution, selective risk-taking, and a more measured rebuilding of confidence across both spot and derivatives markets,” commented analytics firm Glassnode. Furthermore, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s trajectory over the short, mid, and long term on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation’s House Of Doge Announces NASDAQ Listing In the short term, covering the current month, the Bitcoin outlook is neutral. Although a slightly bullish sentiment was noted yesterday, it has reverted to neutral as new data emerges, emphasizing the need for more information to make a conclusive decision. For the mid-term outlook, spanning one to three months, the sentiment is bearish. The expert indicates that the market has recently entered the early stages of a bear phase. While there may be instances of dead cat bounces, he suggests that the overall direction for the mid-term appears to be downward. Looking further ahead, in the long term (three to twelve months), the analysis remains extremely bearish for Bitcoin and crypto as the macroeconomic environment indicates an impending global economic upheaval, which many believe is closer than it appears. When writing, Bitcoin trades just above its key support for the short-term at $110,300.

Stripe, which launched stablecoin payment support a year ago, has helped many fast-growing global technology and artificial intelligence (AI) companies increase their international revenues. According to the company's data, 19 of the top 20 AI companies using Stripe are based in the US, but generate 60% of their revenue outside the country. However, the slow, costly, and error-prone nature of cross-border payments has led some companies to turn to alternative solutions.

These transactions are completed almost instantly and at twice the cost of traditional methods. With the new feature, Stripe will allow businesses on its platform to: Offering its customers the opportunity to pay for subscriptions with stablecoins, Manage fiat and stablecoin-based payments through a single Stripe Dashboard, Provides full integration with Stripe Billing and Optimized Checkout Suite, It makes it possible to extend the advantages of stablecoins to the entire product range. Stripe developed a custom smart contract for this system that addresses one of the fundamental limitations of blockchain payments. This contract allows users to register their wallet as a payment method and authorize recurring payments without re-authorizing each transaction. The system supports over 400 cryptocurrency wallets. “Stablecoin payments help us lower our cost of revenue from global customers, attract more tech-savvy users, and reach audiences that lack access to traditional payment methods,” said Alex Mashrabov, CEO of Higgsfield, one of the first companies to implement stablecoin subscription payments with Stripe. *This is not investment advice.

The post highlights a 2020 report indicating that Russia’s central bank has been exploring the use of tokenization to let foreign investors buy shares in domestic companies. The same document outlines earlier research by the Bank of Russia into blockchain-based settlements that directly mention Ripple and XRP as potential tools for international transactions. According to Amelie, this development positions XRP as a likely candidate for Russia’s cross-border payment framework. She cited the Central Bank’s document, noting that it referenced experiments involving Ripple technology for cross-border settlements as early as 2018. The report’s technical section describes how Russia’s Novosibirsk laboratory conducted trials using Ripple’s platform to process payments between banks and national systems. BREAKING: Russia’s Central Bank wants to use tokenization solutions to grant foreign buyers access to shares in domestic companies! According to a document from the Central Bank of Russia dated 2020, they are most likely to use #XRP for cross-border payments! … pic.twitter.com/871ai2AmHU — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 13, 2025 Ripple’s Role in Russian Payment Systems The document provides detailed insight into how Ripple’s technology was evaluated for settlement operations. It states that the Ripple platform could serve as the foundation for a system of international transfers once legal and technical conditions were satisfied. The research discussed using XRP as a transfer medium or as a fiat currency equivalent between national banks. It also proposed a framework for reconciling balances between Ripple participants and national systems, using embedded cryptographic solutions on the Ripple network. Importantly, it included the idea of establishing procedures for “determining cross rates for the internal ‘currency’ of Ripple – XRP.” This indicates that the bank considered XRP not just as a tool for liquidity but as a standardized digital asset within an international framework. From Pilot Tests to Tokenization Amelie’s post ties this earlier Ripple research to the Central Bank’s current tokenization initiative. The document she referenced confirms Russia’s goal of allowing foreign investors to buy domestic securities through tokenized systems, signaling a wider shift toward blockchain integration.

The consistent mentions of Ripple throughout this project highlight a sustained interest in XRP’s functionality within regulated payment environments. Potential Benefits for XRP If the Central Bank of Russia moves forward with XRP as part of its cross-border payment and tokenization framework , it could significantly expand the token’s utility. XRP’s efficiency in facilitating instant, low-cost international transactions complements the central bank’s aim to modernize settlements and attract foreign investors. While no final decision has been publicly announced, the references to Ripple in official research documents and Amelie’s observations suggest XRP remains a viable option for Russia’s financial modernization strategy.

He points to XRP’s multi-year chart as a near-textbook example of technical precision, featuring symmetrical consolidations, breakout zones, and enduring support levels that mirror the principles of classical trading theory. Following its explosive 2017 rally and prolonged consolidation, the asset now exhibits a clean, symmetrical structure that hints at a major breakout with XRP’s price presently trading at $2.50. Brandt’s analysis underscores XRP’s exceptional technical integrity, its precise trendlines, disciplined retracements, and balanced formations, making it a textbook example of how long-term market cycles mature. In a market often driven by short-term speculation, Brandt’s recognition of XRP’s long-term chart underscores the lasting value of classical analysis. Beyond daily volatility, XRP appears to be shaping a historic case study in digital asset markets, one defined not by hype, but by technical precision and time-tested charting discipline. XRP Defies Market Turmoil with $61.6M Inflows for 18th Straight Week Despite last week’s widespread crypto market selloffs, institutional investors are doubling down on XRP, signaling growing confidence in the digital asset’s long-term prospects. According to CoinShares’ latest report, XRP recorded $61.6 million in inflows over the past week, marking its 18th consecutive week of positive institutional investment. This sustained streak stands out as one of the most impressive runs among major altcoins, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid volatility that rattled the broader market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced fluctuations in fund flows due to profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty, XRP continued attracting steady capital, a clear indicator of bullish institutional sentiment. Consistent inflows during market corrections often indicate strategic accumulation by institutional investors positioning for future gains, a quiet buildup that frequently precedes major market momentum. Ripple’s deepening collaborations with financial institutions, fintechs, and tokenization projects are strengthening confidence in XRP’s potential to anchor the next wave of blockchain finance. As Ripple pushes forward with its RLUSD stablecoin and global partnerships, the XRP ecosystem is emerging with unprecedented structural and institutional strength. Conclusion Peter Brandt’s recognition of XRP’s long-term chart highlights more than technical elegance; it signals the quiet maturity of an asset refined by years of volatility and scrutiny. If classical patterns mirror market psychology, XRP’s structure tells a story of resilience, steady accumulation, and readiness for its next decisive phase. Whether that leads to a breakout or extended consolidation, one thing stands out: XRP has become a textbook study in disciplined, long-term market behavior, where history, patience, and precision align. On the other hand, XRP’s 18-week streak of institutional inflows highlights a deeper story beneath crypto volatility, one of strategic confidence and long-term conviction.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 06:07:49

In a speech about the central bank’s balance sheet, Powell openly acknowledged the rising “downside risks to unemployment” in a dovish signal that the central bank is preparing to ease monetary policy. “Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,” he said before adding, “We judged it appropriate to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance at our September meeting.” “There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals.” There you have it, QT is over. Back up the fucking truck and buy everything. pic.twitter.com/kQbpBSOlOU — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 14, 2025 End of QT Is Good For BTC Powell indicated the Fed may approach the point of stopping balance sheet runoff in the coming months, suggesting the quantitative tightening phase is nearing its end, clearing the path for more rate cuts. The target rate probability for a 0.25% cut at the Fed’s Oct. 29 meeting is currently 95.7%, according to the CME futures markets. However, the probability of a similar cut in December has risen to 94.8% suggesting that rates are likely to be cut by 0.5% by the end of the year. “While there was little doubt the FOMC was angled to cut rates at its next meeting, today’s remarks were strong confirmation of that expectation,” said JPMorgan’s Chief Economist Michael Feroli. “We have a completely dovish Fed, with 125 bps of rate cuts already priced in, poised to end QT,” said Bitcoin entrepreneur Joe Consorti before adding: “BTC has been effectively rangebound since May. You know what happens next. Don’t overthink it.” In a separate post, he said that now that quantitative tightening is ending and the Fed’s policy rates are coming down to sub-3%, “BTC now has the tailwinds of easing at its back.” QT is when a central bank reduces the size of its balance sheet by allowing bonds and securities it owns to mature without replacing them. It is the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE), where the Fed buys securities to inject money and liquidity into the economy. Bitcoin is up 750% over the last 3 years (wow) as the Fed tightened monetary conditions. Fed Funds: 0.25% → 5.5% → 4.25% Balance Sheet: $9T → $6.5T Now that QT is ending and the Fed’s policy rates are coming down to sub-3%, BTC now has the tailwinds of easing at its back. https://t.co/4u7rKhSuQA pic.twitter.com/NbhLHz6A65 — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) October 14, 2025 No Market Reaction Yet Crypto markets are still jittery and reeling from the industry’s largest liquidation event over the weekend, so the reaction was muted.

On Wednesday, he posted on microblogging site GETTR that he had moved from a center-left stance in 2020 to a more centrist position in 2022, after observing aggressive crypto enforcement under SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the Justice Department. “By 2022—having seen Gensler/Biden’s DOJ on crypto—I was a centrist, and (privately) donated tens of millions to Republicans,” he wrote. gm @GETTRofficial https://t.co/GsY3bFkgKM — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 15, 2025 Bankman-Fried Claims Authorities Targeted Him Before Key Crypto Vote He claimed that weeks later, the SEC and DOJ “went after me,” timing his arrest just before a crypto bill he supported was due for a vote and only a day before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. At the time, House Republicans alleged the timing appeared intended “to prevent Sam Bankman-Fried from testifying,” and demanded that Gensler turn over internal communications. In his post, Bankman-Fried revived those suspicions, saying Gensler “conveniently lost” the relevant messages. SEC Confirms Gensler’s Phone Wipe Erased Nearly A Year Of Texts Last month, the SEC’s Office of Inspector General admitted that Gensler’s government-issued phone underwent an “enterprise wipe” that erased texts between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. The office said the phone stopped syncing to the agency system in July 2023 and was flagged “inactive” for 62 days, despite functioning normally. That deletion period overlapped with other major SEC enforcement steps against crypto firms, alongside FTX’s collapse in Nov. 2022 and Bankman-Fried’s December arrest in the Bahamas. Coinbase has since accused the SEC of deleting nearly a year of Gensler’s messages, calling for sanctions over what it described as “destruction of evidence.” Lawmakers Launch Inquiry Into SEC’s Handling Of Gensler’s Missing Messages House Republicans have also launched an investigation into the deletion of nearly a year’s worth of text messages from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, citing concerns about transparency, IT mismanagement, and compliance with federal record-keeping laws. Bankman-Fried remains imprisoned at FCI Terminal Island following his conviction in one of the largest financial fraud cases in history. Prosecutors said he diverted billions in customer funds to his hedge fund, Alameda Research, using them for risky trades, real estate, and political donations. Once hailed as a crypto prodigy and a major political donor, Bankman-Fried now faces years behind bars while continuing to insist his downfall was driven as much by politics as by mismanagement.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japan-prepares-to-ban-insider-trading-in-cryptocurrency-markets-here-are-the-details/,"Japan has begun preparing comprehensive regulations aimed at banning insider trading in cryptocurrency markets. Japan Prepares for Insider Trading Ban in Crypto Markets According to reports, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is planning to introduce regulations explicitly prohibiting cryptocurrency trading based on non-public information. The new law would impose fines proportional to the amount of illicit profits made by those violating the ban. The Securities and Exchange Supervision Commission (SESC) will also have the authority to investigate suspicious transactions and recommend fines or criminal penalties. The FSA reportedly aims to finalize the regulatory details by the end of the year and submit the proposed legislation to next year's regular parliamentary session. Currently, Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act does not contain provisions for insider trading for crypto assets, leaving oversight largely to the self-regulation of crypto exchanges and industry associations. However, regulators emphasize that defining insider trading in crypto assets is more complex than traditional securities. Many tokens don't have a specific issuer, making it difficult to define “insider.” Japan has recently begun tightening its cryptocurrency market. Last week, Binance Japan announced a capital and business partnership with payments giant PayPay Corporation, and it was announced that PayPay had acquired a 40% stake in the local stock exchange. This new step is considered part of Japan's effort to bring crypto markets closer to traditional financial standards. *This is not investment advice.

53166742,https://nulltx.com/?p=152361,1760511380,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Metaplanet’s Market Value Falls Below Its Bitcoin Holdings for the First Time,https://nulltx.com/metaplanets-market-value-falls-below-its-bitcoin-holdings-for-the-first-time/,"Metaplanet , often called “Japan’s MicroStrategy”, just hit a new and unwanted milestone. For the first time ever, the company’s market-to-Bitcoin net asset value (mNAV) has dropped below 1, meaning the market now values Metaplanet less than the worth of its Bitcoin holdings. According to Bloomberg, Metaplanet’s mNAV currently sits around 0.99x, signaling that investors are discounting the firm’s balance sheet, a reversal from months of premium trading. What Is mNAV and Why It Matters Market-to-Bitcoin NAV, or mNAV, measures how a Bitcoin-holding company trades relative to the value of its BTC reserves. It’s calculated by dividing the firm’s market capitalization by the value of its Bitcoin stack. mNAV > 1: The market values the company above its BTC holdings, a sign of growth confidence or trust in management. mNAV For Metaplanet, that ratio falling below 1 marks a key sentiment shift. The market is effectively saying: “Your Bitcoin is worth more than your stock.” Japan’s “MicroStrategy of Asia” Metaplanet earned its nickname, “Japan’s MicroStrategy”, after aggressively accumulating Bitcoin on its balance sheet throughout 2024 and 2025. Like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy in the U.S., Metaplanet positioned itself as a corporate vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, attracting investors looking for BTC-linked equity plays in Asia. As of Q4 2025, the firm’s holdings stand at several thousand BTC, making it one of the largest public Bitcoin holders globally. But that strategy cuts both ways. When Bitcoin rises, Metaplanet’s valuation soars. When Bitcoin drops, as it did recently, the company’s market cap collapses even faster. Bitcoin’s Fall Below $110K Slashes Treasury Value The latest shock came as Bitcoin slipped below $110,000, erasing billions in market value and trimming corporate treasuries across the board. Metaplanet’s BTC reserves lost a significant portion of their paper value within days. That decline, combined with investor profit-taking after a strong summer rally, sent Metaplanet’s share price tumbling more than 70% from its yearly highs. The company, once trading at a heavy premium to its BTC stash, is now sitting at a historic discount, a reversal that few analysts expected this early in the bull cycle. Investor confidence appears to be fading. Traders on Tokyo’s stock exchange have begun pricing in the risks of holding a company that mirrors Bitcoin’s volatility but carries added equity risk, such as dilution or capital management uncertainty. When mNAV dips below 1, it often signals deeper investor caution. It implies that shareholders see more downside in the company’s structure, governance, or execution than upside from its Bitcoin exposure. The move could make raising capital significantly harder for Metaplanet. Investors may hesitate to fund a company whose equity trades at a discount to its underlying assets. And that’s not just sentiment, it’s math. Issuing new shares while mNAV CEO Promised Buybacks, Will He Deliver? Earlier this year, Metaplanet’s CEO publicly stated that if the company’s mNAV ever dropped below 1, management would consider share buybacks to restore confidence and correct undervaluation. That moment has now arrived. Whether the firm can act on that promise remains to be seen. Buybacks would require liquid capital or the sale of BTC, both sensitive moves in a volatile market. Still, such an intervention could help close the discount gap if executed decisively. Investors are watching closely to see whether management follows through. If not, the discount could widen further as trust erodes. Metaplanet’s decline comes amid a broader cooling in crypto equities. MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), and other publicly listed crypto firms have all seen steep pullbacks since Bitcoin’s last local high. According to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC is down over 3% in the past 30 days, pressuring corporate treasuries and sentiment alike. However, few firms have seen such a clear-cut divergence between asset value and market price as Metaplanet, where the discount is now a measurable, structural signal of waning confidence. Bloomberg analysts suggest that Japanese investors, typically more conservative, may be less tolerant of Bitcoin’s drawdowns than U.S. or European peers. A Test of Faith for Bitcoin Corporates For Bitcoin-holding companies, mNAV It challenges the belief that “stacking BTC” automatically drives shareholder value. Instead, it exposes whether a company’s management, strategy, and balance sheet discipline can justify a premium beyond the coins they hold. Metaplanet’s situation echoes MicroStrategy’s past, when MSTR also traded at a discount during deep Bitcoin drawdowns, before recovering strongly as market confidence returned. If the crypto market stabilizes or rebounds, the same could happen here. A discount can quickly flip back to a premium once sentiment turns. The Road Ahead For now, Metaplanet’s leadership faces a tough balancing act. They must reassure investors, defend their BTC strategy, and potentially act on the buyback promise, all while navigating a volatile Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, traders are weighing whether this discount represents an opportunity or a warning sign. If Bitcoin stabilizes above $110K and sentiment improves, Metaplanet could quickly reclaim its premium. But if BTC slips further, mNAV could drift even lower, tightening liquidity and shaking investor faith. Metaplanet’s mNAV drop below 1 marks a symbolic moment for Asia’s Bitcoin corporate movement. For the first time, Japan’s biggest BTC proxy trades at a discount to its own stack, a clear signal that markets demand more than just “number go up.” It’s now a question of confidence, not just coins. And in the high-stakes world of Bitcoin treasuries, confidence is the most volatile asset of all. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yet even as traders were liquidated and markets swung violently, protocol activity surged. Lending fees topped $20 million in one day, DEX volumes hit $177 billion for the week, and stETH yields spiked past 7%, underscoring a liquidity storm that tested every corner of decentralized finance. $12 Billion in Leverage Wiped from Perp DEXs The sharp drop in open interest across perpetual exchanges marked one of the most significant onchain deleveraging events of 2025. According to DeFiLlama, Perp DEX open interest fell from $26 billion to below $14 billion, reflecting mass unwinding across leading derivatives platforms including dYdX, GMX, Hyperliquid , and Aevo. Market analysts linked the crash to cascading liquidations triggered by sudden sell pressure in BTC and ETH markets, combined with thin weekend liquidity. In total, over $12 billion in open interest vanished, one of the largest onchain deleverages since 2022. The scale mirrored centralized market liquidations earlier in the week, where Coinglass data recorded more than $19 billion in positions cleared in 24 hours, underscoring how deeply correlated CEX and DEX markets have become. Lending Protocol Fees Hit All-Time Highs While leveraged traders faced record liquidations, lending protocols enjoyed their most profitable day ever. DeFiLlama data shows lending platforms generated over $20 million in fees on Friday, marking a new all-time high for the sector. Protocols like Aave, Compound, and Morpho saw borrowing costs spike as traders rushed to cover margin calls or reposition into stablecoins during the volatility. The sudden demand for liquidity pushed utilization rates higher across lending pools, particularly for USDC, USDT, and ETH, creating a fee bonanza for lenders and protocol treasuries alike. The surge in lending activity highlighted a key dynamic in DeFi: even in extreme downturns, protocol revenue can soar when volatility drives borrowing and liquidations. Weekly DEX Volume Hits $177 Billion, A New Record Despite the turmoil, trading activity across decentralized exchanges hit unprecedented levels. DeFiLlama reported that weekly DEX volume surpassed $177 billion, setting a new record for decentralized trading. That figure represents nearly a 30% increase over the previous week’s total, signaling how traders flocked to onchain venues during the selloff. Uniswap, Curve, and Jupiter led the surge, while perpetual DEXs like Hyperliquid and dYdX contributed heavily to derivative flows. The record-breaking week further solidifies DEXs as a liquidity backbone for DeFi, even under market stress. On-chain observers noted that while spot DEX trading saw a spike in slippage and gas fees, execution remained stable, with no major outages, a sharp contrast to the system-wide halts often seen in centralized venues during similar events. Total Borrowed Falls Below $50 Billion Amid the volatility, overall borrowing across lending protocols dropped sharply. Total borrowed funds across DeFi lending platforms fell below $50 billion, marking the first time since August that total onchain debt slipped under that threshold. The retreat reflected a broad deleveraging as users repaid loans, unwound yield strategies, or moved collateral into stable positions. For major lenders like Aave and Compound, outstanding debt positions fell by more than 10% day-over-day, signaling that traders were actively reducing exposure in the wake of extreme volatility. Still, the rapid repayment of loans contributed to network congestion and heightened gas fees, especially on Ethereum, where liquidation bots competed to close risky positions. stETH APY Spikes Above 7% One of the more surprising side effects of the crash came from Ethereum staking yields. According to DeFiLlama, stETH APY briefly spiked over 7%, its highest level in months, as validator rewards surged due to heavy transaction volume and elevated priority fees. The APY jump drew renewed attention to liquid staking tokens, which remain a core yield source across DeFi. For context, Lido’s stETH, the largest liquid staking derivative, typically offers around 3.5–4.5% APY. The spike to 7% reflected extreme network demand as traders arbitraged positions, repaid debt, and bridged assets between chains. Analysts expect yields to normalize in the coming days, but the brief surge underscored how DeFi rewards can fluctuate sharply during volatile market conditions. DeFi Volatility, Onchain Strength Despite the flash crash’s chaos, DeFi infrastructure showed resilience. Perp DEXs, lending markets, and staking protocols all absorbed record transaction loads without major outages or oracle failures, an improvement from the system weaknesses exposed in earlier drawdowns. While total value locked (TVL) dipped temporarily, network activity metrics such as fees, volume, and user counts remained elevated. Market watchers say this may mark a turning point for DeFi maturity: higher volatility now drives more protocol revenue, not less. DeFiLlama’s aggregated data supports this trend, the same crash that erased $12 billion in leverage also created all-time highs for fees and trading activity. That dynamic underscores a growing separation between price pain and protocol health, while token prices drop, the underlying infrastructure profits from volatility. The Oct. 11 flash crash reminded traders that crypto’s decentralized layer is both fragile and antifragile. Open interest can halve in hours, yet DeFi protocols thrive under pressure. With Perp DEX leverage cut in half, fees at record highs, and stETH yields surging past 7%, the ecosystem continues to prove its adaptive strength. If anything, DeFiLlama’s data confirms one thing: decentralized markets are now too large, too liquid, and too resilient to ignore, even when the market burns.

According to government and blockchain sources, the move aims to anchor identity attestations on a public chain while keeping private personal data off the ledger. What The Shift Involves Based on reports , the National Digital Identity (NDI) platform will serve roughly 800,000 people and the full migration of credentials is expected to be completed by Q1 2026. Officials say the change follows earlier platform updates and is meant to strengthen how identity claims are verified across services. The government previously moved its self-sovereign identity system from Hyperledger Indy to Polygon in 2024, a step taken to improve scalability and performance before the latest integration with Ethereum. That earlier migration is part of the technical background now guiding the current switch. 1/ Today, Bhutan celebrates a historic milestone, becoming the first nation to anchor its national digital identity system on Ethereum. @VitalikButerin and I were honored to join the launch ceremony on behalf of the Ethereum community, graced by His Royal Highness. pic.twitter.com/KA4tOYbsJ4 — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) October 13, 2025 Ceremony And Leaders Reports have disclosed that the launch event drew high-profile figures from the Ethereum community and Bhutan’s leadership. Ethereum co-founders and foundation representatives were present at the announcement, and local officials described the day as a landmark in the country’s plans for digital services. Technically, the government and its tech partners say the system will avoid placing private identity data directly on chain. Instead, cryptographic proofs or hashes will be used to confirm identity claims while personal records remain stored off chain under government control. That approach is intended to balance verification with privacy protections, according to public statements from project leads. What This Means For Citizens For many users, the change should be invisible day to day. Verifiers — banks, agencies, and service providers — will be able to check credentials against the public proof without receiving raw personal data. This is how officials describe the model in plain terms: keys and proofs on a public ledger, private data kept elsewhere under rules and legal guardrails. Still, practical questions remain. How will the government handle costs tied to public chain transactions? Which apps or wallets will citizens use? How will the system work in remote areas with limited internet? Those are the sorts of operational issues that the NDI team has said it will address as migration continues toward the Q1 2026 target. Global Context And Caution Experts say Bhutan’s move is notable because national identity systems are usually run on closed networks or permissioned ledgers. Anchoring proofs on a widely used public chain like Ethereum is uncommon at scale. Observers praise the transparency potential, but they also warn about long-term costs, governance, and the need for clear legal protections for citizens’ data.

Bitcoin At The Risk Of Losing Momentum? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Bitcoin’s Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) has been trending lower, confirming that inter-exchange activity is slowly fading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Dominate On Binance As CVD Confirmation Nears 0.9, Signaling $130K Target Zone For the uninitiated, the IFP measures liquidity as it moves between crypto exchanges. In essence, it can be considered a proxy to determine how active arbitrage and market-making really are. To explain, arbitrage refers to the practice of buying an asset for a lower price on one platform and selling it at a higher price on another, thus benefiting from the price differential. In simple terms, arbitrage refers to profiting from inefficiencies. When such inefficiencies exist in the market and are actually executable, liquidity tends to start moving fast. At the same time, trading bots begin shuttling funds across platforms, market spreads begin to realign again, and the market starts to feel “alive.” This is when the IFP rises. Although there is greater market volatility due to a rising IFP, it is generally considered healthy for the market as it confirms that BTC is likely experiencing a bullish momentum. However, since the IFP reading has turned lower in recent weeks, traders are finding it harder to arbitrage price discrepancies even though they might still be appearing. TeddyVision noted: Price discrepancies still appear, but they’re harder to arbitrage – liquidity is thinner, latency is higher, and risk-adjusted opportunities are drying up. Traders find fewer setups worth taking, and less capital circulates between venues. The analyst emphasized that liquidity is not leaving the market, it is just not circulating like earlier. While such a slowdown in liquidity does not crash the market, it does drain the energy out of it. To conclude, the market is not collapsing, it is just “too efficient” at the moment for traders to find any meaningful arbitrage opportunities that they can benefit from. When inefficiencies leave the market, the underlying asset is likely at risk of losing its momentum. A Healthy Correction For BTC? The market crash on October 9 led to the largest single-day liquidation ever in the history of the crypto industry, totalling a mammoth $19 billion. While the overall optimism has receded, some analysts are still hopeful of a quick sentiment turnaround.

Prominent crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has released an updated chart highlighting $2.65 as a critical level for the asset. According to his analysis, this price point, which previously acted as strong support before XRP’s crash , has now become a resistance zone that the asset must overcome to regain its upward momentum. The chart he shared outlines the current positioning of XRP against key exponential moving averages (EMAs), including the 9, 21, 50, 100, and 200 EMAs. The asset is presently trading below $2.65 but remains above the 200 EMA, signaling a possible stabilization phase. The asset’s decline pushed it below $2 for the first time since June , but the quick rebound marked on the chart suggests a repeated pattern where XRP finds support before attempting another push higher. #XRP Update: $2.65 – Again A Key Level But This Time Resistant : What was once strong support has now turned into a formidable resistance level. $2.65 is playing a major role again! If we can flip it into support on the 3-day timeframe with a full body candle, we’ll be in a… https://t.co/7HONwm4EMZ pic.twitter.com/Pc8ji5igOw — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 13, 2025 The $2.65 Level and Its Technical Significance EGRAG CRYPTO described $2.65 as a key level playing a major role, noting that “what was once strong support has now turned into a formidable resistance level.” The chart shows that each time XRP experienced a similar dip, a recovery followed. However, this time, the key difference lies in whether the price can close above $2.65 with confirmation on higher timeframes. He added that flipping this level into support on the three-day timeframe “with a full body candle” would be a positive signal for XRP’s next phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Targets and Future Outlook Such a move would indicate market strength and potentially validate a new support base. The analyst recently pointed out the importance of the $2.65 level , and according to his updated analysis, breaching this level would set the next technical target at $2.85, aligning with the 21 EMA, as shown in his chart. The chart also identifies subsequent targets beyond $2.65 and $2.85. If bullish conditions persist, EGRAG outlines $3.13 and $3.44 as potential levels to monitor. These upper boundaries remain within the projected trend channel, placing XRP just below its all-time high , and offering potential benchmarks for traders tracking medium-term growth. Despite the market’s recent turbulence, XRP continues to maintain support around the $2.30 region, which corresponds closely with the 100 EMA. If XRP manages to close decisively above $2.65, it could mark the beginning of another rally. Until then, $2.65 remains the central test defining whether momentum will shift back in favor of the bulls. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Roger Ver settled with the US DOJ, admitting he hid Bitcoin holdings when renouncing US citizenship in 2014. He paid nearly $50 million in back taxes and penalties, leading the government to drop its indictment. Ver’s case ties into Trump-linked lobbying efforts as speculation about a potential pardon. According to the DOJ , Ver, the early Bitcoin advocate famously known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, agreeing to pay nearly $50 million in back taxes, penalties, and interest to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). US Drops Indictment After Roger Ver Pays $50M in Tax Settlement Prosecutors said his omission caused a $16.9 million loss to the US government. In exchange for the payment, the government has moved to dismiss the indictment against him. “Mr. Ver is accepting responsibility for his actions and has agreed to pay a substantial penalty,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli in a statement on Tuesday. Ver, who became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, was arrested in Spain last year and extradited to the United States. His case was led by the IRS Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit, which investigates tax evasion involving digital assets. The settlement confirms reports that Ver and the DOJ had been finalizing a resolution to the $48 million tax-evasion case. Meanwhile, speculative trading on Polymarket briefly pushed odds of a Trump pardon for Ver to 50% before falling back to around 13% following the DOJ’s announcement. Roger Ver is facing life in prison for revealing how the US government worked secretly to subvert cryptocurrency and prevent economic freedom. More people should hear this story.

Earlier this year, he paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone to lobby against the tax provisions central to his case. Lobbying records also show that Ver hired attorneys Christopher Kise and Brian Ballard, both of whom have long-standing ties to Trump’s political network. The Justice Department accused Ver of hiding the true value of his Bitcoin holdings. The filings were connected to his decision to renounce US citizenship. At that time, Americans were required to pay an “exit tax” on all global assets, including cryptocurrency. Prosecutors argued that by concealing his holdings, Ver deprived the US of millions in taxes. White House Weighs Pardon for Binance Founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao The White House has reportedly intensified discussions over a potential presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to an October 12 New York Post report. Sources cited by Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino claim that President Donald Trump is “leaning toward a pardon,” despite concerns among advisors about how it could appear given his financial ties to the crypto industry. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain adequate anti-money laundering controls at Binance, leading to his resignation as CEO. The talks come nearly a year after Zhao publicly hinted he “wouldn’t mind a pardon” following President Joe Biden’s controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, in 2024. The potential pardon has already sparked backlash from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sent a letter to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, warning that Zhao’s request raises “urgent concerns about the integrity of the justice system.” The post ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver Settles $50M Tax Case With US DOJ Over Undeclared Holdings appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|DOJ|Regulation|Roger Ver,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-15 07:04:11

In 2028, it will range between $4.55 and $5.20, with an average price of $4.87. In 2031, it will range between $7.80 and $8.45, with an average price of $8.12. SNX is the native token for the Synthetix Network and is used for governance. It is listed on top exchanges like Binance, Uniswap, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. Synthetic is a decentralized protocol that allows you to create and transact synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Is SNX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Let’s get into the SNX price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Synthetix Abbreviation SNX Current Price $2.01 (-5.6%) Market Cap $688.93M Trading Volume (24-hour) $437.63M Circulating Supply 343.46M SNX All-time High $28.77 (Feb 14, 2021) All-time Low $0.03258 (Jan 5, 2019) 24-hour High $2.23 24-hour Low $1.83 SNX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Variation) 31.24% 50-day SMA $ 0.872684 200-day SMA $ 0.762918 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 38 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) Synthetix price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Synthetix coin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as the price decreased to $2.01. Cryptocurrency loses 5.6% of its value. SNX coin may find support around $1.85. As of October 15, 2025, Synthetix price analysis reveals a bearish trend. The altcoin’s price decreased to $2.01 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 5.6% of its value as it corrects following the sharp spike to $2.57. However, buyer support was observed a few hours ago, when a slight price increase was noted, but at the time of writing, the altcoin is falling again. SNX/USD 1-day chart: SNX faces strong accumulation The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend as it continues its bearish slide as investors divest. The cryptocurrency price has decreased to $2.01 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility for the coming days. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the broken resistance, has shifted to $2.05. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.559. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve has entered the neutral area, currently at 69.36. This situation suggests that sellers have control of the SNX price, and further instability in the market can be expected if the bears sustain their momentum. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin also signals selling pressure on the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price decreased to $2.01 in the past few hours. The high volatility levels suggest an increased probability of an upcoming reversal or more price oscillation. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.70, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.961, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value decreased to 61 over the past four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an imbalanced trading environment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours and are still trying to maintain their lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively unbalanced trading setup for intraday traders.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin price has decreased to $2.01 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $1.85 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.36 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $2.01, losing 5.6% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.95 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.45, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.45 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX is trading above $1, as the current sentiment is bullish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 07:12:39
53168353,https://invezz.com/?p=2925400,1760512455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,The next big crypto to explode in 2025 according to analysts,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/15/the-next-big-crypto-to-explode-in-2025-according-to-analysts/,"Analysts and DeFi veterans are calling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the next crypto to explode in 2025. Their optimism comes from one clear reason — Mutuum’s design connects real revenue, sustainable yield, and token buybacks into one economic engine. As crypto coins regain momentum and investors ask why is crypto going up again, Mutuum stands out as a project preparing for a breakout year driven by real product expansion and growing liquidity. A final sub-$0.04 opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the middle of its presale and continues to attract strong attention from both retail and institutional investors. The project has already raised around $17.35 million and gathered more than 17,100 holders. Its total token supply is capped at 4 billion MUTM. Phase 6 is now live, with 68% of its 170 million tokens already sold at a price of $0.035. Once this round ends, Phase 7 will begin at $0.040 — a 15% jump that marks the final sub-$0.04 window before broader market exposure. Market analysts describe this phase as the ideal entry point before Mutuum’s upcoming beta release and potential exchange listings create higher visibility. The price difference between $0.035 and $1 reflects not just speculation but the economic logic of a platform that earns, buys back, and redistributes for its own token value. Dual lending model creating a powerful economic flywheel Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on two integrated lending systems designed to cover both institutional and retail markets. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will target stablecoin lenders and institutions seeking steady returns. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will attract risk-seeking users and meme-coin holders looking for higher yield opportunities. Together, these two engines will generate two continuous streams of revenue that fuel the protocol’s buyback and reward mechanism. The same logic applies to borrowers. Those posting collateral, such as ETH, will gain liquidity while keeping their assets’ market exposure. Borrowers will pay interest, generating revenue for the platform. That income, combined with platform fees, will later fund open-market MUTM buybacks. The cycle repeats: lending creates revenue, revenue funds buybacks, and buybacks reward stakers — a self-sustaining loop that increases both utility and value over time. Testnet launch fueling 2025 growth The Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s team has recently announced the launch of V1 of the protocol on its Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, including ETH and USDT, mtToken accounting, and an automated liquidator bot. This early testnet will build community trust through real-time testing and transparent results before the full mainnet rollout. Projects with successful testnets often achieve a 5× to 10× increase in total value locked within months, and analysts expect Mutuum’s audited beta to generate a similar response. An investor who entered during Phase 5 at $0.030 with $20,000 received 667K tokens. At the current $0.035 price, that holding is worth $23K. When the price reaches $0.50, that same position will be valued at $333K — more than 16X the initial investment. This growth is based on platform economics, not speculative trading, making it one of the few crypto coins built for sustained appreciation. Mutuum’s dashboard will display live return tracking, and its Top-50 leaderboard is already introducing a gamified environment that encourages huge investors. Each day, the highest-ranked user will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC daily. This combination of visibility and rewards will strengthen community loyalty and keep circulating supply low — a key factor behind price stability. The year of Mutuum As more investors return to the market wondering why is crypto going up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as a standout answer. It connects real yield, strong tokenomics, and an active community into one expanding ecosystem. With Phase 6 already 68% sold and the next round priced higher, this is the most attractive window before mainnet buzz begins. 2025 will be the year when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters its public phase, proving that sustainable yield, audited systems, and community-driven economics can turn a presale token into a top-performing crypto.

He said that the company has started focusing on “moving away from traditional financial assets by ‘re-potting’ them in a digital manner.” This way, investors could stay within the digital ecosystem, he added. Next Wave of Opportunity Fink envisions bringing some of the $4 trillion crypto market investment into traditional assets such as exchange-traded funds by tokenizing them and making them easier to access. “There’s $4.1 trillion of money sitting globally in digital wallets,” he said before adding that a lot of that money is outside the United States.” “If we could tokenize an ETF, you know, digitize that ETF, we could have investors who are just beginning to invest in markets through, let’s say, crypto. They’re investing in it, but now we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products.” He added that this was the “next wave of opportunity” for BlackRock over the next ten years.

It has the largest tokenized cash money market fund called BUIDL, which has $2.8 billion in assets under management. It also has the world’s largest and fastest-growing Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which has now surpassed $100 billion in AUM. “It’s not about if the market’s going up or down, or if there’s a bubble in crypto or if there’s a bubble in technology … It’s about being in the market throughout the cycle,” he told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. RWA Sector Outlook The real-world asset tokenization sector is at an all-time high of $33.8 billion in on-chain value, according to RWA.xyz. That figure has grown 115% since the beginning of this year, and around half of it is tokenized private credit. Despite all of the FUD, Ethereum remains the industry leader and standard for asset tokenization. It has a market share of 57%, which climbs to 78% if Ethereum Virtual Machine and layer-2 networks such as ZKsync, Polygon, and Arbitrum are included. Many believe that BlackRock will continue to use Ethereum to bring its assets on-chain rather than reinventing the wheel.

The asset stood at around $112,100 at press time, down slightly over the past 24 hours and down 8% over the past week. Though short-term performance is weak, some technical and on-chain indicators are pointing to possible strength building in the background. Log Curve and RSI Near Crucial Levels Bitcoin’s price is approaching the top of its long-term logarithmic curve, a level that has acted as a ceiling in previous cycles. According to EtherNasyonaL, BTC “ hasn’t even broken above the logarithmic curve resistance yet ,” and the market tends to gain speed when this resistance is crossed.

Moreover, the RSI isn’t even in the… pic.twitter.com/JjH99Fot2M — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 14, 2025 Meanwhile, the monthly RSI is also near 72 but remains under its long-term trendline. Back in 2017, the RSI broke this same trendline shortly before the price moved sharply higher. The current setup shows the price and RSI are close to similar conditions again, though no breakout has been confirmed so far. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, Trader Tardigrade noted that Bitcoin is forming a double bottom pattern. The second low is higher than the first, which often signals that sellers are losing strength and buyers may be returning. The resistance line, or neckline, of this pattern is around $116,000. A move above this level would confirm the setup. Until that happens, the pattern remains unconfirmed. This type of structure has previously led to upward moves, but only once the neckline is cleared with volume. Source: Trader Tardigrade/X Pricing Bands Mark $119K as Key Level The MVRV pricing model from Glassnode places the current Bitcoin price just below the +0.5 standard deviation band, which is at around $119,000. Analyst Ali Martinez said, Bitcoin $BTC must reclaim $119,000 to keep bullish momentum alive! Otherwise, the Pricing Bands signal a correction toward $96,530. pic.twitter.com/I7IGhKcXjX — Ali (@ali_charts) October 15, 2025 If not, a move down toward the model’s mean at $96,526 is possible. These pricing bands are used to map past tops and bottoms. Bitcoin is now in the middle range, with no clear direction until it breaks above or falls below one of these thresholds. On-Chain Data Shows Shift in Market Behavior Data from XWIN Research Japan suggests Bitcoin is now in a later stage of the cycle. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) sits at +0.52. In past years, this level marked a shift from growing optimism to more speculative behavior. Around 97% of the supply is now in profit. Short-term holders now represent 44% of Bitcoin’s realized capitalization. This is the highest level recorded. It shows that many long-term holders are selling into strength while newer buyers step in. According to XWIN, “ This time the structure appears different ,” pointing to ETF inflows and broader liquidity as stabilizing forces. As long as the price stays below resistance, the breakout is still unconfirmed. A move above $119,000, along with a break in RSI, could signal that the trend is continuing.

During September, U.S. ETFs gathered $152.50 billion in net inflows, the second-highest monthly total on record, bringing year-to-date inflows to $951.27 billion—already surpassing last year’s full-year record of $740.78 billion. Assets have now posted 41 consecutive months of net inflows, ETFGI said, highlighting sustained investor demand even amid higher rates and market volatility. The continued growth and demand shows the dominance of ETFs as the preferred vehicle for both institutional and retail investors. Volatility, Commodities and Crypto Lead September Inflows The top 10 U.S. exchange-traded products (ETPs) by net new assets collectively added $803 million during September. The largest single inflow came from the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX US), which pulled in $272.99 million, reflecting renewed hedging demand as equity volatility resurfaced. Close behind were crypto-related funds, which continued to rank among the month’s biggest asset gatherers. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC US) recorded $140.66 million in September inflows, while its sister product, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH US), attracted $78.54 million. Together, the two vehicles brought in nearly $220 million, showing investor interest in digital-asset exposure through regulated instruments. The VanEck Merk Gold ETF (OUNZ US) added $101.66 million, reinforcing gold’s continued role as a hedge alongside crypto. Meanwhile, commodity-linked funds such as the United States Copper Index Fund (CPER US) and ProShares Ultra DJ-UBS Natural Gas (BOIL US) benefited from cyclical demand for raw-material exposure. Crypto ETFs Cement Their Place in Mainstream Portfolios ETFGI’s data highlight how digital-asset ETFs have matured from speculative novelty to permanent fixture. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF now oversees $5.46 billion, while the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETFmanages $3.00 billion. Their steady inflows contrast with outflows seen across leveraged and inverse products, suggesting investors are treating Bitcoin and Ethereum as longer-term growth plays rather than short-term trades. With more than $1.38 trillion in net inflows over the past 12 months, ETFGI said the industry remains on pace to finish 2025 at another all-time high. Rising adoption of spot crypto products and tokenization-themed ETFs could provide an additional tailwind in the fourth quarter. Volatility Shares Files 27 Leveraged ETFs Targeting Crypto New ETF launches in the U.S. continue to accelerate, with issuers introducing products across equities, commodities, and digital assets to meet growing investor demand. Recently Volatility Shares filed for 27 new leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming to deliver 3x and 5x exposure to a mix of leading technology and digital asset-related equities. The proposed lineup includes single-stock and crypto-linked ETFs tied to firms such as Nvidia, Tesla, MicroStrategy, Palantir, and Coinbase, as well as digital assets like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and XRP. The products, which would expand Volatility Shares’ footprint in the leveraged ETF segment, are slated for an effective date of December 29, 2025, with tickers and fees yet to be disclosed.

That explosive growth made early investors major profits and sealed the fate of Solana as one of the most promising projects of the decade. Traders are now perceiving similar potential in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project currently sits at $0.035 and is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with over 65% sold out. Mutuum Finance has had over $17.35 million raised in presale and is a next-gen DeFi token with a compelling roadmap, innovative technologies, and the type of early momentum that could see it achieve breakout success to give it the moniker “Solana 2.0” among investors looking to the future. Solana’s 2021 Meteoric Rise Becomes the New Benchmark of the Next Crypto Giant In 2021, Solana (SOL) shocked the crypto market with one of the greatest rallies in market history. Beginning the year at approximately $1.50, SOL soared to a new all-time high above $258 within months based on the strength of its lightning-fast transactions, fees as low as possible, and growing ecosystem of decentralized apps and NFTs. This explosive growth made early investors major winners and made Solana’s name synonymous with innovation and scalability within the world of blockchain technology. As traders now look to the future to 2025, most are still looking to find the next project with the potential to produce the same kind of trajectory, and growing interest is turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), that is beginning to generate the same kind of early eagerness that once existed towards Solana. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Goes Mainstream Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making the headlines among investors this week with a big jump in Phase 6 of the presale. The tokens are now offered at $0.035, a 16.17% jump from the previous one. More than 17,040 investors already made the purchase thus making a sum of over $17.35 million, healthfully indicating a growing market belief in the bright future of Mutuum Finance in the DeFi market. More than 65% already sold in Phase 6 alone, early investors making their buy-ins ahead of the next hike. Even collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. In the case of stable, proper prices as well as risk valuation, oracles used are the Chainlink oracles for AVAX, MATIC, ETH, as well as USD feeds. Fallback oracles, sophisticated data feeds, as well as distributed exchange TWAPS prevent valuation based on a protocol’s record-record volatility or illiquidity remaining incorrect. Mutuum lending and borrowing protocol will be released at any time this quarter. Version 1(V1) of the same will be released on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4, 2025, and will consist of principal constituents as follows: liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be offered at the initiation for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will provide the users with the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. Floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools are also offered by the platform and regulate the supply against the demand for the liquids along with stabilizing the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance Might be the Following “Solana Moment” in 2025 Solana’s 2021 surge, a jump from $1.50 to over $250, is one of crypto’s most storied success stories based on trailblazing scalability, lightning-fast transactions, and a flourishing DeFi ecosystem. The same kind of early-stage momentum and disruption is current around Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now at $0.035 during Phase 6 of the presale, with raised funds over $17.35 million and 17,000+ investors on board, MUTM is exhibiting the same kind of momentum that once surrounded the growth of Solana. Potential investors looking for the “next Solana-style” performer should seriously consider joining the Mutuum Finance presale today and get ahead of the pack before the next momentum surge in the DeFi market.

The exchange discredited CJ’s allegations as false and defamatory and threatened to pursue legal action against the executive for his unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications with Binance officials. Binance acknowledged that it was aware of CJ’s claims and clarified that it does not charge any fees for token listings. It also emphasized that allegations of token dumping by the company and its founders are untrue and unsubstantiated. The exchange stated that it was surprised by CJ’s revelation of sensitive information, which compromised the integrity of what the crypto community considers confidential. The exchange explained that cash or token security deposits are refundable in one to two years. It also asserted that the token allocations are for its users and security deposits are for their protection. The exchange claimed that CJ’s allegations are designed to mislead the community and attack the integrity of its listing process. CJ shares listing offer from Binance offer from @binance : > 1% airdrop on day 1, alpha listing > 3% further airdrops in 6 months > 1% for ""marketing"" at Binance full discretion > provide 100% of TVL for token pool on Pancake Swap ($1M+) > $250k security deposit > 3% reserved for BNB HODLer programme > $200k… — CJ (@cjhtech) October 14, 2025 The Limitless Labs boss claimed that Binance requires alpha listings to set aside 1% of their token supply for an airdrop on the first day. An additional 3% is expected to be airdropped in the first six months, and 1% is for marketing at Binance’s discretion. CJ also disclosed that the exchange requires project owners to provide 100% of the $1M+ TVL for the token pool on Pancake Swap. He revealed that Binance requested a $250,000 security deposit and $2 million worth of BNB tokens as collateral for a spot listing. The CEO further stated that Binance required him to reserve 3% of his tokens for the BNB HODLer program. He also claimed that the exchange wanted $200,000 worth of tokens at the MFN price for its affiliate marketers. Ultimately, CJ was required to distribute 8% of his project’s token supply to Binance users through airdrops and other activities. In support of CJ’s allegations, 6MV founder Mike Dudas confirmed that he had seen Binance’s listing proposals in the past month, which looked exactly like CJ’s. Dudas said he was not required to sign an NDA, so he could not be sued for publicly discussing the details. He claimed that Binance has been running the same playbook for years. Peng criticizes CJ for being immature Crypto Analyst and former Head of Collectibles at TVM Ventures, Howard Peng, clapped at CJ, calling him immature for his unwarranted rant. He said the Limitless boss has no principles and wondered why he casually spoke about Binance’s terms as if it were not a big deal. Peng asked CJ to refuse the deal and move on if he did not like the offer. He then suggested that the disgruntled boss try his luck getting listed on Kraken or Coinbase and see how that works for him. Responding to CJ’s claim that Base was better, the analyst emphasized that Base-related projects are launched in a disorganized way.

Here Are Expert Opinions!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/experienced-investor-peter-brandt-predicts-one-last-drop-before-bitcoin-rises-here-are-expert-opinions/,"Following the recent market fluctuations, crypto analysts predict that the current volatility is temporary and that Bitcoin will enter an uptrend again in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Could Experience One Last Drop Before New High: Peter Brandt Experienced investor Peter Brandt said that Bitcoin could retest the $125,100 all-time high (ATH) in the short term, but a significant correction wave could occur in the process. “Either there will be a major shakeout followed by a new ATH within a week, or a breakdown of the parabolic structure could lead to a drop of up to 75%,” Brandt said. Brandt stated that the 80% declines seen in the past will not be repeated, but the price could fall to the $50,000-$60,000 range. More than $19 billion was liquidated in the crypto market after US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday. Bitcoin's price fell from $121,000 to $102,000. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, called the surge a warning about leveraged trading. “Even leverage above 1.5x is dangerous,” he said. “You always have to consider the long-term risks,” he said. Edwards added that his outlook for the coming weeks was “bullish.” BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes wrote on his X account, “Bring the truck back and buy everything,” after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced the end of quantitative tightening. According to Hayes, the period of quantitative easing creates a positive environment for crypto markets because cheaper credit and increased liquidity support investment flows. Pav Hundal, chief analyst at Swyftx, also said that the economic data is sending positive signals for Bitcoin: “With falling oil prices and a weakening labor market, it seems inevitable that the Fed will cut interest rates this month. This could be a golden period for Bitcoin.” Macroeconomist Lyn Alden said in her latest statement, “I think the next quarter will be quite favorable for Bitcoin.” While short-term corrections are possible, Bitcoin could reach new records before the year is out, according to experts. *This is not investment advice.

53169063,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836280,1760515200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53169063.jpeg,RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter warned inflation may be stronger than expected for Q3,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/rba-says-hot-inflation-may-delay-cuts/,"Australia’s central bank has cautioned that persistently high inflation could delay or halt interest rate cuts, despite earlier signs of easing. At the Citi Australia & New Zealand Investment Conference in Sydney on Wednesday, RBA Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter said inflation for July–September is likely stronger than expected, reinforcing market fears that the bank’s rate-cutting cycle could be paused for longer. Reserve Bank of Australia staff are actively reviewing and analysing the latest economic trends as they prepare updated forecasts for the November Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter said. Hunter noted that as the RBA looked ahead, a variety of potential outcomes remained uncertain and that the bank’s approach would continue to be data-dependent. She added that the RBA board would continue to monitor developments and make further adjustments to monetary policy as needed, reaffirming the central bank’s cautious stance as it assessed upcoming inflation data and economic indicators. The RBA’s third-quarter inflation numbers, scheduled for release on Oct. 29, will be a crucial test of the central bank’s belief that inflation is heading back to target. RBA warns inflation could prove tougher to tame Hunter’s remarks follow upside surprises in recent monthly inflation readings for July and August, which indicate that price pressures across services and housing have remained heightened. The RBA, which has cut the cash rate three times already this year to 3.6%, held steady last month, citing the need for more data. Hunter said the RBA aimed to keep inflation, on average across the cycle, around the 2.5% midpoint of the target band in underlying terms. However, she cautioned that persistent inflation, especially in labour-intensive sectors, could delay the target return. Asked about the RBA’s projected neutral rate (the level that doesn’t slow growth), Hunter didn’t offer a specific figure and said it was “a range rather than a point number.” The quarterly CPI will be a key driver for when the next policy shift will come, economists say. Markets are now split: while some participants continue to anticipate a cut at the RBA’s Nov. 3-4 meeting, others regard the decision as too close to call. Traders have also revised down expectations of aggressive easing by early 2026. Economic resilience complicates easing plans Recent data indicate that household spending is holding up better than forecast, supported by more jobs and a rebound in the housing market. The labor market, meanwhile, is tight: Unemployment remains close to 4%. These developments are adding to the arguments for rate stability in an effort to avoid rekindling inflation. The RBA has repeatedly stated that it aims to ensure inflation remains sustainable within its 2-3% target band before cutting rates again. Services inflation in particular has been stubborn, with higher costs of wages and strong demand for goods from sectors such as health, education, and hospitality, the central bank added. In her speech titled “Why Productivity Matters for Central Bankers,” Hunter addressed a deeper structural challenge: sluggish productivity growth. She said Australia’s medium-term productivity outlook had been revised down, with trend growth now expected at 0.7%, compared with 1% previously. That shift implies Australia’s so-called potential growth rate, which is the speed at which it can grow without inflation spiking, is to be a shade lower at 2% a year rather than 2.25%. Hunter said some of the deceleration could be attributed to growth in the care economy, softer mining output, and underinvestment in technology. Hunter conceded that the RBA’s updated assumption for productivity growth might still be too high. She added that, conversely, rapid advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence could develop faster than expected and deliver stronger productivity gains. The lagging productivity trend presents a dilemma for policymakers. Slower productivity implies that any given level of demand would generate more inflation, so the RBA has less comfort in stimulating the economy through rate cuts.

The pullback follows last week’s tariff-driven shock and Monday’s fade from resistance, with traders eyeing whether the dip sets up the next leg higher, or a deeper test of support. Bitcoin Price Rejected at $116K, Liquidations Flush Leverage After rebounding more than $15,000 off the weekend low, the Bitcoin price stalled near $111,500, a level that’s repeatedly attracted seller interest and profit-taking. As price rolled over, a wave of long liquidations swept through derivatives venues, wiping out overleveraged positions and cooling overheated funding. Short-term, $111,000 has emerged as an initial demand zone, with deeper supports clustered near $110,000 and the psychological $105,000–$108,000 band. A decisive daily close back above $116,000 would reassert bullish control and put the prior high back in focus. Macro headlines continue to frame intraday swings. Tariff uncertainty recently amplified volatility across risk assets, though a softer tone from both Washington and Beijing has tempered worst-case fears. That shift helped stabilize crypto broadly, but BTC’s latest rejection shows bulls still need a clean catalyst to reclaim the trend. Sentiment Capitulation: “Buy-the-Fear” Signal? On-chain and social gauges flash a familiar pattern: retail FUD peaked into the drop while “smart money” accumulated, according to market analysts. Santiment’s Brian Q. noted that spikes in negative retail sentiment have repeatedly preceded short-term reversals this cycle, from spring tariff scares to summer geopolitical headlines. Several technicians also highlight a bullish MACD cross on higher time frames, a setup that appeared before previous alt-season advances, even as near-term chop persists. Strategists point to improving market structure after the liquidation sweep: lower funding, cleansed leverage, and still-elevated spot participation. That mix often precedes range rebuilds and trend continuation, provided key supports hold and macro rhetoric doesn’t re-ignite broad de-risking. What to Watch Next Key technical levels remain clear for traders. Immediate support is seen between $110,500–$111,000, followed by a deeper cushion at $110,000. A decisive close above $116,000 would confirm renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $110,000 could expose Bitcoin to the $105,000–$108,000 range. Beyond Bitcoin price action, attention turns to Bitcoin ETF net flows and stablecoin liquidity, which signal broader market participation. Sustained inflows would strengthen the buy-the-dip narrative, while macro factors, such as tariff headlines or surprise data, could still trigger volatility.

However, the announcement has sparked significant criticism within the crypto community. Many users, particularly those on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), have voiced concerns that the criteria for eligibility have not aligned with the developments, leaving several traders, including those from Hyperliquid (HYPE), ineligible for the airdrop. Hyperliquid And HypurrNFT Users Left In The Lurch At the time of the announcement, it was stated that users of Hyperliquid, Phantom perps, and holders of HypurrNFT would be eligible to receive the MON airdrop. Despite this, reports indicate that very few HypurrNFT holders qualify, with some users claiming that their substantial trading volumes—over 200 million on perps—did not meet the eligibility requirements. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency These frustrations have led to comments such as, “this airdrop is a joke,” highlighting the disconnect between the expectations set by Monad and the reality faced by its community. According to the outlined criteria, Monad plans to distribute tokens to over 235,500 users, including active community members who have consistently supported the project on social media and engaged in various initiatives. The criteria also encompass traders with high trading volumes on decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid, long-term holders of popular NFTs (such as CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins), participants in DAO voting on Ethereum-based platforms, contributors to ecosystem development through various roles, and developers actively creating products on Monad and participating in project hackathons. Critics Question Monad’s Commitment To Users Critics, including DeFi researcher Coin Metrika, have sharply criticized Monad’s airdrop strategy. Metrika pointed out that the published eligibility criteria shocked many within the crypto community, revealing that only 5,500 wallets are considered eligible—representing just 0.74% of Monad’s Discord users. Related Reading: Tether Resolves Celsius Lawsuit With Major $300 Million Settlement Deal Meanwhile, the project is distributing airdrops to 225,000 addresses outside of its community, many of whom may not even be aware of Monad or the impending claim deadline. In a sarcastic commentary, Coin Metrika summarized the situation, stating: If you haven’t figured it out yet, here’s a summary of #MonadAirdrop criteria: You have roles in Discord that are difficult to obtain—thank you, we’re not interested in you because you’re poor! You participated in our testnet—thank you for helping us test the product for free, which we sold to investors for a lot of money. Dressed up in clown costumes and shot viral videos to promote the @monad brand—thank you, we laughed out loud at you. You have money that you’ve shown on the blockchain—let’s be friends, here’s your airdrop! This highlights the increasing dissatisfaction within the Hyperliquid, HypurrNFT and wider crypto communities regarding how Monad has handled its airdrop initiative, raising questions about its commitment to its users. At the time of writing, HYPE trades at $39, recording losses of 13% over the past seven days.

Bitcoin Is Making Yet Another Retest Of The STH Realized Price As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin could be at the fourth step of the short-term holder (STH) Realized Price cycle. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that measures the average cost basis of the investors on the BTC network. When the value of this metric is greater than the spot price, it means the overall market is carrying a net unrealized loss. On the other hand, it being below BTC’s value suggests the average holder is in the green. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Unlike LUNA & FTX Collapses, Says Glassnode: Here’s Why In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a specific segment of investors is of interest: the STHs. These are the BTC holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This group is considered to include the fickle-minded bunch of the sector, prone to making panic moves during volatile periods. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price of the STHs over the last couple of months: As is visible in the above graph, Bitcoin has made a few retests of the STH Realized Price during the last few weeks and each time, the level has held so far. The reason behind the indicator acting as support lies in how investor psychology tends to work. As the analyst has broken down in the chart, STHs typically follow a five-step cycle during bullish phases. The first three steps involve some degree of buying from the group upon retests of their cost basis from above. These holders consider the retraces to their break-even level as dip-buying opportunities. By the fourth retest, however, they can become exhausted, and may decide to stop their accumulation. This is when the level stops providing support to the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BNB Shoots Up 6%: Is This Just The Start Of A Run To $2,400? From the chart, it’s visible that the latest retrace in Bitcoin has once again brought its value near the STH Realized Price. Given that this is the fourth retest, Maartunn has noted that this could potentially be the fourth step in the STH cycle. It will now be interesting to see how the asset’s price develops in the coming days. A sustained move below the level may confirm a breakdown of support and lead to the fifth and final step of the STH cycle, where these investors start looking at their break-even level as an opportunity to exit the market instead, thus turning what was once support into resistance. BTC Price Bitcoin dropped to $110,000 earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back to $113,000.

The document, published online in February 2023, discusses how blockchain is reshaping the financial sector and names several institutional examples. Within that discussion, it explicitly refers to “the American Express instant blockchain-based payment system, which was developed on the Ripple platform.” The excerpt attached by SMQKE presents blockchain as a transformative force within finance, healthcare, education, and other industries, emphasizing its ability to deliver fast, secure, and transparent data transactions at reduced cost. It cites the Interbank Information Network, led by J.P. Morgan, Australia–New Zealand Banking Group, and the Royal Bank of Canada, as one of the largest blockchain networks in operation. The mention of American Express’s system appears immediately after, identifying it as a frequently used blockchain payment application built upon Ripple’s distributed ledger technology. Ripple developed a blockchain-based platform that is “frequently used” by American Express. See for yourself. https://t.co/Aq7FXU9Kh0 pic.twitter.com/tgZumIfvf6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 13, 2025 Implications of the Document The document offers more than speculation; it provides a verified academic acknowledgment of Ripple’s practical integration within the financial industry. It indicates that American Express utilized Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure to enable instant payments, confirming the platform’s use in mainstream economic systems. The academic citation carries weight, as peer-reviewed works undergo rigorous evaluation before publication, suggesting the information originated from verifiable sources available at the time of writing. The excerpt also notes that Ripple functions as a distributed ledger incorporating servers and crypto tokens known as XRP . This description aligns with Ripple’s established framework, where transactions are validated across a decentralized network to achieve high-speed settlement. The academic context reinforces Ripple’s status as a technology provider that has contributed to tangible blockchain applications within the global banking ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Context in Financial Technology Blockchain adoption among major financial institutions has accelerated as firms seek faster and more cost-effective solutions for cross-border settlements. By citing both the Interbank Information Network and the American Express–Ripple collaboration, the publication cites these initiatives as leading examples of blockchain integration in finance. These cases demonstrate that blockchain technology has moved beyond experimental stages and into real-world payment operations among globally recognized institutions. Although the excerpt does not elaborate on current transaction volumes or the operational scale of American Express’s use of Ripple , the acknowledgment alone substantiates that such an implementation occurred and was actively recognized in academic literature. It further supports the view that Ripple’s infrastructure has played a direct role in enhancing payment efficiency within major financial networks. SMQKE’s post is grounded in documented academic evidence that American Express developed an instant blockchain-based payment system on Ripple’s platform. The source not only verifies Ripple’s involvement but also highlights its integration into the practical operations of a global payments leader.

SOPR Hits 6-Month Low — $2.50 Crosshair,https://coinpaper.com/11678/xrp-rebound-imminent-sopr-hits-6-month-low-2-50-crosshair,"XRP’s SOPR Hits 6-Month Low: Could History Repeat Itself? According to market commentator Xaif Crypto, XRP’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has just dropped to 0.95, marking its lowest level in six months. SOPR, a key on-chain metric used to gauge investor behavior, indicates whether coins moved on a particular day were sold at a profit or loss. Values below 1 suggest that holders are selling at a loss, often signaling potential market capitulation and setting the stage for a rebound. XRP’s SOPR has historically signaled early price reversals. When it last hit 0.92 on April 7, XRP jumped 35%, soaring from $1.90 to $2.58 in days. Traders are now watching closely, as a repeat scenario may be in play. Xaif Crypto added, “Now with a low near $2.38, next potential target: $3.10–$3.35.” XRP is presently trading at $2.50 , just above recent lows. If history repeats, analysts see potential upside to $3.10–$3.35, signaling a notable gain that’s drawing both retail and institutional interest. Notably, XRP’s SOPR has hit a six-month low, signaling a potential market turning point. Historically, such levels have preceded strong rebounds, with targets around $3.10–$3.35. Traders and investors may be looking at one of the most attractive risk-reward setups in crypto right now. XRP Eyes Critical Bounce as Market Reacts to ABC Pattern According to market analyst Lingrid, XRP is showing signs of reactive buying pressure, hinting at a potential squeeze as the recent pullback evolves into an ABC corrective pattern. Therefore, this technical setup is capturing traders’ attention, as the coin approaches crucial support and resistance zones that could define its next directional move. Lingrid highlights the $2.50 level as the key support that must hold to maintain bullish momentum. A failure to defend this zone could open the door to further downside, with a potential fade toward $2.30. On the flip side, if buyers manage to defend this level, XRP may see a trend resumption, with initial resistance at $2.85–$2.90 acting as the first “lid” for gains. Surpassing this range could pave the way toward the $3.18 target line, signaling a more pronounced rebound. Therefore, XRP is showing signs of a reactive market, with short-term bids testing support ahead of a potential squeeze. The ABC corrective pattern suggests that holding above $2.50 could reignite bullish momentum, while a drop below risks sharper losses. Key levels now define clear opportunities for risk management and strategic entries or exits. XRP sits at a critical technical juncture. Key support at $2.50 must hold, while resistance at $2.85–$2.90 and the $3.18 target mark define upside potential. Traders should watch price and volume closely to assess whether a bullish continuation or deeper correction is likely. Conclusion XRP’s SOPR hitting a six-month low signals a potential market turning point. Capitulation at $2.38 historically precedes sharp rebounds, with past rallies surging 35% and technical targets pointing to $3.10–$3.35, giving traders a clear roadmap for potential opportunities.

The Mayor signed an executive order on Tuesday, strengthening the City’s bid to become the global crypto capital. The new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain aims to promote “responsible innovation” and alignment across stakeholders. Mayor Adams has appointed crypto policy expert Moises Rendon to lead the office as executive director. “Mayor Adams’ creation of this new office proves that the future is now for digital assets and blockchain in New York City,” said Rendon. We're embracing the technologies of tomorrow, today! With our new Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain, we'll be able to grow our economy and attract world-class talent through cryptocurrency and blockchain tech: https://t.co/7yIrfdLPZN — NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) October 14, 2025 Digital Assets Office to Strengthen City’s Role in Crypto The municipal office for crypto will develop strategies to strengthen the city’s role as a hub for the industry, per an official statement from the NYC Mayor’s office. Besides, it will evaluate new digital assets and develop initiatives that educate the public. Further, the establishment will coordinate efforts across agencies to ensure alignment of policies, services, and digital asset initiatives “The age of digital assets is here, and with it comes the chance to grow our economy, attract world-class talent, expand opportunities for underbanked communities, and make government more user-friendly,” said Mayor Adams. Mayor Adams has embraced crypto way before America’s current pro-crypto outlook. He received his first three mayoral paychecks – worth $30,000 roughly at the time – in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in January 2022. Later the same year, the mayor said he still held the two popular cryptos, despite extreme market turbulence. The crypto paycheck stunt earned him the title ‘Bitcoin Mayor.’ ‘Pro-Crypto’ Mayor Adams Ends Reelection Capaign – Who’s Next? Last month, Mayor Adams ended his reelection campaign , citing financial struggles. Zohran Mamdani, who won the New York mayoral primary election on June 24, will face off against other candidates, including former governor Andrew Cuomo, in November. Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race, has largely remained silent on crypto. In June, Tyler Winklevoss called New York City a “broken kleptocracy.” Regarding Mamdani’s surging popularity in the mayoral election, he said, “It appears things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.” The post NYC Mayor Establishes ‘Nation’s-First’ Crypto-Centric Office Ahead of His Exit appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|New York|NYC Mayor,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-15 08:18:51

Even though the disappointment will be discouraging, analysts are monitoring select levels of support along with bullish signals of reversals that can stimulate a turnabout, especially if market conditions normalize. Against such volatility, the spotlight is also on under-$1 cryptos that are picking up strong presale traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , in Phase 6 of the presale with over 65% sold, is fast becoming investors’ go-to choice as they hunt newcomers with high-growth potential cryptos in the early stages, reflecting the way future-oriented traders are matching seasoned assets like SOL with newcomers that also look set to deliver. Sol Price Prediction: Reversal Potential Following Drastic $590M Sell-Off Solana (SOL) has been under heavy selling pressure after an enigmatic $590 million liquidation across the cryptocurrency market within a 24-hour span sent it crashing to about $182, a 22% decline throughout the week. Although the swift loss proved hasty, experts opine that correction is still possible should SOL find support near current lows, with possible new buying inclination should the overall market condition improve. As investors keenly observe buy signals within the price action of Solana, the growing interest in new high-prospect projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hides the scope to which the quest continues to find the next big crypto opportunity amidst volatility. Mutuum Finance Shines Bright in Q4 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going viral with its strong presale run in 2025. So far, over 17,040 investors have invested over $17.35 million. Phase 6 of the presale is now 65% full as more and more investors pour in. Mutuum Finance protocol is offered with up-to-date, real-time Liquidation Terms as well as Loan-to-Value (LTV), both of which recalculate whenever the market fluctuates. This is to enable the platform to hedge the volatility to a very high extent, thus making the platform highly secure during market volatilities. Mutuum Finance will debut its lending and borrowing protocol in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. The extensive list of core features will boast: mtTokens, liquidator bot, debt tokens among several functionalities to aim towards best-in-category usability as well as ultimate optimization. ETH and USDT will be operational from the day the collateral is borrowed/lent, thus with live, scalable high-speed DeFi activity. The project’s security measures protect the protocol from the influence of market shock as well as makes all stable. MUTM’s lending management platform is built to maximize lending ability, together with overall capital efficiency, by continued leveraging of highly correlated holdings. Insolvency risk is reduced, and the platform will provide for a stable, secure, and sustainable DeFi borrowing and lending experience. Mutuum Finance Becomes Popular as Market Stress Tests Solana With Solana (SOL) unable to regain ground following a historic selloff of $590 million, investors look to new opportunities that couple innovation with strength. One project that obviously shines as a contender is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), having already successfully raised over $17.35 million across over 17,040 investors. The real-time tracking of the project’s Loan-to-Value (LTV), the evolving terms of the liquidation as well as the strong security arrangement cause the project to stand out in uncertain market conditions. With the lending and borrowing protocol to be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, Mutuum Finance will be one of the most prominent DeFi projects in the year to come. Cryptocurrency investors looking to ride the wave of an under-$1 cryptocurrency with long-term potential must dash to the Mutuum Finance presale right now to secure a spot before Phase 6 closes off.

In a video analysis posted yesterday, Kevin framed Powell’s appearance at the National Association for Business Economics forum yesterday as unusually balance-sheet centric and tantamount to advance guidance: “This man came out today and literally sat there and spoke about the balance sheet the entire time… he telegraphed… we’re probably going to end the quantitative tightening program in the coming months.” He added, “The Fed telegraphs what they’re going to do with monetary policy… they don’t want to come out in surprise rate cuts or surprise rate hikes.” Several experts like BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes and Walter Bloomberg confirmed the interpretation via X. There you have it, QT is over. Back up the fucking truck and buy everything. pic.twitter.com/kQbpBSOlOU — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 14, 2025 FED’S POWELL: MAY BE APPROACHING END OF BALANCE SHEET CONTRACTION ‘IN COMING MONTHS’ — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) October 14, 2025 Start Of The Crypto Bull Run Kevin’s core claim is unambiguous: durable altcoin cycles have required a neutral or expanding Fed balance sheet, and QT has marked their demise. “We know the correlation between the Fed’s balance sheet and durable altcoin outperformance is literally one-to-one… That’s it. That’s the correlation. It’s one to one. It’s 100% hit rate,” he said, pointing to a multi-year chart of “total others versus Bitcoin” that he has tracked “for years.” According to his read, every time QT has started, altcoins have entered a bear market against BTC; when the balance sheet has shifted to neutral or QE, “altcoin season is able to occur.” The timing around last week’s violent cross-market liquidation reinforced his thesis, in his view. Kevin noted that “as soon as we see a 70–80% crash on altcoins on their USD pairs and then total others versus Bitcoin taps this major support level… three days after that, Powell comes out and telegraphs… we’re going to end [QT] in the coming months.” He stopped short of alleging intent—“I don’t like to go down the rabbit hole of manipulation… it just seems a little odd”—but argued the macro liquidity pivot now appears in sight: “All we know is that the Fed did telegraph that they are going to be ending QT, and that should be happening either by the end of the year or first thing next year.” Related Reading: Most Coordinated Attack In Crypto History? What Led To $19 Billion In Losses As Bitcoin Price Crashed While his macro read is overtly constructive, Kevin emphasized he is not trading it blindly. ” In practice, he is waiting for validation across two pillars: Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe moving averages and the USDT dominance structure. On Bitcoin, he repeated a rule he has used across cycles: “Anytime Bitcoin has lost the 2-day 200 SMA and EMA, the cycle was over. Anytime Bitcoin has lost the 50-week SMA on the weekly time frame, the cycle was over.” He located the current “cycle validators” around the rising band that, on his charts, spans “$102,000 to $96,500,” with $98,000/$96,000 the approximate line in the sand. “If you break $98K, slash $96.5K on multiple weekly closes… the cycle’s probably over,” he said. The stablecoin gauge—USDT dominance—remains his market metronome. Kevin described a “classic textbook macro descending triangle” in USDT.D with a “flat bottom” near “3.9%–3.7%” and lower highs into two-week moving averages. “There’s a 70–80% chance that this descending triangle ends up breaking down and crypto goes higher,” he said, cautioning that a minority of such formations do break up. “I don’t plan on doing a thing until it does break… I ain’t going to be the guy who sat here this entire time tracking this incredible pattern… and then deviate away from it now.” What To Watch Now Beyond liquidity, Kevin addressed the perennial four-year-cycle debate head-on. By his dashboards—ROI since halving, ROI since cycle bottom—“you’re at the end of the cycle… the four-year cycle’s over.” But he argued that macro still governs whether price must top on schedule. Related Reading: Crypto Crash Triggered By Binance Margin Exploit, Uphold Research Chief Claims Running a “process of elimination,” he said the backdrop does not currently resemble 2021’s inflation shock or a clear earnings/bubble unraveling, though he acknowledged exogenous risks such as renewed US–China tariff escalation. “Unless something macro-related durably tops this market, there’s still a chance that it goes higher,” he said. “Crypto is not invulnerable to the macro… all markets are literally tied one-to-one to the macro. Period.” Technically, he remains cautious on breadth. He highlighted persistent weekly bearish divergences on Bitcoin, Total2 (large-cap ex-BTC), and Total3 (ex-BTC, ex-ETH), and the failure to secure decisive weekly closes above “120K–125K,” which, in his words, produced “two weekly reversal candles [and] a monthly reversal candle” and “lower highs in the weekly RSI.” The August-to-present message, he said, has been consistent: “Be cautious… If you’re in altcoins from way lower, take some profits… Don’t buy anything right now… wait for a resolution.” Still, the QT call is the pivot he’s watching most closely. “We are at a critical stage in the history of crypto… I want a definitive answer.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.79 trillion.

Recent on-chain data shows a cohort of new whales has taken control of a larger part of the supply. The Bitcoin (BTC) expansion stage is already mature, and may see further speculation. On-chain data shows a new cohort of whale wallets is in charge, as older holders either moved coins or locked in gains. BTC holders are still mostly in profit, with 97% of all-time buyers in the green. Despite the support, the recent slide of BTC from its peak, combined with dramatic liquidations, raised questions on the direction of the bull market.

During the 2025 cycle, the metric has not even touched the euphoria range, as trading is much more strategic, with the presence of institutions and treasury buying. The exuberance and chaos of previous cycles is not present in 2025, despite the higher valuations and BTC records. New wallets take over Bitcoin The recent BTC rally boosted activity in a new wave of whale wallets. New whales were more active in all of 2025, this time preferring to realize gains. While BTC volatility was low, whales still wanted to avoid the drawdowns. A larger number of new whales traded strategically during the 2025 market cycle, accelerating their market presence in the past months. | Source: Cryptoquant Despite the whale selling, drawdowns during the 2025 cycle rarely exceeded 25% and were mostly driven by derivative trading. According to analysts , BTC was in a mature speculative stage, supported by inflows of liquidity and new sources of capital inflows. Over the past few months, wallets with 100 to 1,000 BTC are still the most significant source of accumulation. The current shift to new whales may translate into a holding wave, as some of the wallets mature. BTC starts recovery after record liquidations BTC is starting a recovery following last weekend’s peak liquidations. Open interest hovers around $34B, still taking time to rebuild the recent liquidated positions. BTC open interest on Hyperliquid is down to $2.43B, from a recent level of over $4.6B. In the short term, BTC regained some of its price positions, jumping to $113,257. The Crypto fear and greed index is still pointing to a fearful trading sentiment. The recent liquidation heatmap shows positions in a tight range, with short traders opening positions as low as $114,000. On the downside, long positions are in the $111,000 range. As the market remains jittery, another crash to that level is still possible. BTC is currently poised between those liquidatable positions, as whales rebuild their bets on a market direction.

The Dutch semiconductor equipment firm told markets it now believes next year’s revenue won’t fall below 2025 levels, reversing its July stance that had caused panic among investors. Shares jumped 3% on the day and are now up 24% year-to-date. Back in July, ASML’s stock dropped after the company warned it couldn’t commit to 2026 growth due to what it called “macro and geopolitical uncertainty.” This week, it finally decided to talk straight. While it didn’t give a full forecast, ASML said it will lay out more details in January, and at least for now, 2026 isn’t looking worse than 2025. ASML warns of sharp China drop as U.S. ramps pressure CEO Christophe Fouquet said ASML expects a “significant” decline in Chinese customer sales next year. This is a warning shot. He also said in a video transcript that while AI is pushing new momentum into the business, China won’t carry the weight it once did: “We expect customer demand and sales in China to decline significantly next year compared to 2024 and 2025.” This is happening while U.S. lawmakers continue threatening even tighter export controls on chip gear, and Donald Trump keeps throwing tariff threats back into the mix. Ben Barringer, global tech analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC’s Europe Early Edition that, “The news on China is a little concerning… the U.S. select committee is potentially considering more restrictions.” Despite that, Barringer said the Q3 bookings figure was stable enough to calm markets. “The bookings number has been quite volatile over this year, so a little bit of stability is, I think, quite good,” he said, adding that investors are starting to look beyond 2026 and focus more on 2027. ASML’s biggest client, TSMC, is expected to report its earnings on Thursday. Everyone’s watching closely, especially since demand for AI-related compute infrastructure still hasn’t slowed. More strain in computing capacity could feed straight back into ASML’s lithography business. ASML hits 7.5 billion euros in sales, eyes 9.8 billion for Q4 ASML reported €7.516 billion in net sales for Q3, just shy of LSEG’s €7.79 billion forecast, and net profit of €2.125 billion, slightly above expectations. Looking ahead, it forecast Q4 sales between €9.2 billion and €9.8 billion, and a gross margin between 51% and 53%. For full-year 2025, it’s holding on to its previous call; revenue up about 15% compared to 2024, with a gross margin hovering around 52%. The firm also reminded analysts it’s still Europe’s most valuable listed company, and it’s not backing off AI anytime soon. “Strong news about commitment to AI has helped reduce some of the ongoing uncertainties,” Fouquet said. “We also see that AI could create a lot of value in our products moving forward.” ASML’s Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen added that their new partnership with French AI company Mistral is part of a wider plan to go deeper into the AI space: “This is a way for us to get closer and closer to the AI world.” On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Jefferies have all upgraded their ASML outlook. Morgan Stanley pointed to more AI foundry expansions, and UBS said stronger PC and phone sales, plus AI-driven memory demand, were creating upside. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Intel’s $5 billion supply deal is expected to drive more demand for ASML’s gear.

53172153,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836346,1760521395,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53172153.jpeg,CME trading surges in Middle East as Gulf activity heats up,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cme-trading-surges-in-middle-east/,"CME Group is seeing a massive upswing in trading from the Middle East, with hedge funds pouring into Dubai and Abu Dhabi and pushing activity to new highs. CME’s average daily volume from the region jumped 16% this year, hitting 193,000 contracts per day, while hedge fund trading itself has surged by about 30%, according to data released by the exchange on Wednesday. Julie Winkler, CME’s chief commercial officer, called the hedge‑fund rush “pretty consequential,” saying the Middle East has become “our fastest‑growing segment by far.” Julie added that CME’s expansion follows its clients’ footprints, as more funds establish bases in the Gulf to be closer to the region’s sovereign wealth funds. The Middle East still represents only a single‑digit percentage of CME’s global trading activity, roughly the same as Hong Kong, but the momentum is what matters. CME is embedding itself deeper in the region, setting up a business‑development officer inside the Gulf Mercantile Exchange (GME) office in Dubai, where it already owns%. Hedge funds move operations to the Gulf Wall Street names are showing up fast. Davidson Kempner, managing $37 billion, just opened an office in Abu Dhabi, joining firms like Marshall Wace and Brevan Howard, the latter already running a team of more than 100 staff there. Their logic is simple: being on the ground gets them closer to cash‑rich funds that control hundreds of billions, instead of sending teams back and forth from London or New York. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) said in July that it hosts 85 hedge funds, a% jump from last year, with 69 managing over $1 billion each. The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) doesn’t publish data, but it did admit to a surge in fund registrations less than two months ago. Julie said the region’s appeal comes from a combination of a tax‑friendly setup, an attractive lifestyle, and a timezone that connects Asian, European, and U.S. trading hours. She added, “They’re wanting to build out those operations to a level that is pretty significant. We’re seeing complete pods of some of these hedge funds moving to the region.” CME’s leadership views this as a natural extension of its customer strategy. “Both the asset management and the hedge funds flowing into Dubai were critical,” Julie said, adding that CME is simply going where its trading community already operates. Meanwhile, Gulf stock markets strengthened on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, under President Donald Trump’s administration, will cut rates in the coming months. Traders are pricing a 99% chance of a 25‑basis‑point cut in October and a 94% chance of another in December. Those moves matter in the Gulf, where most currencies remain pegged to the U.S. dollar, making Fed policy a local event. Dubai’s DFM index rose 1.4%, lifted by a 3% gain in Emaar Properties and a 3.8% rally in Emirates NBD. The bank is in advanced talks to buy a stake in India’s RBL Bank, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the deal. Anyway, Abu Dhabi’s FTFADGI index surged by 0.1%, while Saudi Arabia’s TASI index ended the day flat. CME Group’s own stock has surged by 17% year-to-date, beating both Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)’s 6.3% and the Nasdaq’s 15% surge. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The filings, dated October 14, includ e AR K Bitcoin Yield ETF , AR K DIET Bitcoin 1 ETF, an d AR K DIET Bitcoin 2 ETF . AR K Bitcoin Yield ETF intends to earn revenue from Bitcoin-related strategies. The fund, as per the filing, will sell options and gather premiums to yield and seek to minimize volatility. It is permitted to invest up to 25% of its total assets in other funds managed by Ark. The DIET series aims to protect investors from downside risk. The DIET Bitcoin 1 ETF serves as a cushion against half of any market losses, but it only joins the returns after the price of Bitcoin has increased by 5% within a given timeframe. At the same time, the DIET Bitcoin 2 ETF also insulates investors against the first 10% of losses and engages in upside potential after prices rise beyond the beginning of each outcome period. These reports follow BlackRock’s submission of a request to list the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF on Nasdaq, another yield-focused Bitcoin product. The competition between issuers underscores the increased interest in diversified crypto ETFs to provide income and risk-adjusted exposure. ETF industry hits record $12.7 trillion The larger U.S. ETF industry continues to grow, reaching a record $12.70 trillion in assets at the end of September, according to data from ETFGI. Investors saw net flows of $152.5 billion in September alone, the second-highest monthly total on record. Year-to-date inflows totaled $951.27 billion, surpassing last year’s full-year record. The report said that ETFs have experienced 41 straight months of inflows, indicating investor confidence despite market volatility and high interest rates. ETFGI’s data also support the conclusion that digital-asset ETFs have evolved into a mainstream investment segment. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF currently holds $5.46 billion, and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF holds $3.00 billion. With net inflows of $1.38 trillion in the last 12 months, ETFGI forecasts net flows for the U.S. ETF industry may reach a new peak by the end of 2025, driven by the launch of spot crypto and tokenization-themed ETFs. Bitcoin Price Reacts to the ETF filings Bitcoin rose after a surge in ETF filings. The coin is currently trading at $113,051, registering a 1% rise in the last 24 hours. The volume increased by 30% as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that more rate cuts were likely, leading to increased volatility. According to CoinGlass, the optimism among derivatives traders was cautious. However, total Bitcoin futures open interest declined 2% to $72.74 billion with minor losses across both CME and Binance futures. Analysts believe the pullback may be a result of profit-taking after investors began rebalancing their portfolios.

The deal will see Absa integrate Ripple’s institutional-grade digital asset custody technology to store tokenized assets, including crypto, for its customers in South Africa. In a statement released by Ripple on Wednesday, Ripple said Absa will use its enterprise-grade custody platform to secure and scale storage for several digital assets. The system will see the bank manage cryptos and tokenized financial products in compliance with operational standards. Ripple taps Absa as first custodian in Africa Absa Bank will become Ripple’s first digital asset custodian in Africa, a firm that serves more than 12 million customers in over ten countries on the continent. “Africa is experiencing a major change in how value is stored and exchanged, and our partnership with Absa reiterates Ripple’s commitment to unlocking the potential of digital assets on the continent,” said Reece Merrick, Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa at Ripple. “As one of the most respected and innovative banks in Africa, Absa has a strong track record of leadership, and we’re proud to support its digital asset ambitions with the most secure and compliant custody infrastructure on the market.” Today, we’re excited to announce that @AbsaSouthAfrica , one of Africa’s leading financial institutions, is now @Ripple ’s first major custody partner in Africa: https://t.co/9FQ5GTxMnK We’re bringing institutional digital asset custody to South Africa, providing the secure and… — Ripple (@Ripple) October 15, 2025 Absa Corporate and Investment Banking’s Head of Digital Product, Custody, Robyn Lawson, said the move shows the bank’s commitment to innovation and client trust. “We recognise the importance of providing our customers with secure, compliant, and robust custody solutions for their digital assets. Ripple’s custody solution allows us to leverage proven and trusted technology that meets the highest security and operational standards. Together, we can deliver the next generation of financial infrastructure to our customers,” Lawson remarked. Ripple’s partnership with the bank follows its earlier collaboration with Africa-based fintech Chipper Cash, where Ripple’s technology powers cross-border crypto-enabled payments. The company also recently introduced its US dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, to African markets. According to the San Francisco-based technology company’s 2025 New Value Report , 64% of financial leaders in the Middle East and Africa believe faster payments and settlement times is the main motivation for the continents to adopt blockchain-based currencies. Ripple said the partnership with Absa was buoyed by “the demand for compliant digital asset infrastructure in emerging markets.” In its press statement, the RLUSD issuer boasted of holding over 60+ licenses from financial regulators in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. Africa’s crypto adoption builds bridge for crypto businesses According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, between July 2024 and June 2025, Sub-Saharan Africa received over $205 billion in on-chain value, a 52% increase from the previous year. Africa came third in the list of the fastest-growing crypto markets, only trailing Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Monthly on-chain volume in the Sub-Saharan region reached nearly $25 billion in March, against the backdrop of a currency devaluation in Nigeria steering citizens and institutions towards crypto. Chinalysis mentioned South Africa and Nigeria as the top jurisdictions that have forwarded formal frameworks for crypto trading, taxation, and custody, which has given banks and fintechs confidence to launch digital asset services. South Africa, in particular, has seen an uptick in consumer-level crypto adoption, topped off by new integrations in retail payments. Last Monday, QR payments provider Scan to Pay announced a partnership with Bitcoin payments company MoneyBadger to enable crypto payments at checkout counters in the country. The integration allows users of exchanges, including Binance, Luno, Blink, and VALR, to pay using Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other crypto assets at more than 650,000 Scan to Pay-enabled merchants. Payments are processed through QR codes, while merchants receive settlements in rand via the MoneyBadger platform. Crypto exchange Luno said the integration links its network of 30,000 merchants with Scan to Pay, extending payment options to widely used South African retail chains Shoprite, Checkers, Makro, and Vodacom.

CryptoQuant CEO: Retail Investors Are Now the Major Players in the Bitcoin Futures Market According to data shared by Ju, the average order size for Bitcoin futures was around $6,000 earlier this year, but has now fallen to $2,000. This situation shows that the influence of professional and institutional investors on the market is decreasing, while the share of small investors in the transaction volume is increasing. According to experts, this decline in average order size signals a market preference for more cautious, short-term positions. Furthermore, increased interest from individual investors during periods of high volatility could lead to increased risk in leveraged trades. CryptoQuant CEO Ju had also emphasized in his statements in recent months that individual investors are playing an increasingly important role in determining market trends. *This is not investment advice.

As gold makes constant new all-time highs, Bitcoin could be about to follow in its footsteps. In order to do so, a couple of trend breaks need to take place. The Bitcoin price is currently at the first of them. Potential trendline breakouts Source: TradingView Looking at the 4-hour time frame for the $BTC price it can be seen that the first trend break is actually in progress. If this is successful, further consolidation above $112,000 can occur, and the price is then likely to move up to the $116,000 horizontal resistance. A break of this level could coincide with the second trendline (faint dotted line). A breakout of both could then send the $BTC price back to the all-time high and the major ascending trendline (bold black line). Bitcoin is near all-time high correlation with gold Source: TradingView The gold chart is a sight to behold. Moving into a parabolic, straight up formation, gold could have $5,000 in its sights. Given the huge central banks purchases of gold rather than treasuries, a $5,000 gold price may even be attainable by the end of this year. Bitcoin is now highly correlated with gold, with the $BTC to gold correlation almost at an all time high at 0.85, according to CryptoQuant. With Bitcoin’s scarcity far greater than that of gold, it may not be much longer before $BTC starts catching up to gold. Bitcoin uptrend still intact Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $BTC price shows that the trend is still up. Had the Friday crash not been bought up this trend could have reversed and things would have been looking seriously bearish. As it stands, this week's candle could put in yet another higher low, so at least for the time being the bull market is still progressing higher. The bottom of the chart is most important. The Stochastic RSI indicators have crossed back to the downside again. Could it be that a big Bitcoin rally will need to be put on hold for the next two to three weeks until the indicators make their way back down to the bottom? Or will a sudden spike in the price action turn the indicators back around before they get there? All speculative ideas. However, the main thing is that the trend is intact and the price is still being funnelled into a narrowing space between the major 8-year trendline above, and the smaller 5-month ascending trendline below. In which direction the price breaks should determine the continuation or termination of this bull market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

53172520,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836326,1760521818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53172520.jpeg,Apple CEO Tim Cook promised to expand investments and partnerships in China,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-pledges-increased-investment-in-china/,"Apple CEO Tim Cook pledged major investments in China during his visit to the world’s second-largest economy, despite earlier US threats of tariffs on imported goods. During the trip, Cook met with Li Lecheng, China’s Minister of Industry and Information Technology, who urged Apple to strengthen collaboration with local suppliers, according to an official WeChat post. In response, Cook confirmed that Apple would deepen its partnership with China, highlighting the country as its largest market outside the US and a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino-based company. Apple plans to expand its reach in the tech market as competition in the industry intensifies Besides meeting with Li Lecheng, Cook also shared a post concerning his meeting with Kasing Lung, an illustrator and toy designer widely known as the creator of Labubu, and visited an Apple store in Shanghai. He also pledged a donation to Tsinghua University, China’s top university. In recent years, Apple has sought to diversify its supply chain away from China by adopting strategies such as increasing production in India. However, even with such strategies in place, the tech company still produces most iPhone products in the country with a strong support system from Taiwanese-based Foxconn Technology Group and Chinese-based Luxshare Precision Industry Co. Meanwhile, Apple intends to expand its reach in the tech market to solidify its position as the leader in the industry. To begin with, the tech company is committed to increasing its manufacturing efforts in the US while enhancing its production capabilities in other locations. Moreover, the tech giant’s team is preparing to produce new smart home gadgets in Vietnam. The main reason behind this strategy is to lessen their reliance on China. Nonetheless, like any other tech company, Apple has faced challenges in its efforts to diversify its workforce. To illustrate this, Foxconn returned hundreds of skilled Chinese engineers from India’s iPhone factories. This action significantly impacted the tech giant’s plan to enhance manufacturing activity in the country. What triggered Foxconn’s move to bring back hundreds of skilled Chinese engineers from India was the earlier announcement by Beijing officials that regulatory agencies and local authorities should restrict technology transfer and equipment exports to India and Southeast Asia. Regarding the officials’ announcement, tech analysts have pointed out that this could be an attempt to halt firms from shifting their manufacturing operations away from China. Apple focuses on expanding its operations in China with the launch of its slimline iPhone Air After imposing a break to give local carriers time to prepare for the eSIM-only device, Apple announced its intention to introduce the super-slim iPhone Air in China. Following its announcement in a Weibo post, preorders for the super slim iPhone Air will commence on October 17. Regarding this launch, a spokesperson from the tech giant confirmed that the smartphones will be available in stores on October 22. This confirmation followed a report from the Chinese news source Jiemian, which highlighted the scheduled release date. In the meantime, reliable sources have pointed out a unique feature: the slimline iPhone Air does not utilize physical SIM cards, making it Apple’s first-ever smartphone that is entirely eSIM-dependent. With the eSIM, everything related to a mobile network is integrated directly into the phone. Therefore, according to Apple, removing the SIM tray helped make room for a larger battery within the phone’s slender design. This statement was made during a launch event last month. However, China has slowly embraced eSIM technology among its mobile carriers. This resulted in the iPhone Air being launched later in the country. The phone was released elsewhere on Sept. 19. Despite this, hope has been sparked in the Chinese market following the announcement that China Mobile Ltd. has been approved to launch eSIM services in the country.

Writing on GETTR, he explained that he had moderated his political views from center-left in 2020 to centrist by 2022, after seeing the aggressive crypto regulation by the SEC and the Justice Department. He commented, “By 2022—having seen Gensler/Biden’s DOJ on crypto—I was a centrist, and (privately) donated tens of millions to Republicans. Weeks later, Biden’s anti-crypto SEC/DOJ went after me. They had me arrested weeks before the crypto bill I was working on was set for a vote — and the night before I was set to testify before Congress.” Gensler’s government phone had messages deleted for a period of time Around the time of Bankman-Fried’s arrest, House Republicans asked whether the arrest had been intentionally timed to prevent his testimony. They demanded that the then-SEC chair, Gary Gensler, furnish internal correspondence. However, Bankman-Fried wrote in a new post that Gensler suggested the records at issue had disappeared. According to the report of the SEC’s inspector general, released last month, an “enterprise wipe” was performed on Gensler’s government phone, which deleted text messages from October 2022 through September 2023. The device had stopped syncing with the agency’s system in July 2023 and was classified as “inactive” for more than two months, despite remaining operational, the office stated. Over those months, the SEC had consequently launched a series of high-profile actions against major exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance. The period also overlapped with the FTX collapse and Bankman-Fried’s subsequent arrest in the Bahamas. So far, Coinbase has accused the SEC of deleting close to a year’s worth of messages from Gensler’s phone and is seeking sanctions over what it is calling the “destruction of evidence.” Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud On December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S., where he was arrested. At the time, federal authorities alleged that Bankman-Fried planned the FTX fraud from day one and that it ultimately drove the exchange broke. Shortly after his arrest, Bankman-Fried was granted release on a $250 million bond and confined to his parents’ residence on Stanford’s campus, monitored by an ankle bracelet. He was later remanded to custody due to allegations of witness tampering, and in under a year, a 12-member jury found Bankman-Fried guilty on every charge he faced. Currently, he’s serving a 25-year sentence but is seeking to overturn the conviction on appeal. He and his family have petitioned President Donald Trump for clemency, who recently pardoned Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht. In a separate GETTR post, the imprisoned FTX founder explained that his friend published his message on the site: “I can’t post directly; I dictate to a friend via approved BOP phone/email.” However, investigative journalist Laura Loomer has warned the public not to listen to any of Bankman-Fried’s claims. She noted that the FTX founder would only “pretend like he was a victim of Joe Biden and the Democrats” to receive a pardon.

Ethereum Activates Fusaka on Sepolia, Mainnet Set for December — $PEPENODE Emerges as the Next 1000x Crypto October 15, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade is now live on Sepolia testnet, entering its second phase of roadmap with a mainnet launch scheduled for December. Sepolia serves as the perfect mid-stage environment ahead of the third and final Hoodi testnet on October 28th. In the 1st phase on Holesky testnet v, Ethereum tested the PeerDAS system, higher gas limits, and performance stability. In this phase, the network will stress-test data availability and raising the block game limit to 150M (up from the current ~45M). PeerDAS, an integral part of the Fusaka upgrade will reduce storage and bandwidth costs significantly, allowing more smaller validators to participate. As part of the Fusaka upgrade, Ethereum developers are focused on ensuring that nodes can efficiently handle larger blocks in every phase without compromising the network’s speed or stability. One emerging project mirroring Ethereum’s push for performance, innovation, and community-driven growth is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , the first mine-to-earn meme coin that allows you to earn rewards through gamified virtual mining. Follow our detailed guide to buy $PEPENODE. Safe and Circle Push USDC Adoption Among Institutions — Analysts Eye $BEST as the Next 1000x Crypto October 15, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Safe, an on-chain custody protocol, has now partnered with Circle to make USDC the preferred stablecoin for institutional self-custody and on-chain treasury operations.

53172694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86386,1760522440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Best Crypto to Buy As Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs Record $755m Outflows,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-ethereum-eth-and-bitcoin-btc-etfs/,"Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds have drained $755 million in a single day, signaling investor caution amid escalating U.S.-China trade frictions. Renewed tariff threats from President Donald Trump, targeting all Chinese imports with a 100% levy starting November 1, have triggered this exodus. Grayscale’s GBTC alone shed $145.3 million, while BlackRock’s ETHA lost $310 million, according to SoSoValue data. Yet, as these crypto etfs hemorrhage capital, opportunities emerge elsewhere in the crypto market. Such volatility underscores why spotting the best crypto to buy demands sharp focus. This is especially on fundamentals over fleeting headlines. Bitcoin ETFs Confront Heavy Redemptions Outflows hammered Bitcoin etfs hardest on October 13, with $326.5 million exiting after robust prior gains. Bitwise’s BITB and Fidelity’s FBTC contributed $115.6 million and $93.2 million in losses, respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT alone drew $60.4 million inflows, softening the blow slightly. Bitcoin prices tumbled 2.85% that day, reflecting broader crypto prices today under pressure. Yet, partial recoveries hint at underlying strength. Investors watched closely. The crypto fear and greed index stabilized somewhat, yet caution lingers. Ethereum ETFs Suffer Larger Withdrawals Ethereum etfs fared worse, posting $428.5 million in outflows that eclipsed Bitcoin’s losses. No fund recorded inflows, a stark turn from recent $1.3 billion hauls. BlackRock’s ETHA bore the brunt at $310 million. Ethereum prices plunged 3.94%, erasing weekly gains of 12.5%. U.S.-China port fee disputes added to the strain, spilling into high-tech sectors reliant on shared materials. Traders paused. Crypto etfs like these expose vulnerabilities in centralized products during geopolitical flares. Still, Ethereum clings above key supports, awaiting trade talk resolutions. Mutuum Finance Emerges Amid Market Shifts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured investor interest as outflows rock major crypto etfs, raising $17,400,000 since presale inception with 17,140 total holders. Phase 6 of 11 phases now unfolds at 70% capacity, offering tokens at $0.035—a 250% rise from phase one’s $0.01 entry. This price jump underscores growing demand for utility-driven projects. The team recently unveiled a dashboard featuring a 24-hour leaderboard of top 50 holders; the daily number one earns a $500 MUTM bonus after completing one transaction, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Leading buys in the past day included $8,860.03 from 0xbb66…3cfc, $8,339.03 from 0x4787…c7b1, $1,187.81 from 0xe168…0e95, $949.71 from 0x9764…f9ae, and $649.69 from an unnamed wallet. Such engagement highlights MUTM’s appeal in a jittery crypto market. Lending Protocol Advances Take Shape Mutuum Finance has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development, targeting V1 on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements encompass liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, starting with ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral. Borrow interest rates derive from utilization, keeping liquidity balanced: low rates spur borrowing during abundance, while hikes during scarcity draw deposits and repayments. Stable rates lock predictability for borrowers, often at a premium over variables, with rebalancing if markets swing sharply. Overcollateralization guards against volatility; positions liquidate below thresholds, rewarding liquidators with bonuses. Deposit and borrow caps limit exposures, especially for illiquid tokens. Thus, MUTM holders gain from a system prioritizing solvency and efficiency. Security Measures Bolster Confidence The Mutuum Finance team has finalized its Certik audit successfully, earning a 90/100 token score that affirms robust security. Complementing this, they launched a Bug Bounty Program with Certik, allocating $50,000 USDT across critical, major, minor, and low tiers to incentivize vulnerability reports. Meanwhile, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway celebrates the presale, distributing $10,000 to each of 10 winners; participants submit wallet addresses, complete quests, and invest at least $50 to qualify. Phase 6 sells out rapidly at $0.035, closing the window for this entry before phase 7 raises prices 14.3% to $0.04. Launch arrives at $0.06, projecting 420% ROI for current buyers post-deployment. These steps weave MUTM into DeFi’s fabric, where users earn yields on idle assets or borrow against holdings without custody loss. Navigating Outflows Through Utility Plays As Ethereum and Bitcoin etfs bleed $755 million, the best crypto to buy pivots toward protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), blending P2C pooled liquidity for instant access with P2P custom loans for tailored terms. Lenders deposit assets like USDC, receiving accruing mtTokens redeemable anytime, while borrowers post excess collateral for seamless repayments. This dual design suits both passive yield seekers and precise risk managers. Crypto prices today fluctuate wildly, yet MUTM’s fixed 4 billion supply and 45% presale allocation promise stability. Investors have flocked, boosting holders past 17,000. The best crypto to buy now favors such layered utilities over exposed etfs. Secure your position in phase 6 before it vanishes.

53172650,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=838275,1760522445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53172650.jpeg,Bitcoin (BTC) ‘Uptober’ Rally On Pause Until This Level Is Reclaimed,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-btc-uptober-rally-on-pause-until-this-level-is-reclaimed/,"After a remarkable start to ‘Uptober,’ Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen significant volatility, retesting multiple crucial levels. As the price bounces from the $110,000 mark, some analysts have suggested that BTC’s rally won’t restart until a key area is reclaimed. Related Reading: Chinese Investment Bank Eyes $600 Million Raise For BNB Treasury Company Bitcoin Needs Key Reclaim For New Highs Over the past week, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated between its range’s lower and upper boundaries, hitting both a new all-time high (ATH) of $126,000 and a three-month low of $102,000. Notably, the crypto market saw one of the largest liquidation events in history on Friday, which briefly sent BTC’s price below $107,500. The flagship crypto quickly bounced from the lows and reclaimed the $110,000 barrier as support over the weekend, attempting to reclaim the $116,000 level twice since Sunday. Analyst Ted Pillows noted that holding the crucial $110,000-$111,000 zone could set the stage for a bounce back to the high of its three-day range, but warned that losing this area could send the price to the $107,000 support before a reversal. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that despite the pullback, BTC’s range between $107,500-$124,000 has held and the key horizon levels have been respected, with “many large pivots and moves happening from these areas.” The trader suggested that Bitcoin will likely continue to “chop” within the range’s mid-zone, where most price action has occurred since Q3, until it reclaims and retests $117,000 as support. To achieve this reclaim, analyst Rekt Capital pointed out BTC must show continued stability around the $114,000 area as it has “historically preceded upside into at least $117.3k.” He noted that on the previous occasions when the price Daily Closed above this level, Bitcoin was able to rally to at least $117,300, even if the bounce eventually led to more downside action. Nonetheless, “for bullish bias, it’s important $117.3k doesn’t turn into a resistance on this current move and so Bitcoin will need to Daily Close above $117.3k to continue towards $120k over time,” the analyst warned. BTC’s Macro Structure Shows Strength Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC managed to maintain its macro bullish market structure, continuing to “print progressive Higher Lows despite the drastic downside, which is a sign of strong continued premium-buying behaviour on price pullbacks.” He also noted that Bitcoin has been consolidating within the $108,000-$116,000 levels in the monthly timeframe, upside wicking beyond the range high and downside wicking below the range low since July. The analyst suggested that the downside wicks could be a positive sign since “it signifies a liquidity grab at lower price levels that could add the necessary fuel to attempt a Macro Range breakout.” “As a matter of fact, Bitcoin has been upside wicking beyond the $116k Range High far more frequently in recent months compared to the downside wicking below the $108k Range Low, which is a testament to the Range Low’s role as a stable higher timeframe support,” he explained.

He concluded that holding the $114,000 support in the weekly timeframe is the key level for a new challenge of the Range Highs. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $112,610, a 2.7% decline in the daily timeframe.

Crypto Sector Has Just Seen $700 Million In Liquidations On Friday, Bitcoin and other digital assets were shook by a sharp crash, resulting in a record amount of liquidations in the futures market. A “ liquidation ” occurs when an open contract amasses losses of a certain degree and gets forcibly shutdown by its platform. Last week’s market downturn was violent, so naturally a massive amount of positions were caught off guard. Bitcoin alone saw liquidations of over $11 billion during this volatility, as data from Glassnode shows. This plunge in the Bitcoin futures Open Interest was the largest in the cryptocurrency’s history and caused a reset in speculative excess across the derivatives market. The Open Interest here is naturally a USD measure of the total amount of positions related to BTC that are currently on all centralized exchanges. The analytics firm has also shared a heatmap that puts into perspective just how intense the swing in the Open Interest was across the top 100 coins by market cap . Despite this recent squeeze, however, traders have once again been caught out by market volatility in the past day as liquidations have piled up on the various platforms. As data from CoinGlass displays, the crypto sector has witnessed almost $708 million in liquidations on the derivatives exchanges over the last 24 hours. Around $457 million of these liquidations, equivalent to 64% of the total, involved long positions. The derivatives flush has mostly been triggered by a decline in Bitcoin and company, so it makes sense that bullish bets have taken the brunt of the squeeze. Overall, this mass liquidation event is significantly smaller than the one from last week, but that’s because excess leverage already saw a degree of reset then and the latest volatility hasn’t been quite as sharp. In terms of the individual symbols, Ethereum was the coin that contributed the most toward the liquidations with more than $234 million in contracts involved. Bitcoin was second with liquidations of $168 million and Solana third with $42 million. A mass liquidation event like today’s isn’t an uncommon sight in the crypto market, due to the fact that coins can be volatile and extreme amounts of leverage can easily be accessible. Even so, the recent liquidations have been extraordinary. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $113,300, down about 6.5% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin derivatives|bitcoin liquidations|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto liquidations|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 10:00:54

53172753,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86404,1760522552,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,EasyA Co-founder Explains to XRP Holders How Leverage Works,https://timestabloid.com/easya-co-founder-explains-to-xrp-holders-how-leverage-works/,"Dominic Kwok, co-founder of the educational platform EasyA , recently provided an in-depth explanation of how leverage functions in cryptocurrency trading, offering clarity on a topic often misunderstood by new investors. His detailed breakdown outlined the core concept of leverage, how it amplifies both gains and losses, and why it is widely regarded as one of the riskiest trading tools in financial markets. Leverage, as Kwok described , allows traders to borrow funds from an exchange to take on a larger position than their actual capital would otherwise permit. For instance, an investor with $100 can use leverage to control a $1,000 position at a 10x ratio. This means that the trader contributes $100 as collateral and borrows $900 from the exchange. While the approach can significantly increase potential profits if the market moves in the trader’s favor, it equally magnifies losses if prices fall. since many have asked, here's how leverage works: TLDR leverage is when investors borrow money to trade, allowing them to take out larger positions than otherwise possible. here's how (and why it's so risky): let's say i have $100, but i want to buy more crypto than my $100… https://t.co/ARPaPBv9Yp — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 13, 2025 How Leverage Amplifies Gains and Losses In his explanation, Kwok used a straightforward example to illustrate both sides of the equation. When a trader uses 10x leverage on a $100 investment, they are effectively controlling $1,000 worth of crypto assets. If the market moves upward by 10%, the position’s value increases to $1,100. After repaying the borrowed $900, the trader pockets $200, effectively doubling their original capital. However, the same mechanism that allows for such high returns can quickly erase the trader’s capital. If the market drops by 10%, the $1,000 position falls to $900, equaling the borrowed amount. At that point, the exchange automatically closes the position to recover its funds, leaving the trader with a total loss of their $100 collateral. This automatic liquidation is a safeguard for exchanges to prevent borrowers from losing more than their own capital. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Clarification on Losses and Liquidation Following Kwok’s initial breakdown, another X user known as Legendary Hamster posed a question to clarify further. They asked whether a trader would owe money to the exchange if the price of the asset continued to drop more than 10%, such as in a 20% decline scenario. Kwok clarified that exchanges typically close out leveraged positions automatically before further losses accumulate. As soon as the asset’s value decreases enough to eliminate the trader’s margin, the position is liquidated immediately. This process ensures that traders do not go into debt and that exchanges recover the borrowed funds in full. Kwok emphasized that this mechanism is precisely what makes leverage so risky, as even a small market movement in the wrong direction can wipe out an investor’s entire position almost instantly. Leverage and Investor Caution Kwok’s explanation emphasizes a key principle in financial trading: leverage should only be used by those who fully understand its implications. While it offers the potential for significant returns, it is a double-edged tool that can easily lead to complete capital loss when the market turns unexpectedly. He pointed out that many traders underestimate how quickly leveraged positions can unravel in volatile markets, such as cryptocurrency. Because digital assets often experience sharp and unpredictable price movements, the risk of liquidation remains high even over short periods.

This investment is part of Coinbase Ventures’ earlier funding round. CoinDCX last raised $135 million at a valuation of $2.15 billion, in a round led by Pantera Capital and Steadview Capital Management. Expansion Strategy Focused on India and Middle East Coinbase’s move aligns with its broader expansion strategy in India and the Middle East, regions the company believes are critical for further cryptocurrency adoption. High adoption levels make these markets particularly attractive for long-term growth. CoinDCX is among India’s largest exchanges. Its parent group generates annual revenue of approximately $141 million, with the platform serving 20 million users as of the end of August 2025. The investment deal is pending regulatory approval, and the financial terms remain undisclosed. Earlier reports suggested Coinbase was in talks to acquire CoinDCX for roughly $1 billion, but CEO Sumit Gupta denied these rumors. Security Challenges and Resilience In July 2025, CoinDCX experienced a security breach, losing over $44 million from its operational funds. The breach was reportedly caused by malware on an employee’s laptop. No user funds were affected, as all customer assets were stored in secure cold wallets. The exchange absorbed the loss from its treasury and took additional measures to strengthen internal security, demonstrating resilience despite the incident. CoinDCX has since enhanced multi-factor authentication, implemented real-time transaction monitoring, and conducted regular internal audits to prevent future breaches. The company also emphasizes user education and awareness programs to ensure clients adopt safe security practices when managing their accounts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 10:13:19

The long-awaited recovery has given traders something to smile about, especially since Ripple continues to make efforts to forge in-depth global payment partnerships. However, whereas XRP may eventually climb towards $10, much of the retail sentiment is focused beyond it on smaller projects, such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which can drive profits far more spectacularly. Alongside LILPEPE are ASTER and Arbitrum (ARB), standing out as strong prospects for the next cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Turning Serious Heads What began as a leisure activity meme project evolved into one of the most exciting presales of 2024. Little Pepe now stands at over $26.8 million. That kind of traction puts it in rare company; few early-stage tokens show such sustained participation this late into a presale. What sets LILPEPE apart is its unique blend of humor and genuine blockchain use. In addition to a Layer 2 network for faster, cheaper transactions, the token has been designed with actual scalability. Staking incentives, governance, and interoperability with leading DeFi apps are on its roadmap. This blend of fun and purpose has drawn not only meme traders, but also long-term investors, who prefer tokens that last. Adding to the excitement is the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway , which rewards both major buyers and random participants during Stages 12–17. The campaign has added energy to an already strong presale, helping the project maintain one of the most engaged meme communities on Telegram and X . If momentum holds, analysts expect Little Pepe’s launch could mirror what Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin achieved in their early breakouts. With a projected listing price of $0.003, some forecasts suggest LILPEPE could multiply 20x or more if post-launch adoption continues to build. Aster (ASTER): A Decentralized Trader’s Playground The ASTER token has quickly earned a reputation as the “wildcard” in decentralized trading. Starting below one cent and rising toward $0.50 within months, the project demonstrated that there’s still a massive appetite for DeFi trading innovation. Built around perpetual trading markets, ASTER enables users to take leveraged positions directly on-chain, eliminating intermediaries. Despite the project's constant ups and downs, it has remained stable thanks to good liquidity and active trader participation. Analysts estimate that if adoption continues at the same pace, ASTER could be trading at about an average of $1.38 by 2025. However, as is the case with most high-speed altcoins, its ride won't be a smooth one; volatility is a package feature. Arbitrum (ARB): Infrastructure Strength Arbitrum is still a vital component of Ethereum's scaling stack. Founded by Offchain Labs, it utilizes Optimistic Rollup technology to make transactions cheaper and faster than those on Ethereum, at roughly 90% lower prices. Its strength lies in compatibility, as it enables developers to port Ethereum dApps to Arbitrum without code rewriting. That simplicity has led it to dominate the Layer-2 space, with over $2.7 billion locked in leading DeFi protocols, such as Aave and GMX. The ARB token governs the network and has been trading for around $0.45 most recently. Aside from year-over-year volatility, technicals are looking up as the token is now well above its 200-day moving average. Should ARB be able to break through its resistance, momentum should carry it way higher.. Conclusion Ripple’s journey toward $10 might offer decent returns for large-scale holders, but for smaller investors, the outsized gains often come from projects earlier in their cycle. Little Pepe , with its viral presale, community-driven design, and upcoming exchange debut, is drawing comparisons to the early days of SHIB and PEPE and may have the most room to grow. If the market stays bullish through 2025, these three could easily outpace XRP in percentage terms. But among them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the one with the momentum, imagination, and grassroots support that often define the next breakout story.

But the crypto community's focus is shifting towards other burgeoning projects like Little Pepe (LILPEPE), ASTER, and Arbitrum (ARB), which are poised to offer substantial gains. Introduction to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Starting off as a fun meme coin, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has evolved into a serious contender in the cryptocurrency market with over $26.8 million already raised in its presale. This project blends humor with practical blockchain applications, offering staking, governance, and interoperability with major DeFi apps. The excitement around Little Pepe is magnified by the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway , which energizes its community by rewarding both significant contributors and random participants. Additionally, Little Pepe's strong community engagement can be followed on platforms like Telegram and X . Overview of ASTER: Revolutionizing Decentralized Trading ASTER has rapidly gained recognition in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena by facilitating leveraged trading directly on blockchain. With its unique offering and robust liquidity, ASTER's potential for growth remains high, although it does come with inherent volatility. Arbitrum's Role in Ethereum’s Scaling Solutions Arbitrum enhances Ethereum's efficiency with its Optimistic Rollup technology, reducing transaction costs significantly. This compatibility has helped it secure a dominant position in the Layer-2 ecosystem, maintaining over $2.7 billion in major DeFi protocols. Conclusion While Ripple might be eyeing a gradual increase to a $10 valuation, emerging projects like Little Pepe (LILPEPE), ASTER, and Arbitrum are setting the stage for potentially explosive growth. The unique market positions and innovative technologies of these cryptocurrencies could very well provide higher returns compared to established players like Ripple.

His assessment highlighted a significant distinction between speculative tokens and assets with institutional-level resilience, explicitly identifying XRP as a select group that endured one of the most severe market crashes in recent years. $XRP is a institutional-grade asset according to the National Bank of Kazakhstan's Chief Digital Officer. https://t.co/qZ0BKjsie5 pic.twitter.com/OEROayV9Mr — Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) October 13, 2025 Market Collapse and Structural Weaknesses Zhalenov highlighted that within 24 hours, over $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, affecting more than 1.6 million traders worldwide. The collapse of hundreds of projects, he explained, reflected a deeper structural issue within the crypto ecosystem. Many assets, he noted, were never built on real economic foundations but rather on systems that merely redistributed value without creating it. As a result, a large portion of the market, heavily reliant on retail capital and speculative momentum, failed to survive the volatility. Among the few assets that demonstrated resilience were BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, and TRX — which he classified as “institutional-grade.” This designation carries significant weight, particularly as it comes from a high-ranking official within a central banking authority. According to Zhalenov, these assets managed to maintain stability while the broader market experienced widespread liquidation and investor capitulation. A Shift Toward Institutional Recognition His remarks suggest a turning point in how central banks and financial institutions perceive the crypto landscape. Rather than dismissing digital assets altogether, the focus is shifting toward evaluating their capacity to integrate with real-world economic systems. Zhalenov emphasized that blockchain technology itself remains strong and continues to mature, with increasing applications in tokenization of real assets , cross-border settlement, green finance, and digital rights. This evolution highlights how blockchain is transitioning from speculative use cases toward more stable and practical applications. For assets like XRP, which are designed to operate efficiently within financial infrastructure, such institutional acknowledgment strengthens their long-term relevance. Central Bank Perspective on Responsible Integration Zhalenov further explained that for central banks, including the National Bank of Kazakhstan, the current lesson is clear: the approach to crypto must evolve beyond passive investment strategies. Assets must be actively managed and hedged, retail participation must be safeguarded through education and regulation, and stablecoins should be integrated into mechanisms that complement fiat systems while supporting cross-border liquidity. He underlined that the future of blockchain lies in its real-world integration rather than speculative gains. Central banks, he noted, must work to ensure that innovation supports financial stability and genuine economic growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Refinement of the Market and Institutional Validation Zhalenov’s perspective reflects a growing institutional sentiment, one that separates blockchain’s technological potential from speculative trading behavior. His concluding remarks made it clear that the recent crash was not a death blow to crypto, but rather a process of refinement. He stated that what remains in the aftermath is “stronger, more institutional, and closer to the real world.” On social media, the statement gained attention from crypto enthusiasts, including Subjective Views, who noted that XRP’s classification as an institutional-grade asset by a central bank official represents more than just recognition — it signifies validation from within the traditional financial system. Another user, Roman Trotsko, commented that when central banks begin identifying assets like XRP as institutional-grade, it transitions from speculation to acknowledgment by those shaping global financial policy. The National Bank of Kazakhstan’s stance provides an important insight into how regulatory and monetary authorities are beginning to differentiate between transient market projects and assets with real-world utility. For XRP , which has long been positioned for institutional and cross-border use , this recognition reinforces its relevance as blockchain technology continues to converge with the global financial system.

The transaction comes as some of the coins were about to be confiscated into the reserves of the US Government. Another batch of old BTC from the Lubian miner wallets has moved. A single transaction moved 9,756 BTC, just as analysts were discussing whether the coins were still controllable and movable. The transaction shifted the coins into two new addresses, one containing 1,000 BTC, and the rest on another address. The coins originated from the remnant wallets of Lubian.com , which were not affected by the hack and remained controllable by the mining pool. The wallet retains 2,129 BTC. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the Lubian mining pool fell prey to a hack in late 2020, but the wallets and the amount stolen was unveiled by Arkham only in 2025. The coins are now being forfeited to the US Government. The recent coin movement suggests Lubian has been eager to retain ownership of its remaining reserves, which have appreciated significantly in the last year. The address is not part of the hacker’s stash, which for now remains idle. Lubian hacker funds remain unmoved According to Arkham’s tracking service, the coins on all known Lubian hacker addresses remain unmoved . While there is a legal call to forfeit the assets, there are doubts about the controlling entity for the coins and whether they can be moved to new addresses. Even if the US Government decides not to sell the coins, not controlling their private keys also raises the issue of the true value owned. While the Government aims to build a reserve of BTC, simply laying claim to idle addresses has never worked as a form of BTC ownership. This means the reserve may only be valid if the USA moves the coins to fully controlled wallets. Before now, the Lubian hacker consolidated some of the coins in the summer of 2024, suggesting the miner wallets may not be locked forever. Lubian wallets linked to weak private keys The mining pool reportedly used an algorithm to create private keys, leading to a list of insecure wallets . The US Government announced the seized assets based on a list of wallets, so far not performing any transactions. Additionally, one address holding around 154 BTC was omitted in the recent report. However, the hacker’s ownership is not conclusively connected to those private keys. Lubian additionally retained 11,886 BTC, which were still controllable and securely stored. The Lubian.com wallet was actually the original sender of the recent transaction. The large-scale shifts happen at a time when even treasuries of 100 BTC are seen as significant. Lubian has not shown any plans on selling the BTC or using it for other purposes. The wallet that moved the funds is outside the scope of forfeiture, but the coins may have been moved as a precaution.

53176060,606577,1760528683,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53176060.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy as Bitcoin Bulls Calm the Market After Historic Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-bitcoin-bulls-stabilize-market/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin traders are preparing for a new bottom, as liquidity runs thin above $105K. If support breaks, the recent low around $101K might be retested. But analysts point out that the recent crash is a mature reaction to volatility rather than panic selling. This keeps the bullish perspective intact, opening a short window for investors to buy the dip before it’s too late. Last week’s colossal market shakeout likely marks the beginning of a clean-up phase for Bitcoin. Multiple supports could be retested – including the yearly open of $93,500 – before $BTC holds ground at $117K and prepares for another breakout rally. But the pullback is controlled deleveraging more than a market crash, according to Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. Trends across futures, spot volumes, and open interest reveal the market exercising self-corrections. In a recent post, Glassnode offered more perspective by comparing the reset against the FTX and Terra Luna collapses of 2022. Less than 65% of the supply was in profit in those catastrophic events, while 90% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is in profit now. As loud and as sudden as the recent pullback has been, it’s far from turning into a long meltdown. As further reassurance, here are two more trends that indicate that the sell-pressure is cooling: Bitcoin has managed to steady itself above the 135-day moving average. So the mid-term trend is still looking good. Short-term traders no longer have huge unrealized gains, as the Young Supply MVRV ratio (an on-chain indicator used to assess whether the market is undervalued or overvalued) has reset to around 1. The coming days are likely to witness Bitcoin trading sideways before a stronger base forms above $117K. And once the market finds its footing, there might not be a slowdown till a new all-time high is found. For strategic investors who believe in Bitcoin’s role in modern finance, this is a brilliant window to buy the dip. But limiting your portfolio to Bitcoin is a bad idea, as it’s often undervalued altcoins that generate heavier returns in short timeframes. Early-stage projects are especially juicy when they are backed by projects that could shape the market’s future. In a loud and chaotic market, hunting down the best cryptos to buy now is easier said than done. To save you the trouble, here are our top altcoin picks to stock up on while the market recovers. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 in History Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of the hottest cryptos this season. With its native token presale approaching $24M, it’s easy to see what the big deal is. The project is building an upcoming Layer-2 solution dedicated to Bitcoin, which has long been tied to its slow and clunky base chain. The fact that Bitcoin is the world’s largest crypto will seem a little surprising if we consider how outdated its underlying blockchain is. Transaction fees on the network can sometimes skyrocket so high that $BTC doesn’t make sense as an everyday currency: The network is not reliable for timely transactions, either. Web3 owes most of its success to Ethereum and Solana, and it’s these blockchains that have built a home for a wide range of applications in DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and countless others If Bitcoin’s historic relevance has made up for all its technical flaws, just think what it could do with an infrastructure upgrade. That’s what Bitcoin Hyper is here to accomplish: The above infrastructure is not just a paper vision – unlike most early-stage cryptos – with the tech team making steady progress in product development. So it’s best not to wait till the market recovers to buy $HYPER. This is one of the few early-stage projects with substance, and the presale is quickly moving toward a sell-out (it has raised over $23.76M so far). And bear in mind, it’s priced in stages to encourage early purchases, and the next price surge is only a few hours away. High staking APYs (currently 50%) also await early backers. Join the presale now to grab $HYPER for just $0.013115 . 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Crypto Mining Simplified For everyone who’s always been curious about crypto mining, but never had the patience to explore it, here’s an opportunity not to miss: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is launching a virtual mining platform where you can build mining rigs, buy nodes, set up a server room, and earn raining rewards. All of it virtual, of course. You don’t need to be a crypto nerd to get started, nor do you need a huge investment. All it takes is an early position in $PEPENODE, which explains the growing traffic to the token presale that’s on its way to $2M. Your earning potential depends on how good you are at optimizing your mining setup. For this, you can try different node combinations and even consider upgrading your nodes. What makes this opportunity even more compelling are: Crypto airdrops for top players who climb the leaderboards. They’re not just paid in $PEPENODE, but also other popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. The deflationary tokenomics , where 70% of the tokens used to purchase upgrades are burnt. That, in turn, could drive the token value over time. Referral rewards . You earn 2% of rewards mined by players you invite. Now selling for just $0.0011005, the price increases in just a few hours. The staking APY – currently at 704% – won’t last long either. Here’s how to buy $PEPENODE . Visit the official PEPENODE website to join the presale . 3. BNB Has More ATHs on the Horizon Next up is BNB, the top trending crypto that didn’t just defy the broader market trend, but also set a new all-time high amid the chaos. BNB is now only behind $BTC, $ETH, and $USDC on the crypto chart, claiming XRP’s fourth ranking with a massive $168B market cap. But here’s what makes it an attractive buy now. BNB has slid 5% on the daily chart, and is now trading 11% below its ATH set just two days ago. BNB’s latest rally started despite backlash from users who claimed that the coin exacerbated the market turmoil. But the team was quick to do damage control by issuing BNB airdrops worth $45M to meme coin traders hit by the market crash. The long-term picture also shows resilience, as the chain has been consistently attracting traders and developers with fast and cheap transactions. Reports that China Renaissance Holdings is planning to raise $600M for a new US-listed investment vehicle built around BNB further strengthen the bullish view. Check out the BNB price performance on Binance . But can a heavyweight like BNB match the high-upside potential of low-cap coins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) ? That remains to be seen. But as always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

The regulators in Belgrade now seek to implement a mechanism that will allow them to immediately flag suspicious transactions and identify wallet owners. Serbian government to amplify crypto supervision Serbia’s financial intelligence body has announced a public tender for a system that can scan cryptocurrency trade, local business media reported. According to the procurement’s technical specifications, the new platform should allow authorities to continuously monitor transfers on major blockchains. It is also expected to be able to recognize transactions related to Serbian residents and automatically notify government analysts about any suspicious movement of funds. The official documentation, published by the Serbian Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering (APML), also requires: “The proposed solution should combine publicly available blockchain data, network monitoring and advanced analytics to enable an official request for the identity of the wallet owner to be sent within minutes of a suspicious transaction being detected.” The system should be capable of monitoring transactions with 10 leading stablecoins and cryptocurrencies by trading volume, eKapija and BiznisKurir revealed this week. The list approved by the agency includes Tether ( USDT ), Circle’s USDC, First Digital USD (FDUSD), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), BNB, Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Sui (SUI). The tender expires on November 10, 2025, the economic news outlets noted in their reports. Cryptocurrency trading is legal in Serbia The APML , which is part of the administration of the Serbian Ministry of Finance, acts as the Balkan country’s financial intelligence unit. Its responsibilities include collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial information to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It gathers reports of suspicious transactions from various obliged entities, including banking institutions, insurance companies and accounting firms. The watchdog’s activities are mainly governed by the Republic of Serbia’s Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. The popularity of cryptocurrencies has been growing among Serbs over the past years, and crypto investing is legal in the Southeast European nation, which took steps to place its crypto space in order well ahead of many others in the region and across the Old Continent. The market was regulated with the Law on Digital Assets , which was adopted in 2020 and went into force in mid-2021. The legislation covers activities like coin trading and mining. It defines digital assets and divides them into two main categories – virtual currencies and digital tokens. The National Bank of Serbia ( NBS ) and the Securities Commission ( SC ) were granted powers to oversee the industry built around them. Service providers, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, need to obtain a license from the NBS to operate and meet minimum capital requirements. The Tax Administration of the Republic of Serbia, which is also subordinated to the finance ministry, is the body that collects taxes on crypto-related income and profits. The latter are considered capital gains in the country and taxed at a 15% rate.

At this point the latest news came from France. According to Coindesk, French banking giant ODDO BHF announced that it has officially entered the cryptocurrency market with its euro-backed stablecoin EUROD. EUROD is launching for the first time on Bit2Me, a platform backed by Telefonica, Unicaja and BBVA. The 175-year-old bank, which manages over 150 billion euros (about $173 billion) in assets, will list EUROD on Bit2Me, the Madrid-based cryptocurrency platform backed by telecom giant Telefonica and major institutions such as Unicaja and BBVA. The stablecoin complies with EU MiCA regulations and can be used by both individual and corporate users. ODDO BHF stated that it positions EUROD as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. The move by the established bank marks a significant step as it expands its product range for digital currencies and demonstrates the growing trend among traditional financial institutions to embrace blockchain technology and digital assets. EUROD, which meets the requirements of the EU's new MiCA regulation, is expected to have low volatility. *This is not investment advice.

Tuesday saw some more bearish price action, although a bounce off of a major ascending trendline did take place. Is it up or down next for the altcoins? Total2 battle at strong support Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Total2 (combined market capitalization of all cryptos excluding $BTC) shows that things are at a critical juncture right now. Last week’s huge candle wick to the downside is generally very bullish and bears testament to the massive buying that came in as Total2 plummeted down to a seemingly impossible level in the space of just a few hours. That said, the price could come back to fill in more of this wick before rising again. It just remains to be seen whether the smaller wick down from Tuesday’s bearish price action will have been enough. As can be observed from the chart above, the current horizontal support level of $1.55 trillion is a very strong one. Although the market cap price is starting to dip below, the trendline would likely hold, that is if the price does get back down there. Finally, the bull market trendline (faint dotted line) would provide a last ditch defense for the bulls. If this broke and the price confirmed below, this would probably signal the end of this bull market for the altcoins. Total3 more bullish Source: TradingView More bullish than the Total2 chart is Total3. This is the chart of the combined market capitalization of all cryptos excluding both $BTC and $ETH , so this probably gives an even better picture of the health of the altcoins once the big market cap of $ETH is also removed. Total3 is still holding nicely above the trendline, and also the very strong $1.03 trillion horizontal support line. What’s more, the crash candle wick stopped beautifully at the 0.786 Fibonacci extension level before rising a good way back to where it had started. At the bottom of the chart, as is the case for most of the major cryptos, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are still descending. This may mean another two or three weeks of sideways and downwards price action until they hit bottom and start angling up again. $TRX price falls through parabola Source: TradingView One cryptocurrency that has been following a parabolic curve since the beginning of the bull market is $TRX . However, as can be seen in the weekly chart above, there is some concern for the bulls right now. The price has pierced through the bottom of the parabola and this week’s candle has opened below. Be that as it may, the candle has found good support at the $0.32 horizontal support. Also, if the bulls can push the price back up through the parabola by the end of the week, a confirmation of the breakdown would have failed and $TRX would be back on track. The rest of this week could make or break not only $TRX, but the whole of the altcoin market. Watch this space closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

53176929,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836478,1760529387,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53176929.jpeg,China ramps pressure on EV makers over door failures after fatal accidents,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xiaomi-crash-scrutiny-on-ev-door-designs/,"A deadly accident involving a Xiaomi electric car has sparked fresh concerns about modern door handle designs and is expected to speed up China’s efforts to introduce stricter safety rules. The driver of a Xiaomi SU7 sedan died after the vehicle caught fire following a crash on Monday. People at the scene tried to help but could not get the doors open to pull the driver out. Police believe the driver had been drinking before the accident. The incident has brought attention back to a problem Chinese officials started looking at earlier this year. In March, another crash killed three people, prompting government agencies to begin working on new safety requirements for car door handles. The topic quickly became popular on Weibo, a social media platform in China, where a related hashtag was seen more than 1 million times. Last September, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology put forward new rules that would make all passenger cars have door releases that work manually. These releases would need to be reachable from both inside and outside the vehicle according to Bloomberg. The proposed standards target the type of handles that sit flat against the car body, which Tesla made popular in recent years. Industry leaders call for swift changes Li Yanwei, who advises the China Automobile Dealers Association, said the recent Xiaomi accidents will push the new standards to happen faster. Companies that make cars with flat handles “need to improve their products to comply with the new standards,” he said. These smooth, flat door handles first appeared on electric vehicles as a modern-looking design feature. While China’s planned rules would only apply to cars sold within the country, the nation buys more cars than anywhere else in the world. This means car companies from other countries will probably have to change their designs to follow the new standards, which could change how cars look everywhere. In the United States, Tesla is also facing questions about its door handles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration started looking into problems with some Model Y door handles. This happened just days after a report about several cases where people got hurt or died because they could not open car doors after the vehicles lost power. The draft rules China has proposed would allow door handles that use electricity to work, but they must still be able to open from the outside without any tools. This has to work even if the lock is on or if the battery gets too hot. Under these rules, a mechanical release means a system that works only through physical parts, with no electrical signals needed. The handle also has to have enough room for a hand to grip it – at least 6 centimeters by 2 centimeters. China EV safety rules give carmakers 19-month window The proposed standards also call for testing the handles under different conditions. People can give their opinions on the draft until November 22. Once the rules become final, car manufacturers will get 19 months to update vehicles they are already planning to make. The standards are set to start in 2027. Some companies are already making changes. The Zeekr 9X sport utility vehicle has traditional-style handles that use electricity but still meet what the draft rules ask for. Yale Zhang, who runs Automotive Foresight, a consulting company in Shanghai, called the draft safety standard “a return to common sense.” As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, Xiaomi’s stock price dropped more than 5% on Monday after news spread about the crash. The shares fell as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong, the biggest drop since April, before recovering somewhat. The incident adds to ongoing safety challenges faced by Xiaomi and other electric vehicle makers as Chinese regulators intensify safety oversight of the rapidly growing EV market.

Whoever had more machines won. Today, that formula no longer works. Intelligence has become the new edge — the ability to adapt, predict, and stay efficient even as network difficulty rises. Mining is entering an era where success depends not on brute force, but on smart algorithms, automation, and real-time optimization. When innovation turns into infrastructure A clear reflection of this shift can be seen in Neopool (neopool.com) — one of the fastest-growing mining ecosystems in 2025. In less than a year, the platform has joined the top 15 global mining pools, reaching around 15 EH/s in capacity. But more importantly, it has built its reputation on transparency, efficiency, and user trust. Rather than competing on raw power, Neopool has focused on technology. Its proprietary algorithms optimize task distribution and balance ASIC performance in real time — effectively creating a system of intelligent hashrate management. This approach ensures stable payouts, predictable results, and lower energy consumption — three critical pillars for miners navigating an increasingly complex environment. “Our goal is to give miners not just stability, but confidence in every payout,” says Andrey Kopeykin, CEO of Neopool. “Efficiency is no longer a feature — it’s the foundation of trust.” Making mining transparent again Neopool’s philosophy is built on clarity. Its dashboard provides detailed statistics on every aspect of performance — from hashrate and payout frequency to task allocation and reward history. Daily automatic withdrawals, a minimum payout of 0.001 BTC, and no hidden fees make the system accessible to both large-scale and independent miners. Where traditional pools often operate as black boxes, Neopool opens the process — turning mining from a guessing game into a measurable, data-driven experience.

Developer milestones released through 2025 show activity rising across Nightshade shards as new tools bring external assets into the Near environment. Cross-chain integration has become the sector’s defining race, and every major project is now looking for the most efficient way to move liquidity between networks. XRP Tundra approaches the same challenge from another direction. Instead of scaling a single chain through shards, it links two existing ecosystems—the XRP Ledger and Solana—through an audited framework designed for interoperability. Where Near widens its base layer, Tundra builds bridges between ledgers already proven at scale. Near’s Sharded Expansion Gains Ground Near’s Nightshade design splits transaction processing across multiple shards, allowing the network to run operations in parallel. Each shard acts as a lightweight blockchain, coordinated by a single validator set. The upgrade to Phase 2 allowed automatic resharding, meaning active areas of the network can divide further as demand rises without halting operations. NEAR’s performance milestones are public record: the core team reported 600 ms block times and roughly 1.2 s finalityin May 2025, and confirmed nine shards live on mainnet in August. These updates restored Near to the center of scalability discussions among Layer-1 developers. The project’s focus now extends beyond speed — it aims to serve as an access layer for assets from Ethereum, Solana, and other chains through its Rainbow Bridge. The strategy works within Near’s own environment. The limitation is that every asset crossing through its bridge must eventually conform to Near’s contract standards. That design still centralizes finality within one chain, even as execution becomes more distributed. XRP Tundra’s GlacierChain: Linking Ledgers, Not Shards XRP Tundra is taking the opposite route. Instead of expanding one blockchain, it connects two with complementary strengths. Solana processes transactions at scale, averaging over 50 000 per second in live conditions. The XRP Ledger delivers near-instant settlement with deterministic finality and transparent state verification. The next stage, GlacierChain, will function as a Layer-2 bridge between them. It will allow users to move liquidity across networks without wrapping tokens or leaving the audited perimeter of either ledger. The system is being developed to handle both governance signals and transaction data, using XRPL’s validator consensus to anchor results. This design treats interoperability as infrastructure rather than feature. Each layer retains its native advantages — Solana’s speed and XRPL’s settlement assurance — while the bridge manages confirmation logic in real time. The architecture avoids the bottlenecks that come with scaling a single network under heavy load. Dual-Token Structure Keeps Functions Clear The two-token model is central to how Tundra handles cross-chain coordination. TUNDRA-S, operating on Solana, is the utility and yield token powering liquidity pools, staking rewards, and transaction flow. TUNDRA-X, on the XRP Ledger, governs protocol parameters, reserves, and future Layer-2 proposals. By separating these roles, Tundra removes a major pain point visible in other ecosystems. Governance votes, staking returns, and market liquidity no longer compete for the same token supply. It’s a model designed for composability: one token builds, the other decides. This structure also reduces exposure to congestion. When Solana traffic spikes, governance remains unaffected on XRPL. When governance proposals activate on the XRPL side, execution speed on Solana continues uninterrupted. The result is an operational division that favors continuity over theoretical maximum throughput. Verified Infrastructure for Interoperable Finance Audits remain the foundation of that continuity. XRP Tundra’s codebase has been reviewed by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins . Team identity verification was completed through Vital Block , confirming the transparency standard that underpins every phase of the project. Independent coverage on Crypto Volt’s channel described Tundra’s architecture as cross-chain done from the ledger level, emphasizing how the audits allow verifiable performance across different networks. In an industry still recovering from bridge exploits and unaudited interoperability experiments, that level of disclosure has become a competitive advantage. The audit process extends to token economics as well. Each presale round is reviewed before the next begins, creating a timestamped record of contract integrity. This practice gives investors a way to track compliance across every component of the ecosystem. Presale Growth Reflects Structural Confidence The numbers behind that framework have continued to grow. XRP Tundra’s Phase 6 presale has raised more than $1.2 million from 11,600+ participants. TUNDRA-S sells at $0.1 with a 14% bonus, while TUNDRA-X carries a reference price of $0.05. Listing values are fixed at $2.5 and $1.25 respectively, giving the project a measurable, pre-audited upside. Because presale mechanics and audits are synchronized, later buyers enter under the same verified structure as early ones. That consistency stands in contrast to networks where token distribution adjusts on demand or liquidity events trigger price resets. Tundra’s cross-chain model isn’t trying to replicate Near’s sharding. It’s addressing the same performance challenge with different tools — linking independent ledgers under an auditable framework rather than splitting one chain into fragments.

The loyalty business underperformed from the outset, producing modest revenue relative to the acquisition value, and was impacted by COVID-19, so divesting was a good move. The current business model positions Bakkt as an embedded service layer, offering trading, custody, and compliance infrastructure via APIs to fintechs, neobanks, and brokerages. Current stock price movement resembles a relief rally; long-term upside of BKKT stock depends on execution and adoption of the new business lines. I'm initiating coverage on Bakkt (BKKT), as the stock stages a fresh rally following the divestiture of legacy businesses, a public offering, a stablecoin services launch, and a leadership transition the company has undergone, with fintech veteran Mike Alfred's appointment to the board being the latest spotlight move, which all refocuses the company as a pure crypto infrastructure and services provider. Bakkt is not a new name to most crypto investors. The company helped open an institutional on-ramp for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in 2019 when Bakkt launched the first regulated, physically delivered Bitcoin futures contract in the U.S., which was traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ), a product that delivered Bitcoin on settlement and gave institutions a regulated path to hold BTC long before the spot Bitcoin ETFs became available in the U.S. This piece will focus on what the divestiture and the renewed focus as an institutional-grade crypto infrastructure and services provider mean for Bakkt and how the sequence of recent corporate actions could fundamentally reshape Bakkt's investment narrative for investors. Bakkt—The Streamlining and the Road Ahead Bakkt's recent sequence of transitional moves has been a long time coming for both the company and most investors. It's been a long stretch of volatile revenues and razor-thin margins. In some quarters, the cost of revenue even exceeded the revenue itself, resulting in negative margin and gross profit. Net losses have been persistent throughout the history of Bakkt as a publicly traded company, save for Q1 this year when a non-cash accounting gain recognized from the fair value of warrant liability temporarily lifted results into positive territory. In short, the company struggled to balance its consumer-facing business (the Loyalty business) with its institutional infrastructure business (Bakkt Trust). Every quarter of financials has reflected this strain. Income statement (Seeking Alpha) Now, to understand where Bakkt is headed, we need to understand where it's coming from. Bakkt has always basically been a crypto company but ran two different businesses that were largely unrelated, and their business model made it difficult for most investors (including me) to properly understand and value the company. The two business models were a B2B loyalty and rewards platform inherited through the Bridge2 Solutions acquisition and a digital asset custody and trading infrastructure business operated under Bakkt Trust Company (a New York State-chartered limited-purpose trust). On the one hand, the Loyalty business operated as a B2B services provider, managing corporate rewards programs where consumers could redeem points for travel and merchandise. I think it's a good decision for Bakkt to streamline its focus by divesting the legacy loyalty business. The way the Loyalty business worked before the divestiture was by acting as a large intermediary. When a customer redeemed loyalty points from or through a partner brand or financial institution, Bakkt had to procure that specific flight, hotel booking, or product from a vast network of third-party vendors, handling all the logistics and payments. This created lots of operational strain, lower margins, and a drain on capital and management focus that should have been dedicated to crypto. And I think a lot of things went wrong with this business line from the outset. A business was acquired for a large amount following a $300 million Series B funding in 2020 but ended up producing only modest revenue relative to that price. ICE contributed Bridge2 to Bakkt at an implied enterprise value of about $250 million as part of the Series B transaction ( this filing shows ), yet Bridge2's pro forma revenue for 2020 was about $36.4 million. The acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions happened just before the COVID-19 lockdown period, and that immediately hit the travel and retail industries from which the Loyalty business directly earned its revenue. By recent quarters (before the divestiture), net loyalty revenues had fallen to single-digit millions (net loyalty revenue was $9.8 million in Q2). Pro-forma sales 2020, 2021 (Company filing) When the Loyalty business was integrated from the Bridge2 acquisition, Bridge2 was already seeing declining revenues, and though the bottom line remained positive, net income was also declining. Bridge2 acquisition (Bakkt) Then the custody business via Bakkt Trust was focused on institutional-grade crypto storage and settlement, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) custody and supporting products like Bakkt's physically settled Bitcoin futures launched through ICE (mentioned earlier). The Trust required capital and compliance overhead but seemed to never reach sufficient institutional scale to offset those costs, which further diluted profitability and management bandwidth. An example of this is a direct comparison of Bakkt Trust's assets under custody [AuC] as of the Q4 2024 end before it was transferred to ICE in Q1 this year, which was reported to be around $2.3 billion. This is an enormous gap from peers like Anchorage Digital, boasting tens of billions of dollars in AUC, and Coinbase ( COIN ) Custody, which manages custody balances well into the hundreds of billions across institutions and ETFs. And I think one reason for this could be Bakkt's initial focus on its physically settled Bitcoin futures contract (its flagship product mentioned in the opening paragraph) rather than a custody-as-a-service model, compared to rivals like Coinbase and Anchorage, who have seized institutional inflows from funds, ETFs, and corporate treasuries and have thus gained much higher AuC. Though the physically settled futures structure required Bakkt to build a robust, secure custody arm (the Bakkt Warehouse) to hold the physical Bitcoin for settlement, Bakkt's primary go-to-market product was the futures contract itself, not custody services. Bakkt basically missed out. A further drag for the custody business was the SEC's issuance of SAB 122 , which rescinded interpretative guidance included in SAB 121 . Under SAB 121, entities were required to record customer crypto assets as liabilities, which likely discouraged most regulated institutions from becoming crypto asset custodians. But now that it has been rescinded, banks and regulated institutions face fewer accounting roadblocks to offer custody, which cleared the way for more regulated institutions to enter the crypto custody market and made the competition tougher for companies like Bakkt. Now that the Loyalty business has been divested and Bakkt Trust has been sold to ICE, the main question is what clear, scalable growth narrative Bakkt now offers for investors to be excited about. In a crypto bull market (which I believe we're currently in and have only been slowed down by last Friday's liquidations), it is easier for companies' pivots to garner attention and price rallies, especially when they simplify the story and align with themes like crypto treasury (which has been a trending narrative for most of this year). Is Bakkt Too Late to the Crypto Services Market? Pure-play crypto companies that have survived multiple downcycles are those that have built a business model based on recurring sales and an asset-light SaaS model that scales with transaction volume rather than market volatility. From the looks of it, Bakkt is now structurally more asset-light and has a clearer path to build recurring revenue. Execution and client wins will, however, determine whether recurring sales actually scale. The new business model essentially positions Bakkt's infrastructure as an embedded service layer where Bakkt provides crypto trading and custody infrastructure via APIs to fintechs, neobanks, and brokerages. Then these fintech and neobank clients plug Bakkt's APIs into their apps to offer crypto services, while Bakkt handles trade execution, routing, compliance, and custody in the background. Though Bakkt's custody business is no longer in its direct control, Bakkt will still offer custody services through a signed nonbinding letter of intent with ICE Digital Trust to provide custody services for digital assets and potentially resell the custody services to third parties. One of Bakkt's other selling points is a shorter time to market for clients and partners as crypto adoption grows as the company markets its products as ""turnkey"". And I believe the catalyst to further propel Bakkt's place in the crypto services market is how fast crypto integrates into the global financial stack and how each of Bakkt's product offerings is optimized for specific crypto use cases. Not forgetting how much of that integration is turnkey (like the company markets its products) since the target customer base is primarily fintechs and neobanks. Stablecoins, for example, have already gained some regulatory backing with the GENIUS Act in the U.S. Bakkt is already laying infrastructure for stablecoin payments, and in Q1 announced a cooperation agreement with DTR for stablecoin payment infrastructure. Then in the Q2 results press release , Bakkt announced the launch of its AI-based stablecoin solution called Bakkt Agent, which offers on-chain settlement and compliance automation for global stablecoin payment flows. Such products hold the prospects for steady, recurring revenue with better margins. But I think this doesn't in any way mean some huge moat for Bakkt (yet). Competition is intense across the crypto infrastructure sector, with incumbent players like Coinbase (via Coinbase Prime) and other well-funded private players like Fireblocks or Anchorage, who offer the same API integrations, custody, and stablecoin rails, fighting for the same clients as Bakkt. But in practice, Bakkt's relationship with ICE could potentially be an advantage for clients' trust and regulatory profile. Bottom Line Bakkt's restructuring seems like the best strategic reset the company has executed in years. Recent funds raised, including the $75 million capital infusion , also ease liquidity pressure and extend some runway for the company. Still, execution is key. Bakkt needs to sign anchor clients, scale take rates, maintain disciplined cost control moving forward, and find ways to integrate new products like the stablecoin rails without losing margin. I, personally, would not rate BKKT at the moment as a Buy for a crypto portfolio, but I think it is worth being on the watchlist for crypto investors. Swing traders will likely profit from the current price actions. Key metrics to watch will be whether Bakkt finalizes deals, how rapidly recurring revenue grows, how the take rate evolves versus the cost base, and whether it begins buying and holding Bitcoin under its new treasury strategy. Bakkt now holds a majority stake in the Japanese company Marusho Hotta and has bought the bitcoin[dot]jp domain name for the corporate treasury strategy. For now, BKKT's current price action really looks like the pattern of a relief rally in my view. Bakkt's streamlined business model is still a bet on execution. If it succeeds, Bakkt will likely punch higher above its current valuation.",ICE|BKKT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-15 12:00:00

Senator Lummis Says Hold",https://bitcoinist.com/did-us-stack-127000-bitcoin-senator-lummis/,"US Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) on Tuesday praised the Trump administration’s coordinated crackdown on the Prince Group, a Cambodia-based conglomerate that US authorities allege ran forced-labor “pig-butchering” cyber-fraud compounds and laundered criminal proceeds through bitcoin at unprecedented scale. A Win For The US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed an indictment charging Prince Group chairman Chen Zhi with wire-fraud and money-laundering conspiracies, while the Justice Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint against roughly 127,271 BTC—about $14–$15 billion at current prices—now in US government custody. The Treasury Department, in parallel, designated Prince Group a transnational criminal organization and moved to sever the Huione Group from the US financial system. “Another @POTUS win and a victory for human rights, financial integrity, and American leadership,” Lummis wrote on X. In a thread highlighting the size of the crypto takedown, she added: “The seizure of 127,000 bitcoin underscores two urgent priorities for Congress: first, passing clear digital asset market structure legislation to ensure law enforcement can act decisively against bad actors while protecting innovation… Second, codifying how seized bitcoin is stored, returned to victims, and safeguarded for future generations. Turning criminal proceeds into assets that strengthen America’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shows how sound policy can turn wrongdoing into lasting national value.” The underlying case is sprawling. Prosecutors say Chen directed Prince Group’s network of Cambodian compounds where trafficked workers—detained and abused—were forced to run online investment and romance-bait frauds, siphoning billions from US and global victims. The EDNY filing describes the bitcoin cache as proceeds and instrumentalities of the schemes that Chen previously controlled via unhosted wallets; it calls the action “the largest forfeiture action in the history of the Department of Justice.” The news ricocheted through crypto-forensics circles. Arkham, which tracks government-linked wallets, stated: “The US Government has submitted today a filing for the forfeiture of 127,271 $BTC… These Bitcoins are now confirmed to be under US Government control. It’s the largest forfeiture case of all time.” While on-chain analytics firms do not determine legal ownership, their confirmation that the assets moved to US-controlled addresses aligns with the Justice Department’s representations to the court and Treasury’s sanctions actions. Does The US Government Have To Sell? The immediate policy question for markets is whether the administration will sell—or hold—this bitcoin. Here, the answer is more constrained by law and process than by politics. The Trump White House’s March 6, 2025 executive order (EO 14233) , “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” created a framework under which the reserve is initially capitalized with bitcoin “owned by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty.” Under EO 14233, government BTC placed into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve “shall not be sold” except when the Treasury exercises its lawful stewardship authority, when a court orders disposal, or when the Attorney General or another agency head determines the assets (or proceeds) should be returned to identifiable victims, used for law-enforcement operations, equitably shared with state and local partners, or released to satisfy statutory requirements Thus, the legal sequencing matters. Tuesday’s 127,271 BTC is in government custody pending the outcome of the civil forfeiture case. Only after final forfeiture—through settlement or judgment—can the assets be disposed of or allocated under the EO’s hierarchy, which puts victim restitution first. Politically, Lummis is pushing for Congress to lock in the policy architecture she outlined on X: market-structure legislation that empowers decisive action against illicit finance without kneecapping innovation, and statutes that “codify how seized bitcoin is stored, returned to victims, and safeguarded for future generations.” That second plank is the legislative counterpart to EO 14233’s administrative framework. As for the market’s operative question—will the US under Trump sell this BTC?—the current signals point to restraint, not immediate liquidation. The DOJ has affirmed the bitcoin is in US custody while the case proceeds; the EO presumes reserve treatment for finally forfeited BTC after victim claims; and senior Republicans like Lummis are explicitly lobbying to embed that approach in statute. Until the court enters a final forfeiture order and victim restitution is addressed, there is nothing to sell.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan’s reference rate at 7.0995 per dollar, its strongest level in nearly a year, crossing the key 7.1 level that officials had been defending since September. The stronger fixing pushed the offshore yuan higher and slightly weakened the US dollar, proving that China is not backing off from its defense line. However, the latest decision breaks from what Beijing did during the last trade confrontation. At that time, it allowed the yuan to weaken to soften the impact of American tariffs. Now, officials are keeping the yuan steady to limit financial outflows, calm investor nerves, and back their long-running plan to make the currency more international . According to Bloomberg, analysts said the decision showed clear intent. “A fix below 7.10 sends a strong message of strength,” said Fiona Lim, senior foreign-exchange analyst at Malayan Banking in Singapore. “A strong yuan is symbolic of how China is in a position of strength for any negotiations or tit-for-tat escalations.” China changes its strategy as tensions rise The stronger reference rate fits into a clear pattern. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, including Danny Suwanapruti and Xinquan Chen, said China’s latest actions are “markedly different” from its earlier playbook. Instead of relying on a weaker currency to absorb shocks, policymakers are using monetary and fiscal measures to deal with economic pressure. “We continue to expect dollar-yuan to grind lower below 7,” Goldman Sachs analysts, including Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a note. “This yuan strengthening reflects a warranted appreciation after very significant real depreciation in recent years.” Under the current system, the PBOC only allows the yuan to move 2% up or down from the daily reference rate. Wednesday’s stronger fixing was meant to stop any speculation that the currency might slide further as trade tensions flared again. That tension intensified when President Donald Trump targeted cooking oil exports as his latest weapon after Beijing refused to buy US soybeans in response to sanctions placed on the American units of a South Korean shipping company, as Cryptopolitan reported . Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered, said the PBOC’s action was purely about keeping markets calm. Becky added that: “It will anchor yuan expectations and avoid a substantial rebound in volatility ahead of possibly more US-China headlines. The extremely strong strengthening bias in the recent fixing looks like a precautionary move to prevent a sharp move in markets, not an effort to smooth trade talks.” Beijing braces for key political meeting and economic headwinds China’s Communist Party will hold a closed-door meeting from October 20 to 23, where it will review China’s five-year development plan, and officials are known to tighten market controls before such events to prevent instability. The move to defend the yuan fits with that strategy. Still, the currency’s gains could hit a ceiling. Eddie Cheung, senior emerging markets strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, said his team expects “a ranged dollar-yuan” because both sides seem focused on avoiding big swings. Deflation pressure inside China and weaker domestic demand are likely to limit how far the yuan can climb. Others think the central bank’s changes are too small to make a real difference. Some traders argue that the PBOC’s adjustments aren’t big enough to suggest Beijing wants meaningful appreciation. They point out that ongoing trade tensions, the uncertain path of the US dollar, and China’s lower interest rates compared to the US are still serious obstacles. Analysts at Bank of America said investors are waiting for weaker inflation numbers and new fiscal stimulus before taking bigger positions in the yuan. They expect the yuan to end this year at 7.1 per dollar before appreciating to 6.7 in March 2027.

The project’s focus on cross-border payments earned it a spot among the most recognized names in crypto. But as the market evolves, new contenders are emerging, and one token in particular, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is drawing serious comparisons to Ripple’s early rise. XRP’s Journey and the $200 Billion Question XRP price has been testing crucial support levels. Currently, the cryptocurrency is holding steady around the $3 mark, which serves as a primary Fibonacci support level. According to crypto analyst Casitrades, the XRP price’s ability to maintain this level could indicate the potential for a more significant move to $200 million in the coming weeks. Analysts are wondering whether XRP can push toward a $200 billion market cap in the coming cycles. Yet, there’s a growing feeling among investors that XRP’s biggest gains might already be behind it. It’s a mature asset now, stable, trusted, but no longer the hidden gem it once was. That has left many investors searching for the next Ripple, something that offers life-changing upside early enough, but is credible enough to deliver real value. The Hunt For The Next Big Crypto Story LILPEPE is another meme token. But a closer look tells a different story. It’s currently in stage 13 of its presale, priced at $0.0022, and has already raised more than $26.9 million while selling over 16.4 million tokens. That’s not just investor curiosity, it’s conviction. LILPEPE’s momentum is reminiscent of early stage XRP, when a passionate community, a clear mission, and a strong token economy came together at the right moment. The excitement surrounding Little Pepe isn’t just about price action; it’s about timing and sentiment. The market is hungry for a fresh narrative, LILPEPE seems to fill that gap perfectly. Why LILPEPE Could Mirror XRP’s Early Momentum One of the biggest parallels between LILPEPE and XRP lies in their ability to build communities around clear, emotionally resonant ideas. Ripple spoke to banks and fintech innovators who wanted faster payments. Little Pepe speaks to retail traders who crave a sense of belonging, energy, and the thrill of early discovery. However, unlike many meme tokens that thrive solely on hype, LILPEPE has carefully built its tokenomics. The presale structure is attracting serious buyers who view it as more than just a short-term play. Crypto veterans often say, “The best trades are the ones nobody’s talking about yet.” LILPEPE is positioned to make that shift, transitioning from a niche presale to a token that has the potential to take over the conversations in social forums and trading. The interplay of narrative strength, retail attention, and healthy participation in the market may allow it to be one of the very few meme coins to change from being a simple meme to being a legitimate player in the ecosystem. What It Means for Investors If XRP does achieve its $200 billion market cap, it will likely cement its status as a stable, blue chip crypto asset. However, for investors seeking exponential growth, the returns may not match those enjoyed by early XRP holders. That’s where Little Pepe enters the conversation, as the fresh opportunity that still carries asymmetric potential. Those who recognize trends early know that market narratives evolve fast. Meme coins are no longer dismissed as jokes; they’re now central to crypto’s culture and liquidity. As more investors diversify from traditional projects into high-energy community tokens, LILPEPE could become a central story of this cycle. Conclusion XRP remains a cornerstone of the digital asset market, a project with strong foundations and clear use cases. But when it comes to the hunger for the next big thing, attention is shifting. Little Pepe’s presale success, community buzz, and growth potential suggest it might just be that next breakthrough story. If XRP defined the last era of institutional blockchain adoption, LILPEPE could define the next, where community, creativity, and accessible pricing drive a new wave of opportunity. For investors watching both, the real question isn’t whether XRP can reach $200 billion, but whether LILPEPE might write the next great chapter in crypto.

Central banks, once cautious of cryptocurrencies, are now exploring the very technologies that underpin them to modernize their monetary systems. As the race toward Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) accelerates, a familiar name has begun to re-emerge in European discussions — Ripple and its digital asset, XRP. The Banque de France and Its Digital Ambitions France’s central bank , the Banque de France, has been one of the earliest European institutions to experiment with blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since 2016, it has been testing blockchain to manage SEPA Credit Identifiers (SCIs). This move has enabled faster data sharing and automation through smart contracts. These experiments, now integrated into parts of the SEPA network, represent the bank’s long-term effort to explore how digital ledgers could enhance cross-border and interbank payments. In a document highlighted by crypto analyst SMQKE, references were made to ongoing CBDC research within the Banque de France. The report notes that the central bank is “actively considering” Ripple’s XRP as a potential technological foundation for a digital euro — a remarkable indication of how traditional finance is evaluating previously unconventional technologies. XRP Bank of France Documented. https://t.co/cNUB0LBw03 pic.twitter.com/mDzhhjQXTs — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 14, 2025 Ripple’s Technology and the CPA Australia Report A report by CPA Australia, titled “Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): A Comparative Review,” provides deeper insight into this consideration. The publication identifies Ripple as one of the most promising blockchain platforms for CBDC implementation. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Ripple’s XRP Ledger operates with a unique consensus mechanism designed for stability and efficiency — attributes that align well with the institutional requirements of a central bank digital currency. The report emphasizes that XRP’s infrastructure offers near-instant settlements, low transaction costs, and scalability, all of which are essential for a European digital currency capable of supporting millions of transactions daily. It contrasts XRP’s predictability and centralized governance with Bitcoin’s volatility, concluding that Ripple’s model fits more naturally with the design goals of a CBDC tied to fiat stability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Broader Global Trend Toward Blockchain Integration According to research cited by SMQKE from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the World Economic Forum , over 40 central banks globally are testing blockchain systems for CBDC development. The Banque de France is among the early pioneers, alongside the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This growing adoption underscores a clear direction: the future of money will be digital, and blockchain is poised to form the backbone of that evolution. The Bank of France’s application of blockchain within the SEPA framework already demonstrates tangible progress. By automating information exchange through smart contracts, the central bank has laid the groundwork for more complex DLT-driven systems — including a potential digital euro based on private blockchain infrastructure. XRP’s Strategic Advantage in the CBDC Race Ripple’s focus on institutional-grade payments makes it a strong candidate for partnership with central banks. The company’s technology supports interoperability between existing financial networks and future CBDC frameworks — a capability that few blockchain platforms can offer with similar efficiency. As SMQKE’s post underscores, this interoperability could be crucial in enabling seamless, borderless digital settlements across Europe and beyond. While the Banque de France has made no formal announcement regarding XRP’s adoption, credible reports and official documents confirm that Ripple’s technology remains under serious evaluation. This recognition signals not speculation, but a gradual convergence between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. The Banque de France’s exploration of XRP represents more than just a technological experiment — it marks a potential shift in the European financial landscape. By testing Ripple’s blockchain for payment efficiency and CBDC applications, France is positioning itself at the forefront of digital currency modernization. As global efforts toward CBDC development accelerate, XRP’s inclusion in these discussions reflects its growing legitimacy as a bridge between the old and new worlds of finance.

Verifiable computation’s long-term goal is to become the standard for integrating the broader internet with blockchain, aligning with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s vision of cost-effective and frequent validity proofs. Users may be able to leverage their collateral without bridging, improving liquidity and capital efficiency, when Ethereum embraces zero-knowledge proofs. Buterin envisions the ability to aggregate proofs from multiple rollups into a single proof, submitted once per slot, centralizing settlement activity on the base layer, reducing reliance on bridge operators, and enabling almost instant cross-rollup asset movement through Ethereum. The progress in reducing hardware demands and enhancing performance A recent breakthrough has tempered skepticism surrounding the current state of ZK technology. Brevis , an infrastructure provider powering smart, verifiable applications with zk proofs (ZKPs), has announced that its Pico Prism zkVM has achieved record proving coverage of 99.6% (below 12 seconds) and real-time proving coverage of 96.8% (below 10) for Ethereum blocks with a 45M gas limit. Among Pico Prism’s other improvements over existing solutions are $128,000 hardware cost vs $256,000, 64 RTX 5090 GPUs vs 160 RTX 4090 GPUs for comparable performance, 6.9-second average proving time for 45M gas blocks and 6.04 seconds for 36M gas blocks vs 10.3 seconds, and a performance improvement of 3.4x using combined cost efficiency and speed metrics. Pico Prism has moved to production-ready infrastructure, doing away with a critical bottleneck in Ethereum’s transition to base-layer zero-knowledge verification. GPU hardware costs are reduced by 50%, rendering real-time proving economically feasible for large-scale production deployment. Existing issues with scalability and economic viability Zk rollups like StarkNet, zkSync Era, and Polygon zkEVM compress thousands of Ethereum transactions into a single ZKP that proves their correctness, and generating one proof for a full Ethereum block (around 45M of gas) can take 10–20 seconds or longer, even on clusters with hundreds of GPUs or ASICs. Zk rollups depend on provers to generate state-transition proofs with multiple steps, under strict availability and finality constraints. These steps require GPUs and other expensive hardware, and the process reaches finality only after all stages are completed and results are posted on the blockchain. As rollups scale, it becomes harder to remain economically viable due to dynamic resource needs, demands for fast finality, and rising throughput. A recent study based on Halo2 proving systems demonstrated these challenges, identifying finality time, average gas usage, and transactions per second as leading cost drivers. Researchers proposed a cost model capturing rollup-specific limitations and ensuring provers keep up with transaction loads to address these drivers. They formulated a model as a constraint system and found cost-optimal configurations using the Z3 SMT solver. Memory constraints Many existing zkVMs still require at least ten seconds per proof and face memory and scaling constraints, with some requiring up to 82 seconds. Proof generation times increase more or less linearly with input size, with corresponding increases of the Fibonacci input from the 10th to the 100,000th term . GPU implementations tend to demonstrate reduced host memory use (CPU) but consume significant GPU memory, with the benchmarked GPU-accelerated projects requiring VRAM of at least 24GB. Improvements in memory efficiency frequently result from implementing continuation and similar techniques, using smaller cryptographic fields, and adopting more efficient memory-checking arguments, such as polynomial IOPs. Depending on the specific zkVM, memory constraints can be due to the lookup table multivariate polynomial extension and Merkle Tree construction. When it comes to CPU limitations, constraints involve polynomial commitment schemes and proof recursion. Performance and security tradeoffs Another concern with optimizing zkVMs exclusively for performance involves security guarantees. Some zkVM projects lack comprehensive security validation because they are still in development or for other reasons. Evaluations of zkVMs should incorporate security maturity, including rigorous safety proofs, completed third-party audits, and formal verification efforts, to provide a comprehensive analysis. Brevis leverages ZKPs to transfer expensive blockchain computations to a more affordable off-chain environment, maintaining L1 security assumptions while allowing Web3 apps to scale faultlessly. ZKPs’ road to simplicity, efficiency, and scalability Proofs are created in multiple stages, including elliptic curve operations, calculating hash functions, intermediate proofs, and more. Given the myriad ZKP techniques with distinct qualities, the ideal approach depends on system specifications and the application in question. ZK-STARKs and ZK-SNARKs are examples of different ZKP system variants. The former are more suitable for complex applications, while the latter tend to work better for private transactions. Moreover, cryptographic standards evolve over time, and ZKP systems should be able to adapt to these changes without major functional disruptions. On the subject of elliptic curve operations, schemes that rely on BN254 or other elliptic-curve pairings are not quantum-secure. It’s necessary to replace the underlying elliptic curve with a post-quantum alternative, such as hash- or lattice-based constructions. Scaling problems arise in systems with large query or transaction volumes as complicated computing procedures are used to create and verify ZKPs. A prominent example of a scaling problem goes back to the launch of Zcash, when each private transaction required generating a zk-SNARK proof on a personal computer. A single proof could take tens of seconds to generate and use over 3GB of RAM; many devices couldn’t handle the computation, and most transactions remained non-private because shielded transactions were too slow, running counter to the cryptocurrency’s nature. Pico makes zero-knowledge cryptography more scalable, efficient, and adaptable by allowing developers to customize their proving mechanisms.

The terminal, located in Shandong province, manages nearly 10% of China’s total oil imports and is a vital hub for Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. The sudden blacklisting, announced last week by Washington, has already started to reshape shipping routes and threaten production at several state-run refineries. Two of the very large crude carriers, Spherical and New Vista, are now heading to Ningbo Zhoushan near Shanghai. The Spherical carries about 2 million barrels of Brazilian oil, while the New Vista holds 1.8 million barrels from Abu Dhabi. The third vessel, Habshan, transporting 1.9 million barrels from Africa, has shifted toward Tianjin in northern China. All three ships had initially signaled Rizhao as their destination before the sanctions order was made public. US measures hit Sinopec’s refining network The Rizhao Shihua terminal, partly owned by Sinopec, connects to multiple refineries across Shandong through a long pipeline network. The blacklisting came after the facility was accused of handling shipments linked to Iran, a direct violation of American sanctions. Data reviewed by Bloomberg reportedly shows that the terminal brought in over 1 million barrels per day of crude last year, with 189,000 barrels traced to Iran. Analysts at Energy Aspects predict that the disruption could cut refinery runs by as much as 250,000 barrels per day, affecting operations at several key plants. Sinopec’s Luoyang refinery, which processes around 200,000 barrels per day, is expected to take the biggest hit, given its heavy dependence on crude arriving through Rizhao’s pipeline. Other connected sites, like Yangzi and Jinling refineries, could also see short-term slowdowns as supply tightens. “The main impact falls on state-run refiners that receive non-sanctioned crude through the terminal, as sanctioned oil accounts for less than 25% of the terminal’s crude imports,” said Emma Li, senior market analyst at Vortexa. Tankers change destinations as rerouting accelerates Bloomberg’s tracking data show that tankers began changing course immediately after the sanctions were announced. Early Monday, Spherical switched from Rizhao to Caofeidian in Hebei province. Meanwhile, other vessels waiting offshore near Shandong have either turned off tracking signals or are now heading for Ningbo and Tianjin, avoiding any risk tied to the blacklisted terminal. Unlike previous trade wars that targeted small independent “teapot” refiners, this round directly hits Sinopec, a state-owned energy giant that serves as China’s biggest oil importer. As well as being routed to different ports, oil that was headed to Rizhao could also be offloaded onto smaller ships to be taken to Sinopec refineries along the Yangtze River that get their oil via the pipeline from the terminal in Shandong, Energy Aspects said in a note last week. Traders are expected to reroute most cargoes to nearby ports in Zhoushan, Ningbo, and Tianjin, helping to ease the disruption but still slowing refinery throughput in the short term. Energy Aspects also said that the overall effect on China’s oil demand should be temporary, as rerouting capacity expands and replacement berths are secured. But the sanctions have temporarily removed a terminal responsible for nearly one-tenth of the nation’s oil imports, an abrupt reminder that geopolitical decisions in Washington can upend cargo movements across China’s coast overnight.

Super mega bullish for Bitcoin and alts. pic.twitter.com/EBS3Jn5kxJ — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) October 14, 2025 ‘Giant Exchanges Blocking Small Orders’ Following a record-breaking crypto selloff, Przemyslaw Kral, CEO of zondacrypto , commented that “last weekend highlighted not just why you should approach crypto with caution and market knowledge, but also why regulation is so important.” Kral argued that “all cars require airbags for safety during crashes, just as all crypto exchanges need strong regulation to ensure greater stability when markets turn volatile. Some argue regulation is boring and stifling. But we have seen giant exchanges blocking small orders, restricting trading during big market moves, and they’re now facing hundreds of millions in compensation claims.” This is why the development of more stable and transparent products needs support, even if these products “take more time and are less flashy.” “The crypto industry must actively choose to leave chaos behind. It needs more responsible builders who are committed to long-term thinking. The industry must also prioritize education and develop community resources to support market resilience.” Meanwhile, analysts over at Glassnode found that “traders remain positioned for upside,” as signaled by BTC Options markets showing net premium concentration at $115,000–$130,000. $BTC Options markets show net premium concentration at $115k–$130k, suggesting traders remain positioned for upside.

It started the day with the intraday low of $110,256, rising to the day’s highest point of $113,537. At the moment, it’s trading relatively sideways. The price may move toward $114,000, after which it may target $119,800. A close above $120,000 would once again open doors for the $125,000 and $130,000 levels. On the other side, if it continues decreasing, BTC could revisit $109,500 and lower. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently trading at $4,159. The coin’s lowest point today was $3,905, after which it surged to the intraday high of $4,203. That said, like BTC, it has been trading sideways for much of the last 24 hours. ETH could rise above $4,200 and move towards the $4,350 and $4,500 levels. However, should it go back into the red, the price could decrease below $3,900 and, subsequently, move towards $3,750.

The crypto market has increased over the past day, and the stock market saw a mixed picture on Tuesday. By the closing time on 14 October, the S&P 500 was down by 0.16%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.69%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.44%. The stock market has seen increased volatility due to the trade uncertainty created by the US, particularly in regards to China. Is this rally sustainable?

Countries around the globe keep a close watch on the American economy because what takes place there affects their own situations. Without access to regular updates from the United States , foreign policymakers say their jobs become harder and the chance of making wrong choices goes up during a period when nations are already dealing with changes brought by the Trump White House’s new approach to international commerce. “It’s a serious problem. We hope this gets fixed soon,” Kazuo Ueda, who runs Japan’s central bank, said at a press conference on October 3. He talked about the difficulties his institution faces when trying to figure out the right time to raise borrowing costs. A different Japanese official, speaking to Reuters anonymously due to restrictions on public commentary, offered a more direct critique. The official expressed skepticism about the situation, questioning Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s repeated assertions that Fed policy decisions are driven by economic data, arguing that reliable data to base such decisions on is actually lacking British policymaker warns of ‘termites’ eating dollar’s status Catherine Mann, who helps set policy at England’s central bank, explained that questions about American information don’t affect British decisions as directly as shifts in commerce policy do. Those changes have a direct impact on costs and what the country sells abroad. However, she pointed out how Britain’s currency lost its top position in the world over many years. She compared policy changes that might hurt the dollar’s standing or weaken the Fed’s freedom to “termites” that slowly damage something over time. These issues “are things that we have in our mind but they’re not front and center,” Mann said. Leaders from finance ministries and economic agencies worldwide gathered in Washington this week for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings. With ongoing war in Europe, trouble in the Middle East, and long-term challenges like climate change, much of the discussion centers on President Donald Trump’s global plans, how he’s performed so far, and the sudden halt of official information about a $30 trillion economy that makes up roughly one-fourth of what the world produces. Shutdown symptoms point to deeper problems The shutdown might end anytime and information could start flowing again. But the situation shows deeper problems with American governance and whether data can be trusted. Trump has tried to gain more control over the Federal Reserve and removed the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after getting angry about a jobs report. The IMF listed this among the “downside risks” the world faces right now. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, published Tuesday, cautioned that growing political interference with policy institutions threatens to undermine the public credibility they have worked hard to establish in carrying out their responsibilities. The report further noted that when agencies responsible for gathering statistical information face such pressure, it risks damaging both public and market confidence in government-provided data. This would make the work of central banks and other policymakers considerably more difficult when formulating policy. Additionally, if political meddling compromises the accuracy, dependability, and promptness of data, the chances of flawed policy decisions increase substantially. Not everything has gone dark. The Federal Reserve, which pays for itself and isn’t touched by the shutdown, keeps surveying its wide network of contacts. Private services offer alternatives that officials have learned to piece together, though these aren’t perfect. The IMF cut its global growth forecast by half a percentage point to 2.8% in April. In Tuesday’s update, the fund revised this to 3.2% for the year. The report found “a significant, though not massive, impact of shifting policies on the economic outlook.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Economy|BoJ|EUR|Federal Reserve|JPY|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 13:24:12

The GENIUS Act introduces federal oversight for stablecoin issuers, requiring 100% cash or Treasury reserves and monthly public disclosures. This could mark the start of ‘Stablecoin Season,’ as regulated issuers bridge the gap between banks and blockchain payments. Best Wallet ($BEST) stands to benefit, offering users secure custody, presale access, and up to 80% APY staking rewards. Stablecoins are going legit, and pretty fast. Stripe’s stablecoin arm, Bridge, just filed an application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to form a national trust bank under the newly enacted GENIUS Act . It’s the latest move in what’s shaping up to be ‘Stablecoin Season’: a full-blown regulatory sprint to bring digital dollars under federal oversight. If approved, Bridge’s charter would let Stripe issue, redeem, and custody stablecoins directly under the OCC, instead of juggling dozens of state-level money-transmitter licenses. That means its entire stablecoin business would sit under on federal framework, complete with 100% cash or Treasury-backed reserves and monthly public disclosures, as required by the GENIUS Act. Bridge now joins Circle ($USDC), Ripple ($RLUSD), Paxos ($USDP), and Coinbase ($COIN) in chasing national trust licenses – a race that marks a historic pivot for the US digital asset market. Together, these firms are positioning stablecoins as the regulated backbone of global payments, rather than gray-zone fintech experiments. The timing makes sense. Stablecoins already account for over $315B in circulating value , and Standard Chartered analysts estimate they could pull $1T in deposits away from traditional banks over the next three years. For users and merchants, that shift would make stablecoins the default settlement rail of the internet. They’re faster, cheaper, and now, finally, compliant. For Striple, Bridge isn’t just about compliance; it’s also an infrastructure play. The company recently unveiled Open Issuance, a service that helps apps launch their own stablecoins using Bridge’s back-end.Wallets like Phantom ($CASH), MetaMask ($mUSD), and Hyperliquid ($USDH) already rely on Bridge as their issuance partner. All signs point to a regulated on-chain economy, where digital dollars move under federal supervision and mainstream adoption finally takes hold. So the real question for investors becomes: if stablecoins are about to become the rails of this new system, which tokens will capture user flow at the edge? That’s where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) enters the picture, powering one of the fastest-growing Web3 wallets built to bridge the gap between regulated stablecoins and everyday users. From Stablecoins to Wallet Wars – the New On-Ramp Race The race for federal trust charters isn’t just about who prints the next digital dollar; it’s about who controls the gateway to it. Stripe, Circle, Ripple, and Coinbase are fighting for issuance and compliance. But at the user level, a different war is breaking out… the battle for wallets. Under the new GENIUS framework, stablecoins can finally plug into traditional finance with clear oversight from the OCC. That unlocks direct settlement with banks, cross-chain interoperability, and compliant collateral for lending protocols. This is the pipeline for a regulated DeFi economy. And this is where crypto wallets come in. They’re no longer just storage apps. They’ve become super apps. MetaMask now offers staking, Phantom integrates stablecoin rails, and new players like Best Wallet are going further by blending payments, presales, and rewards inside one secure, Fireblocks-powered interface. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Token Fueling a Web3 Super App Built for the Stablecoin Era As stablecoins edge closer to federal recognition, wallet ecosystems are becoming the frontlines of adoption. Best Wallet is positioning itself at that intersection as a non-custodial wallet app that merges security, yield, and discovery into one seamless platform. Built on Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP framework, the same institutional-grade tech used by major custodians, Best Wallet offers users secure on-chain control without sacrificing usability. It’s a place to store tokens, buy into new crypto presales , stake assets, and soon, spend crypto cash through the Best Card. That card will deliver cashback and fee discounts to anyone staking the native $BEST token . And that token is what powers the entire ecosystem. Holding $BEST unlocks reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and early access to new token launches through the in-app ‘Upcoming Tokens’ feature. Discover how to buy Best Wallet Token in our step-by-step walkthrough. The project has drawn over 57K followers on X and raised $16.5M so far in the presale. Tokens are priced at $0.025795, and with ambitions to capture 40% of the crypto-wallet market by the end of 2026, you can see why we a Best Wallet Token price prediction of $0.05106175 is not unreasonable. As stablecoins come under the OCC’s watch, wallets integrating compliant rails and institutional security will stand out. Best Wallet is built precisely for that world, connecting regulated stablecoin infrastructure with DeFi native opportunities. In that sense, the GENIUS Act sets the stage for wallets like Best Wallet to become the banks of the future, Join the $BEST presale and stake now for up to 80% APY.

He also pointed to recently deleted SEC text messages as evidence of misconduct. SBF Claims Political Setup Sam Bankman-Fried, the imprisoned founder of the defunct FTX exchange, reignited controversy by alleging that his 2022 arrest was politically motivated by the Biden administration. In a post that was shared on GETTR , Bankman-Fried claimed that after shifting his political donations from Democrats to Republicans in 2022, he became a target of regulatory enforcement from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). He said he moved from being “center-left” in 2020 to “centrist” in 2022 after witnessing what he described as “anti-crypto” actions under SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the DOJ. According to his account, he was arrested “weeks before the crypto bill I was working on was set for a vote — and the night before I was set to testify before Congress.” SBF’s post on GETTR At the time, House Republicans questioned the timing of his arrest, and suggested it may have been an attempt to prevent his testimony. They also demanded that Gensler release internal communications related to the case. Bankman-Fried claimed those messages have since been “conveniently lost.” His statement was made after a recent report from the SEC’s Office of Inspector General, which confirmed that Gensler’s government-issued phone underwent an automated data wipe, which erased all text messages between October of 2022 and September of 2023 . Interestingly, this was a period when the SEC pursued high-profile enforcement actions against firms like Coinbase and Binance. After his December 2022 arrest in the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States and convicted in November 2023 on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy for misappropriating billions in FTX customer funds. He is serving a 25-year prison sentence while appealing his conviction. Bankman-Fried and his family continue to maintain his innocence and have sought clemency from President Donald Trump, who recently pardoned Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 13:30:00

However, there is still a lot of struggle between the bulls and the bears when it comes to the direction that the Ethereum price could be headed next. To this effect, an analyst has pointed out some interesting formations on the Ethereum chart, and what could trigger a rally to $14,000. Two Things Must Become Bullish For The Ethereum Price Crypto analyst Without Worries outlined that there are two questions that Ethereum investors must ask in order to determine if the price has turned bullish or not. The first of these questions centers around the current trend, asking whether it is bearish or bullish . The analyst explains that with the break of $1,600 and the Ethereum price moving higher back in April, the trend has turned more positive from here. Hence, as long as this is maintained, then the trend does indeed remain bullish, leading to the second and most important question. This question centers on the Ethereum price action, and the problem here is that the altcoin continues to trade under resistance . This major resistance lies at the $4,400 level, with the digital asset having been rejected from this level multiple times in the past. From this, the crypto analyst tells investors to keep an eye on the 2-week chart for confirmation. The Ethereum price would have to break out above $4,400 and then clear $4,500 with a decisive move. This means that sharp price wicks do not count. But if this resistance breakout is completed and support is confirmed, then the Ethereum price could continue to rise until $14,000 . There is also the fact that the Ethereum price is on the verge of completing another 2-month candle. The analyst points out that the price resistance for this trend is at $3,400, which is coincidentally the low for the liquidation event that occurred last Friday. Thus, it remains a decisive support point for the price. On an important note, the analyst points out that if the Ethereum price is able to complete its 2-month candle above $4,400 by the end of October, then it also confirms that price action is positive and the price could continue to climb. However, this means that in the event that the price fails to actually surmount $4,400 on both the 2-week and 2-month charts, then it could put the bears back in control of the price. A turn toward the negative could confirm that the decline could deepen. “Positive answers to questions one and two are a green light for a long entry. And more importantly, a cancellation of the bearish idea,” the analyst said.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 13:30:12

Versan Aljarah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, presented a direct stance that challenges previous narratives, which downplay the importance of price. The message is centered on institutional infrastructure, liquidity efficiency, and the role of XRP in large-scale financial flows. Rather than addressing short-term fluctuations, the focus is on structural requirements tied to adoption. They told you XRP doesn’t need a high price, they lied. At the scale of adoption, liquidity management requires a high-value XRP to efficiently move institutional capital and settle cross-border payments at a global scale. Featuring insights from @DigitalOutlook3 Watch the… pic.twitter.com/PAgOocqdkN — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 13, 2025 Liquidity as a Functional Requirement The core claim made is that a low-value XRP cannot realistically sustain the liquidity demands associated with institutional settlement. The suggestion is that once financial institutions operate at scale on any settlement asset, the price must reflect that responsibility. It is argued that cross-border settlement involving substantial capital cannot rely on an asset that lacks the depth and valuation needed to absorb and clear transactions without friction. Black Swan Capitalist emphasizes that the future role of XRP, if it is to function as a serious settlement instrument, requires a valuation that supports institutional-grade liquidity. This argument moves away from speculation and places valuation as a prerequisite for performance in high-value corridors. Insights from the Attached Video In the attached video, the speaker known as Versan stated that holding XRP is equivalent to securing a position within an evolving financial infrastructure. He explained that as XRP becomes embedded in the movement of hundreds of trillions in value, price escalation should be viewed as a direct outcome of its utility. According to this perspective, price is not the starting point, but the result of becoming essential to real-time global settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Digital Outlook contributed by addressing frequently raised questions about high price targets. When asked about the possibility of XRP reaching figures such as $1,000, he acknowledged it as feasible while clarifying that the value of such a figure depends on the point in time it is achieved. Institutional Considerations Another user, Roman Trotsko, added further context by focusing on institutional behavior. He noted that institutions do not adopt settlement solutions that introduce friction, and any technology intended for large-scale integration must provide seamless liquidity. According to this line of reasoning, XRP’s architecture is built to enable such performance. But full functionality would be contingent on adequate valuation supporting deep liquidity pools. Black Swan Capitalist’s message shifts attention from speculative sentiment to functionality. The perspectives featured in the discussion present price appreciation as an outcome tied to real-world integration, where liquidity, scale, and reliability dictate value.

The SEC filing , dated October 14, outlines a robust operational structure, with BitGo tapped as custodian, Valkyrie Funds LLC stepping in as seed capital investor, and CSC Delaware Trust Company serving as trustee. U.S. Bancorp Fund Services will act as administrator, U.S. Bank NA as cash custodian, and Paralel Distributors as the marketing agent. Notably, the trust will not participate in staking, meaning investors will gain exposure strictly to XRP’s spot price rather than any additional yield. “Our mission is to make XRP accessible to institutional investors in the U.S., with a fully compliant, transparent, and secure framework,” a CoinShares spokesperson said, framing the move as a milestone for both the firm and the broader digital asset ecosystem. SEC faces pending spot XRP ETF decisions The timing is striking. The SEC faces a flurry of pending spot XRP ETF decisions, with Grayscale’s application up for judgment this week, followed closely by CoinShares, 21Shares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Canary Capital between October 18 and 25. Thus, the coming days could prove pivotal for XRP’s long-term positioning in U.S. markets. Markets have already begun to react. XRP climbed 3.23% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2.49, lifting its market capitalization to $149.24 billion. This marked a sharp rebound from an intraday low of $144.37 billion, translating into nearly $5 billion in inflows, even as daily trading volumes contracted by more than 27% to $5.96 billion. XRP 1-day market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The rally stands in contrast to XRP’s broader downtrend, with the token still off 12.9% over seven days and 16.4% across the past month. Part of the uptick can be traced to deepening institutional engagement. CME Group launched XRP options on October 15, with Wintermute and Galaxy executing the inaugural trades, signaling a new layer of liquidity and hedging demand for the asset. Ripple, meanwhile, has expanded its footprint in Africa through a partnership with Absa Bank, providing crypto custody solutions that may further bolster long-term adoption narratives. Technically, XRP’s bounce came at a crucial juncture. Prices rebounded from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2.52, a zone that many traders had earmarked as key support.

The firm plans to begin testing its vehicles on London roads in the coming months, with trained safety personnel behind the wheel during the initial phase. If everything goes according to plan and the company secures necessary approvals from regulators and government officials, paying customers could start using the service sometime next year. Waymo has been growing fast back home The service now operates commercially in five cities in the US, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta. The company has also revealed intentions to bring its robotaxis to Washington, D.C and Miami. In August, Waymo received permits allowing it to test its self-driving cars with safety drivers in New York City. London represents Waymo’s second city outside the United States, following Tokyo, where the company kicked off testing earlier in 2025. For the London rollout, Waymo will use Jaguar iPACE electric cars fitted with its Waymo Driver technology. The company already has engineering staff working in London and Oxford. Waymo plans to partner with Moove, a company that offers vehicle financing to drivers and handles tasks like charging, cleaning, and repairs for ride-hailing companies including Uber and Waymo. Uber has also invested in Moove recently. The timing aligns with recent changes in British policy. In June, the United Kingdom government introduced a faster approval process for self-driving car companies wanting to run commercial trials, hoping to attract investment in autonomous vehicle technology. Waymo points to its safety data as a selling point Based on the company’s own data analysis, its technology gets into injury-causing crashes five times less often than human drivers. The difference is even more dramatic for accidents involving pedestrians, where Waymo claims its vehicles have 12 times fewer injury-causing incidents compared to human drivers. The company has already accumulated significant data in its favor. Waymo reports its autonomous vehicles have driven 100 million miles on public roads without a human driver, and have given more than 10 million paid trips to customers. The company operates under Alphabet’s “Other Bets” division, which generated $373 million in revenue during the second quarter. Alphabet is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on October 29. Waymo won’t be alone in London. Wayve, a British startup with backing from Microsoft and SoftBank, previously said it would launch its own robotaxi trial in London next year. However, Wayve uses a different technical approach, relying on cameras rather than the radar, lidar and advanced sensors that Waymo employs. This camera-based method resembles Tesla’s strategy for autonomous driving. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

But Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes it may ultimately reaffirm the strength of the ongoing bull market. The exec recounted the chain of events that sent crypto prices spiraling late last week, only to watch them rebound almost as quickly – although, admittedly, not to the same extent. Nothing Fundamental Changed The sudden drop came after former US President Donald Trump threatened China with sweeping 100% tariffs on all imports in response to Beijing’s move to restrict exports of rare earth metals. With equity markets closed, traders sought a real-time reaction mechanism and turned to crypto. Within minutes, Bitcoin plunged by as much as 15%, and altcoins, led by Solana, saw declines of up to 40%. Nearly $20 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in the largest such event in crypto’s history, which ended up amplifying the sell-off through cascading liquidations. Despite this, most crypto assets partially recovered after the US administration softened its stance. According to Hougan, the key question is whether the episode was a fleeting blip or a signal of more profound structural weakness. The exec found that nothing fundamental to crypto’s outlook changed, while citing the market’s underlying technology, security, and regulatory progress. Hougan outlined three questions Bitwise uses to assess whether a market shock has lasting implications. These are whether any major institutions collapsed, how blockchain systems performed under stress, and whether investor panic reached systemic levels. None of those red flags appeared. No major firms or market makers failed, and most losses were confined to retail traders who had taken highly leveraged positions. Technologically, decentralized platforms such as Uniswap, Aave, and Hyperliquid continued operating as usual without disruption. Centralized venues did experience some turbulence. Binance, for instance, refunded traders on a few separate occasions. But overall, the crypto markets held up as well or better than traditional ones might have in similar conditions. Professional players largely ignored the event, in what appears to be a vote of confidence in the asset class’s long-term trajectory. That steadiness, he argued, indicates how far crypto markets have matured from the days when similar volatility would spark panic. The broader picture also remains encouraging. Bitcoin has gained 21% so far in 2025, and Bitwise’s Large Cap Crypto Index is up 22%. While short-term volatility may continue as liquidity providers and market makers temporarily step back, Hougan believes the market will soon stabilize. “But over time, I expect the market will catch its breath and renew its attention on crypto’s fundamentals. When that happens, I think the bull market will continue apace.” Bitcoin Still Far from Peak Euphoria According to on-chain research by CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio is currently near 2.0. This level has historically represented mid-cycle conditions rather than extreme valuations. The ratio remains comfortably below the 4.0 range reached during prior bull market peaks, while still above the sub-1.0 levels seen in major accumulation periods. As such, long-term holders are refraining from heavy selling, and institutional ETF inflows continue to provide support. Miner activity has also softened, which points to reduced supply pressure. These trends indicate that Bitcoin is consolidating within a constructive, mid-phase market environment rather than approaching an overheated or cyclical peak.

At the time of writing, the token is priced at $2.53, up 2% in the past 24 hours, though still down 12% over the past week, based on CoinGecko data. Pattern Suggests Two Possible Scenarios Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO pointed to a descending broadening wedge on the chart. Based on this structure, there is a 57% chance of a break to the upside and a 43% chance of a move lower. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X If the lower outcome plays out, EGRAG mentioned a possible retest of the $0.50 area, based on measured move projections. On the other side, a successful breakout to the upside could take the price toward the $9 region. They also referenced earlier trades where some sold around $2.70 to $2.80, and XRP is now sitting near $2.50 to $2.60. EGRAG noted, “If you want to sell now, go ahead, no hard feelings… Just don’t come back to me later saying you wish you had sold.” Long-Term Structure Still Holds Analyst ChartingGuy shared a monthly chart showing that XRP is still trading above the $1.61 support. This level lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement and a former resistance zone from 2021. While Ripple’s token recently failed to hold above $3.31, the 0.886 Fibonacci level, it continues to print higher lows. Notably, the same chart shows potential future levels near $3.31, $8, $13, and $27, based on standard Fibonacci extensions. These levels may act as price targets if XRP holds its current structure. Referring to the larger time frame view, ChartingGuy said, $XRP is NOT bearish in the slightest pic.twitter.com/ZZ3ILgSfaG — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) October 14, 2025 Whale Activity Linked to October Drop As reported by CryptoPotato , large wallets began moving XRP to Binance in the first half of October. This followed a quiet period in September. The timing of these transfers matched a 20% drop in price, adding pressure during the decline. Meanwhile, open interest across XRP futures fell sharply from $9 billion to around $4.17 billion. This move came as broader crypto markets saw forced selling and deleveraging across several major tokens. Partnership Announcement Supports Sentiment Ripple confirmed a new partnership with Immunefi, launching a security testing program for the XRP Ledger. The test includes a $200,000 bug bounty, set to run from October 27 to November 24. This announcement came as XRP slid through key levels, offering a short-term lift in sentiment.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the billionaire described Bitcoin as the only financial system “based on energy” rather than politics or policy. Responding to financial outlet Zerohedge, which linked the global AI race to growing demand for hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin, Musk wrote: “Bitcoin is based on energy. You can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it’s impossible to fake energy.” His comment quickly went viral, surpassing 4.5 million views, and reignited discussion about Bitcoin’s scarcity model. Musk’s energy-based framing reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a scarce, verifiable digital asset, unlike fiat currencies that can be expanded indefinitely by central banks. True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2025 Market observers said Musk’s remarks arrived at a key moment for investors navigating persistent inflation and tightening global liquidity. By labeling Bitcoin as a “proof-of-energy” system, Musk effectively tied its long-term value to the measurable energy and computational work required to mine it, a concept gaining traction as AI infrastructure drives global power demand higher. Bitcoin’s Macro Narrative Strengthens Elon Musk’s endorsement reinforces the link between energy, scarcity, and digital value. As nations expand AI infrastructure, energy has become a new measure of economic power, and Bitcoin is built on that foundation. Each Bitcoin requires measurable computational work, giving it real production cost and scarcity. This proof-of-work mechanism anchors its value in energy, much like gold’s link to extraction effort, but with global mobility. That energy tie and capped supply help explain Bitcoin’s resilience and long-term outperformance. With inflation elevated and public debt climbing, institutions increasingly see Bitcoin as digital hard money, value secured by energy, not policy. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: Triple Bottom Signals Reversal On the technical front , Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades near $111,800, stabilizing after forming a triple-bottom pattern between $109,600 and $110,000, a key demand zone that has consistently drawn buyers. The setup often precedes a reversal, especially as momentum indicators turn positive. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC remains within a descending channel, with immediate resistance at $116,400, aligning with the 100-SMA and 50% Fibonacci retracement. A breakout above this zone could open a path toward $119,800 and $123,000. Bitcoin holds near $111.8K, forming a potential triple-bottom around $109.6K–$110K. A breakout above $116.4K (100-SMMA & 50% Fib) could confirm reversal toward $119.8K–$123K. RSI flattening signals early bullish divergence. #BTC pic.twitter.com/Lgb1z0Hrf4 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 15, 2025 The RSI near 40.5 signals fading bearish momentum, with early signs of bullish divergence emerging. A confirmed close above $114,600 may trigger renewed buying, targeting $125,000. Sustained strength above $109,600 would validate this bullish scenario, potentially marking the beginning of Bitcoin’s next accumulation phase, one that could, over time, set the stage for Musk’s $1 million Bitcoin vision.

The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013115 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

The company stated that the industry-wide initiative utilizes the Web Bot Auth protocol, enabling AI agents to shop at millions of merchants worldwide. The leading connectivity cloud company previously partnered with Visa to develop and introduce the Trusted Agent Protocol. The new protocol enables payment platforms to integrate Web Bot Auth, allowing merchants to securely and transparently engage with the next generation of AI shopping agents. Cloudflare’s protocol allows merchants to engage with AI shopping agents 🚨This just in from #CloudflareConnect ! 🚨 We’ve partnered with @Visa and the broader payment ecosystem to help bring agentic commerce to millions of merchants worldwide. Read more here: https://t.co/Rca9MsFBU7 pic.twitter.com/yRGVAjebw3 — Cloudflare (@Cloudflare) October 14, 2025 Visa said it’s incorporating the new AI protocols into its agentic payment platform, Visa Intelligence Commerce. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Cloudflare and Coinbase unveiled a new x402 protocol in July to enable digital agents and AI systems to make real-time payments using a shared format. Forestell, Chief Product and Strategy Officer at Visa, stated that a new era of commerce is emerging as AI agents begin to transact on behalf of consumers, which requires trust, transparency, security, and industry collaboration. Cloudflare also collaborated with Mastercard and American Express to integrate Web Bot Auth into both payment networks. Mastercard said it’s integrating the protocol into Mastercard Agent Pay to enable merchants to identify trusted agents and deliver secure , personalized agentic commerce capabilities easily. Jorn Lambert, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard, acknowledged that the collaboration with Cloudflare simplifies agent verification for merchants and ensures a unified approach to agentic commerce that is scalable, secure, and widely adopted. American Express maintained that it will also incorporate Web Bot Auth for agentic commerce initiatives. Cloudflare added that AI agents built with its Agents SDK will soon be able to use the Trusted Agent Protocol to shop autonomously at millions of merchants globally. EVP & head of global innovation at American Express, Luke Gebb, said the firm plans to utilize Cloudflare’s Web Bot Auth to help merchants identify trusted agents and deliver a secure agentic commerce experience. Web Bot Auth helps merchants determine intent of agent traffic Cloudflare revealed that Web Bot Auth allows bots and agents to authenticate themselves for use in agentic commerce. The firm added that the use of bots in the Trusted Agent Protocol helps merchants determine the identity and intent of agent traffic. The Trusted Agent Protocol also enables merchants to securely accept any payment method from an agent, including credit, debit, cryptocurrency, and other methods. According to Cloudflare , Web Bot Auth creates an authentication layer through compatibility and interoperability with all major agent-based frameworks, empowering merchants and developers to deploy agentic commerce at Internet scale safely. Stephanie Cohen, Chief Strategy Officer at Cloudflare, argued that the future of commerce is agentic, and the firm is building the trusted foundation for it. She also argued that the company’s global network positions it to enable trust protocols that allow AI agents to transact safely and unlock the next era of digital commerce. Cloudflare said Web Bot Auth will help payment companies understand customers’ intent to gather product details or purchase an item or service. Web Bot Auth will also help payment firms maintain personal relationships with customers. Cloudflare acknowledged that the initiative will help merchants determine if a customer has an existing account or shopping history, even if an agent is initiating a purchase on the customer’s behalf. Web Bot Auth will also help merchants process payments from agents using various payment methods, including crypto, credit, debit, and others, to complete a purchase.

XRP Bull Run To $26 Still Possible? On the current monthly candle, XRP is trading at $2.4477 with 17 days and 10 hours left in the period after printing an open at $2.8467, high at $3.1037, and low at $1.5800, down 14.0% month-to-date. The rejection zone is precise: a horizontal line marks the 1.000 Fibonacci retracement at $3.3170, which aligns with the 2018 cycle peak and has capped the last several tops in 2025. Just below, the chart includes a 0.888 retracement band (approximately $2.96) that has acted as near-term resistance during this three-month range between roughly $2.10–$3.30. Under price, confluence is building at the former breakout shelf from the 2021 surge. A lime-green box highlights the $1.60–$1.80 area, overlapping directly with the 0.786 retracement at $1.6125 and the top of the 2021 congestion. This band caught last week’s deep wick to $1.58 and, in prior months, has served as a staging area for rebounds. The next staircase of support below is marked by the 0.702 at $1.2149, the 0.618 at $0.9153, and the 0.500 at $0.6149, delineating a clear hierarchy should the market see further volatility. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes 50% Over The Weekend, What Does This Mean For Price? The bullish extension framework in Charting Guy’s layout is unambiguous. Above the all-time high at $3.3170, the chart plots successive Fibonacci expansion targets at 1.272 = $8.2961, 1.414 = $13.3894, and 1.618 = $26.6304. Those levels map a classic measured-move pathway for a trend continuation once price achieves a decisive, high-timeframe close through the prior peak. In other words, the cycle roadmap remains intact so long as the monthly structure continues to hold above the 0.786 stack and eventually flips the ATH into support. Market Structure Remains Supportive The analyst couples that chart with a broader market read. “So many [are] caught up in day-to-day price action,” he posted on X, adding that TOTAL2, TOTAL3, and top altcoins (ETH, XRP, SOL) each “have ONE more key fib to get over… their prior ATH. Once that happens with strength, altseason really gets going. BTC.D tanks & shitcoins finally catch a bid.” In his XRP view, that “one more key fib” is the $3.3170 threshold. Related Reading: XRP Could Swing To $1.19 Or $20 After Order-Book Collapse, Analyst Warns Technically, the setup is binary and well-defined on the monthly timeframe: continued defense of $1.60–$1.80 keeps the uptrend’s higher-low structure intact, while a sustained break and close above $3.3170 would confirm the next leg toward the extension grid at $8.30, $13.39, and—at the cycle’s ambitious outer bound—the 1.618 marker near $26.63. For now, XRP remains range-bound beneath ATH but supported by the same zone that powered its last breakout, exactly as Charting Guy’s chart depicts. At press time, XRP traded at $2.4655.

In this case, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) requested the seizure of 127,271 Bitcoin (BTC) and numerous assets, including luxury yachts and private jets. While the DOJ seized 127,271 Bitcoins, a new debate has begun regarding these BTCs. While discussions continue regarding the 127,271 Bitcoins seized by the US, a billion-dollar transfer was made from a wallet belonging to the LuBian Bitcoin mining pool from which these BTCs were stolen. According to Elliptic, these Bitcoins were stolen from LuBian Mining in 2020. $14 Billion Bitcoin Seizure Awakens Wallets! According to Lookonchain's post, one of LuBian's wallets (39DUz) moved all 9,757 BTC worth $1.1 billion after three years of inactivity. The Bitcoins were transferred to two new addresses. This transfer also comes just a day after news broke that the US government seized LuBian’s stolen assets of 127,271 BTC, worth $14.4 billion. This raised questions about whether the move was for liquidation purposes or simply an attempt to transfer funds to new wallets for security or operational reasons. One of #LuBian 's wallet(39DUz) just woke up after 3 years of dormancy — transferring all 9,757 $BTC ($1.1B) to new wallets.

Lubian Mining emerged suddenly in early 2020 and quickly became one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools in the market. While its entry and growth did not go unnoticed, Lubian was soon hacked in December 2020, resulting in the theft of 127,000 BTC. However, the perpetrators were never identified. One of Lubian's wallets, which mysteriously disappeared suddenly in early 2021, was seized by the US just one day after being found. This seizure was the largest Bitcoin seizure in the US to date. *This is not investment advice.

DeepSeek is betting big on Solana’s future trajectory, citing it could exceed $500 this year – nearly a 150% gain compared to its current $203 price tag. The Chinese AI tool believes the #3 largest crypto could break this level following ‘a massive crypto bull run, successful upgrades, and the potential greenlight of Solana ETFs.’ If $SOL rallies as anticipated, it spells excellent news for crypto projects building on the Solana network, like Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Is Another Crypto Bull Run Incoming? DeepSeek analyzes the World Wide Web in real time, and thus its findings carry serious weight. A crypto bull run would, of course, set the stage for $SOL’s most explosive growth phase yet. While $BTC is down at $112K following $19B in recent liquidations , it’s not all doom and gloom for the industry. Take the analysts CryptoQuant and Glassnode , for instance. They point to a surge in $USDT supply, large-scale whale buys, and steady ETF inflows as bullish indicators of growing strength across the market. Suggesting to prosperous times for $SOL alone, however, is its ambitious 2025 roadmap . Solana Plans to Cut Transaction Finality to Just 150ms At the heart of Solana’s upcoming developments is Firedancer, a new validator client developed by Jump Crypto . With the SIMD-0370 update, the system is expected to slash transaction finality from roughly 12.8 seconds to just 150 milliseconds. And that’s not all. Solana plans to double its block space and implement a new consensus algorithm that eliminates vote transactions, increases throughput, and shortens block times – each of which would significantly boost the network’s efficiency. On the institutional front, Solana’s leadership is actively engaging with major financial players and policymakers. One such example is the Solana Policy Institute . The ultimate aim of the Institute is to educate policymakers on how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy, plus why the people building on and using them need legal clarity to succeed. Additionally, supporting the network’s growth are projects like Helix’s RPS 2.0 and Confidential Transfers . The former is designed to decouple Solana’s read and write layers to address the network’s bottlenecks. Meanwhile, the latter introduces privacy-preserving transactions to attract institutional users who care about confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Not to mention, there’s also the potential for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a Solana ETF this year . According to Polymarket data, traders are betting big on a 99% probability , underscoring just how confident the market is in Solana’s next major milestone. Each of these developments is nothing short of fantastic news for $SNORT . Snorter Bot to Offer Low 0.85% Trading Fees on Solana $SNORT is the foundation of Snorter Bot, a Telegram trading bot that’s preparing to go live on Solana this quarter. It’s under development to give traders an advantage in the fast-paced crypto sector. By initially being built on Solana, it promises that it’ll deliver high execution speeds and trading fees as low as 0.85% (that’s provided you buy some $SNORT). After Solana serves as the bot’s launchpad, it sets out to expand across Ethereum, BNB Chain, and other EVM-compatible networks. In doing so, you’ll be able to partake in various types of investments, not just the best Solana meme coins . Whether you’re eyeing the next crypto to explode or want to learn the basics of crypto trading, Snorter Bot will offer lots of services to help you make smarter trading decisions. Its automated sniping tool, for instance, means you’ll be able to secure early entries as soon as they go live. Meanwhile, its copy trading feature is super helpful if you’re a crypto newbie. This is because it’ll allow you to capitalize on the moves of top-performing wallets without technical know-how. And all will be offered without the bot compromising on security. It’ll be MEV protected and include rugpull and honeypot alerts. This way, you’ll be safeguarded against common crypto scams around the clock. Buy SNORT Today for Possible 771% Gains $SNORT is behind it all, powering every aspect of the bot and its future trajectory. Ensuring sustainable growth is a quarter of its total token supply being earmarked for development. But buying $SNORT on presale doesn’t just mean supporting the project’s evolution; it opens exclusive benefits – leaderboard rewards, a staking APY up to 108% (if you join now), and DAO governance. You can reap the perks by joining the presale for as little as $0.1079, using either $SOL, $ETH, $USDT, $USDC, $BNB, or fiat. With Solana’s network heating up and Snorter Bot poised to launch on it, there might not be any better time to get involved. This is especially true when considering that our Snorter Bot price prediction foresees $SNORT reaching $0.94 this year. As such, joining now at its current price could generate 771% gains – that’s provided that it successfully launches on the best crypto exchanges . Buy $HYPER before its price spikes.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-now-convinced-xrp-etfs-will-massively-impact-xrp-price-heres-why/,"The crypto world is at the precipice of a turning point: the possibility that XRP could emerge as the ETF darling of digital assets, rewriting expectations about how institutional capital flows into the sector. After months of skepticism, many observers now see a credible roadmap for XRP ETFs to become a dominant driver of demand—and Vincent Van Code’s recent public pivot captures that shift in sentiment. Regulatory Momentum & ETF Timelines The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently signaled a more structured approach toward crypto-based exchange-traded products. In July 2025, it released guidance clarifying disclosure, custody, and operational requirements for crypto-linked ETFs—a move widely interpreted as an acknowledgment that these products are part of the broader capital markets landscape. Multiple spot-XRP ETF proposals from firms like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares, CoinShares, and others remain pending. These applications have undergone rounds of amendments, and observers expect critical decision windows in October–November 2025. The proximity of these deadlines suggests that the ever-theoretical XRP ETF possibility could shift rapidly into execution. After many months of holding the position ""ETFs will not affect XRP price"", I am pivoting. I think the XRP ETFs are about to have a massive impact on its price. It will be seen as the one with the greatest use case and potential and become the favorite. BTC ETFs went to $100BN… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 14, 2025 Institutional Capital as a Catalyst If approved, XRP ETFs would provide institutional and retail money a regulated, custodial route into XRP exposure. Such vehicles tend to compress entry friction and attract large inflows—especially from investors who prefer not to manage private keys or engage directly with exchanges. Bitcoin’s ETF evolution offers a precedent: some Bitcoin funds grew rapidly toward the $100 billion assets-under-management mark, anchoring institutional allocations into a regulated wrapper. A similar trajectory applied to XRP could channel outsized capital toward it — especially if investors begin betting that XRP’s real-world use case grants it asymmetric upside. The introduction of an XRP ETF could therefore accelerate demand beyond the already supportive narrative of utility. XRPL Volume & On-Ledger Pressure Beyond the institutional story, on-chain dynamics are beginning to shift. XRPL decentralized exchange (DEX) activity has registered meaningful gains: in one week, DEX volume is reported to have surged 203%, rising from roughly $108,000 to over $300,000 in USD terms. More broadly, the XRPL’s 24-hour DEX volume is in the multimillion-dollar range, and total DEX volume over 30 days runs into the tens of millions. Additionally, Automated Market Maker (AMM) volume on XRPL recently rose ~17% month-on-month, with DEX metrics up ~21% in that same span. Rising on-ledger trading and settlement activity may reduce the effective float held on centralized exchanges. As traders increasingly prefer native DEX activity or withdrawals into custody, visible CEX supply tightens, making each incremental demand push more price sensitive. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Tightness & Feedback Loops Combining the supply squeeze with strong demand creates the conditions for amplified price moves. If ETF inflows begin converting into actual XRP acquisitions—and exchange inventories are simultaneously being drained—the scarcity of XRP available for trading could steepen price appreciation curves. In effect, the system self-reinforces: as more capital competes over fewer tokens, market dynamics tip toward aggressive bid support. This is exactly the model Van Code now believes will play out. He frames the upcoming ETF approval window as the ignition point of structural change: the moment XRP transitions from “use-case undervalued” to “ETF champion.” Risks and Caveats The thesis is not without risks. The SEC may delay or reject applications, or impose restrictive terms; significant portions of ETF demand might be hedged synthetically rather than converted into spot XRP. Market makers and custodians will influence how much of the demand translates into actual buying pressure. Further, while XRPL on-chain metrics are growing, they remain modest compared to major blockchains, and activity fluctuations remain a risk. In conclusion, Vincent Van Code’s evolving stance reflects more than opinion—it echoes a broader shift in the market narrative. Regulatory frameworks are aligning; institutional vehicles are poised; XRPL is starting to show meaningful volume shifts; and supply dynamics could rapidly evolve into a virtuous squeeze. If the timing and execution align, XRP ETFs may not only influence the market—they could define the next regime of price discovery . Whether that outcome is realized will depend on the SEC, market structure, and execution nuance—but the plausibility has moved from speculative to nearly tangible.

While Bitcoin and the majority of altcoins are turning red, many altcoins, particularly among the top 100, have lost more than 40% of their value in the last hour. However, Binance Coin (BNB) has once again made a name for itself with its strong showing amid this decline. At this point, BNB hit a new ATH on Monday, falling to $1,150 within two days. While BNB has been falling since its new record high, experts said it has failed to sustain its record rally and has been rejected twice near the $1,350 level in the past week. This raises the possibility of a pullback in October. Related News: As Bitcoin and Altcoins Try to Recover from Historic Crash, BNB Rises Again! - CZ Reveals the Source of BNB's Success! Accordingly, experts stated that a double top formation has begun to form on BNB's daily chart and if it is completed, the price may drop by 30%. According to experts, the neckline of the double top formation is formed around $1,100, and a daily closing candle below this neckline will signal the completion of the formation. It was also stated that the various negative rumors surrounding Binance and the net outflow of $21.75 billion in the last seven days could weaken BNB's upward momentum. *This is not investment advice.

The collaboration combines Kadena’s technical scalability with Brickken’s compliance-driven tokenization tools to accelerate enterprise blockchain adoption. Building compliant tokenization for institutional use Under the collaboration, Kadena and Brickken plan to tokenize an initial $10 million in real-world assets as part of the testnet launch, with a full mainnet rollout expected in 2026. The initiative comes amid forecasts that as much as $16 trillion in assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. Kadena’s multi-chain Proof-of-Work design delivers energy efficiency and low transaction fees while maintaining enterprise-level security. Brickken’s white-label infrastructure complements this with end-to-end tokenization capabilities covering issuance, KYC compliance, lifecycle management, and automated distributions. Together, they provide a full-stack solution for institutions seeking compliant RWA tokenization across jurisdictions. “Brickken enhances Kadena’s RWA strategy by providing an end-to-end tokenization platform for issuers to create, manage, and distribute real-world assets on-chain,” said Annelise Osborne, Chief Business Officer at Kadena. “Integrating Brickken’s robust tokenization infrastructure with Kadena’s scalable, energy-efficient Proof-of-Work blockchain delivers a secure and compliant foundation for bringing real-world value into the digital economy.” Combining Kadena’s Proof-of-Work scale with Brickken’s regulatory infrastructure Brickken currently operates in 16 countries and has facilitated over $300 million in tokenized assets for corporate and institutional clients. The company’s infrastructure supports compliance across multiple jurisdictions and leverages the ERC-7943 standard, co-authored by Brickken’s co-founder Dario Lo Buglio, to streamline token issuance and reduce fragmentation within the RWA space. Kadena brings its existing institutional framework to the partnership, including a $25 million RWA Grant Program backing projects such as CurveBlock, a sustainable real estate tokenization platform in the UK, and Access Equity, an AMF-regulated platform managing $65 million in tokenized private equity. Additionally, Kadena’s broader ecosystem includes infrastructure partnerships with Dfns for enterprise wallets, Zodia for institutional custody, and Ownera for asset interoperability. Edwin Mata, CEO of Brickken, said of the partnership: “Partnering with Kadena reinforces Brickken’s commitment to advancing institutional-grade blockchain solutions. Together, we’re bridging traditional finance and Web3 and delivering the infrastructure required for compliant and secure Real-World Asset tokenization at scale. It is a new benchmark for the future of institutional adoption.” Featured image via Shutterstock.

That came out to $1.06 per share, blowing past the 95 cents analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. Revenue wasn’t left behind either, jumping 10.8% year-on-year to $28.24 billion, also above the $27.5 billion forecast. No confusion here: every line beat the Street. Investors didn’t wait around. BoFA’s stock jumped by 6.8% at market open, according to data from Google Finance. The stock was already up 14% year-to-date before the report even hit. And it’s clear why. The second-largest U.S. bank by assets rode strong waves across Wall Street activity. Both investment banking and trading desks pushed the numbers hard; the same trend was seen at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which also booked big trading gains this quarter. Banking fees jump while trading revenue climbs Bank of America said its investment banking fees hit $2 billion, a 43% increase from last year. That’s $380 million more than what analysts at StreetAccount expected. Deals and capital raises picked up speed, and the bank cashed in. Meanwhile, equities trading pulled in $2.3 billion, a 14% boost, topping expectations by around $200 million. Fixed income trading didn’t miss either. That line came in at $3.1 billion, rising 5% from the previous year—right in line with what was forecast. The entire trading unit ran clean this quarter, with no part dragging the score down. Credit performance also helped. Provision for credit losses dropped to $1.3 billion, a 13% decline from last quarter and $280 million below analyst forecasts. That change was big for earnings, as it means fewer borrowers are falling behind, which means less cash needs to be set aside to cover future bad loans. At the same time, net interest income hit $15.39 billion, up 9% and about $150 million over expectations. CEO Brian Moynihan said in the earnings release: “With continued organic growth, every line of business reported top and bottom-line improvements. Strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with effective balance sheet positioning, resulted in record net interest income.” Balance sheet changes and capital ratios hold steady At quarter-end, Bank of America had $3.4 trillion in total assets, slightly down from $3.44 trillion in Q2, but still above the $3.32 trillion from the same time last year. Total loans and leases rose to $1.17 trillion, up from $1.15 trillion in Q2 and $1.08 trillion a year ago. Of that, $1.16 trillion came from business segments alone, not including other units. Deposits held up too. They stood at $2.0 trillion, barely down from Q2’s $2.01 trillion, but up from $1.93 trillion in Q3 last year. On average, assets clocked in at $3.44 trillion, loans and leases at $1.15 trillion, and deposits at $1.99 trillion. The bank also reported $311.5 billion in long-term debt and $961 billion in average global liquidity. Common equity climbed to $278.2 billion, while book value per share rose to $37.95. The tangible book value moved up to $28.39 per share. Regulatory capital levels remained solid. The CET1 capital stood at $202.9 billion, with a CET1 ratio of 11.6% under the standardized approach and 13.1% under the advanced one. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio was at 5.8%, a small increase from 5.7% last quarter. As for shares, there were 7.33 billion common shares outstanding at the end of Q3. That’s down from 7.44 billion in Q2 and 7.69 billion in Q3 last year. Get seen where it counts.

As of today, the token is holding firm near the $2.50 mark, suggesting that selling pressure may be easing. However, market sentiment remains fragile, with traders staying cautious amid lingering uncertainty and fear-driven trading behavior. The recent decline followed a broader market correction that swept across the crypto sector, triggered by heightened volatility and profit-taking after XRP’s strong rally earlier this month. Despite the pullback, on-chain data shows a decline in active sell orders and an uptick in accumulation by mid-sized holders, signaling that bearish momentum could be losing steam. Market analysts note that XRP’s ability to defend the $2.40–$2.50 support zone is critical for restoring investor confidence. Furthermore, a decisive close above $2.60 could open the door for a potential rebound toward $2.85, while failure to hold current levels may reignite downside pressure, possibly retesting the $2.30 support region. Meanwhile, technical indicators signal cautious optimism. The RSI has rebounded from oversold levels, and trading volumes show consolidation instead of heavy selling, hinting at a potential cooldown before the next major move. However, pundits remain alert to false recoveries as macroeconomic headwinds and risk aversion continue to pressure the broader crypto market. Webus Integrates XRP to Power Tokenized Travel Rewards, Targeting the $20B Global Loyalty Market Nasdaq-listed Webus has integrated XRP into its new tokenized travel rewards platform, a bold move to modernize loyalty programs across travel and hospitality. Targeting the $20B global loyalty market, the initiative aims to solve persistent challenges of fragmentation, illiquidity, and poor interoperability. Leveraging blockchain tokenization and XRP’s stablecoin settlement layer, Webus’ platform enables instant, frictionless conversion and transfer of loyalty points across airlines, hotels, car rentals, and other mobility partners. By breaking down traditional silos, it lets travelers seamlessly exchange and redeem rewards across brands and regions, eliminating delays, inefficiencies, and value loss common in legacy loyalty systems. Nan Zheng, Webus CEO acknowledged, “The global loyalty market is large but highly fragmented. Our goal is to build a unified, tokenized reward exchange that unlocks real liquidity and simplifies global redemption. By integrating XRP stablecoin settlement, we aim to bring real-time, low-cost, and transparent value conversion to the travel rewards ecosystem.” Industry experts acknowledge that tokenized rewards mark the next major evolution in loyalty programs, transforming closed, rigid systems into open, tradeable, and user-driven ecosystems. As a result, consumers gain freedom to earn and spend rewards across brands, while businesses benefit from deeper engagement, real-time transparency, and streamlined operations. Conclusion XRP’s steady hold near $2.50 highlights its growing resilience amid market uncertainty. Despite lingering fear across the crypto sector, easing selling pressure and improving technical indicators suggest momentum may be shifting. A sustained recovery, however, hinges on renewed investor confidence and stronger trading volume in the days ahead. On the other hand, Webus’ integration of XRP marks a transformative leap in loyalty innovation, redefining how value is created, exchanged, and experienced. By combining blockchain-based tokenization with real-time stablecoin settlement, Webus is building a more open, efficient, and liquid global rewards economy.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-15 15:23:00

Per documents reviewed by Reuters, Foxconn’s due diligence concluded that ZF’s powertrain technology division, known internally as Division E, was worth between $1.74 billion and €2.5 billion, far below the $2.9 billion figure previously discussed. More strikingly, the unit’s equity value was found to be negative, compared with an earlier estimate of $1.5 billion. A comment in the internal materials reportedly read: “No deal if equity value is negative.” Debt burden and valuation mismatch The due diligence uncovered that Division E’s net debt was almost 90% higher than expected, reaching $4.9 billion, according to the JPMorgan document titled Project Verde – Discussion Materials. A significant portion of that debt, nearly $1.1 billion, reportedly came from previously underestimated pension liabilities. Foxconn and ZF had been exploring a potential investment under which the Taiwanese company would inject around $1.5 billion to buy a stake in the division if its equity valuation reached $3 billion, a structure outlined in a ZF document dated February 2025. According to the findings , ZF has been struggling under a heavy debt load from past acquisitions. Foxconn’s EV ambitions tested Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has been trying to replicate its success in electronics manufacturing in the automotive world. The company has identified electric vehicles as a pillar of future growth and wants to capture a sizeable part of the global EV market. Foxconn has launched several ventures to anchor itself in the EV ecosystem, but progress has been uneven. In July, Foxconn sold a former factory in the U.S. that it initially acquired in 2022 for EV production. Also, its partnership with China’s Geely to provide contract manufacturing has shown little movement. Nonetheless, Foxconn continues to push forward through partnerships in Asia . However, in May, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Motors through its subsidiary Foxtron Vehicle Technologies to develop and supply an electric model to be built by Taiwan’s Yulon Motor and launched in Oceania in 2026. It also struck an agreement with Mitsubishi Fuso in August to collaborate on zero-emission buses. Last year, Foxconn reportedly acquired 50% shares in ZF Chassis Modules, the ZF Group’s chassis systems maker for passenger cars. However, the stalled ZF transaction is a setback in the company’s effort to secure a strong foothold in Europe’s automotive supply chain. New direction for ZF and industry pressures While the equity sale may be off the table, ZF is reportedly still in talks with Foxconn and other potential partners about possible partnerships that are focused on specific technologies within Division E. The difficulties encountered in the Foxconn negotiations highlight a major strain across Europe’s automotive supply industry, where suppliers face heavy investment needs to transition from combustion technology to electrification, thanks to emissions rules they have to comply with. Many are also grappling with legacy costs, including pensions and restructuring charges, that complicate their capital strategies, as seen in the case of ZF. The latest findings are quite damning for ZF, and it has raised questions about its ability to manage leverage, as its high debt levels could constrain future investment and make asset sales harder to execute without major discounts.

The firm revealed that the deal is backed by $50 million, suggesting it could inject fresh liquidity into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Dogecoin Sees Fresh $50M Liquidity As House of Doge Secures Nasdaq Listing In a press release, House of Doge announced that it has secured a Nasdaq listing through a merger with Brag House Holdings, a deal backed by over $50 million in investment capital, which is a positive for Dogecoin. Brag House will acquire House of Doge in a reverse takeover transaction, which is subject to approval from both companies’ boards of directors. Related Reading: The Historical Performance That Says Dogecoin Price Will Hit $11.71 By End Of Year House of Doge, the commercial arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, noted that this proposed merger will advance mainstream Dogecoin adoption and institutionalize the meme coin’s utility. The firm also highlighted how it boasts 837 million DOGE within its framework, representing the largest institutional Dogecoin holdings in the global crypto ecosystem. House of Doge has already built an institutional foundation for the Dogecoin ecosystem through its partnerships with 21Shares, Robinhood, and CleanCore Solutions. The firm played a key role in helping CleanCore set up its Dogecoin treasury. Now, the firm is looking to deepen the push for the institutional adoption of DOGE and has secured $50 million to boost the meme coin’s ecosystem. House of Doge revealed that it plans to use this capital to lay the foundation for a “scalable, transparent, and yield-producing Dogecoin economy” for both institutional investors and the DOGE community. The firm also confirmed that the newly combined entity will hold a “significant amount of Dogecoin within its framework,” indicating that some of the capital it secured will be used to purchase DOGE. Catalyst For A DOGE Rally The House of Doge’s proposed merger could serve as one of the catalysts for an explosive Dogecoin rally to new highs. The firm has outlined several ways it plans to boost DOGE’s institutional adoption, which could spark more institutional inflows into the meme coin’s ecosystem. Related Reading: Broadening Wedge Could Send Dogecoin Price Flying, But Watch These Key Factors Notably, this comes amid the imminent launch of the Dogecoin ETFs, which are expected to drive fresh liquidity into DOGE. Crypto analyst The Historical Performance That Says Dogecoin Price Will Hit $11.71 By End Of Year, that the meme coin could rally to as high as $0.6533 even as the institutional catalysts line up for Dogecoin. From a technical perspective, the analyst stated that DOGE’s uptrend remains intact and that, as prices hold above a major resistance trendline, the target remains $0.6533. He added that the uptrend can spark a run of over 200% to reach this target.

53183493,606961,1760542418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53183493.jpeg,Crypto in 401(k)s: Trump’s New Frontier for Altcoins Boosts Bitcoin Hyper’s Prospects,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-crypto-401ks-are-here-bitcoin-hyper-can-benefit/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Representative Troy Downing (R-Mont.) introduced a bill codifying Trump’s Executive Order 14330. 2️⃣ The executive order opens the $12T 401(k) market to crypto investors. 3️⃣ Both the executive order and the bill are infrastructure plays, setting up other projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) for long-term growth. Did you hear about US President Donald Trump’s move to open the $12T 401(k) retirement market to crypto? When the news broke weeks ago , there was the usual doubt about what the exact outcome would be. Now we’re one step closer to finding out; U.S. Republicans are pushing legislation to enshrine in law President Trump’s executive order that allows crypto exposure in 401(k) plans. It’s not a stretch to say that the move could utterly transform the crypto market, and not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The size of the 401(k) market is so large that even a small percentage of the total assets being moved to crypto would significantly reshape the current crypto economy. The trickle-down impact would extend beyond $BTC and $ETH, opening the door for key infrastructure projects, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , to gain momentum. From Executive Order to Federal Law Earlier this year, Trump issued Executive Order 14330 , instructing the Department of Labor to permit ‘alternative assets,’ including digital assets, in retirement plans if fiduciaries deem them appropriate. With the order, Trump cracked open the door for crypto to enter the 401(k) and broader retirement market in the US. That’s a huge market segment – by one estimate , the total funds held by all retirement accounts exceed $45T. And defined contribution plans – mostly 401(k)s – account for $13T of that market. However, even executive orders from Donald Trump lack permanence; they can be overturned or modified by future administrations. To address that, Representative Troy Downing has introduced the Retirement Investment Choice Act , a one-page bill that would give Trump’s guidelines the ‘force and effect of law.’ If enacted, this bill would permanently bind the retirement rule into federal statute. Under the original executive order, the Labor Department has 180 days to propose rule changes that would allow plan sponsors to include cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets. However, it’s not all easy-going. Real-world challenges, including the ongoing government shutdown, could delay the process. Meanwhile, nine members of Congress have urged the SEC to accelerate implementation, pointing out that it’s not simply about the size of the 401(k) market cap; nearly 90M investors currently lack access to alternative assets under existing rules. Open the Capital Floodgates for Crypto The implications for capital flows into digital assets are eye-watering. If even just 1 % of U.S. 401(k) assets were allocated to crypto, analysts estimate it could funnel $122B into crypto markets. That figure climbs to approximately $360B if allocations reach 3%. It’s not like there isn’t already an institutional appetite: BlackRock’s IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF just passed the $100B AUM mark and shows little sign of slowing down. The total AUM of the $BTC ETF sits around $160B , with impressive growth over the past year. What Crypto 401(k)s Mean for Altcoins The best options to buy focus not just on short-term plays, but on long-term infrastructure. That’s exactly the kind of approach that fits hand-in-glove with Trump’s executive order and the new bill. By incorporating crypto into retirement accounts, the financial industry could simultaneously boost the development and stability of digital assets. The move could achieve: Broader institutional legitimization : Including crypto in retirement portfolios could shift perceptions, reducing the stigma associated with volatility and risk. Greater capital dispersion : As ETFs covering altcoins become available (from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Solana ), investors should diversify, supporting a wider range of protocols. Reduced correlation to speculative markets : Retirement allocations tend to be longer-term and more stable, which could cushion crypto markets from extreme short-term swings. Viewed that way, Trump’s executive order and Downing’s proposed bill are actually infrastructure plays, setting the stage for crypto to enter its next growth phase. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in, bringing its own upgrade to Bitcoin’s limited architecture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Whale Buys Boost Infrastructure Play, Raise $23.7M for Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin is big, bad, and the poster child for crypto. Too bad it’s not exactly what the original white paper intended . Satoshi entitled the whitepaper a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.’ While Bitcoin has succeeded wildly as a store of value, it hasn’t performed as well as an actual payment system. That’s partly because Bitcoin is secure, stable, and slow. A low throughput and limited TPS (averaging 7) pales in comparison to Visa’s 65K TPS, or even the several thousand TPS offered by Solana. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) addresses these weaknesses by utilizing a canonical bridge to the Solana Virtual Machine, thereby combining Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s flexibility. The resulting hybrid architecture utilizes the bridge to wrap $BTC onto the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2, where it can be used for everything from DeFi to microtransactions, thanks to the SVM’s vastly higher throughput and lower fees. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s the upgrade Bitcoin needed, and there’s an immense amount of buzz around the project with whale buys pouring in: $379K whale buy $274K whale buy $74.9K whale buy Our own price prediction thinks the token has a legitimate chance to move from $0.013115 to $0.32 by the end of the year. If 2339% gains sound decent to you, learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . Visit the $HYPER presale page to learn more. In the meantime, while the path from bill introduction to law is uncertain, the momentum is clear: political actors are aligning behind bringing digital assets into mainstream retirement investing. Should the Retirement Investment Choice Act pass, the steady trickle of crypto adoption could become a flood, reshaping capital flows, investor behavior, and the very architecture of crypto markets – just like Bitcoin Hyper aims to do with Bitcoin. As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

Zeberg’s bearish outlook stands in contrast to the prevailing bullish narrative dominating Wall Street and financial media, both of which continue to celebrate Bitcoin’s resilience amid global macro uncertainty. The economist cautioned that this widespread enthusiasm mirrors the sentiment seen during previous market bubbles, where public excitement often preceded severe downturns, he said in an X post on October 15. #Bitcoin #BTC Think guys! – We are in the most extreme Bubble of all times. – Buffett sees BTC as ""rat-poison squared"" – There is a massive Negative Divergence (on BTC) in Weekly, Monthly and Quarterly charts. This is a VERY Bearish looking chart. – Wall Street and Media… pic.twitter.com/rMdNmh96PU — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) October 15, 2025 Bitcoin set for final rally Zeberg expects a final rally before what he warns could be a horrendous crash, potentially one of the steepest in financial history. His outlook is supported by technical indicators suggesting Bitcoin’s long-term price structure is forming a rising wedge pattern, a setup often associated with major market tops. The analysis shows Bitcoin entering the fifth and final wave of its long-term uptrend, a phase often marked by peak optimism and sharp reversals. The expert also highlighted a strong negative divergence between Bitcoin’s price and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) across major timeframes, signaling fading momentum despite continued gains. His outlook projects three possible outcomes after the peak: a best-case drop to $16,000, a medium-case correction to $4,000, or a worst-case collapse to $150. The warning comes as some market participants anticipate Bitcoin could still target new highs around $150,000 , despite recent volatility. Overall, sentiment remains broadly bullish, with the asset trading mostly above the $100,000 support level for much of 2025.

Some rely on hype and play-to-earn mechanics, while others, like $TRUE token , are backed by real business performance. In this review, we highlight a curated list of promising GameFi tokens to watch in 2025, analyze their fundamentals, use cases, and risks — and paint a picture of where the sector might head next. What Is GameFi? GameFi blends decentralized finance (DeFi) principles with gaming mechanics, allowing players to earn real rewards (tokens, NFTs) by playing, owning, and interacting in digital game worlds. Key features include: Play-to-Earn (P2E): Users can earn in-game tokens or NFTs that have real-world value. Asset Ownership & Interoperability: Players hold genuine ownership of assets (characters, lands, items) that can move across games or be traded. Governance & Tokenomics: Many GameFi ecosystems incorporate governance tokens, staking, yield mechanics, and incentive designs to shape long-term engagement. On-chain Economies: Game economies are often implemented on blockchain to ensure transparency, verifiability, and decentralized operation. While the space offers high upside, it also suffers from risks: token inflation, weak monetization models, regulatory uncertainty around gaming tokens, and the need to retain a critical mass of active users. Top GameFi Tokens to Watch (2025) Below is a selection of GameFi tokens that have shown innovation, traction, or compelling tokenomics in 2025: Token / Project Description Strengths 1. TRUE World ($TRUE) The licensed game studio behind over 60 games, 1,700 partner integrations, and 4.5 million paying players is preparing to list its native token in Q4 2025. Real €79M annual revenue, €7M+ monthly gross gaming revenue, existing player base, deflationary token model backed by actual business income. 2. Immutable X (IMX) A Layer-2 tailored for NFT and game use, enabling fast, gas-free minting and trading. Robust infrastructure, strong partnerships. 3. Gala (GALA) Multi-game ecosystem integrating DeFi elements and NFT ownership. Broad developer network. 4. The Sandbox (SAND) Metaverse platform for user-generated content and land ownership. Strong brand presence, interoperability. 5. Axie Infinity (AXS / SLP) Pioneer of play-to-earn gaming, evolving through new gameplay and land systems. Proven adoption and scale. 6. Illuvium (ILV) AAA-quality RPG with rich visuals and token-driven governance. Strong community, premium design. 7. NOTCOIN (NOT) Viral token gaining traction across social-gaming platforms. Community momentum. 8. Enjin Coin (ENJ) Long-standing token connecting NFTs, wallets, and gaming infrastructure. Deep integrations and standards. 9. MBOX (MOBOX) Combines yield farming and GameFi mechanics in one ecosystem. Diverse rewards model. 10. ApeCoin (APE) Extends Bored Ape IP into gaming and metaverse spaces. Brand recognition, NFT integration. Deep Dive into Top GameFi Coins 2025 TRUE World ($TRUE) TRUE LABS, a regulated gaming studio with real revenue and millions of paying players, has entered the blockchain space with TRUE World — a next-generation loyalty system providing XP, drops, tournaments, and RWA rewards). Now, the studio plans to list the $TRUE token on Tier-1 CEX and DEX platforms scheduled for Q4 2025. Unlike speculative GameFi launches, $TRUE is built on verifiable fundamentals. The studio generates €7M+ in monthly gross gaming revenue, totaling €79M annually, and has spent over six years cultivating partnerships across the global gaming industry. Source: True World Dune Analytics The $TRUE token underpins a live ecosystem of games and reward programs. Its deflationary design—combining usage-based burns with revenue-funded buybacks—ties token scarcity directly to company performance. In essence, every game session contributes to value creation, not dilution. For traders seeking grounded opportunities amid speculative GameFi trends, $TRUE offers a rare case: a profitable, licensed company stepping into Web3 with a proven audience and business model. Watch for listing announcements at: https://x.com/TRUExWorld 2. Immutable X (IMX) Immutable X is a Layer-2 scaling solution designed specifically for NFTs and games. It enables zero gas costs for minting and trading, while leveraging Ethereum’s security. This gives it an edge for GameFi developers who need high throughput and low friction for user assets.IMX has been driving interest through network activity, developer toolkits, and partnerships. Its token is used for staking, governance, and paying protocol fees. Challenges:It must stave off competition from rival Layer-2 solutions (like Arbitrum, zk-rollups), maintain developer adoption, and balance token supply and incentives. 3. Gala (GALA) Gala is a decentralized gaming and entertainment ecosystem that empowers developers to build blockchain-based games, music, and film experiences. It runs its own GalaChain network, allowing players to truly own their in-game items and trade them freely. GALA has maintained strong recognition within the GameFi sector due to consistent ecosystem expansion. Its token is used for purchasing assets, running nodes, and participating in governance. Challenges:The project must sustain long-term player engagement across multiple games and avoid ecosystem dilution. Managing token inflation and ensuring scalability are also ongoing hurdles. 4. The Sandbox (SAND) The Sandbox is a metaverse built on Ethereum, where users can create, own, and monetize virtual experiences using the SAND token. It allows players to purchase virtual land (LAND NFTs), build game worlds, and trade digital assets. SAND has remained a prominent metaverse token, backed by partnerships with major brands and celebrities. It continues to attract creators and investors seeking long-term virtual real estate value. Challenges:User activity and land development have slowed amid the broader metaverse cooldown. Sustaining creator incentives and onboarding non-crypto users are key to renewed momentum. 5. Axie Infinity (AXS / SLP) Axie Infinity pioneered play-to-earn gaming, letting players collect, breed, and battle digital creatures called Axies. The ecosystem runs on two tokens: AXS (governance/staking) and SLP (in-game rewards). Following its 2021 boom, Axie has stabilized and introduced updates like Axie Origins and Homeland to rejuvenate gameplay. AXS remains integral to staking and governance, while SLP underpins player rewards. Challenges:Maintaining sustainable tokenomics remains the core issue. Over-reliance on new player inflow and token inflation have previously hurt the in-game economy. 6. Illuvium (ILV) Illuvium is a visually advanced RPG blending open-world exploration with auto-battler mechanics. Players collect creatures called Illuvials as NFTs and earn ILV tokens through battles and staking. ILV has gained attention for its AAA-quality design and consistent development progress. Its staking system rewards long-term holders and fuels liquidity across its DeFi elements. Challenges:Illuvium faces high production costs and the need to meet AAA gaming expectations. Balancing playability and token value remains a delicate equation. 7. NOTCOIN (NOT) NOTCOIN began as a viral play-and-earn experiment within the Telegram ecosystem, letting millions of users mine and claim tokens through simple gameplay. It’s now evolving into a larger GameFi and social-mining ecosystem. NOT saw massive adoption thanks to its frictionless onboarding and viral appeal. Its exchange listings brought liquidity, fueling short-term trading interest. Challenges:Maintaining engagement after the initial hype and proving sustainable utility beyond “tap-to-earn” mechanics are the biggest tests. 8. Enjin Coin (ENJ) Enjin Coin underpins a suite of blockchain tools for creating and managing NFTs in games. Developers can mint NFTs backed by ENJ, ensuring tangible value for digital items. Enjin remains one of the most established Web3 infrastructure providers, supporting game developers and NFT creators across multiple chains. The ENJ token is used for minting and backing digital assets. Challenges:The brand’s early mover advantage has faded amid competition from newer NFT standards and gaming-focused blockchains. Revitalizing developer adoption is key to long-term growth. 9. MOBOX (MBOX) MOBOX combines GameFi and DeFi, offering play-to-earn games that reward users with MBOX tokens. Its platform integrates yield farming, NFT staking, and player competitions. MBOX has built a loyal community through continuous game releases and multi-chain expansion. Its token remains central to governance, rewards, and NFT marketplace activity. Challenges:The project must differentiate itself in a crowded GameFi field and refine its reward models to prevent inflation-driven devaluation. 10. ApeCoin (APE) ApeCoin is the governance and utility token of the Ape ecosystem, originating from the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. It fuels Web3 gaming, metaverse experiences, and community-led initiatives.APE has extended its reach through projects like Otherside, an evolving metaverse platform integrating gaming and social experiences. It retains strong cultural branding and liquidity. Challenges:Its success is heavily tied to BAYC’s reputation and NFT market sentiment. Broader adoption will depend on delivering real metaverse utility beyond branding. Risks & Considerations Volatility: Many GameFi tokens are high-beta and susceptible to speculative trends. Token Inflation & Misaligned Incentives: If token distribution is too generous, value may erode. User Retention: A game must be fun and sticky; token rewards alone can’t sustain long-term engagement. Regulation: Gaming tokens may draw scrutiny (e.g. as securities) or face regulatory shifts. Technical Execution: Bugs, security flaws, or scalability failures can derail community trust. Conclusion The GameFi sector is moving from experimental to executable. TRUE Token leads a new wave of revenue-backed projects, while established tokens like IMX, GALA, and SAND continue building out their ecosystems. Each carries distinct upside and risk, so any investment should be grounded in deep research and risk management.

Fidelity’s FBTC led the rebound with $132.67 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded minor redemptions. This resurgence signals a return of institutional appetite, likely fueled by dip-buying and easing macroeconomic fears. Since ETF issuers must purchase Bitcoin to back new shares, these inflows translate directly into spot market buying pressure. If momentum continues through the week, it could mark a broader phase of institutional accumulation after a brief cooling period. Meanwhile, Outset PR—a data-driven crypto PR agency—monitors global media trends through its Outset Data Pulse reporting intelligence. It provides consistent benchmarking of media outlets across regions, actionable intelligence for PR and marketing teams, and predictive insights into adoption waves. Corporate BTC Holdings Jump 40% in Q3 Corporate adoption is accelerating. Publicly listed firms now hold 1.02 million BTC (around $117 billion), reflecting a 40% increase in the third quarter, according to Bitwise. MicroStrategy remains the clear leader, with 640,250 BTC on its balance sheet, but the report highlights 48 new companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. This steady rise in corporate exposure tightens liquid supply, reducing the amount of Bitcoin available for trading and heightening price sensitivity to new demand. Such long-term holding behavior counters short-term retail selling, reinforcing the structural bullish foundation beneath Bitcoin’s price action. Technicals Show Resilience Near $111,500 On the technical side, Bitcoin continues to hold firm around $111,500, the midpoint of its current trading range between $126,000 and $97,700. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) remains intact at $107,131, indicating sustained long-term support, while an RSI of 44 reflects a neutral momentum phase. Maintaining the $111,500 level prevents a deeper correction toward $100K. Still, BTC sits 11.6% below its all-time high, with key resistance ahead at $117,940 (38.2% Fibonacci level). A daily close above $113,537 could confirm a short-term bullish breakout. Outset PR Turns Media Intelligence into Visible PR Performance Beyond market data, Outset PR shows how analytics-driven strategy transforms PR into measurable outcomes. Its intelligence reporting system, Outset Data Pulse benchmarks outlets across regions, provides actionable intelligence for communications teams, and offers predictive insight into adoption waves by mapping media dynamics, algorithm shifts, and user behavior. Additionally, Outset PR has developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion Bitcoin’s latest recovery reflects renewed institutional participation, a tightening corporate supply dynamic, and technical stability at a crucial level. While global macro factors—such as U.S.–China trade tensions—still pose risks, the market appears to be stabilizing after recent volatility. If inflows persist and BTC breaks above short-term resistance, the $120K target may soon come back into focus. Meanwhile, Outset PR demonstrates how data intelligence elevates strategic communication.

CMB International Asset Management Limited has partnered with BNB Chain to tokenize the CMB International USD Money Market Fund by issuing two tokens that will be available to accredited investors, the companies said in a statement. The two tokens – CMBMINT and CMBIMINT – will be distributed by DigiFT, a crypto exchange focusing on tokenized RWAs, and investment platform OnChain, respectively. BNB Chain stated in its statement that protocols like Venus Protocol and Lista Dao will integrate CMBMINT and CMBIMINT support, bringing DeFi benefits such as collateralized lending and yield strategies to these tokens. It was also stated that the fund in question was not an ordinary fund, and that the fund ranked number 1 among its competitors in the APAC money market as of October 2025 and managed over $3.8 billion in assets. Additionally, it was stated that accredited investors will now be able to access BNB Chain directly through secure and compliant tokenization. Finally, BNB Chain added in its announcement that the collaboration with CMBI Asset Management is a milestone in bringing RWAs to one of the most active blockchain ecosystems. *This is not investment advice.

When narratives shift and attention intensifies, strategic timing and optimal visibility are paramount. Data-centric agencies like Outset PR meticulously track both token performance and media trends to identify when market sentiment begins to turn. Such awareness enables teams to craft insights and stories that align with the rhythm of the market—amplifying visibility precisely when investor attention peaks. When narratives constantly evolve and attention intensifies, strategic timing and optimal visibility are crucial. Outset PR , a data-centric crypto PR agency, specializes in meticulously tracking media trends. This allows them to craft insights and stories that resonate with the market's rhythm. By amplifying visibility precisely when investor attention is at its peak, Outset PR ensures maximum impact. Technical Setup: Rebound from $2.52 Support XRP recently rebounded from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2.52, signaling an early defense of short-term support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) sits at 37.31, reflecting a neutral but cautious sentiment, while the MACD indicator continues to hint at lingering bearish pressure. Analysts are watching the $2.96 resistance level (0.888 Fibonacci) as a decisive point that could define the next major move. If XRP breaks and holds above $2.70—a zone that has acted as a breakout level since August—momentum could accelerate toward the psychological $3.00 mark. Volume Weakness Signals Caution While short-term traders have been buying the dip, overall trading activity remains subdued. 24-hour turnover has dropped by roughly 30%, suggesting that many participants are staying on the sidelines until clearer signals emerge. This muted volume raises the risk of a false breakout, especially if XRP fails to maintain support above $2.70. A rejection at that level could lead to another retest of $2.14, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, where buyers last stepped in aggressively. ETF Hopes and Whale Activity Drive Sentiment Much of XRP’s recovery momentum appears tied to speculation about potential ETF developments and institutional accumulation. As broader crypto markets respond to expanding ETF demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, traders are betting XRP could follow, especially if regulatory clarity improves in the U.S. However, mixed on-chain signals—such as inconsistent whale accumulation patterns—highlight that not all large holders are fully convinced of a near-term rally. The next few trading sessions will likely hinge on whether the $2.70 level holds, confirming renewed bullish momentum, or if delays in ETF-related news spark another round of profit-taking. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. XRP Price Prediction: All Eyes on $2.70 In the short term, $2.70 remains the defining level for XRP. A close above it could validate the recent recovery and open the path toward $3.00, while failure to hold could lead to a deeper retracement toward $2.14. As the market digests ETF speculation and technical signals, agencies like Outset PR continue to monitor these rapid shifts—transforming emerging trends into actionable insights and timely communication strategies. When price moves and media attention converge, precision in both analysis and storytelling becomes the key to lasting impact.

This dramatic change has stirred curiosity and speculation among traders. The article will explore whether this event indicates a potential shift in the market and which coins might be poised for growth. Shiba Inu Sees Volatility: Is a Bullish Breakout Possible? Source: tradingview Shiba Inu is trading between $0.000008 and $0.000013 recently. With recent dips, the price is down over fourteen percent in the past week and around twenty-four percent in the last month. Despite these declines, the low Relative Strength Index suggests SHIB is oversold, hinting at a possible bounce back. The immediate resistance is at just over $0.000015, which would mark a rise of about twenty percent from the higher end of its range. If momentum builds, it could test nearly $0.000020, indicating a potential surge of over fifty percent. However, it's still close to its support level, so cautious optimism is key. Conclusion The sharp increase in transactions related to SHIB, driven by a recent burn event, points to heightened interest. This may signal a possible upward movement in its value. Historical data shows that significant burns can lead to a reduction in supply, potentially increasing demand. With the current surge in activity, monitoring SHIB's market trends could be crucial. A bullish reversal might be on the horizon if the activity continues to rise. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC's short-term outlook depends on defending the 200D average and volatility normalizing, with resistance at the 126k level. On-chain data shows long-term holders are not capitulating, suggesting the move was a leverage purge, not a macro top. The bullish bias remains, contingent on stable on-chain signals, ETF inflows, and no further trade-policy shocks disrupting the market. The Story TradingView Last Friday’s candle left a mark rarely seen in Bitcoin. A tremendous whiplash of about $13,000 (-10.7%) in a matter of hours, with a deep fuse that went to look for the 200-day average zone (the yellow line of the graph) and an immediate rebound from there. It was a manual deleveraging. There was too much leverage built up in derivatives, stops piled up on obvious supports, and liquidity compressed into a maturing day. In the short term, that touch and defense of the 200D suggests that the first relevant support is already identified (111k–115k) and that the resistance above is still the 126k strip marked on the graph. Reading after such a violent movement is that it is normal to see days of “digestion” (wide ranges, bounces that test resistances and possible second passes to the support). If spot and ETF flows return and volatility normalizes without another liquidity scare, the baseline scenario is one of bullish reconstruction. Hyperliquid A spin of “spies” and insider trading has been added to Friday. Several on-chain and press sources have pointed to a newly created account at Hyperliquid that opened massive shorts on BTC and ETH minutes before Trump's post on China tariffs and that would have later closed with an estimated P&L of $150–200 M. The portfolios being followed, in case the reader wants to investigate, are: 0xb317d2bc2d3d2df5fa441b5bae0ab9d8b07283ae 0x2ea18c23f72a4b6172c55b411823cdc5335923f4 In parallel, that same operator would have reopened additional shorts after the crash, reaching sizes between $150 and $400 M in new positions, according to The Block and crypto press reviews. There are accusations of “insider trading”, but the supposedly involved denies this publicly, and, for the moment, there is no conclusive evidence beyond timing and on-chain flows. In any case, the macro context fits with this theory. The tariffs tweet was the precursor to a record deleveraging, with $19 settled in 24 hours, the largest settlement day on record, and a sweep that took BTC from 121k to the 106–110k zone before the rebound. The fact that a big actor has “anticipated” the headline does not change the background reading that we pointed out above. Last Friday’s event was a leverage purge in a market with tight liquidity and stacked stops; going forward, the focus is on whether the asset can defend the 200D average and whether volatility normalizes without further trade-policy shocks. If that happens, the baseline scenario remains a staggered reconstruction. The Perspectives Node Analytica Following Friday’s whiplash, the indicator that captures whether long-term holders are spending (the gray bars/area and the BI line on the 0–1 scale) showed distribution pulses, but without sustained de-anchoring to a “high-risk” zone (≈0.9). We saw a profit-taking in strong hands, yes, but not a capitulation of old currencies. Moreover, LTH (orange line) supply has been falling since its highs but remains high in cyclical terms, suggesting that the “hard core” did not sell in panic. Looking ahead to the coming weeks, as long as the BI does not soar and remains below the red threshold, the reading is compatible with a leverage purge rather than a macro ceiling. The signal to watch out for would be a persistent jump in GDP toward 0.9, with a clear loss in 200D, reinforcing the scenario of another price sweep before resuming a trend. Node Analytica The percentage of offer in profit (orange) remains high even after Friday's sweep, and the NPC (blue) marked very negative readings (own distribution and forced liquidations) that, historically, tend to reverse when fast sellers run out. The fact that most coins remain “green” after such a fall is an important nuance, as it reduces the likelihood of distress sales and favors lateral digestion phases with rebounds towards resistances (in our price graph, the 126k zone). This bias is invalidated if the supply to profit drops rapidly towards stress levels and the NPC remains deeply negative for several consecutive weeks (signal of more structural distribution and high risk of support rupture). Node Analytica The trend signal receded after the shock but remains positive (+11% on the panel), aligned with the idea that Friday’s move responds more to a liquidity shock than to a regime change. As long as the signal does not decisively cross negative ground and the price respects the average of 200 sessions, the dominant playbook is the step-by-step reconstruction (wide range, validation of supports, ordered attack on resistors). A sustained crossover of the signal below 0% alongside below-200D closures would shift the focus to defense and risk management, with an eye toward intermediate supports before setting new highs. On the risk front, the most visible is the repetition of trade policy holders reopening the forced-selling channel in derivatives (a market still sensitive to the recent redistribution of leverage). A possible tightening of financial conditions via a strong dollar or a rebound in real yields is also weighing in. As a counterweight, positive catalysts go through sustained net inflows into spot and ETF, normalization of funding without abrupt upswings, and implicit volatility that descends by notches (facilitating trend reconstruction and carrying directional positions). The final thesis is a maintenance of the bullish bias conditioned on the signals commented on in the analysis.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence data, the MSCI Europe Industrials Index is expected to deliver 4.9% earnings-per-share (EPS) growth for the third quarter. By comparison, technology is forecast at 4.2% EPS growth, while communication services follow at 3.3%. Companies involved in electrification have been the biggest beneficiaries of the boost in sales and revenue linked to the increase in AI adoption and the development of data centers. AI and defense spending lead industrial surge Europe’s industrial firms are set to outperform all other sectors this earnings season, due to an increase in investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure and defense spending . The capital goods segment is projected to have 15% EPS growth for the quarter. Strategist Kaidi Meng says that about half of that growth is due to Siemens Energy AG, ABB Ltd., and Prysmian SpA. These companies are leveraging the growing demand for electrification. “Electrification is a derivative of the AI spending and rollout of data centers,” Bloomberg Intelligence strategist, Laurent Douillet, said. He added, “Given the market view that AI spending will grow even bigger next year, this segment continues to do well.” ABB, the leader of the automation market in Germany, has been collaborating with Nvidia Corp. to develop next-generation AI data centers. Prysmian, an Italian cable manufacturer, recently saw its price target raised by UBS Group AG due to its exposure to U.S. data center expansion. Citigroup analyst Vivek Midha also expects Prysmian to announce a guidance upgrade and called the products responsible for the company’s growth “durable.” Siemens Energy is benefiting from what analysts describe as “unprecedented order momentum and solid execution.” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Omid Vaziri and Pauline Eschbach predict that the firm could raise its mid-term targets at its fiscal fourth-quarter results in November due to a stronger-than-expected demand for gas turbines and grid technologies. Manufacturers such as Rheinmetall AG, Thales SA, and Leonardo SpA are expected to report strong figures for the fiscal year, boosted by increased defense spending. Europe’s industrial market shows resilience Analysts have raised estimates for European industrial and financial companies, but they’ve lowered expectations for the overall Stoxx Europe 600 index. According to Douillet, the industrial sector’s outperformance could continue until 2026 if investments into electrification and defense remain strong. Recent data shows that the MSCI Europe Industrials Index has outperformed the overall MSCI Europe Index since October 2024. “The impact of major infrastructure investments in Germany, combined with lower interest rates benefiting construction, will likely provide an additional boost,” he said. Germany’s industrial production fell 4.3% in August from the previous month. Companies such as SKF AB, Atlas Copco AB, and Siemens AG may feel the impact in their automotive and industrial technology divisions. The ongoing U.S.-China tariff dispute could also hurt demand and pricing for European manufacturers. Douillet warned that many firms may have rushed to ship and sell more of their products earlier in the year to get ahead of potential tariffs, which creates uncertainty about sales and shipments in the second half of the year. An escalation in trade hostilities could reduce Chinese demand for European industrial products while boosting the competitiveness of domestic Chinese firms. “If China retaliates, it could further erode European market share,” Douillet cautioned. Swedish industrial companies are also facing issues due to the strong krona and a weak U.S. dollar, as that could affect export revenues and profit margins.

Among the growing list of DeFi projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has stood out for its working structure and clear token utility. Experts studying the fundamentals believe it may be one of the few tokens ready to deliver strong performance after its launch. The project’s approach is practical and measurable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) connects lenders and borrowers directly through decentralized contracts, letting both sides interact without middlemen. As the presale continues, the token trades at $0.035, with over 68% of Phase 6 already sold out. More than 17,100 holders have joined, contributing $17.35 million so far. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, marking a 15% step forward. Analysts describe this as one of the last chances to enter before listings begin. Why Analysts See Strong Demand Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not built on speculation. It follows a dual lending model that supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) negotiated loans. This structure attracts different types of users — from individuals lending stablecoins to larger investors seeking higher returns through direct deals. Because both groups interact inside the same ecosystem, overall liquidity and activity are expected to grow together. When the platform goes live, lenders will deposit assets into the system and receive mtTokens in return. These tokens will represent their deposits and help them earn passive income from borrowing activity. Borrowers, on the other hand, will lock up collateral and access loans through Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s secure smart contracts. As users repay their loans or stake tokens, more MUTM tokens will move within the network, driving consistent activity and transaction flow. The MUTM token will also play a central role in the ecosystem’s future stablecoin. Every time users mint or repay these coins, new demand for MUTM will appear on-chain. This design ensures that value is linked directly to platform usage, not external speculation. Analysts view this as a major advantage since it connects token growth to real activity rather than social hype or market noise. Data, Development, and the Road Ahead One feature that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its synchronized launch plan. The team aims to release both the platform and the token together, giving traders a product with instant purpose from day one. This approach is rare in crypto investing, where many projects release tokens long before their platforms are ready. Because the protocol recently gave their proceedings on modules for lending, borrowing, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, industry experts expect smoother adoption during the live rollout. The upcoming V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 will showcase these components, helping analysts verify the platform’s functionality before the full launch. This test phase also builds confidence that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand out among DeFi projects seeking early potential listings on Tier-1 exchanges once the ecosystem goes public. For investors tracking crypto prices and long-term value, the token’s presale journey already tells a clear story. A participant who joined in Phase 4 with $8,000 at $0.025 now holds 320,000 tokens valued at $11,200 at the current $0.035 rate — a gain that reflects the project’s strong momentum even before launch. At the upcoming price of $0.040, new buyers will still enter early compared to projected post-listing levels. The system also includes a buyback-and-distribute loop, where protocol revenue will return to the market to purchase MUTM tokens. These tokens will then be distributed to active stakers as rewards. This process will continuously recycle value within the network and reward those who hold long-term positions. Live Leaderboard The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 24-hours leaderboard is already live, giving the community a clear look at ongoing participation and engagement. The user holding the top spot each day will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that 24-hour period. The leaderboard automatically refreshes every day at 00:00 UTC. Analysts say the combination of a functioning DeFi platform, synchronized token launch, and transparent progress makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most watched crypto investing stories this year. As attention grows, so does anticipation for its upcoming listings and the $100,000 giveaway campaign that will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. With 68% of Phase 6 already sold and the next price set at $0.040, early supporters are positioning themselves before the next announcement. For those tracking emerging opportunities in crypto prices, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents more than a token — it’s a full ecosystem ready to reshape decentralized lending. Smart money always moves first, and this presale may be one of those moments that defines the next DeFi crypto story which is successful.

Insights from cryptocurrency analysts suggest that Mutuum Finance, currently in its presale phase priced at $0.035 per token, could soon see significant growth. This DeFi platform is unique in that it facilitates direct connections between lenders and borrowers through decentralized contracts, effectively removing the need for intermediaries. With the current phase close to completion and an impending price increase to $0.040, interest among crypto investors is spiking. What makes Mutuum Finance particularly promising is its dual lending model, which accommodates both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans, making the platform attractive to a wide array of users, from individual stablecoin lenders to large-scale investors seeking lucrative direct lending opportunities. The Functional Core of Mutuum Finance The operational model of Mutuum Finance includes issuing mtTokens to lenders as a form of receipt for their deposited assets, which accrues passive income through borrowing activities. Borrowers, on the other hand, secure loans by locking up collateral. This economic activity within the platform ensures a constant flow of MUTM tokens, bolstering the system's liquidity and overall transaction volume. The token's utility is further expected to expand with the introduction of a platform-native stablecoin, anticipated to drive on-chain demand for MUTM. This direct linkage of the token’s utility to actual platform use is a strategic design aimed at fostering genuine growth rather than speculative trading. Strategic Developments and Future Plans Mutuum Finance's roadmap includes the synchronized launch of both the token and the platform, which is a strategic move to ensure that the tokens have immediate utility. This contrasts with typical cryptocurrency projects which often launch their tokens far ahead of their platform's operational readiness. The project's development team has recently updated the community on progress in key areas such as lending, borrowing, and the integration of a liquidator bot. These advancements are poised to be showcased in the upcoming V1 release on the Sepolia Testnet, scheduled for Q4 2025. The scheduled test phase is critical, as it is set to demonstrate the platform’s functionalities before it goes fully live, potentially positioning Mutuum Finance for early listings on major exchanges. The financial trajectory of the token during its presale is already telling a compelling story of growth, with significant gains for early investors and a solid setup for new participants aiming to buy in before prices rise in the next phase. Engagement and Community Incentives As part of its community engagement strategy, Mutuum Finance has implemented a 24-hour leaderboard that tracks user activity and rewards top participants with MUTM bonuses, enhancing user involvement and investment in the platform's success. Moreover, the platform has announced a $100,000 giveaway , promising substantial rewards to foster community growth and loyalty as it navigates the crowded DeFi space.

The highly-popular meme coin has suffered in the wake of profit-taking as well market-wide crash, but analysts warn that should SHIB retake significant resistance levels, a modest rebound could materialise in the near-term future. Despite possible redemption, the vast majority of investors are coming to wonder if SHIB still possesses the explosive potential that defined the 2021 surge. At a current price of just $0.035 and in the 6th phase of presale with over 65% already sold out, MUTM has already made it one of the most discussed DeFi projects of 2025. With the intent to bring real utility through the creation of an innovative double-lending model along with scalable design, the project has sparked interest among early investors who look to achieve prospective 5,000% gains once it hits the market. The new opportunity that will define the next bull cycle may be Mutuum Finance. Shiba Price Analysis Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently range-bound between pivotal prices, exhibiting signals of potential reversal after recent losses. The token supports above a significant support area between $0.00000510 and $0.00000988, a region that has in the past offered strong buying interest. So long as this level supports, SHIB may gain momentum towards a push to its next resistance level at $0.00001301, a region that has seen repeated tests. A verified breakthrough above that resistance will pave the way towards a surge to $0.00003528, yielding about 35% potential gain from the current price levels. As traders watch these significant price levels for verification of the bullish breakout, investors are also expanding the scope of interest to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the emerging project that is drawing interest as market sentiment continues to fluctuate. Mutuum Finance’s Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roars in presale where it has successfully raised over $17.35 million in Phase 6 from over 17,040 holders. More than 65% of Phase 6 has been sold to date. Early bird investors are setting themselves up for life-changing gains as MUTM gains traction in 2025. Mutuum Finance is scheduled to launch a lending and borrowing protocol , whose Version 1 will be released on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Liquidity pools will be introduced in the protocol along with mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquid bot. ETH will be allowed on the first day along with USDT to be lendable, borrowable, and collateralizable. Mutuum Finance protocol is based on the close-order book system of market risk management as well as illiquidity protection. Typical features such as close-level terms, liquidation levels, as well as liquidator incentives are duly dynamically determined such that prudent as well as credible lending is provided. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios as well as the factors of liquidation are duly varied dynamically with regard to the volatility of the assets such that riskier assets are dealt with tighter loan terms. Additional risk-weighted multipliers are also utilized within the defined classes of assets to ensure stability, security, as well as resilience even during stress market conditions. Mutuum Finance Beats SHIB in 2025 While Shiba Inu (SHIB) can’t regain momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the limelight with real utility and early development potential. The project has secured $17.35 million from 17,000+ investors with 65% of Phase 6 filled at $0.035. The double-lending platform, interactive LTV model, and future release of the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 makes MUTM one of the most promising projects in the DeFi ecosystem. Invest early in the presale of Mutuum Finance to secure your position before the end of Phase 6.

Key Takeaways: Indonesia’s crypto industry could add $16.5 billion to the economy and create 1.22 million jobs. In 2024 alone, crypto activities contributed $4.4 billion to GDP and generated over 333,000 jobs. The report urges stronger regulation, digital literacy, and tax reform to ensure sustainable growth. According to a study by the University of Indonesia’s Institute for Economic and Social Research (LPEM FEB UI), crypto trading could boost the country’s GDP by 0.86% to 1.18% if trading profits are reinvested locally in productive sectors. “The real economic impact will only be felt if crypto trading profits are used locally in productive ways,” said LPEM FEB UI researcher Prani Sastiono during the launch event in Jakarta. Indonesia’s Crypto Sector Added $4.4B to Economy and 333,000 Jobs in 2024 In 2024 alone, crypto-related activities contributed Rp70.04 trillion ($4.4 billion) to Indonesia’s economy, representing 0.32% of GDP, and generated more than 333,000 jobs, the report found. The researchers believe these figures could grow significantly with clear regulations, improved oversight, and higher financial literacy. To harness this potential, the study outlines five policy recommendations. These include strengthening supervision of illegal trading platforms, improving digital literacy and user data protection, and expanding crypto product diversity, including asset-backed stablecoins and tokenized local projects. Furthermore, the study suggests reforming crypto taxation to maintain competitiveness while ensuring government revenue and updating advertising guidelines to let licensed platforms promote responsibly. Indonesia’s crypto adoption has surged in recent years, but regulators are still refining rules to balance innovation with consumer protection. BIG NEWS: Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve. We were invited to the Vice President’s office to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country. What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 Dino Milano Siregar, head of the Digital Financial Innovation and Crypto Asset Oversight Department at the Financial Services Authority (OJK), said effective supervision must go beyond borders. “Crypto is inherently borderless, so supervision cannot be done in isolation. It requires coordination among local and global institutions,” Siregar said at a forum hosted by LPEM FEB UI on October 8. Domestically, OJK is working with the Task Force for the Eradication of Illegal Financial Activities (Satgas PASTI) and the Indonesia Anti-Scam Centre (IASC) to tackle fraud and illegal trading. The regulator also cooperates with Bank Indonesia, the National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN), and international partners such as the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to enhance cross-border monitoring. MEXC Backs Indonesia’s Crypto Exchange Triv As reported, MEXC Ventures has taken a strategic bet on Indonesia’s growing crypto market, investing in crypto exchange Triv at a $200 million valuation. The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia’s updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. Notably, the Indonesian government is reportedly weighing the use of Bitcoin as a reserve asset , according to Bitcoin Indonesia, which met with officials from the Vice President’s office to pitch the idea as part of a broader national economic strategy.

Speaking at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum, Bessent said the government will not start talks with Beijing simply because stocks are falling. He stressed that trade decisions will be based on what makes economic sense for America, not on market reactions. Bessent took aim at a Wall Street Journal story published overnight that suggested Chinese leaders think another big market drop will eventually push President Donald Trump to the negotiating table. The newspaper reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes the American economy cannot handle a long trade fight with China, according to sources familiar with Beijing’s thinking. The Treasury chief called the Journal report “terrible” and accused the publication of taking “CCP dictation.” His remarks came during a period of wild market swings tied to the uncertain state of trade discussions between the world’s two biggest economies. Stocks dropped hard on Friday after Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports to respond to new rules China put in place restricting exports of rare earth minerals. Bessent said on Wednesday that although Trump appreciates a strong stock market, the president views market strength as an outcome of effective policy decisions rather than a goal in itself. He cited increased AI investment as one example of how policy initiatives are fueling stock market growth. Bessent said he expects the United States and several partner countries to respond together to China’s move. He noted that finance leaders from around the world are in Washington this week for the yearly meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. “We’re going to be speaking with our European allies, with Australia, with Canada, with India and the Asian democracies,” Bessent said earlier at the forum. The back-and-forth moves between Washington and Beijing have made investors worried that the two largest economies might soon be in a full trade war. Longer tariff pause for China on the table The Treasury Secretary also revealed that the administration is considering a longer break from the high tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing agrees to drop its planned tighter limits on critical rare earth materials. Starting from earlier this year, the U.S. and China have implemented successive 90-day suspensions of import tariffs that had reached as high as 145%. Another deadline is approaching in November. The Trump administration is now attempting to block China’s proposed strict export restrictions on rare earth elements through a dual strategy which is providing incentives if China drops the measure and imposing severe consequences if it moves forward with the restrictions. “Is it possible that we could go to a longer roll in return? Perhaps. But all that’s going to be negotiated in the coming weeks,” Bessent said Wednesday at a press conference in Washington. Presidential meeting still expected As Cryptopolitan reported, Trump said there was no reason to meet Xi. However, Bessent said Trump “is a go” on meeting Xi later this month in South Korea, as far as he knows. He adde d th ere is a “very good chance” he will travel to Asia before Trump and meet with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. Bessent said he expected trade announcements to be made during Trump’s Asia tour. The president is expected to attend a summit wit h As sociation of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia before going on to Japan and South Korea, which will be hosting the yearly Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders meeting. The U.S. is “about to finish up” negotiations with South Korea, Bessent added. Those talks have lately revolved around the outlines of a giant investment program. U.S.-Canada talks are “back on track,” Bessent also said. He also indicated progress with India. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

53184599,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86446,1760544314,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Technical Analyst: Buy XRP ASAP. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-buy-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"A fresh wave of optimism is sweeping through the crypto community following a powerful message from market analyst Levi Rietveld, who has urged investors to buy XRP . His post, coupled with a detailed video analysis, has reignited bullish sentiment around XRP, prompting both excitement and scrutiny among traders seeking confirmation that the next big breakout might already be forming. Levi Rietveld’s Bold Call and Market Thesis Rietveld, the founder of Crypto Crusaders, is no stranger to bold market predictions. In his latest X post, he declared, “I’ve seen too many V-shaped recoveries on XRP after black swan events to not buy like crazy right now.” The statement underscores his conviction that XRP is preparing for a swift and powerful rebound — one that could, in his words, “take us to new all-time highs, $10 to $20 per coin.” BUY #XRP ASAP!!! pic.twitter.com/PFGllRL7FU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 14, 2025 He describes the current structure as a textbook “V-shaped recovery,” emphasizing that “we had the massive correction and now we’re starting to work our way back up — the V is forming.” According to him, rising trading volumes, renewed investor confidence, and favorable macro trends are converging to form a “perfect storm” for bullish momentum. Macroeconomic Context: Liquidity Tailwinds Across Markets In Rietveld’s analysis, XRP’s rebound cannot be viewed in isolation. He notes that the stock market recently gained over 1.5% in a single day, adding more than $850 billion in market capitalization, while gold reached fresh all-time highs. To him, this is a critical alignment — “crypto behaves very similarly to gold; it just trails behind gold a little bit,” he explained. This observation ties into a broader macroeconomic narrative: as traditional markets expand and liquidity floods back into risk assets, cryptocurrencies like XRP could be next in line to benefit. Analysts generally agree that such liquidity waves often rotate into digital assets once investors regain confidence in speculative sectors. The Technical Structure Technically, a V-shaped recovery describes a rapid sell-off followed by an equally fast rebound. Rietveld argues that XRP’s recent price behavior fits this model precisely. “We’re still at $2.60 and showing really great signs of recovery. A lot more volume is coming in — that’s a very positive sign, guys,” he stated in his video. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Indeed, market data confirms increasing trading volumes and sustained buy-side interest, suggesting that the correction phase might be giving way to early-stage accumulation. Historical patterns show that XRP has often rebounded sharply after deep retracements, lending credibility to Rietveld’s observation — though it remains a high-risk, high-reward thesis. Price Targets and Potential Scenarios Rietveld’s long-term vision extends beyond short-term gains. He foresees the possibility of XRP revisiting and surpassing its previous all-time highs, should institutional demand accelerate. “ XRP supply shock incoming!” he warned in an earlier post, suggesting that ongoing accumulation could eventually strain liquidity and push prices higher. Still, analysts caution that such targets — including Rietveld’s forecast of $10 to $20 per coin — would require sustained volume expansion, large-scale adoption, and renewed regulatory clarity. Without these catalysts, the path to such ambitious valuations remains speculative. Discipline Over Hype Levi Rietveld’s call to “buy XRP ASAP” has undeniably reignited interest in the token, but traders should balance enthusiasm with prudence. Defining entry points, setting stop levels, and tracking on-chain activity are essential before following any social media-driven trade signal. In essence, Rietveld’s analysis captures a compelling narrative — that XRP’s market structure and global liquidity conditions could be aligning for an explosive rally. Whether this moment marks the start of that breakout or just another temporary bounce will depend on how price, volume, and macro trends evolve in the weeks ahead. For now, XRP stands at a pivotal juncture — and Rietveld’s confident call has once again placed it squarely in the spotlight.

53184712,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/when-crypto-press-releases-deliver-roi-and-when-they-just-drain-your-budget,1760544372,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53184712.jpeg,When Crypto Press Releases Deliver ROI – And When They Just Drain Your Budget,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/when-crypto-press-releases-deliver-roi-and-when-they-just-drain-your-budget,"In crypto, attention operates like a currency—and it's highly volatile. A press release can still shift the market of perception, but only when deployed with strategic intent. Used indiscriminately, it burns budget, clutters information channels, and diverts team focus from tactics that actually convert. Used with precision, it anchors critical milestones, strengthens SEO foundations, and opens doors that remain otherwise inaccessible. So when does a crypto press release actually work—and when does it just waste resources? Think of the press release as a format, not a complete strategy. It's a specialized tool within a broader communications ecosystem that includes founder threads on X, long-form posts on Medium/Substack, community AMAs, thought-leadership op-eds, and direct journalist outreach. Each channel serves a distinct purpose. The press release's specific job is credibility through formality, searchable permanence, and scalable distribution—when you genuinely need those attributes. Before committing resources, ask: What outcome are we purchasing? Proof-of-record? Backlink authority? A consistent cadence to fuel Google Discover? Third-party logos for fundraising materials? If you can't articulate the answer in one clear sentence, you're likely funding a vanity line item. Table of Contents Five Scenarios Where Press Releases Deliver Value 1. Activating a News Trigger 2. SEO and Link Building 3. High-Frequency Visibility Strategy 4. Brand Credibility and Social Proof 5. Access to Selective Outlets When It's Just Wasted Budget Quick Decision Framework What a High-Impact Crypto Press Release Must Include The Final Verdict Five Scenarios Where Press Releases Deliver Value TL;DR: Press releases still generate returns in crypto —but only for (1) official records that catalyze coverage, (2) SEO and link-building infrastructure, (3) sustained visibility campaigns, (4) credibility proof points for stakeholders, and (5) gaining entry to selective publications. For everything else, allocate budget to higher-converting channels. 1. Activating a News Trigger When a project reaches a genuine milestone—mainnet launch, major partnership, exchange listing, funding announcement, token economics framework, or a ""we shipped it"" moment—a press release functions as the official statement of record. It provides journalists, investors, and community researchers with a canonical source to reference in future coverage. Deployed this way, the crypto release becomes the foundation that subsequent organic coverage can build upon. However, it's not the only trigger mechanism. In crypto, owned channels often move faster and feel more authentic: A founder's X thread explaining what's new and why it matters A detailed Medium/Substack post with diagrams, audit links, and comprehensive FAQs A GitHub release tag plus changelog for deeply technical audiences Choose the trigger that best matches your audience and required velocity. A press release can follow to formalize the record and support search discoverability. 2. SEO and Link Building Newswire syndication packages that distribute to dozens of smaller outlets aren't designed for human readership—they're engineered for backlink authority. At scale, those links can enhance your search rankings and help your documentation, blog, and landing pages surface more reliably in search results. Approach this as a technical SEO investment: Optimize anchor text and link targets (documentation, feature pages, pricing, audit reports) Time releases to coincide with product launches so your link graph reinforces your narrative Measure success through search console metrics and domain authority growth, not direct traffic from the wire 3. High-Frequency Visibility Strategy Some strategies prioritize surface area over engagement depth—maintaining visibility across Google Discover, reinforcing keyword presence, or sustaining regular brand mentions during competitive windows (e.g., pre-listing periods, hackathon seasons, ecosystem showcases). Here, format matters less than frequency and consistency. This approach targets recall, not immediate persuasion. If credibility is your primary gap, select a different tactic. If repetition and breadth drive your goals, press releases can function as a scalable, repeatable mechanism in your mix. 4. Brand Credibility and Social Proof Sometimes the strategic objective is social proof: placing recognizable media logos in pitch decks, on homepages, or in investor updates. These placements often exist deep within newswire archives—rarely read by retail audiences, but visually persuasive for gatekeepers who equate logo presence with legitimacy. Used intentionally, this constitutes a valid reputational tactic . Used reflexively, it's ego spending. Be honest about which category you're operating in—and price it accordingly. 5. Access to Selective Outlets Top-tier crypto publications can be highly selective, favoring organic commentary or exclusive stories. When owned contributions aren't feasible and reporter bandwidth is constrained, a well-crafted release can serve as a bridge: it creates a verifiable footprint, provides editors with a fact base, and occasionally earns minimal placement in outlets that otherwise wouldn't engage. It's not a replacement for relationships or genuine newsworthiness, but it can be the only practical entry point in specific cases—especially for emerging teams without established media track records. When It's Just Wasted Budget If you can't connect the release to a specific, measurable objective—record, SEO, visibility, proof, or access—you're likely funding shelfware. Crypto audiences reward clarity, transparency, and community-first storytelling far more than a formal document syndicated across distribution networks. The opportunity cost is substantial: those dollars could fund founder-led content, community AMAs, analyst briefings, or integrations that generate actual usage and organic word-of-mouth momentum. Quick Decision Framework Use this one-minute diagnostic before greenlighting a release: 1. Outcome clarity: Can you name the single primary outcome? (Record / SEO / Visibility / Proof / Access) 2. Audience fit: Who specifically needs this format? (Journalists, search algorithms, investors, editorial gatekeepers) 3. Timing validation: Is there a genuine milestone or narrative arc happening right now? 4. Redundancy check: Would an X thread or blog post accomplish 80% of the same objective faster and more authentically? 5. Measurement plan: What exact metric will demonstrate success? (Media citations, referring domains, impression volume, logo usage in deals, editor responses) If you can't answer these clearly, don't ship a release—ship a thread or owned post instead. What a High-Impact Crypto Press Release Must Include If you decide a press release serves your strategy, ensure it contains: ✓ Clear headline + precise subhead (blockchain, product, integration details, dates) ✓ One-sentence value proposition in plain English, free of jargon ✓ Concrete proof (audit links, partner quotes, on-chain references, repository links) ✓ Quotes that add genuine context, not generic fluff (from founders and ecosystem partners) ✓ Specific next step (documentation, demo environment, testnet/mainnet URL) ✓ Media kit link (logos, screenshots, technical diagrams) ✓ Clear contact and attribution (including official X account for rapid follow-ups) The Final Verdict Is a crypto press release worth the investment? Yes—when it serves a clearly defined strategic job. Otherwise, it's wasted budget. In a noisy, fast-evolving market, formality without function creates drag. The press release earns its place when it anchors a milestone, strengthens your link graph, maintains high-frequency presence, supplies social proof, or unlocks selective outlets. Outside those specific use cases, it becomes dead weight. Deploy it if you can identify: One primary outcome A defined audience who values the formal format A measurement plan tied directly to that outcome Skip it if: Your news is incremental or soft Your audience is primarily community-first An owned narrative (thread/post) will outperform on speed and authenticity Prioritize Your Communication Spend Like This: Ship the product or feature Explain it clearly on owned channels (X, blog, docs) Brief key journalists and analysts directly Use a press release only if it advances your strategy on record, SEO, visibility, proof, or access Final Perspective In crypto, strategic intent defines impact. A press release is neither magical nor inherently wasteful—it's a specialized instrument. Deploy it when the specific job demands that format . Otherwise, redirect your budget toward activities that compound over time: building, storytelling, and authentic community engagement. The question isn't whether press releases work in crypto—it's whether they work for your specific strategic objective at this specific moment. Answer that honestly, and your budget allocation becomes crystal clear.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-15 16:06:12

Bitcoin exploded to a record-breaking all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 last Monday, lifting the broader digital asset sector in its wake. Investor money poured into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already posted new historic highs in the last year. But the excitement didn’t last. When Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports on Friday, crypto plunged sharply. Within an hour, several leading tokens lost as much as 30%, turning the markets into a bloodbath. Many analysts, however, saw this as a necessary reset, a flush-out of over-leveraged traders that historically precedes a fresh bull run. As the market recovers, here are the top altcoins ahead of what could be the next crypto gold rush. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payments Titan Ready for More Highs XRP ($XRP) , the fuel behind Ripple’s lightning-fast, low-cost payment network, outperforms legacy payment systems like SWIFT. Support from the UN Capital Development Fund and partnerships with major U.S. banks have pushed XRP’s profile into the #3 spot, now capitalizing over $150 billion of the market. Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD, its USD-pegged stablecoin, highlights its ambition to capture a slice of the potentially explosive stablecoin market. Over the last year, XRP has soared 360%, hitting a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18, and outperforming Bitcoin’s 72% growth over the period fivefold. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 37, suggesting it’s poised for recovery after a 12% drop over the week. Crypto’s broader $3.98 trillion crypto market has bounced 2.3% in the last 24 hours, pulling XRP up 1.8%. Technical analysis shows two bullish flag formations on XRP’s summer charts. If ETF approvals materialize by mid-October, renewed optimism could propel XRP into the $5–$10 range. If long-promised comprehensive US crypto legislation arrives, then the ceiling may even be $20. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Smart Contract Platform with 2026 Ambitions Cardano ($ADA) has maintained steady growth throughout 2025, delivering 95% gains for all who have held for the last 365 days, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s original co-founders, Cardano is built on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) technology and driven by consistent research. Its academic influence even rubs off on Ethereum from time to time. With a market cap of over $25.6 billion, ADA would need to quadruple in price to challenge Solana for the title of Ethereum’s biggest killer. Trading near $0.6993, ADA jumped 4% in the last 24 hours, indicating strong post-crash accumulation. Under favorable macroeconomic conditions, ADA may see $1.50 by autumn and possibly retest its $3.09 ATH by year-end. Even absent major policy catalysts, steady adoption alone could push ADA close to $2 in 2025. From a technical angle, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern during the summer, a formation that often signals an upward breakout. Though momentum briefly waned amid September’s downturn, the setup has yet to break out. Key resistance sits near $1.15, while support zones hold between $0.65 and $0.70. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Main Rival and This Week’s Momentum Leader Solana ($SOL) continues to dominate as one of the fastest, most scalable blockchain platforms, now boasting a market cap of roughly $113 billion. Its total value locked (TVL) has climbed above $11.6 billion , reflecting surging activity across its DeFi ecosystem. Traders are eagerly awaiting U.S. approval of a Solana spot ETF, which could trigger major institutional inflows akin to Bitcoin and Ethereum’s post-ETF performances. However, an ongoing partial U.S. government shutdown has disrupted timelines. Solana’s RSI of 47 is rising again as traders buy back in, driving the token to converge once again with its 30-day moving average. Currently trading at $205, SOL finds strong support around $150, while resistance near $250 is the key barrier to another breakout. If momentum continues, Solana could revisit its ATH of $293.31, and ETF news could drive it past $500 before 2025 wraps up. Comprehensive US crypto legislation would likely be a bull-case scenario, further pushing SOL’s ceiling up to $1,000. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Layer-2 Solution to Supercharge Bitcoin Among the standout launches of 2025, an innovative meme-flavoured Layer-2 network built for Bitcoin called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly captured market attention, raising over $23.7 million in presale funds. The project’s mission is to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and versatility by combining Layer-2 infrastructure with the viral appeal of meme culture. Analysts anticipate potential 10x or higher returns post-launch as $HYPER unlocks more capabilities for the Bitcoin network. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers smart contract capabilities, fast, low-cost transactions, and a Canonical Bridge that allows near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, and meme token interoperability. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no security flaws, boosting investor trust. The HYPER token powers governance, staking, and network fees, while early investors can earn up to 50% APY through staking and participate in DAO governance.

53186218,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=836707,1760546665,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53186218.jpeg,"Morgan Stanley crushes Q3 with $4.6B profit, biggest earnings beat in five years",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/morgan-stanley-crushes-q3-with-4-6b-profit/,"Morgan Stanley just delivered a monster Q3. The bank posted a $4.61 billion profit and $18.22 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2025, completely smashing Wall Street forecasts. That profit figure was up 45% from last year, and revenue jumped 18%, both numbers blowing past what analysts were expecting. Earnings per share came in at $2.80, compared to $2.10 predicted by LSEG, making this the firm’s biggest earnings beat in nearly five years, according to Bloomberg. Shares jumped almost 5% in premarket trading after the announcement. That adds to a 24% year-to-date gain through Tuesday’s close. The surge came as every part of the business fired at once — from trading floors, to IPO desks, to the firm’s massive wealth division. This wasn’t one line carrying the quarter. This was a full-blown synchronized hit. Trading drives biggest earnings beat in five years Ted Pick, the newly named Chairman and CEO, said bluntly: “Our Integrated Firm delivered an outstanding quarter with strong performance in each of our businesses globally.” Pick pointed to the bank’s $2.80 EPS, 23.5% return on tangible common equity, and $18.2 billion in revenue as the numbers that mattered. That performance came from strong execution across the board, he said. Equities trading exploded by 35%, hitting $4.12 billion, which is $720 million more than StreetAccount expected. The firm credited the jump to higher client activity across regions and record-breaking output from its prime brokerage unit, which serves hedge funds. Fixed income trading added another $2.17 billion, which was an 8% increase over last year, nearly matching estimates. Altogether, trading brought in $6.29 billion, easily beating the $5.5 billion analysts were looking for. That figure makes this the strongest Q3 ever for Morgan Stanley’s trading operation, right on the heels of its best-ever second quarter. That kind of momentum, especially in a market shaped by macro uncertainty, is rare. The investment banking business followed that up with a 44% jump in revenue , reaching $2.11 billion, which was $430 million above expectations. The bank saw more mergers, IPOs, and fixed income fundraising activity than at the same time last year. Deals that had been on hold through late 2024 finally crossed the finish line. Wealth business grows to $8.23 billion amid record client assets Morgan Stanley’s massive wealth management arm also posted a strong quarter. Revenue hit $8.23 billion, up 13% from last year, and $500 million above forecasts. The firm brought in $81 billion in net new assets, bringing total assets across wealth and investment management to $8.9 trillion. The unit posted a 30% pre-tax margin, reflecting strong fee income and trading activity among high-net-worth clients. It’s still one of the firm’s steadiest performers, no matter what’s going on in public markets. Ted said the firm’s strategy of integrating institutional and retail services is working across all geographies. He also confirmed that they remain focused on what he called “durable growth,” not just quarter-to-quarter pops, but long-term profitability. The company also got a capital requirement cut from the Federal Reserve in September, after asking the central bank to take another look at its internal risk calculations. That decision freed up more room for Morgan Stanley to make capital decisions — including possible acquisitions.

Garlinghouse specifically said that resistance to crypto firms obtaining a “Fed master account” is “hypocritical and anti-competitive.” Speaking at the DC Fintech Week event, Garlinghouse stated that the crypto sector “should be held to the same standards” as traditional financial institutions when it comes to combating money laundering and illicit finance, adding, “If we're talking about the same standards, then we should also have access to the same infrastructure. It's inconsistent to say one thing and oppose the other.” The Fed's “master account” system allows institutions to directly integrate into the U.S. financial system and access central bank systems. However, many cryptocurrency companies have struggled due to the Fed's reluctance to approve such accounts or uncertainty about how the process will work. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Delists One Altcoin, Lists Another Ripple recently applied for a “master account” through its subsidiary, Standard Custody & Trust Co. The company also sought a federal bank license from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July. Garlinghouse stated that they have recently held more constructive discussions with banks regarding Ripple's stablecoin project, RLUSD: “I had meetings yesterday in New York with banks that refused to talk to us three years ago. Now they're asking, 'How can we collaborate on this?'” Ripple's CEO argued that granting crypto firms a master account would provide greater stability, oversight, and risk management in the financial system. “It's really disappointing that some traditional banks are lobbying against this,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Amid the controversy, Coinbase's head of the Base network, Jesse Pollak, drew attention by stating that listing fees on exchanges “should be 0%.” This statement sparked calls from the community for Coinbase to “lead by example” and list BNB for free. *This is not investment advice.

The coin has been sliding for months, and analysts keep lowering their price prediction as time goes on. During the last market crash, Pi dropped as low as $0.17 before bouncing about 50% back to $0.20, which now looks like its main support level. This all comes just weeks after Pi Network announced new features meant to push its name deeper into the DeFi scene. Pi Coin DEX Launch: Can It Really Compete? PiDaoSwap is the project’s own decentralized exchange that lets users trade tokens directly on-chain without middlemen. It operates much like Uniswap or PancakeSwap, using liquidity pools and order books to keep every trade transparent between users. What sets PiDaoSwap apart is that it’s built specifically for the Pi blockchain and will launch once the Pi Mainnet opens. If it delivers as planned, it could play the same key role for Pi that Uniswap plays for Ethereum, becoming the foundation of its DeFi ecosystem. Try out Pi’s DeFi features—DEX and AMM functionalities—on Testnet in the Pi Wallet! Watch the new walkthrough video to learn more about the features and how to get started. https://t.co/A9s1muBOnT This release expands Pi’s capabilities in a structured, utility-focused, and… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) October 13, 2025 The team says they are putting a big focus on transparency and fair pricing to prevent manipulation. The Pi Wallet will act as the main control center, giving users access to key features like swapping, exchanging, adding liquidity, and managing tokens all in one place. According to the Pi Network Core Team, this is a major step toward building the financial foundation of Pi’s ecosystem before the full mainnet launch, setting the stage for a more complete DeFi network around the project. Pi Coin Price Prediction: Will This Finally Show What Pi Is Really Worth? Source: PIUSD / TradingView The RSI at 31 shows Pi Coin is deeply oversold, similar to the rest of the market. From this point, the price likely makes a small bounce before any major move. The $0.20 support holds strong, with the price already bouncing from that level several times. Still, the bearish scenario is the more likely one unless momentum in the Pi ecosystem turns around. To flip that view, the price needs to break above $0.23 and clear that double-top area around $0.225. Maxi Doge: Can This Be The “Better Project” Than Pi? While Pi Coin price tries to find its footing and prepares for the PiDaoSwap launch, a new project is already stealing attention. Maxi Doge is quickly turning into the meme coin everyone’s talking about this cycle. Pi’s DeFi progress keeps moving, but Maxi Doge brings a whole different level of energy. It runs on Ethereum and captures the same fun, viral vibe that made Dogecoin explode, but this time it adds smarter tokenomics, strong staking rewards, and a fair launch that keeps whales from dominating early.. The project has already brought in more than $3.6 million during its presale and is offering up to 84 percent APY for early stakers. That mix of fast growth and strong rewards has traders calling it the next big meme coin to watch. More than 150 new buyers joined in the past 24 hours. This is your chance to get in early and join the presale.

This comes after Reform UK, a major political party, informed the commission that it had received a crypto donation in recent weeks. According to reports, a spokesperson for the regulator said, “We will be updating our guidance on crypto donations shortly The Commission continues to review and adapt the support we provide to parties and monitor the ways they accept donations.” So far, several areas of UK crypto regulation are clear, including requirements for financial promotions, anti-money laundering measures, and the legal recognition of crypto assets as property. However, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other regulators still have more regulations underway. Nigel Farage, head of the Reform UK party, criticized the UK’s slow progress in creating crypto regulations and urged quick action. The current laws on crypto-based donation According to Simon Steeden, a Partner at London-based legal firm Bates Wells, UK electoral law does not specifically address crypto-based donations in any way. The main legislation on donations dates from 1983 and 2000 and has only been updated since then “in a piecemeal manner.” That said, donations worth more than $663 must come only from “permissible donors,” who should generally be based in the UK. “Parties have to reject donations if they are unable to ascertain the identity of the donor (so that they can check they are permissible),” he explained. “In general, parties must take ‘all reasonable steps’ to verify or ascertain the identity of the donor and whether they are permissible.” Additionally, details of anonymous donations must be reported to the Electoral Commission, the UK’s electoral regulator, as do donations exceeding £11,180 or $14,905. The UK Government has declared its intention to reform electoral law, including the extension of the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, as well as a tightening of rules surrounding donations. A spokesperson for the Election Commission said that the upcoming changes would “close long-standing loopholes in electoral finance law” and work with the Government’s planned electoral reforms to make the process more transparent and build trust among voters. Scrutiny over crypto donations in the world According to Nigel Farage’s party, Reform UK, the value of the donation received is unknown. “All donations above the reporting limit will be disclosed in the usual way,” a spokesperson for Reform UK said . Therefore, it does not suggest that the funding was outside the window for formal declarations. Additionally, Reform UK’s crypto payments processor, Radom, is based in Poland and is not a currency registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means that the platform falls outside the regulator’s anti-money laundering supervision. Although all indications suggest that Reform UK is not breaking any laws, politicians and transparency campaigners have also raised concerns about the risks posed by introducing digital assets into political financing. There are also concerns that the regulator lacks the necessary skills and resources to thoroughly scrutinize transactions. As r eported by Cryptopolitan, the ministers of the British government stated that crypto is a potential vehicle for laundering foreign money, paying bribes, and financing political campaigns. They call it an existential threat to the country’s democracy. Besides the UK, other countries around the world are considering regulating or banning cryptocurrency donations to political campaigns. Like many democracies, Ireland aimed to shield its democracy from “foreign interference,” fake news, and clandestine campaign financing. It’s different in the United States, state by state. A handful of states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have outlawed donations made in crypto altogether. They raised questions around traceability and transparency. Some states, like California, had bans in place but rolled back those restrictions so money from crypto could again flow into campaigns, as happened when the new year arrived. El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender, permits political donations in crypto. However, civic groups have cautioned that external forces can easily manipulate the democratic process anonymously. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

53186324,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86437,1760547600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Crypto Presale of October 2025: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge, Bitcoin Hyper, & Best Wallet Token Leading Growth",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-presale-of-october-2025-blockdag-maxi-doge-bitcoin/,"Presale season is heating up again, and buyers are focusing on projects that show real progress rather than empty promises. With several new coins reaching major funding milestones and some already launching live testnets or forming partnerships, October 2025 is turning into a busy month for early-stage crypto opportunities. Among the names attracting attention right now are BlockDAG, Maxi Doge, Bitcoin Hyper, and Best Wallet Token. Each brings something distinct, from record-breaking raises to creative features aimed at real-world use. These projects are proving that innovation and delivery still matter. Here’s a closer look at what makes them stand out in conversations about the best crypto presale opportunities available this month. 1. BlockDAG: The F1® Partnership and Testnet Power Combo Few presales are showing as much momentum as BlockDAG. Its combination of delivery and visibility has caught attention thanks to its live Awakening Testnet, capable of handling around 1,400 transactions per second, and its official partnership with the BWT Alpine F1® Team. This multi-year deal places the BlockDAG brand in global motorsport events, starting with the Singapore Grand Prix activation that featured drivers, fan simulators, and tech showcases. The project’s technical side backs up its hype. The testnet is already live with working dApps, including Reflection and Lottery, and supports EVM-compatible smart contracts. It’s built around a DAG-based Layer 1 network, designed for high throughput and scalability. Developer tools, NFT explorers, and account abstraction for gasless transactions make it more than a concept, it’s an ecosystem being built ahead of mainnet launch. With over $425 million raised, more than 27B coins sold and a limited-time entry price of $0.0015, BlockDAG is moving fast. Its Genesis Day is scheduled for November 26, and early buyers can use the promo code TGE to secure the limited entry price and airdrop access at launch. Backed by visible partnerships and a working product, BlockDAG stands out in every discussion of the best crypto presale, blending hype with delivery. 2. Maxi Doge: Meme Energy Meets Utility Maxi Doge (MAXI) brings the humor and viral energy of meme coins while aiming for added functionality. Currently in presale at around $0.000261, the project has already raised over $2.8 million, driven by a strong community push and social campaigns. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on branding, Maxi Doge plans to integrate staking rewards, bonus tiers, and gamified contests, helping it maintain engagement beyond its launch. By mixing meme appeal with coin utility, Maxi Doge has become one of the more active new coins this month. It’s been mentioned across crypto outlets as a fresh option for those watching new presales with strong retail traction. With its balance of fun and function, it’s being positioned as part of the best crypto presale lineup for October. 3. Bitcoin Hyper: Scaling Bitcoin’s Potential Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is trying to solve one of the oldest challenges in crypto, scaling Bitcoin for faster, more flexible use. Positioned as a Layer-2 chain, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is drawing attention, having already raised over $22 million. The coin’s current presale price is $0.013075, with large buys reported, including one wallet purchasing 24.6 million HYPER coins worth about $327,000. Its mission is to bring DeFi, payments, and smart contract compatibility to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. The project’s roadmap includes bridges, staking, and partnerships targeting mass crypto adoption. While early, its combination of Bitcoin branding and functional goals has made it a frequent mention in lists of the best crypto presale coins with strong early backer interest. 4. Best Wallet Token: Expanding Crypto Access The Best Wallet Token (BEST) aims to simplify access to decentralized finance through its upcoming wallet ecosystem. While concrete details are still limited, it has been featured in speculative lists highlighting coins with growing presale interest. Industry chatter places it alongside other rising coins like Bitcoin Hyper and Maxi Doge in recent “next to explode” rankings. Though its technical data hasn’t been fully released, its concept revolves around improving wallet usability and DeFi accessibility for everyday users. For many early-stage watchers, this concept alone is enough to keep it on radar. If its development matches its buzz, Best Wallet Token could soon join the short list of projects labeled as part of the best crypto presale opportunities to watch this quarter. Key Takeaways Presale projects often struggle to balance hype with progress, but this month’s leaders are showing a mix of both. From BlockDAG’s functioning testnet and major sports tie-in to Maxi Doge’s meme-driven model, Bitcoin Hyper’s Bitcoin scaling approach, and Best Wallet Token’s accessibility goal, each brings something different to the table. These projects are drawing strong interest because they combine bold ideas with visible community activity and buyer confidence. Whether it’s early access or long-term vision, they capture what makes a coin worth watching. For October 2025, they define what many investors consider the best crypto presale lineup of the season.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Sheds 25% As $57M Flees Market — Can The Memecoin Recover? That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. BlackRock Now Holds A Large Share Of Bitcoin Supply Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Tokenization Push Adds New Dimension Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Institutional Shift In Ownership Is Clear Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Bitcoin Price And Market Conditions Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand.

Investor sentiment is divided between those holding for the long term and others debating whether to exit after weeks of volatile price action. The debate intensified when prominent market analyst Egrag Crypto shared a data-driven breakdown of the current XRP setup, giving the market a quantified view of what could happen next. His post, which has since sparked wide discussion across the crypto community, blends chart analysis, cycle comparisons, and probability-based forecasting — offering traders a strategic framework rather than emotional speculation. #XRP – Hold or Sell? (57% Vs 43%) Hey everyone! I know some of you don’t really care about the current price ranges and are thinking long-term, like 10 years or more! If that's you, just keep doing what you're doing. I’m with you on that! But for those of you who… https://t.co/oZc6gZJHr2 pic.twitter.com/ouUqkbE4gQ — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 15, 2025 The Technical Picture At the heart of Egrag’s latest analysis lies the Descending Broadening Wedge, a complex chart pattern formed when price action expands within downward-sloping trendlines. The formation usually signifies increasing volatility ahead of a decisive breakout. According to Egrag, XRP’s wedge currently carries a 57 percent probability of breaking upward and a 43 percent chance of moving lower. The odds are close, but they lean slightly bullish — suggesting potential recovery once key resistance levels give way. Recent trading data reinforces this uncertainty. XRP continues to hover between $2.40 and $2.60, levels that have repeatedly acted as both support and resistance. A confirmed breakout above the upper boundary of this wedge could mark the beginning of a strong rally, while a failure to hold the $2.40 floor might invite deeper retracement. Technical analysts across major trading platforms echo this sentiment, noting that volume and momentum will ultimately determine the direction of the next decisive move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Comparing Market Cycles and Long-Term Targets Egrag Crypto’s outlook extends beyond short-term price swings. He compares the current market cycle to the explosive 2021 run, when XRP gained nearly 1,700 percent from its lows to its peak. In this cycle, the token has so far risen about 1,160 percent, leading Egrag to argue that it remains undervalued relative to past performance. If XRP were to mirror the 2021 trajectory, he projects a potential target near $5.20, with extended goals between $9 and $20, and a long-shot top around $27 if bullish momentum fully unfolds. This analysis sits alongside other market commentaries suggesting that XRP’s institutional demand and cross-border payment use cases could amplify its cyclical performance. The broader trend also shows consistent inflows into XRP-based investment products, signaling that some institutions still view the asset as undervalued despite recent volatility. The Decision Point: Hold, Sell, or Wait It Out Egrag’s stance is clear: he is not selling. His conviction rests on both technical and cyclical factors, believing that current price levels may precede the strongest phase of the rally. Yet he acknowledges that for those uncomfortable with risk, trimming positions or taking profits near resistance is a rational move. The choice between holding and selling ultimately depends on time horizon and tolerance for volatility. For long-term holders who view XRP as a decade-scale investment, the current turbulence may be little more than noise. For active traders, however, discipline and timing remain crucial. As Egrag Crypto notes, “If you’re in the 43 percent camp, sell now and stop stressing. If you’re in the 57 percent camp, hold for the breakout.” In short, XRP’s future hinges on which side of that probability line plays out first — and whether investors have the patience, or courage, to stay the course.

The dual CEOs, Mike Sicilia and Clay Magouyrk, are defending a massive AI push built on new data centers and an aggressive partnership with OpenAI, according to The Wall Street Journal. The pair says this is about giving businesses real computing power, bundled software, and analytics that make artificial intelligence actually usable. Sicilia, who led Oracle Industries before taking the top job last month, said the company is “really in a unique situation to deliver what we call applied AI,” explaining that this includes infrastructure, analytics, and enterprise applications. Magouyrk, who previously ran Oracle’s cloud infrastructure arm, said the company’s new AI platform will tie all of that together. Their pitch comes as investors question whether this huge AI build-out is sustainable or just another bubble waiting to pop. Oracle ties OpenAI deal to data-center strategy Shares of Oracle jumped more than 40 percent last month after the company reported a surge of $317 billion in future contract revenue for the quarter ending August 31. Much of that came from its five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI, which executives insist will anchor the next phase of its cloud business. But analysts are already uneasy. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has admitted the company won’t turn a profit until 2029, which makes Oracle’s dependence on that partnership look risky. Moody’s warned last month that Oracle’s balance sheet could come under strain from the cost of its new AI data centers and its reliance on OpenAI to fill them. Earlier this month, Oracle stock dropped as much as 7.1 percent before bouncing back, following a report that margins on renting out Nvidia chips were razor-thin. Still, both Sicilia and Magouyrk plan to defend the math when they meet investors at Thursday’s Investor Day, arguing that scaling will make the business profitable. Magouyrk said , “Margins are the wrong way to look at the business. I understand the economics of each marginal unit and how this works out as it scales, and that actually ends up being a very profitable business.” Balaji Abbabatulla, an analyst at Gartner, said Oracle’s playbook is to sell entire ecosystems of AI tools rather than single products. “They’re not going to be able to show clear returns if they don’t go for those large and multibillion-dollar deals,” he said. That approach means combining AI infrastructure with databases, enterprise-resource-planning tools, and HR software so corporate clients can buy it all from one vendor. Margins, inference, and debt weigh on investor faith Another piece of Oracle’s plan is AI inference; the process of running models after they’re trained. Most infrastructure spending today goes into training, but inference is where customers actually use models and generate results. Magouyrk said Oracle can let clients “do their inferencing right alongside their data with the best models.” He claimed usage could increase a thousandfold once customers adopt its new AI Data Platform. Shawnna DelHierro, chief information officer at SoundHound AI, said her company already uses Oracle’s cloud to train and run models, handling over one billion queries per month. SoundHound also uses Oracle’s back-office software and picked the firm because it offered “a true partner” and “zero latency,” she said. Still, many enterprises complain they haven’t seen quick returns from AI even as they pour money into it. Oracle has added more debt to stay ahead, issuing $18 billion in bonds in late September to fund its AI data-center build-out, including the massive Stargate project with OpenAI. Magouyrk pushed back on fears about debt, saying that if you combine Oracle’s new contracts, revenue projections, and cash flow, the picture looks “much rosier.” He added that Oracle isn’t betting everything on one client. “Pretty much all of the big model providers use our cloud in one form or another,” he said. “You can’t get more than 100 percent of the Pokémon.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|Nvidia|OpenAI|Oracle,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 17:05:48

Analysts Favor Rentstac (RNS) for 2026,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-a-good-investment-analysts-favor-rentstac-rns-for-2026/,"In the world of crypto, few tokens have stood the test of time like XRP. After more than a decade, it remains one of the most recognized names in the market. Yet as 2026 approaches, analysts argue that while XRP offers stability, its growth potential has largely plateaued — and that emerging DeFi projects such as Rentstac (RNS) could deliver the kind of real, asset-backed returns modern investors seek. XRP’s Legacy: Strength Without Acceleration XRP was designed to revolutionize cross-border payments. For years, it has served as a bridge asset for banks and remittance companies, offering speed and low transaction fees. But as the market evolved, competition from stablecoins, CBDCs, and newer blockchain solutions reduced XRP’s edge. Currently trading around $0.50–$0.60 with a $30 billion market cap, XRP would need billions in new inflows just to double its value. Analysts suggest that kind of growth is increasingly difficult in today’s utility-driven DeFi landscape. Enter Rentstac (RNS): Real-World Assets Meet Real Yield While XRP connects institutions, Rentstac connects people to tangible value. The project tokenizes income-producing real estate, turning properties into fractional shares represented by the RNS token. Investors earn passive income directly on-chain as rental revenue flows through smart contracts. Each property is secured through a legally registered Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), providing full compliance and transparency. Unlike many speculative crypto tokens, RNS offers exposure to verified assets and predictable yield — a structure that analysts describe as “DeFi with fundamentals.” With the Phase 1 presale live at $0.025, Rentstac is still at the very beginning of its curve. Analysts now forecast that the project could achieve up to 500× long-term growth as adoption scales across global real estate markets and RWA-driven DeFi protocols. Comparing the Two: Utility vs. Yield Category XRP (Ripple) Rentstac (RNS) Launch Year 2012 2025 Core Use Case Cross-border payments Tokenized real estate and yield distribution Token Supply 100B (inflationary) 2B (fixed, deflationary) Holder Benefits Speculative price gains Real income + governance rights Structure Corporate network SPV + DAO governance Current Price $0.50–$0.60 $0.025 (Phase 1 presale) Growth Outlook Low-medium High (500× potential over time) Why Analysts Are Bullish on RNS Analysts highlight several reasons for optimism around Rentstac (RNS) : Real yield: Rental income distributed automatically in RNS via audited smart contracts. Legal compliance: Every property backed by a registered SPV and monitored by independent oracles. Limited supply: 2 billion total tokens, deflationary over time through buyback and burn mechanisms. DAO governance: Token holders vote on property acquisitions and ecosystem updates. Transparency: Funds held in multi-sig escrow wallets, verified at each development milestone. XRP’s Limits vs. RNS’s Potential While XRP remains a reliable settlement token, holders gain no direct yield from Ripple’s network activity. Profits stay within the company. In contrast, Rentstac distributes on-chain property income to investors, creating continuous token demand and reinforcing its market value. Analysts see this as the evolution from payment tokens to productive assets — a shift defining the new DeFi cycle. Perfect Timing: Presale Phase 1 at $0.025 With smart contracts already deployed and CertiK audits underway, Rentstac’s live presale marks a key milestone. Early participants benefit from the lowest pricing before progressive phases raise the cost toward $0.25. This stage offers what experts describe as an “asymmetric opportunity,” where potential upside vastly outweighs downside. Analysts project that RNS could reach $5–$10 in the coming years as adoption expands — representing over 500× growth from today’s valuation . The Rise of Real World Assets (RWA) The next phase of crypto’s evolution is being defined by Real World Assets (RWA) — the tokenization of tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and bonds. Rentstac is perfectly positioned at the center of this shift. By connecting DeFi infrastructure with legally backed property portfolios, it transforms real estate into a global, liquid, and yield-bearing digital asset class. As institutional interest in RWA protocols accelerates, analysts expect projects like Rentstac to attract both retail and professional investors seeking inflation-resistant, transparent, and income-generating blockchain opportunities. Community and Transparency Rentstac is not just a platform — it’s a growing community where investors, developers, and real estate professionals collaborate through DAO governance. Token holders can propose and vote on property acquisitions, yield distribution models, and future protocol updates, ensuring Rentstac evolves under collective ownership rather than centralized control. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Real Yield Is XRP a good investment? For stability, perhaps yes. But when it comes to growth and innovation, Rentstac (RNS) stands in a category of its own. Backed by real assets, legal structure, and on-chain yield distribution, it offers both immediate utility and long-term expansion potential. Analysts forecast that as RWA adoption accelerates through 2026 and beyond, RNS could rise 500× or more over time — making it one of the most promising crypto presales in the market today.

The cryptocurrency’s price movements have been nothing short of spectacular — soaring 13,500% since launch, hitting an all-time high of $43.81 on October 12, and then plunging nearly 90% before regaining its footing with a 132% rebound. ChainOpera AI price chart | Source: Coingecko With the AI sector heating up again and COAI leading the charge, investors are now asking the same question: what comes next for this volatile but promising asset? AI revival fuels COAI’s comeback After pulling back from its all-time high reached on October 12, COAI’s price has today bounced back 132%, closely tied to a renewed wave of optimism sweeping through the AI crypto sector. Notably, the broader AI market has rebounded by 5.66% to $31.9 billion, lifting tokens with strong AI utility narratives. ChainOpera AI stands, climbing 132% briefly touching $22.35 before consolidating around $15.41 at press time. Notably, ChainOpera AI’s surge outpaced the broader crypto market, which rose just 2.3% during the same period. Part of this recovery stems from COAI’s strong presence in the BNB Chain ecosystem. As BNB’s price jumped past $1,300 and daily active users on the chain crossed 3.5 million, liquidity and user traffic surged. COAI, being one of BNB Chain’s flagship AI infrastructure projects, naturally absorbed a large share of this renewed market energy. Derivatives frenzy adds to COAI’s firepower Following COAI’s resurgence, its perpetual futures market open interest has jumped 161% to $194 million, signalling heavy speculation and leveraged positioning. Derivatives volume has also surged to $2.31 billion, as traders on BNB-based exchanges poured in to capitalise on price swings. While this influx of leveraged positions boosted short-term momentum, it also introduced elevated volatility risks. Liquidations of bearish positions added fuel to the rally, but analysts warn that such setups can reverse quickly. A break below $9.80, the October 14 low, could invalidate the current bullish structure and trigger cascading liquidations. For now, the Relative Strength Index at 64.68 still indicates room for upside, with resistance looming near $17.70 and $21 as the next key targets. ChainOpera AI price forecast ChainOpera AI’s path mirrors the rhythm of the current market — driven by innovation, speculation, and shifting sentiment. Its 132% rally underscores strong buying momentum and the revival of AI-driven narratives, but the 90% post-ATH crash is a reminder of how quickly tides can turn. If buying pressure remains firm and the AI sector continues its uptrend, COAI could challenge the $21 mark in the short term and potentially retest its previous highs. However, while momentum indicators such as the MACD and RSI show strength, analysts note that consolidation within the current ascending channel is likely before any sustainable breakout occurs. If bears overpower bulls, a dip below $9.80 would likely mark the end of the current rebound and open the door to a deeper correction.

Xu’s statement came shortly after an enforcement action led by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on October 14, in coordination with the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO). Huione Group Hit by Sanctions The joint operation targeted large-scale scam networks across Southeast Asia, and designated the Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO) and 146 affiliates for their roles in crypto-enabled fraud, illicit mining, and global money laundering activities. As part of the sanctions, the UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) also blacklisted Byex Exchange after discovering its ties to Jin Bei Group Co. Ltd and the Prince Group. Huione Group, which was previously flagged by FinCEN in May, has now been formally classified as a “primary money laundering concern” under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This designation effectively cuts it off from the US financial system. The crackdown intensified as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed criminal charges against Chen Zhi, also known as “Vincent,” who happens to be the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group. Alongside the indictment, the DOJ filed a whopping $15 billion civil forfeiture case tied to approximately 127,000 BTC allegedly generated through the group’s extensive network of fraudulent crypto operations. From Huione to Tudou Huione Group’s subsidiary, Huione Guarantee, the Telegram-based marketplace which was later rebranded as “Haowang Guarantee,” facilitated over $24 billion in transactions since its inception in 2021 to January 2025. Before its shutdown in May, Huione expanded its digital ecosystem by launching multiple blockchain-based tools, including USDH, a US dollar-backed stablecoin designed to sidestep traditional regulatory controls. It also developed a decentralized exchange, a proprietary wallet, and the ChatMe communication platform modeled after Telegram. The group created a closed ecosystem that allowed internal transfers while minimizing exposure to regulatory oversight. Since its closure, criminal networks have moved to another Telegram-based market, Tudou Guarantee, which was found to have absorbed a large share of its predecessor’s transactions.

The project will span more than 500 acres of land owned by the Mitchell family, who have deep roots in Texas’ oil and gas industry. The site sits in the Permian Basin, the country’s most active natural gas hub, and will generate its own electricity instead of relying on the Texas grid. The project is called Horizon. The land is part of Longfellow Ranch, a massive ranch owned by the Mitchells that covers hundreds of thousands of acres. Eiso Kant, co-founder of Poolside, said Horizon will be rolled out gradually to avoid overloading any systems and will eventually provide two gigawatts of compute, equal to the entire output of the Hoover Dam. Kant added, “It is not about your headline numbers of gigawatts. It’s about your ability to deliver data centers,” describing infrastructure itself as “the real physical bottleneck in our industry.” Poolside to tap local gas plant for self-powered data hub The companies plan to take full advantage of the natural gas already flowing from the ground in the Permian Basin. The Horizon campus will use an on-site gas plant built years ago by Occidental Petroleum, as well as surrounding pipelines, to produce its own power. The site is also near processing plants and is already connected to long-haul fiber networks needed for fast data transfer. Kant said this setup should reduce operational costs and avoid the issues other projects face when power and compute are separated. CoreWeave will be the first tenant on the campus, taking on 250 megawatts of capacity expected to come online by the end of next year. The company has also locked in another 500 megawatts for later expansion. Full construction is expected to wrap up in early 2027. The companies didn’t share what they’re paying to lease the land, or the full cost of the project, but Kant gave a benchmark: a two-gigawatt facility like this would usually cost $16 billion, excluding chips. He said modular construction off-site could help cut that cost down for Poolside. Starting December, Poolside will also get early access to Nvidia-powered AI infrastructure through CoreWeave, a temporary solution while the larger campus is under development. This agreement adds to the list of high-stakes deals in the AI infrastructure war, where companies like OpenAI and xAI are rushing to build capacity across the U.S. OpenAI has said it expects to need over 20 gigawatts just for its AI model ChatGPT, and has announced several new data center builds to meet that demand. Texas grid faces pressure as AI data centers multiply Texas has become a central target for new data center builds.OpenAI is working with Oracle on the Stargate facility in Abilene, while other unnamed builds are underway across the state. But with this growth has come major concerns. Critics have warned that these centers use massive amounts of power and water, and could place serious strain on Texas’ power grid. Unlike other states, Texas operates its own grid, and there are limits to what it can handle. New legislation now gives the state’s grid operator authority to cut off power to large-scale energy users, including data centers, during emergencies. Poolside is trying to avoid those risks entirely by building in the ability to self-generate power. Still, with more companies pushing into Texas for space and energy, it’s unclear how long even that edge will hold. Poolside is also raising another $2 billion in funding. If successful, the company’s valuation would rise to $14 billion, up from $3 billion a year ago when it brought in $500 million. The company says it wants to build AI systems with humanlike intelligence, and sees Horizon as a big piece of that vision. Nvidia’s involvement also means Poolside will have chip supply locked down, a critical advantage in the compute shortage sweeping the industry.

In its latest “Crypto’s Financial Bazaar” report , Grayscale argues that Solana leads the blockchain category in user count, transaction volume, and transaction fees. “These aren’t the only considerations that matter, but on these core blockchain fundamentals, Solana stands apart from its peers,” Grayscale’s research team noted. According to the report, Solana averages 4,587 users daily and processes up to 96,200 transactions per day, with the highest transactions per second among major blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Tron. Source: Grayscale Grayscale: SOL Could Push Above $260 Despite $5 Billion Annual Fee Revenue Raydium, a decentralized exchange and core component of Solana’s DeFi infrastructure, has recorded over $1.2 trillion in volume , more than any other blockchain ecosystem. Jupiter, Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, is also the largest in the crypto industry by volume . Pump.fun, a memecoin launchpad and social app, attracts around 2 million monthly active users and generates approximately $1.2 million in daily revenue. Source: Grayscale Helium, a decentralized physical infrastructure project focused on mobile hotspots, now provides services cheaper than centralized alternatives. The Solana-based protocol has 1.5 million daily users, 112,000 hotspots , and partnerships with major telecom companies like AT&T and Telefonica. These examples represent just a fraction of Solana’s more than 500 unique applications. As a general-purpose blockchain, Solana ranks third in NFT trading , fifth in stablecoin transaction volume, and seventh in tokenized assets. August on Solana, by the numbers: ➔ $148 million in app revenue, up 92% from 2024 and surpassing all other networks ➔ All-time high perps volume of $43.8 billion ➔ 2.9 billion transactions, up 46% y/y and more than 4x all other networks combined ➔ $144 billion in DEX… pic.twitter.com/uPIZXObxW6 — Solana (@solana) September 4, 2025 Solana apps generate about $425 million in monthly fees, or over $5 billion annualized. “We believe that fees are the most direct measure of total demand for a blockchain and its applications, and the data indicate there’s substantial demand for Solana,” Grayscale’s research stated. Solana has carved out a competitive position by offering fast and cheap transactions. The network produces new blocks every 400 milliseconds , and transactions reach finality in approximately 12–13 seconds. Transaction costs have remained low, with users paying an average fee of just $0.02 per year to date. Solana uses local fee markets, which limit fee competition to specific high-demand applications, and median daily transaction fees this year have averaged just $0.001. Additionally, a forthcoming upgrade called Alpenglow is expected to reduce finality time to 100–150 milliseconds. 1,000+ Solana Developers Building What Ethereum Can’t Easily Copy Despite crypto’s user experience challenges, Solana offers one of the best new-user experiences in the industry. Its fast and cheap transactions, diverse applications, and “monolithic” design eliminate the need to bridge assets between network components. Its wallet infrastructure, led by Phantom, also contributes to this advantage. Solana uses a distinct architecture called the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used by Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche. SVM-based applications can’t be easily transferred to non-SVM blockchains, potentially creating sticky demand. More than 1,000 full-time developers work on Solana and SVM-based applications. The number of Solana-focused developers has also grown faster than any other smart contract platform over the last two years, according to Electric Capital’s blockchain developer report . Industry Leaders Project SOL Could Push Past $260 to Hit $520 by Year-End Given these metrics and the 7% staking reward for validators securing the network, Grayscale analysts believe SOL is currently undervalued at $202.36. Grayscale’s research states that the $260 mark achieved in November 2021 represents the fair value for SOL based on the steady growth and leading metrics it has achieved since its FTX-induced crash in December 2022. Grayscale Research believes that Solana’s diverse on-chain economy creates a strong foundation for $SOL ’s valuation and the necessary conditions for future growth. Read the latest on Solana: https://t.co/TivGBXOexr — Grayscale (@Grayscale) October 14, 2025 “Since the FTX bankruptcy, SOL has substantially outperformed the FTSE/Grayscale Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index, ” Grayscale confirmed. This matches similar bullish projections from industry leaders. In September 2024, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said Solana is undervalued and projected it to capture up to 50% of Ethereum’s then market capitalization, equivalent to a $330 valuation. VanEck also predicted that SOL could surge to $520 before the year’s end. Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, told CryptoNews that Solana is gaining ground in the Layer 1 arms race, with strong fundamentals, growing institutional inflows, and steady revenue leadership. He noted Solana’s resilience through Q3 and upcoming network upgrades that could push it toward $300 by early 2026.

The consortium announced via a press release that it will acquire Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management and other co-investors. The consortium believes this acquisition will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure. In their press release, the companies pointed out that the acquisition values Aligned at approximately $40 billion. The consortium aims to position Aligned Data Centers as a cornerstone of next-generation compute infrastructure, enabling large-scale AI workloads across North and Latin America. AIP’s landmark investment in Aligned Data Centers Aligned Data Centers is one of the top three hyperscale AI infrastructure Operators in America. Aligned designs, builds, and operates cutting-edge data campuses and data centers for the world’s premier hyperscalers, neocloud, and enterprise innovators #AI #DataCenter #MGX … pic.twitter.com/SNMbyw2v0r — mgxai (@mgx_ai) October 15, 2025 BlackRock, GIP, MGX, Microsoft, and Nvidia formed AIP last year to direct institutional funds toward the high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. AIP’s goal is to invest $30 billion in equity, with the possibility of adding debt to reach a total of $100 billion. The investments aim to finance the global expansion of digital capacity. Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, Managing Director and Chief Executive of MGX and Vice Chairman of AIP, said the acquisition of Aligned marks a defining step in AIP’s plan to deploy $30 billion in equity and expand global AI infrastructure. Al Idrissi described Aligned Data Centers as one of the top three hyperscale AI infrastructure companies in the United States. He claimed that the $40 billion enterprise value makes it the largest private equity digital infrastructure transaction on record. “We are entering a new era in which AI will fundamentally reengineer our economies and enable accelerated growth. Compute infrastructure at scale will be foundational to that progress.” – Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi , Managing Director and CEO of MGX and Vice Chairman of AIP. The Vice Chairman of AIP added that AIP’s investment in Aligned Data Centers will direct scalable capital to an operator built for efficiency and growth. Al Idrissi outlined that the “scale feature” made Aligned Data Centers a fit for the consortium. He asserted that the data centers can build gigawatt-scale sites, which is critical for scaling compute infrastructure in a cost-efficient way. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock and Chairman of AIP, claimed that as AI continues to transform the global economy, AIP is well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for infrastructure. He emphasized that the AIP, MGX, and GIP partnership is bringing together top businesses to boost productivity and drive global economic growth. The Consortium noted that the investment will provide Aligned Data Centers with the necessary funding and tactical assistance to accelerate expansion. Backed by the Consortium, the data center will rapidly expand its footprint, drive further innovation, and continue to deliver next-generation data center solutions. MGX expands global footprint in AI infrastructure The acquisition of Aligned Data Centers comes amid a boom in AI infrastructure in the UAE and globally. In May, G42 established Stargate UAE, a one-gigawatt computing cluster, which will operate in the emirate’s 5GW UAE-US AI Campus in collaboration with SoftBank Group, OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia. As Cryptopolitan reported , G42’s data center campus will utilize Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, representing about 20% of the campus’s total scope. The facility is expected to launch in 2026. Al Idrissi, CEO of MGX, said.“Stargate is an initiative, it’s not a company.” He asserted that Khazna Data Centres, a G42 company, will contribute to the development of Stargate. The CEO of MGX explained that MGX effectively operates Vantage, Aligned, Khazna, and the AI Compass within its AI infrastructure portfolio. Al Idrissi mentioned MGX sees these international investments as a component of the same infrastructure that is propelling the AI economy across continents. Al Idrissi noted that MGX brings an end-to-end view of the AI play. He added GIP contributes extensive experience in infrastructure, whether traditional or digital, including power and now digital infrastructure. Al Idrissi said BlackRock brings the scale of capital critical to this industry. The CEO of MGX added that Microsoft, xAI, and Nvidia bring the technology expertise and the optics.

As the market matures, though, investor attitudes are hardening. Increasingly, investors are coming to the view that pure hype is insufficient to ensure long-term growth. Though SHIB has a strong fan base and sporadic flare-ups of interest, the absence of substantial utility has had investors questioning whether its best years are yet in the past. Volatility is intensifying as whales broaden their collections, so the hunt for the next breakout project with real utility is intensifying. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the spotlight. Priced at just $0.035 and now in Phase 6 of its presale, over 65% already sold out, Mutuum Finance has become one of the most talked-about up-and-coming DeFi projects of 2025. Unlike meme coins that rely on sentiment, MUTM offers a functional ecosystem that blends Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with Peer-to-Peer lending, allowing users to maximize capital efficiency within a single, integrated platform. This dual-layer model not only strengthens liquidity but also positions the project as a sustainable force in the decentralized finance sector. For investors ready to move beyond speculation and into substance, MUTM might just be the opportunity that defines 2025. Shiba Inu Price Forecast: Serene Before the Following Pump? Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains firm at its lower levels of support, demonstrating remarkable strength despite general market indecision. Analysts point out that this consolidation area can be a key base prior to the next potential upturn, with holder sentiment remaining optimistic but cautious. “Calm down, the pump is coming” remains a familiar refrain throughout the SHIB ecosystem, as investors look towards a breakout that can help reinvigorate the meme coin’s fortunes. And as long as SHIB remains stable at these key levels, traders are looking wider towards new presale projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a development that highlights a growing desire to look towards new horizons. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dominates in Presale Interest in Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale remains strong with more than 17,040 investors putting more than $17.35 million in the project. Aggressive demand like this is an indication of the future potential of the project. The protocol reaches ultimate collateral efficiency by Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio that is computed with highest accuracy, nearly on undercollateralized loans. There remains also shock buffer reserve set aside to absorb market shock, and surer reserves are invested judiciously on risk-free assets. The design enables the ability to absorb shocks without sacrificing the general wellness of the system with stable, strong, and sustainable DeFi platform. Lending and Borrowing Protocol Launch in Q4 Mutuum Finance is developing a future-proof decentralized lending and borrowing protocol . The initial release of the protocol will be made on Sepolia Testnet in Q4. The product will feature liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot, etc. ETH as well as USDT will be used as collateral for borrowing/lending and will provide the users of the platform with a lightning-fast, high-speed, as well as easy-to-use experience within the DeFi scene. Mutuum Finance also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with the help of CertiK. The program rewards white-hat hackers along with security researchers in return for giving them codebase bug details. Forget Shiba Inu, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) May be the Smart 2025 Play Though Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to retain sentimental value, limited usability causes investors to look to something with depth. That’s exactly what MUTUM Finance (MUTM) offers. Despite a price of only $0.035 during Phase 6 of the presale as well as being already 65% sold out, MUTM has secured over $17.35 million from over 17,040 investors as distinct markers of building confidence as well as trajectory. As a peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer double-layered DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance pursues enhancing the capital stability as well as the efficiency in fluctuating markets. The Q4 2025 Sepolia Testnet release as well as the CertiK-sponsored $50,000 Bug Bounty Program secure its credibility further. For investors who are willing to venture beyond meme coins, the real-life utility as well as the long-term potential of Mutuum Finance positions it towards the top of the most attractive under-$1 cryptos of 2025.

We’re talking about NVIDIA’s AI program, the team that built Shiba Inu into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, and Saudi Arabia’s futuristic NEOM city. Let’s understand why these three powerhouses are backing this one project, what each one brings to the table, and why their combined support matters for the token launching in three days. NVIDIA Isn’t Just a Backer – They’re the AI Engine of Astra Nova NVIDIA makes the chips that power artificial intelligence. Their Inception program only accepts startups building serious AI applications. Getting into this program means NVIDIA looked at what Astra Nova is building and said yes. NVIDIA recently announced partnerships with Saudi Arabia to build AI infrastructure, calling AI as essential as electricity and internet. They’re not throwing their name around casually. NVIDIA also works closely with Alibaba Cloud, which powers Astra Nova’s TokenPlay AI platform , to provide GPU-accelerated computing for AI applications. Here’s what this means in simple terms: Astra Nova gets access to the same technology that powers self-driving cars and advanced robotics . For a platform building AI-powered apps and games, this is like having a Formula 1 engine when everyone else is using regular car parts. The technology works. The infrastructure is proven. NVIDIA’s backing says this project has real technical foundations. The Shiba Inu Connection: Community Meets Experience The team behind Shiba Inu knows how to build crypto communities. SHIB went from a meme coin to a full ecosystem with its own blockchain, DEX, and millions of loyal holders. Now key members of that founding team are working on Astra Nova. Astra Nova has already launched MiniApp experiences for Shiba Inu through TokenPlay AI. This isn’t just a partnership announcement. The integration is live and working. Think about what the Shiba Inu team brings: they’ve survived bear markets, kept communities engaged through crashes, and built actual products that people use. They know how to turn hype into something lasting. That experience is now being applied to $RVV. When you have people who turned a dog meme into billions of dollars of value backing your infrastructure project, you pay attention. They understand both sides: the viral community energy and the need for real utility. Saudi Arabia’s NEOM: When Countries Back Crypto Saudi Arabia is spending $500 billion to build NEOM, a futuristic city in the desert. NEOM partnered with Oracle and NVIDIA to deliver AI capabilities across the region, aimed at accelerating AI-powered innovation for enterprises and government organizations. Astra Nova having Saudi backing means something specific: they’re aligned with a country actively investing hundreds of billions in becoming an AI and tech superpower. Saudi Arabia’s deal with NVIDIA involves chips powering massive AI factories in NEOM. Most crypto projects worry about regulations. Astra Nova has backing from a nation that views blockchain and AI as strategic priorities. That’s not just funding. That’s geopolitical positioning. It means access to infrastructure, potential government contracts, and a regulatory environment that wants these technologies to succeed. Alibaba Cloud: The Infrastructure Nobody Talks About TokenPlay AI runs on Alibaba Cloud, one of the world’s largest cloud providers. Alibaba recently integrated NVIDIA’s AI development tools into their cloud platform. Alibaba Cloud operates in 91 availability zones across 29 regions globally. This matters because infrastructure determines whether projects can actually scale. You can have the best idea in crypto, but if your servers can’t handle traffic, you fail. Astra Nova runs on enterprise-grade infrastructure used by massive companies worldwide. When thousands of people want to launch MiniApps, when communities want to build tokenized experiences, when transaction volume spikes – the infrastructure won’t break. That’s what Alibaba Cloud provides. Why These Four Together Change Everything Here’s the key insight: each backer solves a different problem. NVIDIA provides cutting-edge AI technology. Alibaba Cloud delivers global infrastructure that can scale. Saudi Arabia offers strategic backing and capital from a nation building the future. The Shiba Inu team brings proven community-building expertise and millions of engaged users. Separately, each is impressive. Together, they cover every base a Web3 infrastructure project needs: technology, scalability, capital, and community. Analysts are calling Astra Nova’s token launch one of the most anticipated events of 2025. With a starting market cap in the single-digit millions and actual revenue from platform fees, $RVV launches with room to grow and a business model that generates real income. What Happens on October 18 The token goes live. The Binance campaign launches. And we find out if this combination of institutional backing, proven technology, sovereign support, and community expertise translates into success. Most tokens launch with promises. Astra Nova launches with NVIDIA technology, Alibaba infrastructure, Saudi strategic support, and the team that built one of crypto’s most successful communities. The backing is real. The technology works. The partnerships are live. Now the market decides what that’s worth.

This is standard fees for others. If we can help anyone make $20,000 by criticizing Binance, we'd be honored,” Yi He wrote on the X platform. Yi He's statement came after quoting a post by popular crypto investor El Jaboom, who shared DeFiLlama data claiming Binance had received over $4 billion in inflows in the last 24 hours, thus denying the claims. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Delists One Altcoin, Lists Another Rumors of this “massive outflow” began to spread yesterday following a post by CoinGlass. CoinGlass had claimed that Binance had experienced a net outflow of $21.75 billion in the last seven days. However, according to DeFiLlama data, Binance recorded a net inflow of approximately $900 million during the same period. The statement on the CoinGlass website states that the data is collected from third-party sources and its accuracy is not guaranteed. Binance has been forced to defend itself for the second time this week. Yesterday, the exchange announced that it “did not profit” from the token listing process. This statement came after Limitless Labs CEO CJ Hetherington claimed that Binance “requested 8% of the potential token supply and additional deposits” during the listing process. Binance called Hetherington’s statements “unfounded and defamatory” and threatened legal action. However, the move has sparked widespread criticism within the community. “We have removed our previous customer support post regarding the listing process.

MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1121, resulting in a correction to $0.0649. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price triggered strong selling pressure after buyers failed to maintain demand. This resulted in a push toward $0.123. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

While most traders are chasing the next meme coin pump, a different game is being played behind the scenes. Platforms that let other people launch tokens and apps have been quietly printing money. We’re talking seven-figure daily revenues, and in some cases, platforms generating more fees than Ethereum itself on peak days. Astra Nova ‘s $RVV launches October 18th with something these platforms didn’t have at their debut. Major intellectual properties are already building on TokenPlay AI before the token even goes live. Shiba Inu, Simon’s Cat, and partnerships reaching 169 million users through telecom networks. Over 250,000 creators are sitting on a waitlist right now, ready to launch the second doors open. The model is proven, the partnerships are real, and the buyback mechanism means every app launched feeds directly into token scarcity. Why Platform Fees Matter More Than You Think Let’s talk numbers because they tell the real story here. Pump.fun generated $15.5 million in fees during a single day in January. Not revenue projections, not promises—actual fees collected from users. Over the past 30 days, that platform pulled in $35.7 million according to DefiLlama data, and since launch, cumulative fees have crossed $803 million. LetsBonk.fun hit $1 million in daily fees back in July, launching over 16,000 tokens in 24 hours with 37,000 active users. These aren’t outliers anymore. Multiple platforms are proving that infrastructure which enables creation beats trying to be the next big thing yourself. You don’t need to launch the winning token when you can take a cut from everyone else’s attempts. TokenPlay AI enters this space October 18th with a twist that could change the economics completely. Instead of just collecting fees, the platform routes them into automatic buybacks of $RVV tokens, then burns them permanently. More apps mean more transactions, more transactions mean bigger buybacks, and bigger buybacks mean less supply over time while you’re holding. The waitlist already has 250,000 creators who want to build on launch day, which suggests pent-up demand that’s been sitting idle waiting for this exact moment. IPs Bring Built-In Audiences Most platforms launch empty and hope users show up eventually. Astra Nova flipped that script completely. Shiba Inu is already running whitelabel MiniApp experiences through TokenPlay AI, and if you know anything about SHIB, you know they bring millions of holders globally who are extremely active. When those holders interact with apps built for their community, those transactions generate fees that flow straight into $RVV buybacks. The project isn’t just backed by the Shib Army in name only. They’ve launched real products—a Loyalty Questing Platform, Telegram game with 200,000 monthly players, and a Webtoon dApp. All powered by NVIDIA AI, all running right now before token launch. That’s not “coming soon” vaporware. Simon’s Cat adds another layer with 1.8 million Instagram followers and its own successful token. But here’s the kicker: Astra Nova partnered with The Binary Holdings to tap into 169 million telco users across Southeast Asia. That’s distribution most crypto projects would kill for, and it’s live before the token even hits exchanges. Every one of those users creates potential transaction volume, and every transaction creates buying pressure for $RVV starting October 18th. The Buyback Flywheel Explained Platform revenue buys tokens from the market and destroys them forever, which is the mechanic that makes early positioning matter. The token launches at what the company describes as a low market cap. Then applications go live, users start transacting, and the platform automatically buys $RVV with fee revenue and removes those tokens permanently. Early holders get in before this buyback pressure even exists, which is different from typical tokens where you only win if someone else buys later at a higher price. This model turns the platform itself into a perpetual buyer. The more successful the ecosystem becomes, the more aggressive the buying pressure while your holdings stay intact. The ecosystem is already processing 200,000 daily active users across existing products, and those users will migrate to apps built on TokenPlay AI once it’s fully live. Platform fees and advertisements inside TokenPlay AI are core utilities of $RVV, not secondary features added later. Infrastructure That Actually Scales TokenPlay AI runs on Alibaba Cloud, which operates 91 availability zones across 29 regions worldwide. This matters more than most people realize because crypto platforms often buckle under launch day traffic. Alibaba’s infrastructure handles massive enterprise applications daily, and they recently integrated NVIDIA’s AI development tools directly into their cloud platform. Astra Nova raised $4.7 million in funding and instead of spending years in development purgatory, they’re launching October 18th with products already working. The risk that destroys most projects—can they actually ship—is answered because you can use the platform right now before the token even exists. Three Days Until Entry Analysts are calling this one of 2025’s most anticipated token launches, and the math explains why. When platforms using this exact model generate tens of millions monthly and $RVV launches at a fraction of that implied valuation, early participants get positioned before the market prices in future revenue potential. Every application launching after October 18th creates transaction volume, every transaction generates fees, and every fee buys back tokens that early holders already own. The Binance campaign goes live alongside the launch, exchange listings hit Tier 1 platforms, and 250,000 creators get immediate access to start building. The platforms this model is based on are already proving it works with eight-figure monthly revenues. The brands are actively building. Users are already transacting across the ecosystem. October 18th is when the buyback mechanism activates and the market gets to decide what that’s actually worth.

Last week, Deren Akyeam-Pong admitted in court that he and others kidnapped Pleterski in Toronto and held him captive between Dec. 5 and Dec. 8, 2022. This is the time when a video circulated on the internet of a beaten Pleterski apologizing to investors, who lost a total of $40 million. According to reports, Deren Akyeam-Pong admitted to nine charges, including kidnapping, aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, discharge of a firearm, possession of a restricted firearm, unlawful possession of a prohibited device, pointing a firearm, and two counts of failing to comply with firearm prohibitions. However, the details of his plea remain under a temporary publication ban. Crypto King’s guilty plea delays trial of two other suspects Akyeam-Pong’s plea was unexpected and has resulted in a significant turning point in a case that has drawn international attention, largely due to Pleterski’s extravagant lifestyle. Akyeam-Pong was set to stand trial this month with Akil Heywood, who invested a large sum of money and is involved in Pleterski’s bankruptcy proceedings, and Alfredo Paladino. Akil Heywood faces three kidnapping and two extortion charges, and maintains his innocence. Co-defendant Alfredo Paladino faces similar kidnapping, extortion, firearm, and assault charges. Another alleged kidnapper is set to go on trial early next year. As a result of the plea, the trial judge agreed with defence lawyers Hussein Aly, who represents Heywood, and Leora Shemesh, Paladino’s counsel, who asked for an adjournment given the change in the case. A future trial date has not been set. However, Justice Shin will conduct a hearing at the end of the month, where she will be asked to lift the temporary publication ban, which the Toronto Star opposes. Pleterski risks 14-year jail term over fraud Before the kidnapping, investors had forced Pleterski into bankruptcy in August 2022 while trying to recover more than $40 million they’d given him for crypto and foreign exchange investments. According to bankruptcy proceedings, Pleterski has been accused of using investor funds for personal gain, spending $16 million on exotic cars, real estate, and other high-end goods while investing only about 2% of the money he received. Online, Pleterski portrayed an image as a financial markets prodigy, with social media accounts showcasing a jet-setting lifestyle. Police also charged another man, Colin Murphy, allegedly an associate of Mr Pleterski’s. The investigation, dubbed “Project Swan” by authorities, is believed to be the largest fraud case ever in the region. It involved interviews with a large number of victims, over three dozen court orders, and thousands of pages of financial documents. Pleterski was not registered in any capacity with any Canadian securities regulator. To that end, Pleterski faces fraud and money laundering charges related to investor funds, with a trial set for October 2026. If convicted, he could face up to 14 years behind bars. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Keyron Moore received 13 years in prison for a 2022 Toronto-area kidnapping involving torture, sexual assault, and a $1 million Bitcoin demand from a victim identified as A.T., who was abducted outside a Thornhill plaza and confined in a Barrie garage. Meanwhile, over the past 18 months, kidnapping attacks targeting digital asset holders have surged, with at least 231 physical incidents, including abductions, home invasions, and violent coercion, documented worldwide, resulting in the death of at least 6 victims. Even more shocking, of the $166 million stolen through physical attacks on cryptocurrency holders from 2022 to 2025, almost $128 million has been obtained through kidnapping.

53188277,606333,1760551205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53188277.jpeg,Ethereum Staking Rewards Propels SharpLink’s ETH Treasury Reserve – Here’s How Much They Hold,https://bitcoinist.com/sharplink-ethereum-staking/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum staking continues to expand, with retail and institutional investors increasingly adopting this key initiative in order to generate additional revenue. ETH staking is still proving its importance and relevance in the crypto and financial sector, as evidenced by SharpLink Gaming’s massive staking rewards. SharpLink’s Ethereum Holdings Bolstered By Staking Rewards With its entry into the Ethereum staking ecosystem, SharpLink Gaming, a leading public online performance marketing company, has become a leader in ETH adoption. SharpLink Gaming’s foray into ETH staking underscores the rise in confidence among institutional investors in the network’s long-term fundamentals. In a post on X, SharpLink Gaming disclosed that the company’s Ethereum holdings or treasury reserve have grown exponentially. Interestingly, this growth is propelled by a surge in its ETH staking rewards that continue to compound its crypto treasury strength. The company’s increasing ETH reserves show a strategic plan to increase its exposure to the larger decentralized ecosystem while taking advantage of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake reward potential. In addition, the move reflects how the altcoin is now being viewed beyond its status as a digital asset, but rather as a productive and yield-generating treasury asset in the financial landscape. According to the report from SharpLink Gaming , its crypto holdings now boast 840,124 ETH, valued at approximately $3.45 billion at current price levels, after several notable staking rewards. Its staking rewards of about 488 ETH from last week pushed its overall holdings to the aforementioned number of Ethereum. The company’s ETH holdings have been steadily increasing since launching its treasury strategy. With 488 Ethereum generated from staking rewards last week, SharpLink Gaming’s total cumulative rewards from staking activity are currently at 5,211 ETH, worth around $20 million. Despite recent market fluctuations, the firm’s vision that ETH will spur the next wave of finance still remains unchanged. ETH Staking Explodes To Unprecedented Territory Given the rise in retail and institutional staking, there has been a sharp increase in Ethereum staking. Leon Waidmann, the head of research at Onchain Foundation, reported that ETH staking is at its all-time high (ATH) levels, which signals a robust conviction from investors across the leading blockchain . As more ETH continues to be locked up in staking contracts, the supply of liquid tokens in circulation is shrinking. While Ethereum staking has increased sharply, the total supply of ETH on crypto exchanges continues to hit record levels. Data shared by Waidmann shows that nearly 30% of all ETH is locked up in staking. Meanwhile, ETH supply on all crypto exchanges has fallen to 15 million, raising the possibility of a textbook supply squeeze for the leading altcoin.

Rather than relying solely on flashy promotions or aesthetics, Spartans has built a foundation that prioritizes user trust above all else. Every transaction, every wager, and every payout is backed by robust systems designed to ensure transparency, scalability, and safety. From encrypted wallet management to real-time anti-bot detection, Spartans betting is built to protect both casual players and high-stakes investors alike. It’s not just another gaming site; it’s a secure crypto ecosystem where betting meets blockchain-grade confidence. Infrastructure That Prioritizes Stability Behind every successful gaming platform lies an infrastructure capable of handling both scale and performance. Spartans Bet’s backend architecture is built with the same principles that power top financial systems: speed, redundancy, and fail-safe mechanisms. The platform maintains consistent uptime and low latency even during peak gaming hours, ensuring that players never face interruptions or delays when making wagers. Spartans achieves this through distributed servers and scalable systems that adjust dynamically based on player traffic. This adaptability allows Spartans betting to provide a seamless user experience. The focus on infrastructure stability also means that gameplay, data storage, and crypto processing all run in sync without bottlenecks, a rare advantage in the crypto gambling sector. Wallet Security at the Core One of the strongest features of Spartans crypto gambling is its wallet protection layer. Every player’s funds are held in encrypted, multi-signature cold wallets, minimizing exposure to online threats. For transactions, the platform uses hot wallets with limited liquidity, balancing convenience with safety. This structure ensures that even in the unlikely event of an attempted breach, player assets remain secure. Spartans also supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, along with select stablecoins. Transactions are verified through blockchain-level confirmations, giving users a clear audit trail of every deposit and withdrawal. By integrating these systems, Spartans Bet aligns with financial-grade compliance standards, offering the reassurance players and investors expect from a serious platform. Anti-Bot and Fair Play Systems Fairness in gaming isn’t just about random number generation; it’s about maintaining a level playing field for every user. Spartans Bet has deployed sophisticated anti-bot algorithms that detect and block automated betting behavior in real time. These systems analyze user actions, timing patterns, and wager sequences to ensure all bets are placed by human participants. This is particularly important in Spartans betting, where live odds, crash games, and market-based wagers can be exploited by scripts or botnets. The anti-bot layer ensures honest gameplay and genuine competition, protecting not only the casino’s integrity but also the experience of legitimate users. For players, this means they can compete with confidence, knowing that every round is free of manipulation. Audited and Transparent Operations Spartans doesn’t hide behind closed systems. It operates with a transparency model that includes third-party audits and verifiable game fairness reports. The platform’s Spartans crypto gambling framework logs every transaction and gameplay outcome on an immutable ledger, ensuring traceability from start to finish. Regular security audits and penetration testing are conducted by independent firms to verify the platform’s resilience against potential vulnerabilities. These tests evaluate the strength of Spartans’ encryption, access control, and payment verification systems. For users, the result is simple: every spin, card draw, and bet can be trusted because it’s backed by verifiable proof rather than vague claims. Scalable Gaming Engine for Performance and Growth Scalability isn’t just about handling traffic; it’s about supporting continuous expansion without sacrificing speed or quality. Spartans Bet uses a modular gaming engine that can integrate new online betting features and games without downtime. This system architecture ensures that updates, new launches, and seasonal events can go live instantly across all regions. The same scalability benefits the crypto transaction layer. Deposits, wagers, and withdrawals are processed through optimized smart routing systems that handle multiple blockchains simultaneously. Whether it’s a small wager or a large tournament payout, Spartans ensures near-instant confirmations and zero failed transactions. This efficiency not only improves the player experience but also positions Spartans betting as a reliable platform for long-term growth in global markets. Crypto Integration That Works Smoothly Crypto adoption in betting often struggles with user experience, but Spartans has simplified it completely. The deposit process is straightforward, the payout flow is fast, and currency conversions happen with full transparency. The integration of blockchain technology enhances the overall gaming environment rather than complicating it. Users of Spartans crypto gambling can easily track their wager history, view smart contract references, and verify results in real time. The fusion of crypto transparency with casino-style entertainment makes Spartans one of the most advanced gaming platforms available. It’s built for users who want to enjoy modern gambling without sacrificing financial control or anonymity. Conclusion: Where Security Meets Entertainment For players and investors who demand more than just entertainment, Spartans Bet delivers a complete solution built on trust, technology, and performance. Its secure infrastructure, audited transparency, and intelligent anti-bot systems set it apart from typical gaming platforms. With blockchain-backed verification, multi-layer wallet protection, and a scalable gaming engine, it’s the perfect mix of fun and financial integrity. Spartans betting represents the future of online gaming, one where every player has full confidence in the system protecting their funds and data. In a market where trust is rare, Spartans crypto gambling stands as proof that high-stakes gaming can also be safe, fair, and truly scalable.

The asset is trading within a rising structure on the higher timeframes, and analysts are watching for any clear move above the current resistance. BNB Trades Near Major Resistance BNB is trading around $1,181 at press time, down slightly over the past 24 hours and nearly 10% lower on the week. Even with the dip, the price remains within a rising channel that has developed over multiple years. The upper boundary of this channel sits near $1,400, a level that has previously caused reversals. Analyst Jonathan Carter described this point as a “ make-or-break moment ” for BNB. He mapped out longer-term targets at $1,800, $2,500, and $4,500, provided the current resistance area is cleared. These levels are based on previous price reactions and key horizontal zones. #BNB Ascending Channel About to Unfold?

Furthermore, BNB found support at $1,069.75 during the recent pullback. It has since rebounded and is now trading above $1,140. This level has become important as price continues to hover within a range between $1,120 and $1,200, which appears to be acting as a decision zone. Market watcher Skull noted , “Buyers still in control with price action showing resilience in this zone.” He added, “If we break $1,200 again, next stop gonna be new highs.” So far, the level has held, but another test of $1,200 may be needed to confirm momentum. Derivatives Market Signals Trader Interest According to Coinglass, BNB futures open interest is just under $2.5 billion. This figure has grown steadily since mid-July, tracking alongside price gains. The rise in open interest reflects growing participation in the BNB market. Source: Coinglass While open interest has pulled back slightly from its recent peak, the overall level remains high. Traders appear to be maintaining exposure, and market positioning still leans toward a continuation, provided BNB stays above the key support levels.

That’s precisely what unfolded this week when an X post drew renewed attention to an old confession by Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz. Though the comment itself was reflective rather than predictive, the crypto community interpreted it as an unmistakable hint about XRP’s potential future trajectory. The Post That Set the XRP Community Abuzz David Schwartz is one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger and a central figure at Ripple Labs. In his recent X post, Schwartz revisited a well-known personal anecdote — the time he sold 40,000 ETH at about $1 each to finance solar panels for a house he no longer owns. Not long after, that same amount of ETH was worth over $100 million, a loss he has often described with a mixture of humor and humility. While Schwartz’s message was primarily reflective — an acknowledgment of how unpredictable the crypto market can be — it was quickly picked up by several commentators who read between the lines. It couldn't be clearer; David Schwartz is indirectly telling you that XRP will rise significantly. Read between the lines. pic.twitter.com/t2LEqzuFhd — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 14, 2025 Among them was {x} (@unknowDLT), who argued that the post was an indirect signal to XRP holders: a subtle reminder not to make the same mistake by exiting too soon before a major price breakout. Why the Community Thinks It’s a Message About XRP According to @unknowDLT, Schwartz’s anecdote should not be viewed merely as a story of missed profit but as a lesson in long-term conviction. The interpretation suggests that Schwartz, as Ripple’s CTO and one of the most informed individuals about the XRP Ledger’s evolution, might be using a personal experience to encourage holders to stay patient. Given Schwartz’s position and influence, any statement he makes about cryptocurrencies — even indirectly — tends to be dissected and amplified across the XRP community. This latest reflection has been seen by many as a morale-boosting signal amid the ongoing narrative that XRP remains significantly undervalued compared to its utility and global partnerships. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Separating Sentiment from Substance However, while the emotional impact of the post is undeniable, it’s essential to distinguish market sentiment from market fundamentals. Schwartz did not directly predict an XRP price surge or make any explicit investment claim. His story, though rooted in truth, has been in circulation for years, resurfacing periodically whenever investor sentiment in XRP turns hopeful. Still, stories like these often fuel optimism — and in crypto, optimism itself can become a market force. With Ripple continuing to expand its cross-border payment network, and with renewed institutional attention on blockchain utility beyond speculation, XRP’s long-term fundamentals remain a recurring subject of bullish debate. The Real Lesson Behind Schwartz’s Reflection Ultimately, {x}’s interpretation serves as a symbolic reminder rather than a factual forecast. The underlying message — patience and conviction in one’s investments — resonates with many who have watched digital assets swing dramatically in value. For XRP holders, Schwartz’s story underscores a timeless lesson: sometimes, the greatest losses come not from bad investments, but from good ones abandoned too early. Whether or not XRP soon embarks on the kind of exponential growth ETH once saw, Schwartz’s reflection continues to echo through the community as a call to think long-term and stay the course. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a single tweet can reignite hope, reshape narratives, and strengthen conviction. David Schwartz’s story — and {x}’s interpretation of it — may not be a price prediction, but it is a powerful reminder of the enduring tension between caution and conviction that defines every investor’s journey.

It projects that global public debt may exceed 100% of global GDP by 2029, surpassing the levels reached after World War II in 1948. The IMF has urged policymakers worldwide to tighten fiscal measures and be prepared for potential financial shakeups due to increased borrowing costs. Victor Gaspar, the Director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, noted that public debt risks have widened and will continue to grow even faster if no controls are implemented. IMF says public debt may go beyond record set after WWII Under an adverse but plausible scenario, the IMF cautioned that debt could rise as high as 123% of GDP by the end of the decade, approaching the record set just after World War II. The financial institution revealed that debt ratios have increased due to a slow growth rate from governments, which has led to increased interest rates. It highlighted several factors driving the high public debt, including increased defense spending, aging populations, and the need for climate adaptation. “After years of rising debt and falling interest rates, the environment has changed dramatically. Interest rates have increased; financial asset valuations have stretched. The greatest concern is financial turmoil, driven by fiscal-financial feedback loops.” – Victor Gaspar , Director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department Low interest rates emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, also contributing to high public debt before the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased rates. The latest Fiscal Monitor report builds on the April report, which issued the same warnings. The April report warned that global debt would surpass 95% of the worldwide GDP in 2025. Meanwhile, the IMF has projected that public debt will reach 100% by the end of the decade. The financial institution highlighted rising yields, widening spreads, and complex trade-offs between reducing borrowing and sustaining growth. The U.S. tariff wars introduced in April threatened growth in major economies, including the U.S., pushing public debt even higher this year as governments struggled with meeting defense and social spending. The April Fiscal Monitor report estimated that global trade tariffs could add approximately 4.5% to global GDP in the short term. IMF warns that the fiscal space is narrowing for large economies Large economies, such as the U.S., China, Japan, France, Italy, Canada, and the UK, have either surpassed the 100% of GDP mark or will soon do so, according to the IMF. The report cautioned that the fiscal space for those economies is narrowing, and they may no longer enjoy the benefit of deep bond markets and investor confidence. The IMF also noted that small and emerging economies are at a higher risk of higher borrowing rates despite their low debt-to-GDP ratios due to limited fiscal capacity. The report added that low-income nations will be left to shocks from price swings, natural disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and even renewed trade tensions. However, Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, has signaled that the US still has room to improve its fiscal balance. In an interview with CNBC, he stated that the deficit-to-GDP ratio may decrease to 3% in the short term from its current level of 5%. The current U.S. deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30 has not been released yet, following the ongoing government shutdown. The IMF advised the U.S. to focus on deficit reduction, pension, and health care reforms to reduce and stabilize public debt. The financial institution argued that lowering the U.S. deficit would help rebalance the economy and improve the country’s economic conditions. The Fund also emphasized that redirecting a portion of current spending towards education and human capital investment, even if it’s just 1% of the GDP, could increase government revenue by more than 3% by 2050 in developed countries and 6% in developing economies. It also urged developing countries to strengthen their tax systems and maintain credible adjustment paths to avoid crises.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond.

The Bollinger Bands are slightly widening, which indicates renewed volatility, while the price remains below the midline, reinforcing a bearish bias. The MACD chart stays in the negative zone, which means that there is still a persistent selling momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI at 34 signals that SONIC is approaching oversold territory, hinting at potential short-term relief. If buyers step in, a recovery toward $0.22–$0.24 could occur. However, failure to hold above $0.17 may trigger further declines toward $0.15, thereby maintaining the dominant downtrend. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart for Sonic (SONIC/USD) suggests consolidation after its recent drop, currently trading near $0.19. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating reduced volatility and a possible breakout ahead. The MACD shows weakening bullish momentum as histogram bars fade, suggesting buying strength is slowing. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.19 shows mild buyer control, but not enough to drive a major rally yet. If bullish momentum returns, SONIC may test resistance at $0.21–$0.22. However, sustained weakness below $0.19 could lead to a retest of the $0.17 support, signaling continued bearish control in the short term. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.2430 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.2198 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.2536 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2531 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.2826 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.3081 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.3918 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.2578 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.2717 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.2893 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.3029 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.3180 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.3501 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4045 SELL What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Sonic (previously FTM) is likely to face continued consolidation in the near term as the market seeks direction following the recent volatility. On the 4-hour and daily charts, the price has stabilized around $0.19, hovering close to the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting muted momentum. The MACD reflects fading bullish strength, while the RSI near 34 implies that sellers still dominate, though the asset is close to being oversold. For an upward recovery, SONIC must close above $0.21–$0.22 to shift sentiment. Conversely, if it fails to hold above $0.18, the next decline could drive prices toward the $0.16–$0.17 range. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

With this license, the bank aims to conduct “certain cryptocurrency activities” through its subsidiary, Connectia Trust. According to the filing documents, Sony Bank plans to issue stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, manage reserves for these assets, and offer digital asset custody and portfolio management services. Sony's move comes amid a flurry of new financial and technology giants entering the stablecoin market in the US. Companies like Stripe, Coinbase, Paxos Trust, and Circle have also applied for a crypto banking license from the OCC. Anchorage Digital Bank is the only company to have received a full license so far. The bank, which faced a cease-and-desist order from the OCC in 2022, was finally freed from these restrictions in August of this year. This activity in the sector accelerated further with the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US. The new law established a formal framework for stablecoin issuance and trading, paving the way for many large companies from both the finance and technology sectors to enter the market.

The total market capitalization currently stands at $312 billion. Sony Bank operates as a subsidiary of the Sony Group, but is independent of PlayStation maker Sony Interactive Entertainment. The group comprises hundreds of other companies and subsidiaries. Sony's interest in crypto is not new. Last year, the company partnered with blockchain firm Startale Group to launch an Ethereum Layer-2 network called Soneiun. The project went live in January of this year, following plans announced for a 2023 launch. Sony Bank included the following statement in its application: “In the initial phase of operations, we plan to conduct certain legally compliant digital asset transactions for national banks. These include dollar-pegged stablecoin issuance, reserve management, digital asset custody services, and asset management activities for select subsidiaries.” *This is not investment advice.

He made his remarks amid rising tensions in U.S.-China trade policies, which began last week. Miran believes that the labor market began to weaken this year due to the uncertainty over trade policies. He also argued that there may have been the biggest tax hike in history, and firms were probably holding off on investing until the recent tax bill (Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill) was established. U.S.-China’s re-ignited trade war fuels Fed policy decisions Stephen Miran: ""The labor market continued to weaken in the first half of this year.” pic.twitter.com/CYAj61FdWH — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) October 15, 2025 The economist noted that the U.S. had the biggest rearrangement of global policy in half a century. He also argued the Fed held off in making decisions in the first half of the year as deals were being made on policies. Miran acknowledged that uncertainty led to the weakness seen in the first half of 2025. He also said that until last week, he had been operating under the assumption that a lot of that uncertainty had dissipated, since the tax bill had become law and trade deals had been settled for most of the U.S.’s large trading partners. The Fed governor also believes that China decided last week that the deals made earlier in the year in Geneva, London, and Madrid were no longer bound to them. Miran said his assumption that the growth outlook was positive changed after China reneged on the deals that had been made. “And so I think it’s incumbent upon us as policymakers to think about the introduction of a new tail risk. The left tail has become a little fatter , as we might say, and we have to recognize that. There potentially is some difference now versus where we thought things were a week ago.” – Stephen Miran , Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Miran believes it’s incumbent upon the Fed as policymakers to recognize that the change should be reflected in policy. According to him, it would be reasonable for the central bank to consider two additional rate cuts at the upcoming Fed meetings. The Fed will hold its next meeting on October 28-29, with its final meeting scheduled for mid-December. At the time of publication, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 96.7% probability that the Fed may cut interest rates on October 29 and a 95.8% chance for another rate cut on December 10. Michelle Bowman, a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said on Tuesday that she still anticipates two more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at its final two meetings of 2025. She also argued that the central bank will continue to be on a path of lowering rates as long as the labor market and other economic data evolve as the Fed expects. Central bank seeks to balance the labor market and inflation The central bank cut interest rates last month by a quarter of a basis point to 4.00%-4.25%, its first cut since December. Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller championed last month’s rate cut at the previous meeting in July, saying that they believe Trump’s trade policies will not lead to persistent inflation and that the balance of risk is tilted toward the job market. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last month that the central bank is trying to balance against two risks that could call for competing policy decisions: the weakness in the job market and rising inflation. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Powell also warned on Tuesday that a slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy. Powell noted that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, the outlook for employment and inflation didn’t seem to change much since September’s meeting. He also highlighted that the Fed is slightly worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to maintain stable prices.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-news-feds-highly-anticipated-beige-book-document-released-here-are-the-details/,"According to the FED's latest Beige Book report, no significant change has been observed in economic activities across the country recently. Consumer spending declined slightly, employment levels remained largely stable, but labor demand weakened. Wages rose modestly across all regions, but prices continued to rise due to import costs, spending on services, and tariffs. Three of the Fed's 12 districts reported a slight increase in economic activity, five reported no change, and four reported a slight weakening. While retail spending declined, some districts saw increased car sales due to strong demand for electric vehicles. While high-income consumers increased their spending on luxury travel and accommodation, middle- and low-income households turned to discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices. Manufacturing activity varied by region, with most regions reporting challenging conditions due to high tariffs and weak demand. Agricultural, energy, and transportation activity experienced a general decline. Interest-sensitive sectors (especially residential and commercial real estate) showed mixed signals: some regions saw increased credit demand, supported by low interest rates, while others remained stagnant. According to the Fed report, economic growth expectations vary by region. While optimism has increased in some regions, most noted that high uncertainty continues to weigh on economic activity. One regional report noted that a potential prolonged government shutdown poses a downside risk to growth. Related News: Sony Takes a Major Step Towards Cryptocurrencies While employment remained generally stable, there was a significant weakening in labor demand. Many employers implemented layoffs or reduced staffing through natural attrition due to falling demand, economic uncertainty, and increased investment in artificial intelligence. However, some employers reported that finding workers had become easier and that they were shifting their focus to temporary or part-time workers rather than full-time. They noted that changes in immigration policies were causing labor supply difficulties, particularly in the agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and tourism sectors. Wages increased modestly to moderately across all regions. A significant increase in employer health insurance costs in recent weeks has put pressure on labor costs. Prices continued to rise nationwide. Many regions reported accelerating increases in the cost of insurance, healthcare, and technology services, along with import costs. While input costs from customs duties were widely felt, the extent to which firms passed these increases onto final prices varied. While some manufacturers and retailers held their prices steady to maintain market share, others passed on cost increases entirely to customers. Prices for raw materials like steel and lumber have fallen in some regions due to falling demand. *This is not investment advice.

The leading cryptocurrency has since stabilized, consolidating below the $115,000 mark as traders and institutions reassess short-term momentum. While volatility has returned, on-chain and institutional data continue to show underlying strength in Bitcoin’s fundamentals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Handles $14B OI Drop As Spot Volume Surged To $44B: Controlled Reset? According to a new report from Bitwise, institutional demand remains robust — with 72 publicly known companies collectively holding more than 1 million BTC, valued at roughly $117 billion. This includes major corporate holders, ETFs, and investment funds that continue to view Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset despite the market turbulence. This growing accumulation reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s macro trend remains intact, driven by institutional adoption and long-term conviction. As the market digests recent volatility, the strength of these treasury positions could play a key role in stabilizing prices and setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next major move. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Reaches Record Levels in Q3 The latest Bitwise report highlights a striking development in Bitcoin’s institutional landscape: 176,762 BTC were purchased during Q3 by publicly listed companies and funds. This steady growth in corporate treasuries underscores how Bitcoin continues to evolve from a speculative asset into a recognized component of the global financial ecosystem. At the forefront of this movement remains Strategy, which retains its position as the largest corporate holder with 640,031 BTC, equivalent to tens of billions in market value. The firm also added an impressive 40,000 BTC during the third quarter, demonstrating persistent conviction despite recent volatility. Other institutions and ETFs have followed suit, expanding their Bitcoin exposure as part of broader digital asset strategies aimed at hedging inflation, diversifying reserves, and participating in a new phase of global liquidity cycles. This expanding corporate adoption suggests that Bitcoin has entered a more mature and globally integrated phase. No longer seen solely as a speculative trade, it is increasingly recognized as a strategic asset within the balance sheets of financial institutions and multinational corporations. In essence, this trend reflects the institutionalization of Bitcoin—a movement that stabilizes demand, reinforces market confidence, and reduces the dominance of short-term retail speculation. As regulatory frameworks evolve and traditional finance converges with blockchain technology, Bitcoin’s presence in corporate treasuries could become as routine as holding cash or government bonds.

This level has acted as a key supply area over recent months, and each failed breakout attempt has reinforced it as a strong ceiling for the price. After the flash crash to $103,000 last week, BTC staged a moderate recovery but remains trapped between the 50-day moving average (blue) and the 200-day moving average (red)—a zone that often defines medium-term trend direction. Bulls have managed to protect the $110,000–$111,000 support area, but repeated tests of this range show weakening momentum and growing uncertainty. Related Reading: Binance Stablecoin Supply Surges To Record $42B: Liquidity Flows Back Into Markets The moving averages are currently flattening, suggesting market indecision. If Bitcoin fails to retake the $115,000–$117,500 range, further downside toward $108,000 or even $105,000 remains possible in the short term. Conversely, a successful daily close above $117,500 could confirm renewed bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward $122,000–$125,000. BTC appears to be in a consolidation phase, digesting recent volatility while traders wait for clearer direction. Institutional flows and on-chain signals will likely determine whether this zone becomes a base for recovery or the beginning of another leg lower.

If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, we might see another dip to retest the $414 support zone. Is Bittensor TAO a good investment? TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is TAO down? TAO is trading at $425.04 amidst the ongoing market conditions, as today’s bearish trend has brought selling pressure for the altcoin. After finding resistance at $461, buyers lost control, resulting in a downward trend for the day. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

This buyback comes as Cardano affirms the lower boundary of a year-long symmetrical triangle, now nearing its apex.

The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory above 30, while the MACD histogram shows a potential peak below the signal line, both hinting at the early stages of a bullish reversal. With the bulls yet to take control, another retest of this support may be in stall, forming a much stronger double bottom reversal structure. The key threshold for confirmation sits around the historic demand zone at $0.71, which must hold as support to validate a breakout. If successful, the move could fuel a 100% rally to cycle highs near $1.36 before year-end. And with continued U.S. interest rate easing into 2026 to stimulate risk sentiment and potential TradFi exposure through spot ETFs, the pattern could fully realize its $3 target—a 345% gain from current levels.

Investor confidence in artificial intelligence has carried the U.S. stock market to record highs, but signs of doubt are beginning to appear. For nearly three years, AI has dominated Wall Street , lifting technology stocks and bringing in trillions in market value, but investors are now scrutinizing the potential weaknesses that could threaten the momentum. Analysts are warning that the cost of AI innovation, including capital spending and energy costs, makes it risky for investors. Investors question the strength of market gains from AI Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, AI’s potential has become a central theme for investors. Citigroup estimates that nearly half of the S&P 500’s total market capitalization, which is around $57 trillion, has “high” or “medium” exposure to AI. The S&P 500 has climbed roughly 13% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up about 17%. “So much of what is holding up the markets is either directly or indirectly related to that trade,” Yung-Yu Ma, a chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group, said. But the same dependence on AI that’s fueling record highs could also leave the market vulnerable if expectations are not met. Investors are watching for any sign s that AI demand might taper off or that the expected returns will fail to materialize. “One potential trigger is that suddenly the needs just look like they are going to be less than was originally anticipated,” Ma said. Several stumbles in the industry this year include the launch of China’s low-cost AI model, Deepseek , which caused brief turmoil in tech stocks and raised concerns about the high costs of building and maintaining advanced AI systems. A similar incident occurred in August, but both times, the market recovered. Still, the risks have not disappeared. “There is a huge opportunity here, but it really just comes down to what’s priced in and what’s not,” Steve Lowe, a chief investment strategist at Thrivent Financial, said. “There’s a lot of growth priced in, and that’s one of the concerns, because there are still a number of risks that could trip up people’s expectations.” Major U.S. companies are set to release their quarterly results, and investors will be able to assess how sustainable AI investments are and whether the earnings are equivalent to the hype. Analysts weigh in Building and maintaining the infrastructure needed to power AI applications requires massive investments. Barclays strategists estimate that capital expenses from major AI and cloud companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Oracle, will nearly double by 2027 to about $500B annually. While these firms generate vast amounts of cash, rising costs of AI innovation could erode profits. “It’s important to watch whether they’re spending faster than their growth rates and eating into their free cash flow margins,” Michael Arone, a chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management, said. However, any reduction in spending or investing in AI by these companies could alarm investors, as AI expansion depends heavily on continuous investment. “The bigger risk is not investing too much; it’s not investing enough right now,” Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said. Nvidia’s recent plan to invest up to $100B in OpenAI also shows the interconnection between many leaders in the AI and tech industry. “There is significant systemic risk in such close financial and operational ties,” Irene Tunkel, the chief U.S. equity strategist at BCA Research, warned. Anastacio Teodoro, the senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, added that investors should pay attention to how large tech companies fund their deals. “When you see these big announcements, you want to see it funded through cash flow, not debt or equity raises,” she said. Heavy borrowing or dilution could signal that companies are stretching too far. Venu Krishna, the head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays warned about the potential inability of the U.S. power supply to keep up with the energy needs of data centers and AI operations. Patrick Ryan, the chief investment strategist at Madison Investments, added that so far, the evidence of AI’s economic payoff remains limited. “If you get to the point where it becomes questionable that all of this investment was really going to pay off, that is going to be something that would be very at risk,” he said.

Blockchain analytics firms Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence tracked the movement of 9,757 BTC, which is worth around $1.1 billion, to several new addresses. Hours later, an additional 2,129 BTC (about $238 million) was transferred , bringing the total to 11,886 BTC, now valued at over $1.3 billion. Source: Arkham Intelligence However, the timing has sparked curiosity about whether the move was a precautionary reaction to the DOJ’s crackdown or a long-planned reallocation. Blockchain analysts note that similar awakenings often occur after major enforcement actions, as large holders attempt to reorganize funds, enhance privacy, or preempt potential freezes. However, some market observers caution against reading too much into the timing, pointing to recent activity among Bitcoin mining firms adjusting their treasuries amid volatile markets. MARA Holdings purchased 400 BTC (about $46 million) on Oct. 13, increasing its reserves to 53,250 BTC (worth over $6 billion). Riot Platforms produced 445 BTC in September and sold 465 BTC for around $52.6 million, maintaining a 19,287 BTC treasury. Bitfarms sold 1,052 BTC in Q2 for about $95,500 each, retaining 1,402 BTC by mid-August. These data points show a divergence in miner strategy, with some accumulating amid price dips, while others liquidate to fund growth and operations. Whether defensive or strategic, LuBian’s reemergence and a $1.3 billion Bitcoin shuffle right after a major DOJ announcement have set off one of crypto’s most compelling mysteries of the month. The Curious Coincidence Between DOJ’s Case and LuBian’s $1.3B Move The timing of this move has sparked speculation across the crypto community, coming less than 24 hours after U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Prince Holding Group , a Cambodia-based conglomerate accused of orchestrating an international crypto fraud and money laundering network. @USTreasury has moved to make its largest-ever cryptocurrency seizure, targeting $12B in #Bitcoin from a global ""pig butchering"" scam. #US #PigButchering https://t.co/6JpciJNrod — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The DOJ’s complaint seeks to forfeit around $14.4 billion in Bitcoin, allegedly tied to schemes run by the group’s founder, Chen Zhi. Court filings allege that Zhi and his associates laundered illicit proceeds through large-scale mining operations, including Warp Data in Laos, its Texas-based subsidiary, and LuBian in China, which ranked as the sixth-largest Bitcoin mining pool in 2020. According to the DOJ, these companies “produced large sums of clean Bitcoin dissociated from criminal proceeds.” Adding to the intrigue, Arkham Intelligence previously reported that LuBian had been hacked for 127,426 BTC in 2020 (worth about $3.5 billion at the time). Arkham’s September report noted that 11,886 BTC had been moved to recovery wallets, which is the exact same amount that just became active this week. A massive Bitcoin theft from 2020 has surfaced nearly four years later, and it's now being called the largest crypto heist ever uncovered. #Bitcoin #Hack https://t.co/5Qq5HqbUMn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 3, 2025 The reactivation of those funds, following years of silence and within hours of the DOJ’s major Bitcoin seizure, has raised questions about whether the two events are connected or coincidental. If the DOJ succeeds in its forfeiture claims, it could mark one of the biggest additions to the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings to date, further strengthening its role as a leader in the crypto space. These developments come amid Washington’s formal establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), a controversial initiative seeking to convert seized assets into a sovereign digital reserve, thereby showing how the crypto crackdown is evolving into crypto custody at the highest levels of government. Crypto Crackdown to Crypto Reserve: Inside the U.S. Government’s Growing Bitcoin Power What began as a crackdown on illicit cryptocurrency activity has quietly evolved into one of the largest sovereign Bitcoin holdings in the world. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) , a move that effectively formalizes the United States’ role as a major player in the digital asset economy. The reserve is designed to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized in criminal and civil cases, a departure from the long-standing policy of auctioning off confiscated coins. By August, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government already controls between $15 billion and $20 billion worth of forfeited Bitcoin . Current data suggests that the United States now holds roughly 197,354 BTC, valued at around $22.45 billion, placing it at the top of the global leaderboard of government Bitcoin holders. Source: Bitbo China follows closely with an estimated 190,000 BTC, while the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates round out the top five sovereign holders. In September, Congress advanced a bill requiring the Treasury Department to deliver a detailed report on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve within 90 days of enactment . The report will assess the feasibility, security, and accounting of a government-managed Bitcoin stockpile built primarily from seized cryptocurrencies. Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s strongest supporters, has said the reserve will allow the United States to “secure its debts with a hard asset” and ensure transparency through on-chain audits. Add this to the reasons why a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the wisest thing we can do to shore up USD. It secures our debt with a hard asset + we can audit it to prove reserves at any time.

He said these lobbyists are working to block companies like Ripple Labs from obtaining access to the Federal Reserve’s master accounts, which are essential for institutions that directly interact with the US central bank. Garlinghouse’s statements highlight the continuous conflict between established financial institutions and blockchain businesses as they seek financial system legitimacy. Traditional institutions argue that the crypto industry should be held to the same standards for money-laundering protections and other illicit-finance safeguards as traditional financial businesses. However, they don’t want to share the same standards for the good stuff. According to Garlinghouse, crypto “should have the same access to infrastructure, like a Fed master account.” He said , “You can’t say one and then combat the other It’s hypocritical, and I think we all should call them out for being anti-competitive in that regard.” Crypto companies line up for OCC licences and Mastercards Crypto companies have encountered challenges in obtaining access from the Fed, or even in understanding how it could be granted. Ripple recently applied for a Federal Reserve master account through its wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Custody & Trust Company, to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed. Around the same time, the company applied for a national banking license from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Additionally, Circle Internet Group has filed for a national trust bank license, which would allow it to act as a custodian for its USDC stablecoin reserves and provide digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Anchorage Digital Bank, which has held a national trust bank charter since 2021, formally filed for a Fed master account in late August 2025. A master account would enable Anchorage to settle transactions directly with the Fed, rather than routing them through intermediary banks. However, no public decision has been made approving any of these recent OCC charter applications or master account requests for these companies in 2025. The applications are still under review. Legally, crypto firms can apply for both OCC national trust bank charters and Federal Reserve master accounts, but approval is not guaranteed and remains highly discretionary. The US law does not explicitly bar digital asset companies from accessing the banking system. Instead, the Federal Reserve Act and OCC regulations allow any eligible depository institution to apply. However, regulators have been cautious, arguing that most crypto firms pose heightened risks related to liquidity, custody, and compliance. The OCC has slowed or denied several applications since 2022, and the Fed has defended its right to limit master account access to institutions it deems safe and compliant with federal oversight. Garlinghouse says RLUSD has made things easier Ripple, which has recently delved into the field of stablecoin issuers, said banks are finally taking them more seriously after years of difficulty, in which the resistance from US regulators made the financial firms reluctant to engage. “I had meetings yesterday in New York City, where banks that would not have talked to us three years ago are now leaning in and saying, how could we partner around this?” he said. He said granting crypto firms, such as Ripple and Circle, master accounts will contribute to greater stability, enhanced regulatory oversight, and risk mitigation. “It’s been a little disappointing to see some of the traditional banks start to lobby against things like that,” Garlinghouse added. Meanwhile, RLUSD has reached a new milestone after surpassing the $800 million mark in its market cap. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have jumped by 34% for this stablecoin, and currently account for 18% of its market cap. Get seen where it counts.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 19:03:15

Analysts point to improving technical indicators, renewed investor confidence, and strong resistance testing as signs that Monero could be entering a bullish phase. Monero builds momentum above key levels Monero’s price has climbed steadily, trading at around $317.22 at press time, with its price fluctuating between $306.80 and $330.16 over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation stands near $5.88 billion, supported by a 24-hour trading volume of more than $250 million. Notably, over the last year, XMR has surged by more than 100%, reaffirming its resilience in a volatile market. Technical analysis strengthens the bullish case Since early February 2024, Monero’s price has followed an ascending channel pattern, forming higher lows even after sharp market corrections. The token recently bounced from its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $295, showing strong support at lower levels. Technical charts also point to a possible MA50/100 bullish crossover — a signal that could trigger a major upside move. Monero price analysis | Source: CoinMarketCap If this crossover is confirmed, analysts predict a rally of up to 79.64% from recent lows, potentially propelling Monero to $420. Some forecasts even suggest gains of 128% if the rally aligns with the 2.0 Fibonacci extension, placing the token back at levels not seen since May 2025. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the 52.75 mark, reflecting increasing buying pressure, while the MACD indicator approaches a bullish crossover. These signals suggest growing momentum among traders, further strengthening the bullish outlook. Privacy coins thriving amid regulatory tension The broader market dynamics also favour Monero’s rise. Other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, including Zcash (ZEC) , are thriving as global regulators tighten their grip on digital assets. As regulatory pressure mounts, demand for privacy coins has increased. The US Department of Justice recently confirmed the largest-ever crypto seizure, recovering 127,271 BTC valued at around $14 billion from Cambodia’s Prince Group. In addition, Japan is preparing new rules to curb crypto insider trading , which could drive investors toward privacy-oriented tokens. Monero’s price has benefited from this shift, as investors seek refuge in assets that emphasise confidentiality and financial independence. Monero price outlook For Monero (XMR) traders, the critical battle lies between the $320 and $347 zones. A successful breakout above these resistance levels could confirm the start of a new bullish phase. However, $345 remains a crucial ceiling, having capped gains since mid-June, but recent rebounds suggest growing momentum among bulls. If Monero breaks past the $345 barrier, it could test the $372 level next, before targeting the $420 zone. However, should Monero’s price fail to maintain support above $295 could pull the price back toward $285 or even $190, where the 1-week MA200 sits as long-term protection for the bullish setup.

Prices collapsed, automated liquidations multiplied, and across the industry, alarm bells rang. But as the dust settles, one narrative is intensifying: that the flash crash was not merely a macro shock but also an exchange-level failure with deep implications for pricing integrity and investor protection. Flash Crash by the Numbers: How Big Was It? In the span of just 24 hours, total forced liquidations in the crypto markets reached an estimated $19–20 billion, dwarfing previous dislocations such as the FTX collapse or the COVID-19 drawdown. Data aggregators ranked Hyperliquid, Bybit, and Binance among the top exchanges by liquidation volume, with Binance responsible for more than $2.4 billion in closed positions . Many market participants contend these public numbers substantially understate total losses, especially when factoring in cross-platform funding and off-exchange exposure. The shockwave of the crash also exposed cracks in order-routing, API throttling under load, frozen user interfaces, and failed stop-loss executions. Some Binance users reported account freezes and an inability to act during critical moments. JUST IN: @cryptocom CEO IS CALLING ON REGULATORS TO INVESTIGATE @binance FOLLOWING $400B IN LIQUIDATIONS FLASH CRASH CAUSED BY BINANCE’S FAULTY INTERNAL PRICE ORACLES GET YOUR FUNDS OFF BINANCE IMMEDIATELY pic.twitter.com/y1jGiRG8T8 — curb.sol (@CryptoCurb) October 15, 2025 Binance’s Internal Oracle System Under Fire Central to the controversy is the allegation that Binance relied excessively on internal order-book snapshots (or “internal oracles”) to set reference prices in its liquidation engine — rather than robust cross-venue feeds or decentralized oracle data. In particular, three collateral assets—USDE, wBETH, and BnSOL—allegedly depegged sharply on Binance (to levels like $0.65, $0.20, and $0.13, respectively), triggering mass liquidations. On other platforms or on-chain oracle systems, those assets remained much closer to expected peg levels, suggesting that the dislocation was mostly internal to Binance’s pricing system. Critics argue that Binance’s Unified Account margin model, which permitted yield-bearing tokens and unstable stablecoins as collateral, magnified vulnerability. Because liquidation pricing used internal metrics, the system became exploitable once stress began. Some analysts view the timing of the crash — between an announced Oracle update (October 6) and its deployment (scheduled October 14) — as suspicious, giving bad actors a window to prepare. Binance has since acknowledged token depeg events and pledged to review impacted accounts. Co-founder Yi He apologized to users, stating that losses from “market fluctuations” are not eligible for compensation, but promising redress in cases of “platform errors.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Crypto.com CEO’s Call for Regulatory Scrutiny In a high-profile move, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly urged regulators to launch investigations into exchanges that experienced the heaviest liquidations. He questioned whether platforms had slowed or halted trading, mispriced assets, or failed in trade monitoring and anti-manipulation safeguards. Marszalek’s post — amplified by community observers — cited specific exchanges that appeared most exposed and implicitly questioned how much of the crash was endogenous rather than external. These remarks echo broader industry concerns about exchange accountability, transparency, and investor protection during high-stress events. What This Means for XRP Holders For holders of XRP, the episode underscores a critical truth: custody and execution infrastructure matter as much as token fundamentals. Even if XRP maintains its rails, being caught on a platform with flawed internal pricing logic or weak risk controls could lead to amplified losses. Curb post (from which much of this analysis originated) sounded a fire alarm for XRP holders to reassess platform exposure and consider custody alternatives. Particularly, traders should be vigilant about how exchanges price stop-loss orders, how oracles are integrated, and how exchanges handle collateral depeg events under duress. Looking Ahead: Oversight, Reform, and Risk Mitigation The flash crash may prove a turning point in how markets view exchange infrastructure. Possible pathways forward include regulatory audits of pricing and liquidation engines, mandates for external oracle integration, enhanced stress-testing protocols, and clearer disclosure obligations. While Binance has promised internal reviews and compensation for “platform fault” cases, many observers argue that only systematic reform and independent oversight can restore confidence. In sum, the October crash was more than a macro sell-off. It exposed a fault line between token resilience and exchange mechanics. For XRP holders — and all participants in leveraged crypto markets — infrastructure risk is now inseparable from market risk.

The Bitcoin farm was found at an industrial site in Irkutsk, capital of the Siberian region with the same name, which banned the minting of digital coins as a measure to deal with energy deficits. Russia shuts down big mining farm in Irkutsk Russian authorities have terminated one of the biggest unlicensed crypto mining operations this year during a raid in the main city of Irkutsk Oblast, Southeastern Siberia. Officers of the Investigative Committee have confiscated more than 1,200 mining machines, the regional branch of Russia’s main investigating body said in a post on Telegram. The illegal facility was built on the premises of a production site on Rosa Luxemburg Street, the crypto page of the business news portal RBC reported, quoting the announcement. Electrical engineers and even members of the Russian riot police force joined the search, conducted as part of a criminal investigation into suspected electricity theft. Breaking down the hardware numbers further, the press release detailed: “1,257 miners and 66 rigs with video cards were discovered and seized as well as two transformer substations and 10 electricity meters.” Employees of the local utility are currently assessing the financial damages caused by the operators of the massive farm , who will be prosecuted for large-scale fraud under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Investigators intend to also identify the mining pools that the farm was connected to, in order to determine for how long it was active and how much cryptocurrency it mined. Illegal mining still a headache for Russian authorities Mining has been a legal business in Russia since the government in Moscow recognized it as an industrial activity and regulated it in 2024. To mine perfectly legally, however, companies and individual entrepreneurs are also required to register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) if they consume over 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. Their equipment must be registered as well. Places like Irkutsk have attracted a significant number of mining enterprises, with low electricity rates and a cool climate. The high concentration of miners has been blamed for growing energy shortages and addressed with seasonal or permanent restrictions. About a dozen Russian regions, from the Siberian Far East to the Russian republics in the North Caucasus and the occupied territories of Eastern Ukraine, have so far introduced such measures. Irkutsk Oblast is one of them. Its authorities completely banned the minting of digital currencies until the spring of 2031 in the southern parts of the region, including its administrative center. Local authorities have been quite actively combating illegal mining farms such as the one discovered this week, as they are overloading the distribution network in their vicinities. They are causing frequent breakdowns and power outages in such areas, often residential. Many of them are illegally connected to the grid. Besides financial losses to electric utilities, crypto miners working outside the law have also been harming budget revenues in Russia. According to an estimate made public earlier in October, the Russian state is losing over $120 million a year due to tax evasion in the sector, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Speaking at a fintech forum this month, Deputy Minister of Finance Ivan Chebeskov highlighted that less than a third of all participants in the industry are registered. The largest illegal mining facility in recent years was dismantled in June. During a raid in the Angarsk urban district of the oblast, where mining is also prohibited, law enforcement officers found over 2,100 units of mining hardware.

Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR returns to $320 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a strongly bearish market sentiment as the asset loses over 5% of its value across the last seven days. After oscillating between the $320 and $340 level the price crashed to the $266.35 level before climbing back above the $320 level.

However, the price faced strong bearish pressure at the level causing a decline to the $265 level. With the recent recovery to $320 XMR is expected to consolidate at the level. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to consolidate at the current level as the trend corrects.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift recovery from $266 lows to the $330 price level before falling back to $320 where it trades at press time. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

In a recent GETTR post, reportedly shared via a friend, SBF claimed that his shift from center-left to centrist political views and subsequent large donations to Republican causes triggered targeted action from the Biden administration. SBF’s New Conspiracy According to him, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Chair Gary Gensler and the Justice Department moved quickly to arrest him just weeks before an important crypto bill vote and on the eve of his scheduled congressional testimony. House Republicans at the time reportedly questioned the timing and had suggested that the arrest was strategically aimed at silencing him. They also requested internal communications from Gensler that allegedly “conveniently” went missing. The SEC’s Office of Inspector General later explained that a poorly understood automated IT policy had wiped Gensler’s government-issued device, which ended up erasing text messages between October 2022 and September 2023. Despite his conviction on multiple fraud and conspiracy counts in November 2023, SBF and his family maintain that he was wrongly prosecuted. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, were reported to be exploring avenues for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, who had previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road. In interviews following his sentencing, SBF has consistently distanced himself from left-leaning politics while expressing support for Trump, even granting a prison interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, which prompted his crisis manager to resign. He has openly rejected the notion of guilt for himself and co-defendants, and described the convictions as unfair and politically influenced. Overfunded Lobby Effort Behind the Spin Observers and critics, however, remain highly skeptical of these claims. Many view this narrative as a well-funded lobbying effort designed to recast SBF as a victim of partisan politics rather than the architect of one of the largest financial collapses in crypto history. Far-right activist and staunch Trump supporter Laura Loomer warned that the ongoing media push will continue to paint him as unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, despite overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing.

Ethereum Foundation increases exposure to DeFi As earlier stated, the EF’s plan to expand its DeFi-focused treasury management strategy will involve the fresh deployment of 2,400 ETH and about $6 million worth of stablecoins in a yield-bearing Morpho vault. “Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles,” the foundation’s X post read , before explaining that both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under an open GPL2.0 license. The EF has been facing criticism since the beginning of this year over its routine sales of ETH to fund its operations. In response to that, the non-profit announced a plan to transfer a portion of its treasury into DeFi protocols, beginning with 50,000 ETH. Since then, millions of funds have been moved onto platforms like Compound, an OG lending protocol, and Spark, a member of the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) ecosystem. However, it has also continued to sell crypto assets for fiat on centralized exchanges to fund its blockchain research and development. Arkham Intelligence now claims the Ethereum Foundation holds over $820 million worth of crypto assets, including $735 million worth of ETH. Plans for sustainability According to a report released on its site, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) will aim to balance capital deployment for returns while supporting Ethereum’s ecosystem, with a focus on DeFi. Current targets are set at 15% of treasury for annual operating expenses and a 2.5-year operating runway, the report states. Since the EF prioritizes safety and security in its on-chain portfolio, it will favor audited and permissionless protocols. The strategy will include periodic Ether sales based on treasury asset evaluations and long-term staking and lending deployments. Also, to ensure a diversified and low-risk approach, the EF plans to allocate fiat assets into immediate liquidity for operational needs, liability-matched reserves for long-term obligations, and tokenized real-world assets. It promises transparency via structured internal reporting, while encouraging cypherpunk principles in DeFi, with a focus on security, privacy, and self-sovereignty. As it supports projects like Morpho that align with these values and improve privacy features in the DeFi landscape, the EF envisions a gradual reduction in annual operating expenses to a long-term baseline of 5%. Still, its strategy will enhance its role in staking and DeFi to ascertain financial sustainability and support for Ethereum’s infrastructure. Get seen where it counts.

Speaking on CNBC , Moglia stated, “ Five years from now, there’s not going to be a stock, there’s not going to be an option, not going to be a mutual fund, ETF, anything that’s not in effect tokenized. “ The prediction comes as real-world asset tokenization has surged past $33.91 billion, up 10.14% in 30 days, with the number of asset holders reaching 483,892, according to RWA.xyz. Source: RWA.xyz Private credit leads at $17.5 billion, followed by U.S. Treasury debt at $8.3 billion and commodities at $2.8 billion, driven by tokenized gold breaking $3 billion. Moglia now chairs FG Nexus, an Ethereum treasury company, whose journey resembles that of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s transformation from a crypto skeptic to an advocate. “That’s because he used to be a real traditional finance guy. Now he’s a DeFi guy,” Moglia said of Fink. However, Ethereum dominates with $12.1 billion in tokenized assets, a 57.55% market share. In comparison, Solana holds just $686.3 million, despite achieving a 35.34% monthly growth rate, which raises questions about the uniformity of global adoption within the next five years. Ethereum Privacy Push and Solana Revenue Leadership Drive Institutional Flows Ethereum launched its “privacy cluster” team to develop protocol-level privacy features, including private payments and zero-knowledge infrastructures. Speaking with Cryptonews, Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, stated the upgrade “ demonstrates how Ethereum seeks to continue its market leadership in both innovation and infrastructure .” Young emphasized that privacy technologies “ will play a key role in attracting traditional financial institutions seeking a blockchain that balances transparency with discretion .” Solana led all major networks in Q3 revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, told Cryptonews that Solana “ recorded over 4% gains in September as Ether fell 5% ,” driven by treasury accumulation and upcoming upgrades. Solana treasuries crossed $4 billion with $2 billion allocated in September, which is a 230% increase compared to Ethereum’s 35% growth. Forward Industries and Helius drove accumulation ahead of Alpenglow and Firedancer upgrades, which launched in Q4. Youseff projected that Solana could “ soar as high as $300 by Q1 2026 ” if upgrades and ETF decisions align, though “ macro headwinds could halt momentum, causing SOL to retest the $200-$210 range. “ Tokenized Stocks Hit $677M as Gold and Tesla Drive Adoption Tokenized stocks exploded to $676.77 million, up 22.62% in 30 days, with monthly transfer volume surging 182.46% to $665.90 million. Monthly active addresses jumped 39.20% to 32,746. Tesla became the most popular tokenized stock with over $25 million held by 14,000 unique holders on Solana, according to Solana itself . . @Tesla now has 14,000 new investors, holding $25 million collectively on Solana Higher https://t.co/j22z9hy4Pb — Solana (@solana) October 15, 2025 Moglia revealed that FG Nexus is tokenizing its reinsurance company. “ We are looking at tokenizing that risk. We’re in the process of taking a look at that now, ” explaining that the firm is now moving towards institutional tokenization. Commodities led RWA growth, reaching $3.31 billion, a 31.14% monthly increase, as tokenized gold surpassed $3 billion in value. Source: RWA[dot]xyz While speaking with Cryptonews, Dustin Becker, Tech Lead at GoldDAO, explained that tokenization “ strips out all those layers of trust in third parties that could break. With tokenized gold, you can even leverage your gold in DeFi. “ According to RWA.xyz, the monthly transfer volume reached $5.08 billion, a 286.96% increase, as investors shifted from ETFs to on-chain alternatives amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Earlier this month, Stablecoins surpassed a market capitalization of $300 billion , and currently have 196.08 million holders. Moglia noted that Secretary Bessent projected a “$2 trillion market” within two years, with Ethereum capturing approximately 60% of activity. However, blockchain distribution reveals concentration risks. Ethereum hosts 435 RWA assets totaling $12.1 billion, while second-place ZKsync Era holds $2.36 billion, an 81% gap. Solana’s seventh-place ranking, despite a 60% tokenized stock market share, suggests that infrastructure fragmentation could delay universal tokenization beyond Moglia’s timeline.

This move signifies Sony’s intent to engage in various cryptocurrency-related activities, which include the issuance of US dollar-backed stablecoins, maintaining reserves, and providing custody and fiduciary management services for digital assets to select clients. Sony Seeks OCC Approval For Crypto Banking License In its national banking charter filing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Sony emphasized that its proposed activities align with those already approved for other nationally chartered banks. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Holders Left In The Dark: Monad Protocol Faces Scrutiny Over MON Airdrop Should the application be granted, Sony would join a select group of firms, including Stripe, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), Paxos, and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), all of which are also pursuing federal crypto banking licenses. Currently, Anchorage Digital Bank is the only entity to have received full approval. If Connectia Trust secures approval from the OCC, it could emerge as one of the first major tech-bank hybrids authorized to issue regulated stablecoins in the United States. Strengthening Digital Asset Presence This venture into the digital asset space is not Sony’s first.

Crypto analyst Steph, in a detailed technical analysis shared on X, noted that the latest move could be an important turning point for XRP. Although his outlook acknowledges the possibility of recovery, his deeper analysis of XRP’s chart history and key indicators paints a mixed picture of what lies ahead for the cryptocurrency. Bearish RSI Divergence Echoes 2021 Price Collapse According to Steph, XRP’s current structure on the weekly timeframe closely mirrors the 2020 to 2021 cycle that led to a 74% correction. The analyst highlighted a bearish RSI divergence where the price forms higher highs while the RSI forms lower highs, indicating that buying momentum is fading even as prices attempt to climb. Related Reading: Can XRP Replicate The BNB Price Rise To $1,300 ATH? Analyst Shows The Odds In his view, this pattern has always indicated exhaustion in bullish strength and the beginning of corrections. Steph drew comparisons to late 2024, up until July 2025, when XRP’s weekly RSI was declining despite rising prices. This setup has now triggered the most recent 65% correction that reached a bottom over the weekend. He noted that the correction, which started around July 14, has lasted more than 80 days, similar to the duration of the 2021 correction. Based on this, XRP could be nearing the end of its corrective phase before a rebound if history repeats itself. Steph acknowledged that the crypto market’s recent crash was heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors, including the US president’s announcement of a 130% tariff on Chinese imports, effective November 1. This shock, combined with leveraged positions across the market, led to the deepest liquidation wicks ever recorded for XRP. Nonetheless, the analyst believes that XRP has flushed out excessive leverage and cleared liquidity zones around $2.25, and this has set the stage for a possible rebound to higher liquidity targets and new all-time highs above $4. However, sustained bullish momentum from here depends on reclaiming other important price levels. XRP Price Levels To Watch Before Calling A Bottom Despite the bullish prediction, it is important to note that XRP is still at a technical crossroads that can either be bullish or bearish. The price has fallen below its range between $2.65 and $2.84, which had served as support for months. Therefore, reclaiming at least $2.65 on the weekly close is essential to confirm that the bottom is in and that the recovery phase has begun. Related Reading: Analyst Urges All XRP Investors To Pay Attention To This Connection No One Has Made Before In his video, crypto analyst Steph also talked about the importance of the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), which is currently around $2.45. Closing below this line has marked the start of bear markets for XRP. If we see one or two weekly closes below $2.40, then that’s a signal to exit crypto. The bullish prediction, one that could even lead XRP to new all-time highs, depends on if it manages a weekly close above $2.4, breaks above $2.65 and its 50-week SMA, and sustains buying strength. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.52, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $7.67 and an average trading price of $7.19. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $11.50 and $12.46, with an average price of $11.98. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024. What’s next for the meme token in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the SPX6900 price prediction and technical analysis.

In a recent interview clip shared by John Squire, Garlinghouse set the record straight on one of the industry’s longest-standing confusions: the difference between Ripple, XRP, and the XRP Ledger. His explanation comes as Ripple positions itself at the heart of the next evolution in banking and liquidity systems — where XRP could play a foundational role in powering real-time financial infrastructure. The Distinction: Ripple vs. XRP For years, even industry insiders have conflated Ripple with XRP. Garlinghouse addressed this directly , noting that “there is Ripple as a company, XRP is the digital asset , and there is an XRP Ledger.” He explained that Ripple is a Silicon Valley technology company founded in 2012, focused on developing payment infrastructure for financial institutions. XRP, by contrast, is an open-source digital asset that operates independently on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain network validated through consensus rather than proof of work or proof of stake. BRAD JUST SAID IT: #XRP will power the new U.S. banking system “Global liquidity is the foundation of the future of finance.” This isn’t hype — it’s execution. $XRP = the engine of real utility. #XRPArmy #Ripple pic.twitter.com/KblCPhhE0u — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 15, 2025 Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of this distinction, explaining that Ripple merely participates in the development of the XRP ecosystem but does not control it. “Ripple is an important participant in the development of the XRP ecosystem,” he said, “but obviously there are many others, as you would expect, which are part of an open-source community.” Ripple’s Broader Vision: Execution, Not Hype In his response, Garlinghouse reiterated that Ripple’s strategy has always focused on real-world utility and global liquidity — not price speculation. He highlighted that XRP’s efficiency in speed, scalability, and cost makes it particularly suitable for cross-border payments, an area where legacy banking systems continue to struggle. “We feel it works well for cross-border payments,” Garlinghouse stated, underlining Ripple’s mission to modernize the infrastructure that underpins the movement of value. The CEO’s remarks align with Ripple’s recent developments, including its U.S. national bank charter application, expansion of liquidity hubs, and the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin in late 2024 — all key moves in integrating blockchain-based liquidity with traditional finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity and Future Prospects The clarification also comes after Ripple successfully navigated years of legal uncertainty. With its long-running SEC case fully resolved , Ripple now operates on more solid regulatory ground, allowing banks and institutional players to explore XRP’s role in global liquidity management. This new phase signals a potential shift toward a regulated crypto-finance hybrid system, where Ripple’s technology and XRP serve as connective tissue between traditional banking and blockchain settlement rails. A Chance to Educate, Not Just Debate When asked whether the ongoing confusion between Ripple and XRP frustrates him, Garlinghouse admitted it does — sometimes. “It annoys me when there’s someone I feel should know the differences,” he said, adding that it can also serve as “a chance to educate.” His tone reflected a mix of frustration and optimism, underscoring his commitment to transparency and understanding. The interview shared by John Squire offers one of Garlinghouse’s clearest articulations yet of Ripple’s structure, purpose, and long-term vision. His message was unmistakable: XRP is the engine of utility, not just a speculative asset — and Ripple is executing a plan to make it the foundation of the new global liquidity system.

On-chain data reveals both large transfers from long-dormant wallets and large transactions between exchanges. A newly created wallet withdrew 10,009 ETH (approximately $41 million) from Binance. Similarly, another new wallet moved 5.01 million ASTER tokens ($7.65 million) from Binance to its cold storage. Meanwhile, it was discovered that 11,885 BTC (approximately $1.34 billion) worth of assets belonging to the LuBianCom mining company, which had been dormant for three years, were moved to new wallets. Following this development, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) reportedly continues to track the 127,271 BTC linked to the LuBian hack through a network known as the Prince Group, which is associated with cybercrime and forced labor operations.

Today, the same address deposited $10 million in USDC, increasing its position to $140 million. Additionally, another newly created wallet withdrew $10 million in USDC from Coinbase, deposited $9 million of it into HyperLiquid, opened a 3x leveraged ETH long position, and purchased XPL with a $3 million TWAP order.
