Wedson, who has maintained a bearish stance for the past three months, now points to a lesser-known metric as a key indicator of Bitcoin’s strength: the Real Market Average Price. According to Wedson, this metric excludes BTC from mining activity and has historically acted as a strong support level. Wedson recalled that Bitcoin held firm at this level during the 2021 China Ban-induced market crash and reached an all-time high months later. “The market is complex and unforgiving,” Wedson said, noting that most investors are often too late to make the right trading decisions. Wedson, who is the CEO of cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal, warned that Bitcoin has entered what he calls a “Chained Bear Market,” a phase dominated by bearish signals. However, he believes that the real euphoria in this cycle is yet to emerge and suggests that there could still be significant upward movement. “When that happens, don’t hesitate to take profits, buy the green,” he told traders. Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)? What Price Level Needs to be Breached for a Big Rally to Come? The analyst acknowledged that Bitcoin’s price could fall below $70,000 and potentially reach its Real Market Average Price of around $64,000. Despite this, he remains confident that the bull market is intact and that BTC’s dominance could pave the way for an altcoin rally soon. With stablecoins gaining traction, he predicts a major Altcoin Season in the next few months. Wedson argued that, contrary to popular belief, macroeconomic trends currently have a weak correlation with Bitcoin’s price action. Even as traditional markets face turmoil, crypto markets will likely follow their own path. He also noted that the crypto space is extremely volatile, with corrections of 20%, 30%, and even 50% common in bullish cycles. *This is not investment advice.

Just as robust frameworks are crucial for the crypto space, ensuring the safe and ethical development of AI is becoming paramount. A recent report co-led by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li emphasizes this urgency, advocating for proactive AI safety laws to address not just current, but also potential future risks associated with advanced AI systems. Why Proactive AI Regulation is Essential Now? The report, from the Joint California Policy Working Group on Frontier AI Models, emerges from Governor Newsom’s initiative to thoroughly assess AI risks following his veto of SB 1047. This group, comprised of leading figures like Fei-Fei Li, Jennifer Chayes, and Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, argues for a shift in perspective. Instead of solely reacting to present dangers, policymakers must anticipate and legislate for future AI risks that are not yet fully understood or manifested. Think of it like this: Current Risks are Real, But Limited Scope: Existing AI regulations often focus on issues we already see, like bias in algorithms or data privacy concerns. Future Risks are Exponential and Unknown: As AI evolves, especially frontier AI models , the potential for unforeseen and far-reaching consequences increases dramatically. Proactive Laws are Preventative Measures: Just as we don’t wait for a nuclear disaster to understand its devastation, we shouldn’t wait for extreme AI-related incidents to realize the need for strong safeguards. The report highlights that while concrete evidence for extreme AI threats like AI-driven cyberattacks or bioweapons is still “inconclusive,” the potential stakes are too high to ignore. This is where the concept of “trust but verify” comes into play. Demanding AI Transparency : The ‘Trust But Verify’ Approach A core recommendation of the report is to boost AI transparency . This isn’t about stifling innovation but fostering responsible development. The report suggests a two-pronged strategy: Empowering Internal Reporting: Create safe channels for AI developers and employees to report concerns about safety testing, data practices, and security measures within their organizations. Mandatory Third-Party Verification: Require AI companies to submit their safety claims and testing results for independent evaluation by external experts. This approach aims to create a system of checks and balances, ensuring that claims about AI safety are not just taken at face value. It’s about building trust through verifiable evidence and accountability. Key Recommendations at a Glance To summarize, the report advocates for several crucial policy changes: Recommendation Benefit Why it Matters Mandatory Public Reporting of Safety Tests Increased accountability and public scrutiny Ensures AI developers are prioritizing safety Transparency in Data Acquisition Practices Identifies potential biases and ethical concerns Promotes fairness and responsible data handling Enhanced Security Measures Disclosure Reduces vulnerabilities to misuse and attacks Protects against malicious applications of AI Third-Party Evaluations of Safety Metrics Provides objective validation of safety claims Builds trust in AI safety protocols Expanded Whistleblower Protections Encourages internal reporting of safety violations Creates a culture of safety within AI companies Industry Reaction and the Path Forward Interestingly, the report has garnered positive responses from across the AI policy spectrum. From staunch AI safety advocates like Yoshua Bengio to those who opposed stricter regulations like SB 1047, there seems to be a consensus on the need for a more transparent and proactive approach. Even critics of SB 1047, like Dean Ball, see this report as a “promising step” for California’s AI safety framework. Senator Scott Wiener, who championed SB 1047, also views the report as a positive development, aligning with the ongoing legislative conversations around AI governance. The report’s recommendations echo elements of both SB 1047 and its successor, SB 53, particularly the requirement for developers to report safety test results. This report could be a significant win for the AI safety movement, which has faced headwinds recently. By emphasizing proactive measures and broad industry consensus, it provides a strong foundation for shaping future AI regulation and ensuring the responsible evolution of this transformative technology.

While many altcoins make bold claims, few truly reshape industries like Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X. Tron is expanding its cross-chain capabilities by integrating a wrapped version of TRX on Solana. Meanwhile, Immutable X continues its dominance in Web3 gaming, drawing major partnerships and unveiling new gaming innovations at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025. Amid these advancements, Qubetics ($TICS) is capturing attention for addressing the gaps in real-world asset tokenization. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that struggle with fragmented ecosystems, Qubetics seamlessly integrates multiple blockchains, making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize and trade real-world assets efficiently one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain network designed to bring real-world asset tokenization to the forefront of the digital economy. By offering an aggregated blockchain infrastructure, it allows seamless transactions between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other leading networks. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine being able to fractionalize ownership of high-value assets like real estate, luxury goods, or rare collectibles—all secured on the blockchain. Instead of requiring massive capital to purchase an entire commercial property, businesses and individuals can own portions of tokenized assets, creating a more liquid and accessible global market. Beyond accessibility, Qubetics enhances security and transparency. Smart contracts govern all transactions, eliminating fraud and manual paperwork. The blockchain ledger ensures immutable proof of ownership, making disputes nearly impossible positioning itself as the best altcoins to invest in now. The numbers speak for themselves, highlighting the remarkable momentum of $TICS. Currently in its 26th crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.1181, with over $15.2 million already raised. With more than 23,400 token holders and over 501 million $TICS sold, the rapid demand underscores strong investor confidence. Early adopters have already seen significant gains, and with projections indicating a strong upward trajectory, the potential ROI for new investors remains highly attractive. As the platform continues to gain traction across global industries, those securing tokens now may be well-positioned for substantial returns in the future. Tron: Expanding Cross-Chain Capabilities Tron (TRX) has long been a powerhouse in decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital content distribution. Built for speed, scalability, and low transaction fees, Tron has consistently been a preferred network for developers and crypto enthusiasts alike. As of now, TRX is holding above $0.20 but facing resistance at $0.23 and $0.24. While price action is always volatile, its latest cross-chain initiative positions Tron for long-term expansion. Recently, Tron announced the integration of a wrapped version of TRX on Solana, marking a significant milestone in its cross-chain interoperability strategy. This move isn’t just about connecting two blockchains—it’s about unlocking greater liquidity and making TRX more usable across multiple ecosystems. For developers, it means seamless transactions between Solana and Tron, enabling more efficient DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and payment solutions. For TRX holders, it expands the token’s utility and reach, potentially boosting demand as new use cases emerge one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Immutable X: Powering the Next Era of Web3 Gaming Immutable X (IMX) is one of the most influential names in blockchain gaming. By providing gas-free transactions and high-speed scalability, it eliminates the biggest hurdles preventing mainstream gamers from embracing blockchain technology. At GDC 2025, Immutable X took center stage, showcasing how it is revolutionizing the gaming industry through strategic partnerships and cutting-edge innovations.

Well, you might be onto something! The latest buzz from the financial world is hinting at a potentially brighter future for the crypto market, all thanks to the Federal Reserve’s recent projections. Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader digital asset space. Decoding the Fed’s Dot Plot and 2025 Interest Rate Cuts The Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States, recently released its updated “dot plot.” Think of the dot plot as the Fed’s interest rate forecast – each dot represents an individual member’s expectation for future interest rates. According to the latest data, as reported by Odaily News, the Fed is still projecting two interest rate cuts in 2025. This projection remains consistent with their outlook from December 2024, suggesting a steady hand and a continued expectation of easing monetary policy down the line. But what exactly does this mean? In simple terms, interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can slow down economic activity. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, potentially stimulating economic growth. For the crypto market, which often reacts to broader economic signals, this is significant. Here’s a quick breakdown of what we know: Consistent Projections: The Fed’s projection of two rate cuts in 2025 remains unchanged from December 2024. This consistency provides a degree of certainty and predictability for markets. Dot Plot Indicator: The dot plot is a key tool for understanding the Fed’s forward guidance on monetary policy. It’s closely watched by investors and analysts alike. Odaily News Report: The news is sourced from Odaily News, a reputable source in the crypto and financial news space, adding credibility to the report. Why Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 Could be a Game Changer for the Crypto Market So, why should crypto enthusiasts get excited about potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 ? Here are a few key reasons: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates typically lead to increased liquidity in the market. With cheaper borrowing costs, investors and institutions may have more capital to allocate to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Risk-On Sentiment: When interest rates are high, investors often prefer safer, fixed-income investments. Rate cuts can shift sentiment towards “risk-on” assets, making crypto more attractive compared to traditional investments offering lower returns in a low-rate environment. Weakening Dollar: Historically, lower interest rates can sometimes lead to a weaker US dollar. A weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. Boost to Innovation and Growth: Lower borrowing costs can spur innovation and growth in the tech and crypto sectors. Startups and established crypto companies may find it easier to secure funding for development and expansion. Navigating the Path to 2025: Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of Fed rate cuts is undoubtedly positive for the crypto market , it’s crucial to keep a balanced perspective. The journey to 2025 and beyond isn’t without its potential bumps. Here are some challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Inflationary Pressures: The Fed’s primary mandate is to control inflation. If inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed might be hesitant to cut rates as aggressively as anticipated, or even delay the cuts altogether. Economic Uncertainty: The global economic landscape is constantly evolving. Unexpected economic slowdowns or geopolitical events could influence the Fed’s decisions and alter the trajectory of interest rates. Dot Plot is Not a Promise: It’s important to remember that the dot plot represents projections, not guarantees. Economic conditions can change, and the Fed’s actual policy decisions may deviate from these projections. Crypto Market Volatility: Even with favorable macroeconomic conditions, the crypto market is inherently volatile. External factors, regulatory changes, and market sentiment can all significantly impact prices, regardless of interest rate policies. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for Potential Rate Cuts So, what can crypto investors and enthusiasts do to prepare for the potential interest rate cuts in 2025 ? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic data, Fed announcements, and expert analysis. Understanding the macroeconomic environment is crucial for making informed crypto investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in any investment strategy, especially in the volatile crypto market. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: While rate cuts can provide a short-term boost, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. Look for projects with strong use cases, solid teams, and growing adoption. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The crypto market can be highly rewarding but also carries significant risks. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility and potentially improve your average entry price over time. The Optimistic Outlook for Crypto in 2025 and Beyond The Federal Reserve’s continued projection of two rate cuts in 2025 offers a beacon of hopeful news for the crypto market . While challenges and uncertainties remain, the potential for increased liquidity, improved risk sentiment, and a weaker dollar paints an optimistic picture for digital assets. By staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, crypto investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this evolving macroeconomic landscape. The year 2025 could indeed be a significant year for the crypto space, marking a new chapter of growth and innovation, fueled in part by these anticipated monetary policy shifts.

42012939,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=696401,1742426443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42012939.jpeg,Bitnomial ends SEC lawsuit and launches first CFTC-regulated XRP futures,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitnomial-ends-sec-lawsuit-cftc-xrp-futures/,"Crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial has launched Ripple XRP futures regulated by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Chicago-based firm announced the launch today, noting that its clients can have access to the product by March 20. According to Bitnomial ‘s announcement on X, prospective clients would have to be onboarded through any of its Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) partners, including RJ O’Brien, Marex Global, or Bitnomial Clearing, to access the product. XRP futures contracts allow traders to bet on the asset’s future price movements and hedge against its future performance. While several offshore exchanges already offer derivatives products for XRP, this is the first time a CFTC-regulated exchange will also list contracts for the token. The announcement coincides with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropping the long-running lawsuit against Ripple over the status of XRP. While there have been weeks of speculation about when the SEC filed the lawsuit, the settlement has finally kicked off an avalanche of new developments around the token. Bitnomial initially tried to launch its XRP futures in 2024 but faced opposition from the SEC then, with the regulator claiming that it would amount to security. With the SEC’s position changed, the exchange also dropped the lawsuit against the SEC. Over the past few weeks, the exchange has been busy with new products, listing derivatives contracts for cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Litecoin, HBAR, Polkadot, Solana, etc. One key feature of Bitnomial’s futures contract is physical settlement, which its CEO, Luke Hoersten , said ensures that the product interacts directly with underlying assets. Hoersten said: “Physically settled futures ensure contracts are delivered in actual crypto upon settlement, distinguishing them from cash settled alternatives that do not directly interact with the underlying asset.” Meanwhile, the firm added that the XRP contracts would be available on another CFTC-regulated exchange, Botanical, when they launch. XRP is up 12% as expectations of ETF approval rises With the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, XRP saw a massive jump in price today, rising more than 12% to reach $2.57. Although it has now dropped to $2.50, expectations about what is next for XRP have increased significantly. Many believe XRP’s chances of getting a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) are almost certain now that the SEC has a case against it. Ripple CEO Brad Garlignhouse admitted this, noting that there are about 11 filings for XRP ETFs before the SEC currently, and he expects the regulator to approve them by the second half of the year. Interestingly, the Ripple-SEC settlement does not affect Judge Torres’s ruling, which classifies the institutional sale of XRP as securities. There is no clarity on whether Ripple will drop its appeal challenging the $125 million fine. Meanwhile, the positive impact of the XRP news also moved the rest of the market, with Bitcoin gaining almost 5% to surpass $85,000 for the first time since March 9. Even ETH, which has been stuck below $2,000 for days now, finally climbed out of that rut, just as SOL and other altcoins recorded sizable gains. Solana’s positive performance is partly due to Volatility Shares’ upcoming launch of the first-ever Solana ETFs in the US on March 20. The two futures ETFs will track SOL, with one of them being 2x.

The event follows his executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning BTC as a key asset in the country’s financial framework. Donald Trump Speech at DAS and Its Context Donald Trump’s presence at the Digital Asset Summit comes amid increasing government interest in Bitcoin and digital currencies. His administration has taken steps to integrate Bitcoin into national reserves, emphasizing its role in the country’s long-term financial strategy. The U.S. president previously addressed a Bitcoin conference in Nashville during his campaign. Now, the pro-crypto President will speak at a crypto conference for the first time. Discussions at the event will focus on Bitcoin’s adoption among institutions, regulatory developments, and the future of crypto markets. Trump’s speech will touch on the next steps in his administration’s Bitcoin strategy. This development comes just a few hours after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that XRP is expected to be part of the US Digital Asset Stockpile. He cited President Trump’s previous mention of the asset on Truth Social. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Initiative Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, marking a new phase in the country’s approach to digital assets. The initiative aims to accumulate Bitcoin as a national reserve asset, drawing comparisons to traditional gold reserves. Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for the Trump administration, stated that the government’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy is budget-neutral. He emphasized that this approach ensures it does not affect other financial priorities. Hines has emphasized that Bitcoin accumulation is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the nation’s financial resilience. Lawmakers have already proposed measures to expand the reserve, with Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich suggesting a plan to acquire 1 million BTC over the next five years. The proposal is currently under review, with legislative discussions expected to continue in the coming months. More so, the Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets revealed plans for stablecoin legislation to be finalized within two months. Bo Hines expects Senator Bill Hagerty’s GENIUS Act to be enacted, with President Trump potentially signing it into law. Industry Leaders and Lawmakers at DAS The summit will feature key figures in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, in addition to Trump’s address. Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin advocate, will deliver a keynote speech and participate in a discussion with BTC historian Pete Rizzo. The event will also host Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who will moderate a panel featuring BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, Giang Bui. President Trump’s participation in the Digital Asset Summit is changing how people view digital assets.

According to an investigation by Global Ledger , a Swiss blockchain analysis company, Garantex has moved its liquidity to Grinex and has continued business as usual after its recent shutdown. Global Ledger went on to provide evidence from its investigation, showing on-chain and off-chain activities that followed patterns similar to Garantex. As of mid-March, Grinex was reported to have received over $29 million. As part of its investigation, Global Ledger discovered that the ruble-backed stablecoin, A7A5, which was previously listed only on two exchanges, Garantex and BiFinance, is now available on Grinex. Coincidentally, Garantex transferred 4.5 billion A7A5 from its blocked wallet to Grinex. The whole process that led to this transfer of funds is well documented by Global Ledger with the transactions reminiscent of the modus operandi of Garantex. In the detailed report released by Global Ledger, the user interface of both exchanges is quite similar, with very few visible differences between them. Also, a coinmarketrating review of Grinex adds credence to the claim that Garantex has rebranded and resumed operations as Grinex. The report explicitly stated that the exchange platform was created by Garantex after its platform was sanctioned internationally and subsequently blocked. Garantex has a long history of illegal dealings Garantex is a known non-regulatory compliant crypto exchange that has served as a platform for bad actors in the crypto space. The exchange was notorious for serving as a major money laundering platform and was used by ransomware groups such as Conti and Black Basta, among others. The platform also served as a fertile ground for moving DarkNet market (DNMs) proceeds linked to drug trafficking and child sex abuse materials (CSAM). It’s also reported that Garantex also served as the platform for laundering over $22 million of funds stolen from a hacked blockchain in the US. The platform has also been linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean government-backed hacking collective known for major crypto theft globally, most recently the Bybit hack. It has also been linked to some Russian cybercriminal forums and terrorist financing. In 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury, which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security, sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating the laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. However, Garantex still continued transacting illegally in the US, using various tactics to avoid detection and occasionally changing its operations using tactics such as constantly changing wallet addresses to avoid compliance requirements. Garantex also broke US federal regulations by carrying out financial operations in the US without registering with FinCEN. An international clampdown on the platform On March 7, 2025, the platform was finally brought to its knees in a joint international effort involving a collaboration between public law enforcement and private stakeholders in the blockchain space. Tether joined in blocking its operational wallets, thereby limiting its ability to move some funds. As predicted by Chainalysis , Garantex has quickly rebranded and resumed operations, moving its customers to the new platform. This isn’t the first time a platform that was shut down by regulators sprang up with a new name with the Suex and Chatex case being a perfect example. The partnership between public and private actors to curb transnational cybercrime in the crypto space is a welcome development and organizations like Global Ledger are ensuring that there’s adequate awareness about the operations of bad actors like Garantex. While Global Ledger’s investigation conclusively showed that Garantex now has a successor in Grinex, it did not answer the question on many of our minds — how soon will the hammer of the regulator and international law enforcement bodies come down on this new exchange?

42012891,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141654,1742427009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient DeFi Lending Protocols: Maintaining Steady 15-20% TVL Share Amidst Crypto Volatility,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-lending-protocols-tvl-share/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, where volatility is often the only constant, certain sectors demonstrate remarkable resilience. One such sector is decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a compelling insight: DeFi lending protocols are steadfastly holding a significant 15-20% share of the total value locked (TVL) within the entire DeFi ecosystem. This revelation sparks a crucial question: What does this steady performance signify, especially when the broader crypto market navigates bear markets and unpredictable price swings? Let’s delve into the fascinating world of DeFi lending and understand why it’s proving to be a cornerstone of the decentralized finance landscape. Decoding DeFi Lending Protocols and Their Significance Before we dive deeper, let’s clarify what DeFi lending protocols are and why they matter. Imagine traditional lending, but without banks or intermediaries. That’s essentially DeFi lending. These protocols utilize smart contracts on blockchains to enable users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. Users can earn interest by lending out their crypto assets, while borrowers can access crypto loans without going through traditional financial institutions. This peer-to-peer system offers greater accessibility, transparency, and often, more competitive interest rates compared to traditional finance. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of DeFi lending protocols: Decentralization: Operates without central authorities, fostering trust and reducing single points of failure. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering unparalleled visibility. Accessibility: Open to anyone with a crypto wallet, breaking down geographical and bureaucratic barriers. Efficiency: Smart contracts automate processes, leading to faster transactions and potentially lower fees. Yield Generation: Lenders can earn passive income through interest on their deposited assets. The Power of DeFi Ecosystem TVL and Lending’s Consistent Share Total Value Locked (TVL) is a crucial metric in DeFi, representing the total value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols. It’s essentially the lifeblood of the DeFi ecosystem, indicating the overall health and investor confidence. The fact that DeFi ecosystem TVL consistently allocates 15-20% to lending protocols is a powerful statement. It underscores the fundamental and continuous demand for lending and borrowing within the crypto space, regardless of market conditions. Why is this 15-20% share so noteworthy? Steady Demand: It indicates that lending isn’t just a fleeting trend but a core utility within DeFi. People consistently need to borrow and lend crypto assets. Bear Market Resilience: Even when the crypto market is down, the demand for lending persists. This suggests that DeFi lending serves real-world needs beyond speculative trading. Volatility Buffer: High volatility in crypto markets doesn’t deter users from engaging in lending, highlighting the inherent value proposition of these protocols. Foundation of DeFi: Lending protocols are a foundational pillar of a mature DeFi ecosystem, enabling other DeFi applications and strategies to flourish. Why is Crypto Lending Demand So Robust? The persistent demand for crypto lending , even amidst market turbulence, can be attributed to several factors. Let’s explore the driving forces behind this robust demand: Leverage for Trading: Traders often borrow crypto to amplify their trading positions. Even in bear markets, opportunities for shorting or strategic accumulation exist, fueling borrowing demand. Yield Farming Strategies: DeFi lending is integral to many yield farming strategies. Users borrow assets to participate in various yield-generating activities across different DeFi platforms. Liquidity Needs: Individuals and institutions may need to borrow crypto for various liquidity purposes, such as covering short-term expenses or funding operational needs without selling their crypto holdings. Hedging Risk: Borrowing can be used as a hedging strategy to mitigate risk in volatile markets. For instance, borrowing stablecoins against volatile assets can provide a degree of stability. Access to Capital: DeFi lending offers a faster and often less cumbersome way to access capital compared to traditional loans, particularly for those in regions with limited access to traditional banking. Benefits of Decentralized Finance Lending: Beyond the Numbers The steady TVL share is just one piece of the puzzle. The true strength of decentralized finance lending lies in its inherent benefits, which are attracting users and driving adoption: Benefit Description Financial Inclusion DeFi lending opens up financial services to a global audience, including the unbanked and underbanked populations. Higher Yields for Lenders Lenders can potentially earn significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. Faster Loan Processing Automated processes through smart contracts result in quicker loan approvals and disbursals. Collateralized Loans Loans are typically collateralized, reducing risk for lenders and making the system more secure. Transparency and Auditability All transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, enhancing transparency and auditability. Navigating the Challenges in DeFi Lending While DeFi lending presents a compelling alternative to traditional finance, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks involved. Understanding these hurdles is essential for both users and the continued growth of the sector. Smart Contract Risks: Smart contracts are code, and code can have vulnerabilities. Exploits and bugs in smart contracts can lead to loss of funds. Volatility Risk: The value of crypto assets used as collateral can fluctuate significantly, potentially leading to liquidation of collateral if prices drop sharply. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving, and potential regulatory changes could impact DeFi lending protocols. Complexity for New Users: Navigating DeFi can be complex for newcomers. Understanding concepts like impermanent loss, liquidation ratios, and gas fees requires a learning curve. Scalability Issues: Some blockchains face scalability challenges, which can lead to network congestion and higher transaction fees, impacting the efficiency of DeFi lending. Examples of Leading DeFi Lending Protocols The DeFi lending space is populated by a variety of innovative protocols, each with its unique features and offerings. Here are a few prominent examples: Aave: A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with a wide range of supported assets and innovative features like flash loans. Compound: Another major player, known for its algorithmic interest rate model and integration with various DeFi platforms. MakerDAO: The protocol behind DAI, a decentralized stablecoin, allowing users to generate DAI by locking up collateral like ETH. Venus: A decentralized money market on Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), offering fast and low-cost lending and borrowing. Cream Finance: A protocol focused on long-tail assets, providing lending and borrowing opportunities for a broader range of cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Participating in DeFi Lending Wisely Interested in exploring DeFi lending? Here are some actionable insights to guide your journey: Do Your Research: Thoroughly research different lending protocols, understand their mechanisms, and assess their security measures. Start Small: Begin with small amounts to get comfortable with the process and understand the risks involved before committing larger sums. Understand Smart Contract Audits: Look for protocols that have undergone reputable smart contract audits to minimize smart contract risks. Monitor Collateralization Ratios: If borrowing, closely monitor your collateralization ratio to avoid liquidation. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the DeFi space and be aware of potential regulatory changes. Conclusion: The Enduring Strength of DeFi Lending The data is clear: DeFi lending protocols are not just surviving; they are thriving as a fundamental component of the decentralized finance ecosystem. Maintaining a consistent 15-20% share of the DeFi TVL, even amidst market volatility, speaks volumes about the inherent value and demand for decentralized lending and borrowing. While challenges and risks exist, the benefits of financial inclusion, higher yields, and efficient access to capital are undeniable. As the DeFi space continues to mature, lending protocols are poised to remain a cornerstone, driving innovation and expanding access to financial services for a global audience. The resilient nature of DeFi lending offers a compelling glimpse into the future of finance, where decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment take center stage.

This level often acts as a crucial support or resistance zone, dictating the next major price direction. A breakout above it could fuel a fresh bullish rally, while rejection might lead to renewed downside pressure. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, anticipation is whether buyers gather enough strength to push past this critical threshold, or will sellers step in to stall the momentum. As UNI tests this key technical level, the outcome could shape its short-term trajectory and provide insights into the broader market trend. Uniswap Current Price Action: A Closer Look Uniswap price is steadily advancing, nearing a key moving average that could determine its next major move. After experiencing fluctuations in recent sessions, UNI has found renewed bullish momentum, pushing toward this critical technical level. The price action suggests growing buyer confidence, but resistance remains a key obstacle to short-term rallies. Related Reading: Uniswap Bleeds 20%—Is This Whale Behind The Drop? Technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are flashing bullish signals, suggesting that Uniswap may be gearing up for a breakout. The MACD has crossed above the signal line and has risen above average. If this trend continues, it may confirm increasing buying pressure and set the stage for a strong breakout. Trading volume has also increased, indicating heightened interest from both bulls and bears. A decisive push above the moving average could reinforce positive sentiment toward the upside. Conversely, a rejection at this level might signal weakness, inviting renewed selling pressure and a possible retracement. Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios: What’s At Stake? As Uniswap approaches a key moving average, the battle between bulls and bears has intensified, with both sides eyeing a decisive move. The outcome of this price action hints at a short-term uptrend, making this a crucial turning point. Related Reading: Uniswap Price Surges Past $10 — Bullish Pattern Suggests Further 30% Gain If UNI manages above the 100-day SMA with strong volume, bullish momentum will be renewed. A confirmed breakout may encourage more buyers to enter the market, driving the price toward the $6.7 resistance level. A surge past this key resistance could set Uniswap on track for a sustained uptrend to the $8.7 mark. On the other hand, if UNI fails to hold above the 100-day moving average and faces rejection, bearish pressure could increase. Profit-taking and renewed selling are likely to push prices lower to $5.5 with a failed breakout attempt. Should this key support level fail to hold, a deeper retracement would come into play, leading to a loss of momentum.

The firm’s executive maintained that the Ledger team was knowledgeable about and concerned about security in the aftermath of Bybit. He argued that security was not static but constantly evolving. Gauthier cautions about security vulnerabilities in crypto companies Security isn’t an option. It’s a necessity. — Ledger (@Ledger) March 18, 2025 Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier revealed that companies reached out to him after the Bybit hack last month, looking to solve “security vulnerabilities.” Gauthier explained that the institutions also reached out while looking to de-risk since Ledger can offer them that. Gauthier noted that security vulnerabilities were emerging at an alarming rate, and attackers were exploiting them rapidly. He also highlighted his displeasure with how organizations typically took months to implement fixes. The Chairman of Ledger argued that any trusted partner in the crypto space will continuously look for any vulnerabilities in their products to give customers peace of mind. He said the crypto industry as a whole needed to raise its security standards. Gauthier also warned institutional investors against using retail-grade products. He urged them to start the right way with “true enterprise-grade self-custody that has a governance layer.” “Likewise, financial institutions must make tamper-resistant hardware, like Secure Element chips or enterprise-grade systems, the foundations of any security strategy, while implementing comprehensive encryption and clear transaction signing protocols to prevent sophisticated attacks.” -Pascal Gauthier, Ledger Chairman and CEO He maintained that protecting investors should be the highest priority in the crypto industry moving forward. Gauthier believes that the crypto community must be patient to see whether the industry can adapt to new security needs. The company’s executive argued that security wasn’t the best conversation, but it showed a level of maturity in the industry that wasn’t even present at DAS London last year. He believes that the industry had left the more hypothetical stage and entered the planning stage since conversations were evolving to the point of discussing what was actually viable. Guillemet calls for security advancements in the crypto space Crypto industry expert ZachXBT highlighted in a Telegram message yesterday that the time spent freezing funds after the Bybit hack had been “eye-opening.” He also said that the industry was “unbelievably cooked when it comes to exploits/hacks.” ZackXBT argued that he was unsure if the industry would fix itself unless the government forcibly passed regulations that might hurt the entire industry. Ledger’s chief technology officer, Charles Guillemet, mentioned in February after the Bybit hack that 2025 was “the worst year for cybercrime in history.” Guillemet argued that the incident highlighted the need for the industry to move beyond trust-based security models as attackers become more sophisticated. He also acknowledged that the notable evolution was the shift toward enterprise-grade security solutions that combine Clear Signing with robust governance frameworks. Guillemet believes that attackers such as the North Korean group Lazarus linked to the Bybit attack were evolving, and the industry’s current security measures must also evolve. He urged that the crypto industry needed proactive security infrastructure that would eliminate vulnerabilities like blind signing. Ledger’s CTO also expressed concern that the Bybit hack was not the end of Lazarus’s targeting of the company. He argued that Bybit’s machines and networks were probably compromised, and the attackers were still at work attempting a lateral move to compromise other parts of the firm’s IT. Ledger was also a victim of a cyber attack in 2023 after a former employee was phished and gave attackers access to the firm’s package manager. The company said that the attackers stole roughly $600,000 from users, which was a smaller number than the $1.4 billion that Bybit suffered. The phishing scheme led to Ledger removing the blind signing ability back in June of last year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a recent interview, Garlinghouse addressed why XRP was not explicitly mentioned in a recent executive order regarding the U.S. government’s digital asset stockpile. He pointed to a post by President Trump on Truth Social that suggested creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a broader crypto stockpile encompassing other digital assets. While XRP was not mentioned by name in the executive order, Garlinghouse believes it would be part of a broader initiative. “My understanding is that there will be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto stockpile representing other cryptos. I would expect that to include XRP,” he said. Garlinghouse also noted the shift in regulatory stances under the current administration, comparing it to the Biden administration, which Ripple claims has failed to secure meetings with White House officials, noting that the current administration is more open to discussions regarding cryptocurrency regulation and industry development. Related News: JUST IN: SEC- Is Ripple Case Coming to an End! Ripple CEO Explained! XRP Price Started to Rise! In addition to the cryptocurrency stock speculation, Garlinghouse expressed strong confidence that an XRP ETF will be approved in the U.S. this year. He said the number of ETF applications pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing, including applications from major financial firms such as Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. He also noted that while some crypto ETFs have seen outflows, XRP-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) in international markets have seen increased inflows. He attributed this to the decline in negative pressure from the SEC’s legal actions against Ripple, noting that previous regulatory hurdles artificially suppressed market interest in XRP. Responding to questions about the potential inclusion of XRP in the U.S. crypto stockpile, Garlinghouse suggested that seized coins could play a role. “As I understand it, the stockpile will be represented by cryptocurrencies seized other than Bitcoin. Various law enforcement agencies have seized cryptocurrencies, including XRP, and these will go into the stockpile along with the Bitcoin strategic reserve,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The winds of economic policy are shifting, and the latest announcement from the Federal Reserve (Fed) could ripple through the crypto market. The Fed, in its recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, signaled a change in its approach to tapering its asset purchases. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader economic landscape? Let’s dive deep into the Fed’s decision and uncover the potential implications. Decoding the Fed’s Cautious Stance on Fed Tapering The Fed has decided to adjust the pace of Fed tapering starting in April. Instead of aggressively reducing its asset purchases, the central bank is opting for a more gradual approach. This decision is primarily driven by increasing economic uncertainty . But what exactly does ‘tapering’ mean, and why is the pace adjustment significant? Essentially, tapering refers to the gradual reduction of the Fed’s quantitative easing (QE) program, where it buys bonds to inject liquidity into the market and keep interest rates low. Slowing down the tapering pace indicates a more cautious approach by the Fed, signaling concerns about the economic outlook. Key Takeaways from the FOMC Announcement: Slower Tapering: The Fed will reduce the pace of asset purchase reductions starting in April. Rate Hike Support: The Fed remains committed to maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate, suggesting potential future interest rate hikes. Revised Economic Outlook: The Fed has adjusted its economic projections for 2025, indicating a more tempered outlook. Why Economic Uncertainty is Driving the Fed’s Decision The Fed explicitly cited “increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook” as the primary reason for slowing down the tapering pace. Several factors could be contributing to this uncertainty: Geopolitical Instability: Global events can create economic volatility and impact supply chains, inflation, and overall economic growth. Inflationary Pressures: While the Fed is aiming to combat inflation, aggressive tapering could potentially stifle economic growth. The current inflation outlook remains a key concern. GDP Growth Concerns: The Fed has lowered its GDP growth outlook for 2025 from 2.1% to 1.7%, indicating a less optimistic view of future economic expansion. Unemployment Rate: While still low, the Fed has slightly raised its unemployment outlook, suggesting potential concerns about labor market strength. Decoding the Revised Inflation Outlook and its Crypto Connection The Fed’s revised inflation outlook is particularly noteworthy. They have raised their PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation outlook for 2025 from 2.5% to 2.7%. While seemingly a small increase, it signals persistent inflationary pressures that the Fed is grappling with. How does this tie into the crypto market ? Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have often been viewed as a hedge against inflation. In an environment of rising inflation, investors may seek alternative assets like crypto to preserve purchasing power. Therefore, a higher inflation outlook, even if modest, could potentially bolster interest in the crypto market. Inflation Outlook – Key Changes: Metric Previous Outlook (2025) Revised Outlook (2025) GDP Growth 2.1% 1.7% Unemployment 4.3% 4.4% PCE Inflation 2.5% 2.7% Interest Rates and the Crypto Market: A Delicate Balance The Fed’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate while slowing tapering creates a complex scenario for interest rates and the crypto market. While the Fed is not aggressively raising rates immediately, the commitment to the current target range suggests future rate hikes are still on the table. Higher interest rates generally make traditional investments like bonds more attractive, potentially reducing the appeal of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the slower tapering pace could also be interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be less aggressive in raising rates than initially anticipated, which could be seen as positive for the crypto market in the medium term. Impact on Crypto Market – Potential Scenarios: Short-Term: Initial market reaction might be muted due to the cautious approach. However, any perceived dovishness could provide some short-term relief to crypto prices. Medium-Term: The interplay between inflation concerns and interest rate hikes will be crucial. If inflation persists, crypto’s appeal as an inflation hedge could strengthen. However, aggressive future rate hikes could still exert downward pressure. Long-Term: The overall economic health and the Fed’s ability to manage inflation and growth will dictate the long-term trajectory of both traditional and crypto markets. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in light of the Fed’s cautious tapering and the prevailing economic uncertainty ? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases, Fed announcements, and geopolitical developments. Understanding the evolving economic landscape is crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification across different asset classes, including crypto, can help mitigate risk in uncertain times. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your crypto portfolio accordingly. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and economic uncertainty can amplify it. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Seek Expert Advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands both traditional and crypto markets to create a tailored investment strategy. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Forward The Fed’s decision to adjust the pace of tapering reflects a cautious approach amidst growing economic uncertainty . The revised inflation outlook and the delicate balance between managing inflation and supporting economic growth will continue to shape the financial landscape, including the crypto market . For crypto investors, navigating this environment requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. The Fed’s actions are a crucial piece of the puzzle, but understanding the broader economic context is key to thriving in the evolving world of crypto.

This statement has sent ripples across traditional markets and, notably, the cryptocurrency sphere, leaving investors and analysts alike pondering the potential ramifications. Are we entering an era of unpredictable economic tides? Let’s delve into Powell’s comments and what they might signify for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Powell’s Uncertainty on Inflation Impact During a press conference following the latest FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell articulated the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on the inflation impact stemming from current tariff policies. His words, while measured, conveyed a clear message: the future is less certain than previously anticipated. Here’s a breakdown of Powell’s key points: Early Stages of Assessment: Powell emphasized that it is “too early to make a comment” on the definitive inflation impact of tariffs. This suggests the Fed is still in the initial phases of analyzing the economic data and gauging the long-term effects. Price Increases Observed: He acknowledged that “prices have risen to some extent,” hinting at the potential inflationary pressures already at play. However, he stopped short of directly attributing these increases solely to tariffs. No Clear Policy Signal Yet: Powell stated he doesn’t believe there’s been a definitive “policy signal related to tariffs yet.” This implies a level of ambiguity and potential future policy adjustments depending on how the situation unfolds. Temporary Inflation Tolerance: He subtly suggested that “sometimes it’s appropriate not to worry about temporary inflation,” indicating a possible tolerance for short-term price fluctuations as the economy adjusts. These points collectively paint a picture of a central bank grappling with new variables in the economic equation. The uncertainty surrounding the inflation impact of tariffs is now a significant factor influencing market sentiment. Tariffs and the Crypto Market: A Tangled Web Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts pay close attention to tariff policies and central bank statements? The answer lies in the intricate relationship between macroeconomics and the crypto market . Here’s how tariffs and inflation can indirectly and directly influence digital assets: Factor Impact on Crypto Market Inflation Historically, some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been viewed as a hedge against inflation. Rising inflation could increase demand for these assets as investors seek alternatives to fiat currencies. Economic Uncertainty Tariffs can contribute to broader economic uncertainty, leading investors to diversify into assets perceived as less correlated with traditional markets, potentially benefiting the crypto market . Dollar Strength Tariff policies and inflation expectations can influence the strength of the US dollar. A weaker dollar could make dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies more attractive to international investors. Risk Appetite Uncertainty stemming from tariff disputes can dampen overall risk appetite in financial markets. This could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market as investors adjust their portfolios. Powell’s cautious remarks regarding the inflation impact of tariffs inject an additional layer of complexity into this already intricate web. The lack of clear predictions from the Fed adds to the ambiguity, potentially leading to increased market fluctuations. Jerome Powell’s Words: A Double-Edged Sword for Crypto? Jerome Powell’s statements can be interpreted in various ways by the crypto market . On one hand, uncertainty can breed volatility, which some crypto traders thrive on. On the other hand, prolonged economic ambiguity can deter institutional investment and dampen overall market sentiment. Here are potential scenarios: Scenario 1: Inflation Surges Unpredictably: If tariffs do lead to a significant and unforeseen surge in inflation, as Powell suggests is hard to predict, we could see a flight to perceived safe-haven assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Scenario 2: Fed Reacts Aggressively: Faced with rising inflation, the Federal Reserve might adopt a more aggressive monetary policy, potentially raising interest rates more sharply than anticipated. This could negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the short term. Scenario 3: Temporary Inflation and Market Correction: If the inflation impact remains temporary, as Powell hinted might be acceptable, the market could experience a period of adjustment and correction as it recalibrates to the new economic data. Navigating these scenarios requires a nuanced understanding of both macroeconomic factors and the specific dynamics of the cryptocurrency space. Powell’s acknowledgement of the unpredictable nature of tariff-induced inflation adds a layer of complexity that investors must consider. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Crypto Investor’s Action Plan Given the uncertain inflation impact of tariffs and the resulting market ambiguity highlighted by Jerome Powell, what steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic news, especially updates on tariff policies, inflation data, and Federal Reserve statements. Reliable news sources and economic calendars are crucial tools. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Consider diversifying across different types of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets to mitigate the impact of market volatility. Risk Management Strategies: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital during periods of uncertainty. Long-Term Perspective: Maintain a long-term perspective. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and short-term fluctuations driven by macroeconomic news are part of the landscape. Focus on the long-term potential of your chosen crypto assets. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to navigate these complex economic conditions, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. By staying informed, proactive, and adopting a balanced approach, crypto investors can navigate the current economic climate effectively, even amidst the uncertainties flagged by Jerome Powell regarding tariffs and inflation impact . Conclusion: Embracing Uncertainty in the Crypto Sphere Jerome Powell’s candid acknowledgment of the difficulty in predicting the inflation impact of tariffs has injected a dose of realism into market expectations. For the cryptocurrency market, this translates to heightened uncertainty and potential volatility. However, within uncertainty lies opportunity. By understanding the potential macroeconomic forces at play, staying informed, and employing prudent risk management strategies, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for long-term success. The key takeaway is to embrace the uncertainty, adapt to the evolving economic landscape, and remain vigilant in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

According to Santiment, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is “signaling a potential turning point once crypto markets stabilize” as the number of wallets increases. “Dogecoin, like most meme coins, has been hammered during the two-month crypto-wide retrace. However, we recommend keeping an eye on the rising level of wallets holding at least one million DOGE, which has recovered during the price dump. Active addresses are also at four-month highs.” Santiment says that the number of Dogecoin wallets holding over one million DOGE has surged by over 1% since the start of February. In March, the largest memecoin by market cap has also recorded spikes in address activity, with the number rising to more than 150,000 active addresses per day severally. Source: Santiment/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.166 at time of writing, down by about 62% from the 2025 high of around $0.434. Turning to development activity among the leading crypto projects, Santiment says there has been a decline in the number of contributors over the past month. “And if we switch the perspective and zoom in to just the past one month, it’s a bit discouraging to see that every ecosystem in the top 10 has taken their foot off of the gas. Development activity events have declined across the board, with only Cosmos and Solana seeing a rise in contributors.” Source: Santiment Over the past six months, Santiment says the only ecosystem that has recorded a rise in the number of contributors is the layer-2 scaling solution Optimism ( OP ).

The Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock is set to release 92.65 million ARB tokens, sparking debates on how the added supply might affect its price. Meanwhile, Celestia (TIA) price analysis points to a potential market shift, as key support levels hold and signs of a reversal emerge. As traders monitor these developments, developers have their eyes on BlockDAG (BDAG) for a different reason. After raising $204 million in its presale, the project is set to launch a global hackathon series, drawing top developers to expand its ecosystem through new blockchain applications. As one of the top crypto coins, BlockDAG is creating opportunities for builders to shape the future of Web3. Arbitrum (ARB) Token Unlock Set for March—What It Means for Investors Arbitrum is preparing for a significant event as 92.65 million ARB tokens are set to be unlocked on March 16, 2025. This Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock, valued at approximately $30.75 million, accounts for 2.1% of the circulating supply. Token unlocks, designed to gradually release vested allocations, can introduce selling pressure, often influencing price movements. In response, Offchain Labs has announced a buyback initiative aimed at absorbing some of the newly available supply. While this effort signals confidence in the project’s long-term stability, analysts remain divided on its effectiveness in counteracting potential downward price trends tied to the Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis: Is the Correction Phase Ending? After a prolonged correction, Celestia (TIA) price analysis suggests that the asset may be forming a base near the $2.67–$3.14 demand zone. This level aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels and has historically supported price rebounds. The daily chart reflects early signs of a trend shift, with an impulsive five-wave structure forming. A breakout above $5.65 could confirm a reversal, while failure to hold the current range may lead to further downside. As market sentiment remains uncertain, Celestia (TIA) price analysis highlights critical levels traders are watching for potential bullish momentum or continued consolidation. Fierce Competition for BlockDAG Hackathon Spots as Developers Rush to Sign Up BlockDAG’s momentum is impossible to ignore. Raising over $204 million and selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, the project has already attracted a strong community of 170,000+ holders. The BDAG coin’s value has surged by 2,380%, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 since its first presale batch. Now, the focus shifts to innovation. In collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG is rolling out a global hackathon series, inviting developers to build projects that will expand its ecosystem. These events aren’t just about competition—they offer a real chance to contribute to blockchain’s next phase. But what’s in it for ethical hackers and devs? Those entering the series gain direct access to BDAG rewards, industry connections, and opportunities to integrate with the BlockDAG network. Expectations are high, with 200+ new projects expected to emerge, backed by one of the largest developer communities. The demand for fresh ideas is growing, and BlockDAG is becoming a recognised name among top crypto coins as more builders bring their concepts to life. Joining the initiative is straightforward, but the seats are limited. Registration is available on HackerEarth , where upcoming hackathons are listed. Participants can enter online or in-person events, developing blockchain solutions alongside other skilled teams. Top-performing projects secure funding, prizes, and the opportunity to scale their ideas within the expanding BlockDAG ecosystem. The Bottom Line The Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock will test the market’s ability to absorb new supply, with its long-term impact hinging on investor sentiment and Offchain Labs’ intervention. The Celestia (TIA) price analysis points to a potential turnaround, but sustained recovery depends on breaking resistance and regaining momentum. While traders await these shifts, BlockDAG is moving full steam ahead. With more than $204 million raised and its upcoming global hackathon series attracting top developers, the project is turning momentum into action. Limited spots are driving intense competition, and as developers rush to join, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just another name among top crypto coins—it’s becoming a movement.

42014211,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141665,1742428862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Dubai Real Estate: Tokenization Pilot Targets $16 Billion Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dubai-real-estate-tokenization-pilot/,"Dubai, a city synonymous with innovation and futuristic visions, is once again making headlines in the global investment landscape. This time, it’s not about towering skyscrapers or luxury resorts, but about transforming the very foundation of property ownership. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has officially launched a groundbreaking pilot project focusing on real estate tokenization . Imagine owning a fraction of a prime Dubai property with the ease of trading cryptocurrency – that’s the future Dubai is building, powered by blockchain technology. What is Real Estate Tokenization and Why Dubai? Real estate tokenization is essentially the process of converting rights to a property into digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating digital shares for real estate assets. Instead of cumbersome paperwork and lengthy processes, property ownership becomes fractionalized, easily transferable, and more accessible to a wider range of investors. Why is Dubai the perfect place for this innovation? Innovation Hub: Dubai’s commitment to embracing cutting-edge technologies is well-established. From smart city initiatives to pro-crypto regulations, Dubai is a fertile ground for blockchain advancements. Investment Magnet: Dubai’s real estate investment market is globally renowned. Tokenization can further enhance its appeal by lowering entry barriers and increasing liquidity. Government Support: The DLD, along with VARA (Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) and DFF (Dubai Future Foundation), are actively collaborating on this pilot, signaling strong governmental backing. Unlocking the Potential of Blockchain in Dubai Real Estate The core technology behind this pilot is, of course, blockchain. But how does blockchain real estate tokenization actually work and what are the game-changing benefits? How it Works: Property Valuation and Legal Framework: The process begins with a thorough valuation of the property and establishing a clear legal framework for tokenization under Dubai law. Token Creation: Digital tokens, representing fractional ownership, are created on a secure blockchain platform. Each token’s ownership and transaction history is transparently and immutably recorded. Digital Marketplace: A platform or marketplace is established where these tokenized real estate assets can be bought, sold, and traded, much like cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts automate processes like rent distribution, voting rights for fractional owners, and other governance aspects, ensuring transparency and efficiency. Key Benefits: Benefit Description Increased Accessibility Fractional ownership lowers the barrier to entry, allowing smaller investors to participate in Dubai’s lucrative property market. Enhanced Liquidity Tokenized assets are easier to trade than traditional real estate, offering quicker and more efficient buying and selling processes. Greater Transparency Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides clear records of ownership and transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust. Reduced Costs Streamlined processes and automation through smart contracts can significantly reduce transaction costs associated with traditional real estate deals. Global Investment Reach Tokenization can attract a global pool of investors, as digital tokens can be traded across borders more easily than physical properties. Dubai’s Ambitious Vision: $16 Billion Tokenized Real Estate Market The Dubai Land Department isn’t just testing the waters; they are projecting significant growth for the tokenized real estate sector. Their estimate that tokenized properties could constitute 7% of all real estate transactions by 2033, translating to a staggering $16 billion market, showcases their confidence in this innovative approach. This projection underscores Dubai’s ambition to become a global leader in digital real estate and solidify its position as a future-forward investment destination. This ambitious target is not just a pie-in-the-sky dream. Several factors support this optimistic outlook: Growing Investor Appetite: The increasing global interest in digital assets and fractional ownership models fuels the demand for tokenized real estate. Dubai’s Regulatory Environment: Dubai’s proactive and supportive regulatory framework for virtual assets, spearheaded by VARA, provides a safe and conducive environment for blockchain real estate innovation. Technological Advancements: Continued advancements in blockchain technology and the development of user-friendly platforms are making tokenization more practical and accessible. Challenges and Considerations for Real Estate Tokenization While the potential of real estate tokenization is immense, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed for successful widespread adoption: Regulatory Clarity: While Dubai is taking a proactive approach, consistent and clear regulations across different jurisdictions are crucial for global scalability. Issues like taxation, legal recognition of tokenized ownership, and investor protection need careful consideration. Security and Custody: Ensuring the security of blockchain platforms and the safe custody of digital tokens is paramount to prevent fraud and protect investors’ assets. Education and Adoption: Widespread adoption requires educating both real estate professionals and investors about the benefits and mechanics of tokenization. Overcoming skepticism and fostering trust in this new technology is essential. Valuation and Liquidity in Early Stages: Establishing robust and transparent valuation mechanisms for tokenized properties and ensuring sufficient liquidity in the initial stages of market development are crucial for investor confidence. Actionable Insights: Is Tokenized Real Estate Right for You? The Dubai real estate investment tokenization pilot presents exciting opportunities for both seasoned and new investors. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Investors: Diversification: Explore tokenized real estate as a way to diversify your investment portfolio and gain exposure to the Dubai property market with smaller capital outlays. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the platforms and projects offering tokenized real estate . Understand the legal framework, security measures, and the underlying property assets. Start Small: Begin with smaller investments to familiarize yourself with the process and assess the risks and rewards before committing larger sums. For Real Estate Professionals: Embrace Education: Educate yourself about real estate tokenization and its potential impact on the industry. Understand how it can create new business models and attract a wider client base. Explore Partnerships: Consider partnering with technology providers and platforms specializing in tokenization to explore pilot projects and stay ahead of the curve. Adapt to Change: Be prepared to adapt your business practices to incorporate digital assets and blockchain technology as tokenization gains traction. Conclusion: Dubai Leading the Charge in Digital Real Estate Revolution Dubai’s pilot project for real estate tokenization is more than just a technological experiment; it’s a bold step towards revolutionizing the future of property ownership and investment. By leveraging the power of blockchain, Dubai is poised to unlock new levels of accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in its already vibrant real estate market. The projected $16 billion market by 2033 is a testament to the transformative potential of this innovation. As Dubai continues to pioneer in this space, the world will be watching closely, learning from its journey into the exciting realm of digital real estate.

The decision to maintain the current interest rate was unanimous among Fed officials. However, a point of disagreement arose regarding the pace of balance sheet reduction. Fed member Christopher Waller opposed any slowdown in the balance sheet reduction process and wanted to continue at the current pace of reduction. Josh Jamner, senior investment analyst at Clearbridge, said the Fed’s economic forecasts point to a more challenging economic environment for 2024. “Policymakers are predicting a moderate economic slowdown with rising inflation and unemployment,” Jamner said. “However, these forecasts are consistent with recent estimates from Wall Street banks and macroeconomic research organizations. Therefore, we do not expect these revisions to have a significant impact on financial markets.” Jamner also noted that the Fed’s policies could eventually lag behind fiscal policy. Market pricing in federal funds futures suggests the next rate cut isn’t expected until July, and that outlook is unlikely to change in the near term. Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)? What Price Level Needs to be Breached for a Big Rally to Come? Whitney Watson, global co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, noted the Fed’s cautious stance, describing the latest meeting as a “wait-and-see” approach. “The revisions to the FOMC’s forecasts carry a hint of stagflation, with economic growth and inflation expectations moving in opposite directions,” Watson said. The Fed is expected to observe whether the current slowdown in economic activity turns into a more significant problem before making any policy changes. Michele Raneri, Transunio’s Vice President and Head of US Research and Consulting, said that while the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was relatively optimistic, the market is not expecting an immediate rate cut. However, upcoming labor market data could influence future decisions. “Despite the Fed’s current stance, the possibility of a rate cut later this year remains, and multiple cuts could occur in 2025,” Raneri said. “If interest rates start to fall, consumers may be more inclined to use credit products that they have avoided in recent years, such as mortgage refinancing and auto loans. A more favorable credit environment could encourage new borrowing activity and support consumer confidence.” *This is not investment advice.

The live price of UNI now stands at $7.01, with a trading volume of approximately $292 million. The price increase reflects growing optimism among investors as the long-discussed “fee switch” initiative moves closer to activation. Additionally, the open interest in UNI derivatives has seen a significant rise, marking a 17.69% increase, reaching $196.96 million. Uniswap Foundation Secures Funding for Ecosystem Growth The Uniswap community has voted in favor of two governance proposals that allocate $165.5 million in funding. This capital will help support the growth of the Uniswap ecosystem following the launch of Uniswap v4 and the Unichain Layer 2 network. Of this amount, $95.4 million will be directed towards the Uniswap Foundation’s grants budget, and $45 million will be set aside for liquidity incentives. The remaining $25.1 million will go towards operational costs for the next two years. The Uniswap Foundation is an independent non-profit organization responsible for overseeing the growth of the protocol. The decision to allocate substantial funds to ecosystem development is aimed at increasing the network’s scalability and creating new opportunities for growth. The foundation’s long-term goal is to transition Uniswap from a decentralized exchange into a platform that can also cater to developers and bring significant value to the Uniswap community. Liquidity Incentives to Support Uniswap v4 and Unichain Growth Part of the funding will be used to establish liquidity incentives for the newly launched Uniswap v4 and Unichain platforms. Gauntlet, a Web3 risk management protocol, will manage these incentives to draw in new users and maintain growth across both networks. The proposal also includes developer-focused campaigns designed to sustain ecosystem expansion and encourage further participation from the broader community. Uniswap v4, launched in mid-January 2025 , introduced the concept of “hooks” or contracts that allow developers to customize interactions within pools, swaps, and fees. The launch of Unichain, built on the Optimism tech stack, further enhances Uniswap’s scalability by providing a Layer 2 network that can support more transactions at lower fees. Fee Switch Moves Closer to Reality, Potentially Reshaping Revenue Distribution One of the most significant aspects of the governance decision is the advancement of the long-awaited “fee switch.” This would direct a portion of protocol fees, currently earned by liquidity providers, towards UNI token holders. This change has been eagerly awaited by the community, as earlier proposals to activate the fee switch were unsuccessful. The Uniswap Foundation has stated that it will now proceed with the necessary legal steps to activate this switch. Subsequently, the Uniswap fee switch would enable UNI token holders to earn protocol revenue, which has been a major topic of discussion within the community. Over $1 billion in annualized fees have been generated by the Uniswap protocol, and this shift would allow token holders to capture a portion of that revenue. The activation of the fee switch represents a significant step in Uniswap’s ongoing efforts to align the interests of its governance members with the protocol’s long-term success.

Recent statements from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have offered a potentially reassuring market outlook , directly impacting investor sentiment and, consequently, the crypto sphere. Let’s dive into Powell’s perspective on the looming specter of recession and what it could mean for your digital assets. Is a Recession Really Unlikely? Powell’s Perspective on the US Economy Following the latest FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell addressed concerns about a potential recession in the United States. While acknowledging that some experts are forecasting economic downturn, Powell presented a contrasting view, suggesting that a recession is not the most probable scenario. He emphasized the underlying strength of the US economy , pointing to key factors that support his outlook. Here’s a breakdown of Powell’s key arguments: Strong Labor Market: Powell highlighted the robust labor market as a significant buffer against recession . Unemployment rates remain low, and job creation continues, indicating a healthy economic engine. Resilient Consumer Spending: Consumer spending, a major driver of the US economy , has shown resilience despite inflation. This suggests continued economic activity and demand. Banking System Stability: Powell reassured that the U.S. banking system is sound and well-capitalized, reducing systemic risks that could trigger or exacerbate a recession . Inflation Moderation: While acknowledging that inflation is still too high, Powell indicated that there are signs of moderation, suggesting that the Fed’s monetary policy is beginning to have the desired effect. Expert Views vs. Fed’s Confidence: Decoding the Market Outlook It’s crucial to understand that Powell’s optimistic stance on the market outlook is not universally shared. Several economic experts and analysts have voiced concerns about potential recession triggers. These concerns often stem from: Aggressive Interest Rate Hikes: The Federal Reserve’s own strategy to combat inflation involves raising interest rates. While intended to cool down the economy, aggressive hikes can also stifle growth and potentially induce a recession . Global Economic Slowdown: Global economic headwinds, including geopolitical instability and slower growth in major economies, can impact the US economy and increase recession risks. Lag Effect of Monetary Policy: The full impact of interest rate hikes on the US economy can take time to materialize. Some experts believe the negative effects of past rate increases are yet to be fully felt, increasing the likelihood of a future recession . The differing opinions create uncertainty in the market outlook . Investors are left to weigh the Fed’s confidence against expert skepticism, leading to market volatility, especially in the inherently sensitive cryptocurrency market. Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve’s Stance: What Does It Mean for Crypto? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and Jerome Powell’s pronouncements have a significant ripple effect across all financial markets, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Here’s how Powell’s current stance and the broader Federal Reserve policy can influence crypto: Interest Rates and Risk Appetite: Higher interest rates, a tool of the Federal Reserve , generally reduce investors’ appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a pause or potential reversal in rate hikes, if inflation is tamed without triggering a recession , could boost crypto markets. Dollar Strength and Crypto Valuations: Federal Reserve policies impact the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, as crypto is often priced against the dollar. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While the effectiveness of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges is debated, persistent inflation, even if not leading to a full-blown recession , can strengthen the narrative for crypto as an alternative asset class. Regulatory Landscape: The overall economic climate and the Federal Reserve ‘s actions can indirectly influence the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies. Economic instability might lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, while a stable US economy could foster a more balanced regulatory environment. Navigating the Uncertain Economic Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the contrasting views on the US economy and the possibility of a recession , what should crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, and expert analyses of the market outlook . Knowledge is your best defense in volatile times. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including but not limited to crypto, can help mitigate risk. Risk Management is Key: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your crypto portfolio accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of economic uncertainty, focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Projects with strong technology, real-world use cases, and solid teams are more likely to weather economic storms. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy, especially during periods of market volatility. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations, which can smooth out your entry point and reduce the impact of short-term market swings. Conclusion: Confidence Amidst Uncertainty Jerome Powell’s assertion that a recession is unlikely provides a degree of reassurance in an otherwise uncertain economic landscape. However, the divergence of opinions among experts underscores the complexity of the current market outlook . For cryptocurrency investors, navigating this environment requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced approach to risk. While Powell’s confidence offers a positive signal, prudent investment strategies remain crucial in the dynamic world of crypto.

BTC's rise rate in the last 24 hours was recorded as 4.39%. The general financial markets also responded positively to the Fed's decision, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all gaining over 1%. Addressing inflation concerns, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that tariff-related price increases were expected to be temporary and that recession risks remained low. Despite the initial market optimism, some analysts remain cautious. Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian said Powell’s use of the term “temporary” to describe the inflationary effects was reminiscent of past policy missteps. “The word ‘temporary’ has returned to the Fed, with Chairman Powell characterizing the price effects of tariffs as a one-off,” El-Erian said. “It is too early to say with any confidence decline that the inflationary effects will be temporary.” Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)?

Coinbase International Exchange has just dropped some thrilling news that’s set to excite traders. If you’re into futures trading and have been looking for more flexibility and options, you’re in for a treat. Coinbase, a leading name in the cryptocurrency world, is now accepting Cardano’s ADA and Coinbase Wrapped ETH (cbETH) as collateral for Coinbase Futures Trading . This move is a significant leap forward, offering users enhanced opportunities to engage in perpetual futures trading with leverage. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto market. Unlocking New Potential: ADA and cbETH Join the Coinbase Futures Trading Collateral List Coinbase International Exchange made the official announcement via X, confirming that both ADA and cbETH are now live as collateral options. This expansion is available on both Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, catering to a wide range of traders from beginners to seasoned professionals. What does this mean in simple terms? If you hold ADA or cbETH, you can now use these assets to open and maintain positions in perpetual futures contracts. This opens up exciting avenues for leveraging your holdings and participating more actively in the derivatives market. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this update brings to the table: Increased Flexibility: Traders are no longer limited to traditional collateral options like USD or major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The inclusion of ADA and cbETH provides greater flexibility in managing their portfolios and accessing Coinbase Futures Trading . Leverage Opportunities: By using ADA and cbETH as collateral, users can amplify their trading positions through leverage. This means you can control larger positions with a smaller amount of your own capital, potentially magnifying both profits and losses. Expanded Asset Utility: This move increases the utility of both ADA and cbETH. Holders of these assets can now utilize them not just for spot trading or staking but also for engaging in sophisticated derivatives trading strategies on Coinbase Futures Trading platforms. Wider Market Participation: The addition of popular altcoins like ADA and cbETH as collateral could attract a broader range of traders to Coinbase’s derivatives exchange, further enhancing market liquidity and dynamism. Why is this a Big Deal for Coinbase Futures Trading and the Crypto Community? This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic move by Coinbase with several significant implications: Catering to Diverse Crypto Preferences: Coinbase is recognizing the growing diversity within the crypto market. By adding ADA and cbETH, they are acknowledging the strong communities and market capitalizations behind these assets. This inclusivity is likely to attract users who are primarily invested in these ecosystems. Enhancing Coinbase’s Derivatives Platform: In the competitive landscape of crypto exchanges, offering a wider range of collateral options is a key differentiator. This move strengthens Coinbase International Exchange’s appeal as a go-to platform for crypto derivatives trading. Driving Adoption of ADA and cbETH: Being accepted as collateral on a major exchange like Coinbase enhances the legitimacy and utility of ADA and cbETH. This could potentially drive further adoption and demand for these assets within the broader crypto ecosystem. Boosting Trading Volumes: More collateral options typically lead to increased trading activity. As users leverage their ADA and cbETH holdings for futures trading, we can anticipate a potential surge in trading volumes on Coinbase International Exchange. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Potential Challenges of ADA and cbETH Collateral Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this exciting development: Benefits: Diversification of Collateral: Traders are no longer restricted to using only Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. This diversification can be beneficial for risk management and portfolio optimization in crypto derivatives trading. Unlock Value from Altcoin Holdings: Users who hold significant amounts of ADA or cbETH can now put these assets to work in futures trading without needing to convert them to other cryptocurrencies or fiat. Potential for Higher Returns: Leveraged trading, facilitated by ADA and cbETH collateral, offers the potential for amplified returns compared to spot trading, although it also comes with increased risk. Seamless Integration within Coinbase Ecosystem: For users already familiar with the Coinbase platform, this integration provides a seamless and convenient way to access futures trading using their preferred assets. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: ADA and cbETH, like most cryptocurrencies, can be volatile. Using them as collateral means that fluctuations in their prices can impact your margin and potentially lead to liquidation if not managed carefully. Traders need to be acutely aware of market risks when engaging in leveraged trading with these assets. Complexity of Derivatives Trading: Futures trading, especially with leverage, is inherently complex and carries significant risks. New users need to educate themselves thoroughly about the mechanics of futures contracts, margin requirements, and liquidation risks before diving in. Regulatory Scrutiny: The derivatives market is often subject to regulatory scrutiny. As crypto derivatives become more mainstream, regulatory developments could impact platforms and users. It’s crucial to stay informed about the evolving regulatory landscape.

But what exactly does this mean, and why should the crypto community care? Let’s dive into this exciting development. Decoding the Nvidia Acquisition of Gretel: A Strategic Play Nvidia, the giant known for its powerful GPUs that are the backbone of both high-end gaming and complex AI computations, is making a bold move by acquiring Gretel. This San Diego-based startup isn’t your average tech company; Gretel focuses on something incredibly valuable in today’s AI landscape: synthetic data . Think of synthetic data as artificially created information that mimics real-world data. It’s used to train AI models when real data is scarce, sensitive, or biased. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Deal: Nvidia is reportedly acquiring Gretel for a nine-figure sum, exceeding Gretel’s last valuation of $320 million. Team Integration: Gretel’s team of around 80 employees will become part of Nvidia, bolstering their generative AI service offerings. Gretel’s Expertise: Founded in 2019, Gretel has developed a platform that fine-tunes AI models to generate high-quality synthetic data, addressing the growing need for AI training datasets. Why Synthetic Data is a Game Changer for AI Training The acquisition highlights the escalating importance of AI training data. As AI models become more sophisticated, they demand vast amounts of data to learn effectively. However, real-world data can be: Limited: In many niche areas, collecting enough real data is simply impossible. Expensive: Gathering and labeling real-world data can be incredibly costly and time-consuming. Privacy-Sensitive: Data often contains personal information, raising significant privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles. Biased: Real-world datasets can reflect and amplify existing societal biases, leading to skewed AI models. This is where synthetic data steps in as a powerful solution. By creating artificial datasets, Gretel’s technology can overcome these challenges, making AI training more accessible, efficient, and ethical. The Generative AI Revolution Fueled by Synthetic Data Generative AI , the technology behind groundbreaking applications like image and text generation, relies heavily on vast datasets. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft are already leveraging synthetic data to train their flagship AI models. As real-world data sources become exhausted, synthetic data is emerging as the next frontier for fueling the generative AI revolution. Consider these benefits of using synthetic data in generative AI: Benefit Description Scalability Generate virtually unlimited amounts of data on demand. Cost-Effectiveness Significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and labeling. Enhanced Privacy Synthetic data is inherently privacy-preserving as it doesn’t contain real personal information. Bias Mitigation Allows for the creation of balanced datasets, reducing bias in AI models. Nvidia and Data Privacy: A Forward-Thinking Approach For the crypto-savvy audience, data privacy is a paramount concern. Nvidia’s acquisition of Gretel signals a proactive stance on addressing privacy issues in AI development. Synthetic data offers a pathway to train powerful AI models without compromising individual privacy. This aligns with the core principles of decentralization and data control that resonate deeply within the cryptocurrency community. Imagine the implications for blockchain and decentralized AI projects: Secure AI Models: Train AI models for blockchain applications without exposing sensitive user data. Democratized AI: Enable smaller crypto projects to access high-quality training data, leveling the playing field in AI innovation. Compliance with Regulations: Navigate increasingly stringent data privacy regulations with ease. What’s Next? The Impact of the Nvidia Acquisition Nvidia integrating Gretel’s technology into its generative AI services suite could have far-reaching consequences. We can anticipate: Accelerated AI Development: Easier access to synthetic data will speed up the development and deployment of AI applications across industries. Innovation in Generative Models: Synthetic data can unlock new possibilities in generative AI, leading to more creative and versatile models. Enhanced Data Security: The focus on privacy-preserving synthetic data will drive advancements in secure AI practices. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this acquisition is a clear indicator of the growing importance of AI and the need for privacy-centric solutions. As Nvidia pushes forward with synthetic data, we can expect to see innovative applications emerge that bridge the gap between AI power and data privacy . Conclusion: A Strategic Move Towards an AI-Driven Future Nvidia’s acquisition of Gretel is more than just a business transaction; it’s a strategic investment in the future of AI. By embracing synthetic data, Nvidia is positioning itself at the forefront of a new era in AI development – one that prioritizes scalability, efficiency, and crucially, data privacy . This move has the potential to revolutionize how AI models are trained and deployed, impacting every sector from tech giants to emerging cryptocurrency projects. Keep a close watch on how this acquisition unfolds – it’s a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI and its integration with the decentralized world.

Yakovenko said he will use the learning experience to ensure Solana stays focused on open-source software development and decentralization while staying “out of cultural wars.” Source: Anatoly Yakovenko Solana hasn’t made an official comment on the matter, though its X account reshared Yakovenko’s post to its 3.3 million followers. Cointelegraph also reached out to the Solana Foundation shortly after the ad was taken down but didn’t receive a response. The two-and-a-half-minute ad for the Solana Accelerate conference showcased a man acting as America in a therapy session who said he was having thoughts “about innovation” such as crypto. The therapist responded that he should instead do “something more productive, like coming up with a new gender” and later said the man should “focus on pronouns.” The man snapped back, stating that he wanted “to invent technologies, not genders.” Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it. They rolled it back because it hurt… pic.twitter.com/kPMERDpTcn — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2025 The now-deleted ad came nine days after Solana’s X account posted: “Solana is for everyone.” Related: Solana rallies 8% as crypto markets recover — Is there room for more SOL upside? Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran pointed out that transgender people contribute to open-source software and cryptography in an “insanely disproportionate amount.” A GitHub survey from 2017 found that of the 5,500 randomly selected open-source developers, 1% were transgender, and another 1% were non-binary. Most data obtained during 2017 and 2018 suggest that transgender and non-binary people combined represented somewhere between 0.1% and 0.6% of the population.

Experts believe this is capable of thrusting up prices, with estimates pointing up to $5 target. This uptrend has escalated due to the recent ending of the Ripple vs SEC case that has had a massive impact on the XRP price. XRP Price Signals Bullish Momentum Amid Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Resolution After the news of the Ripple lawsuit conclusion, Analyst Dark Defender was quick to comment on how the Ripple token was affected. The crossing above the long-term descending trend is revealing the bulls’ forecasts. A strong green candlestick confirmed the breakout, signaling substantial buying pressure. With this movement, Fibonacci retracement levels suggest strong support for further gains. Analysts anticipate XRP price will move past $3.40 and $3.78 before reaching the $5 target. The momentum shift follows a prolonged consolidation phase, aligning with the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which has been ongoing for over five years. Source: X Market analysts have outlined an Elliott Wave structure projecting a continued XRP price increase. According to this analysis, the asset is in an impulsive wave pattern, which suggests further gains. The breakout from the trendline supports the projection of a strong bullish phase. The conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has eliminated a significant barrier that previously restrained XRP’s potential growth. Concerns Over Whale Accumulation and Leverage While the bullish outlook remains strong, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out concerns regarding the nature of the Ripple token rally. Data from Santiment suggests that large whale investors did not contribute to the price increase. The absence of substantial whale accumulation raises questions about the rally’s sustainability. Further analysis indicates that open interest in XRP futures increased by $200 million, signaling a surge driven by leverage rather than organic buying. When leverage dominates price movements, the market may experience heightened volatility, leading to potential corrections. Source: X Ripple Price Prediction The breakout above key resistance levels has sparked renewed interest in XRP price movements. Analysts remain optimistic about a potential climb toward $5, supported by technical indicators and the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. More so, a recent CoinGape report highlighted that the top altcoin might rally to $20 if the US SEC approves the pending 18 XRP ETF applications . This aligns with Amonyx’s prediction that institutional inflows from these ETFs could drive a parabolic surge in XRP’s price. At the timing of writing this report, the altcoin was trading at $2.51, reflecting a 9% increase in the past 24 hours. Additionally, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume surged by 178.83%, reaching $9.74 billion, indicating heightened market activity.

This shift in investment strategy has seen these investors reallocating funds into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. The project shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $4 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6100 investors while simultaneously raising funds. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback. MUTM could hit $3 to deliver 50x returns A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6100 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $3 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. A major Cardano (ADA) whale is offloading ADA, priced at $0.71, and shifting funds into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi project. Currently in Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02, MUTM has raised $4 million from 6100+ investors. The next phase will push the price to $0.025, with early buyers set for a 200% ROI at launch ($0.06). Analysts predict a surge past $3. Mutuum Finance is attracting smart money, with its dual-lending model, secure USD-backed stablecoin and staking rewards.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be dominant forces, newer altcoins are gaining attention for their advancements in blockchain efficiency, decentralized finance, and AI-powered applications. BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out among them, having raised over $203.9 million in its presale, with 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold at $0.0248. The upcoming listings on 10 major exchanges make it one of the most awaited launches of 2025. Other notable projects gaining traction include Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), and Filecoin (FIL). Below is an in-depth look at why these are among the best long-term cryptos to buy now. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem Raised over $203.9M BlockDAG (BDAG) brings an advanced Layer-1 solution that removes the inefficiencies of older networks by processing multiple transactions at the same time. Unlike other blockchains that handle one transaction per block, BlockDAG executes many at once, boosting both speed and scalability. With its presale exceeding $203.9 million, this project is attracting considerable attention ahead of its exchange launch. Plans are in place for listings on 10 major CEX platforms, ensuring high liquidity and price discovery after release. Key Reason Why BlockDAG is a Top Pick: Over $203.9M raised – A strong sign of demand and confidence. 10 confirmed exchange listings – Will boost liquidity and access. Testnet launch in March 2025 – Demonstrates real-world application. $30M in grants for developers – Encourages dApp growth and Web3 adoption. X1 Miner App’s success – Over 500,000 downloads indicate strong ecosystem engagement. BlockDAG’s ability to process transactions in parallel gives it a major advantage over traditional Layer-1s like Ethereum and Solana, which still face congestion issues. Many are comparing BDAG’s early-stage potential to Solana’s early days, with predictions of significant price increases upon launch. Avalanche (AVAX): Scalable Network for DeFi and Enterprises Avalanche provides a high-performance Layer-1 platform designed to handle congestion issues faced by Ethereum. It achieves this through subnets—custom blockchains that allow decentralized applications to run independently while benefiting from Avalanche’s security. This structure has made Avalanche a preferred choice for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise adoption. The network continues to attract major projects and companies, strengthening AVAX’s utility and long-term outlook. Why Avalanche is Among the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Near-instant transaction finality – Processes transactions in under two seconds. Expanding DeFi ecosystem – Supports lending, yield farming, and NFT platforms. Enterprise interest – Companies integrating Avalanche for efficiency. 3. Arbitrum (ARB) – A Strong Layer-2 Solution for Ethereum Scaling Arbitrum is a widely used Layer-2 solution that enhances Ethereum’s efficiency by reducing gas fees and increasing transaction speed. By utilizing optimistic rollups, it processes transactions off-chain before securing them on Ethereum’s main network. This reduces costs while keeping security intact. As Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform, Arbitrum is set to benefit from the increasing need for Layer-2 scalability. The DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum is also expanding, drawing more projects to its network. Reasons Arbitrum is One of the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Lower transaction costs – Optimistic rollups reduce Ethereum’s fees. Thriving DeFi activity – Hosts numerous decentralized applications. Growing institutional and retail adoption – The Demand for efficient scaling solutions is rising. 4. Filecoin (FIL): A Decentralized Storage Leader for AI and Web3 Filecoin is transforming data storage by decentralizing the process, moving away from centralized services such as AWS and Google Cloud. It enables users to rent out unused storage space, providing a secure and cost-effective alternative for Web3 applications and AI-based projects. With the rise of AI and blockchain-driven applications, the demand for reliable decentralized storage solutions is increasing, positioning Filecoin as a major player in this space. Why Filecoin is One of the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Decentralized cloud storage – A secure alternative to centralized providers. AI and Web3 applications – More demand for censorship-resistant storage. Strategic enterprise partnerships – Large institutions adopting Filecoin’s technology. As businesses and developers prioritize secure data solutions, Filecoin’s decentralized storage model continues to gain adoption. Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! Opportunities are emerging for those looking to enter high-potential blockchain projects before they gain widespread traction. Among the best long-term cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG leads the way with its $203.9M in presale, confirmed CEX listings, and fast blockchain processing capabilities, making it an attractive early-stage opportunity. Meanwhile, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Filecoin continue to evolve, providing essential solutions for DeFi, Layer-2 scaling, and decentralized storage. Each offers strong utility and growing adoption, making them solid picks for those looking at long-term crypto options. With BlockDAG’s presale advancing toward its next phase, now may be the time to acquire BDAG coins before increasing demand pushes prices up.

42016702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=714860,1742432451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42016702.jpeg,Bitcoin Transfer Count Lowest Since 2023—Is This Bearish?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-transfer-count-lowest-2023-is-this-bearish/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin transaction count has plunged to the lowest level since October 2023. Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Transactions Have Seen A Significant Slowdown Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in a new post on X, the BTC transfer activity has dropped to relatively low levels recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Number of Transactions” from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which measures, as its name suggests, the daily number of moves that addresses across the network are making. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shark & Whale Population Rises—Price Turnaround Incoming? Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Number of Transactions has seen a large drop for Bitcoin recently, suggesting that investors are making much fewer moves on the blockchain now. Generally, a drop in network transaction activity is a sign that the traders are losing interest in the cryptocurrency. Any notable move in the price is only sustainable when a large number of investors are providing the fuel to support it, so it can be hard for BTC to mount up a rally when the Number of Transactions declines to a low level. From the chart, it’s visible that the investors were making a high number of moves in the lead-up to the Bitcoin price rally beyond $100,000. But interestingly, the indicator plunged before the price peak arrived, implying that signs of the rally not having too much time left may have already been there from an on-chain perspective. Recently, the Number of Transactions briefly saw a crash to a level that it hasn’t touched since October 2023. Back then, the low transfer count didn’t last for too long and was in fact followed up by a burst of activity that accompanied a price rally. It’s possible that something similar could happen this time as well, but one key difference between then and now is that the recent downturn in the indicator has been more prolonged. Naturally, if things are indeed going to be different this time, then a lasting lack of interest from the investors could be a bad sign for the bulls. That said, an indicator that may provide for an argument against a shift away from a bull market is the Cycle Extreme shared by Axel Adler Jr, another CryptoQuant author. “Cycle Extreme identifies the extreme points of price cycles,” explains the analyst. The indicator makes use of various popular Bitcoin on-chain indicators like the MVRV Ratio and SOPR to determine this. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks Under Parallel Channel: Analyst Predicts This Target As is apparent from the graph, the indicator has often been reliable for pointing out inflection points in Bitcoin. “At the moment, this metric does not give any clear signals,” notes Adler Jr. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $83,600, up almost 1% in the last week.

42016782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141677,1742432515,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Exchange Shift: Garantex Operators Exposed Transferring Funds to Grinex – Sanctions Workaround?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/garantex-grinex-crypto-exchange-shift/,"In a stunning turn of events in the crypto world, a new report has surfaced alleging a clandestine operation involving sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. Are we witnessing a sophisticated attempt to circumvent international regulations? Let’s dive into the details of how Garantex operators are reportedly shifting funds to a newly launched exchange, Grinex, and what this could mean for the future of crypto sanctions and compliance. This is a developing story that demands attention from anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency landscape. Garantex’s Sanction Woes and the Rise of Grinex Earlier this month, authorities took decisive action against Garantex, a Russia-based crypto exchange, due to its alleged role in facilitating illicit transactions. This move sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting the increasing scrutiny on exchanges and their compliance with global sanctions. However, the story doesn’t end there. Blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger’s recent report paints a picture of a calculated maneuver to keep the operations alive, albeit under a new guise. According to the report, Grinex, a freshly launched crypto exchange, isn’t just another newcomer on the block. It’s alleged to be a direct successor to Garantex. The Block, citing Global Ledger’s findings, reports that even as Garantex faced shutdown for enabling illicit activities, its operators were allegedly busy orchestrating a transfer of customer funds and crucial liquidity to Grinex. This alleged transfer points to a deliberate attempt to maintain operations and potentially continue facilitating transactions that might be under regulatory scrutiny. What Makes Grinex a Suspected Successor? Several key factors point towards Grinex being more than just a coincidence. Let’s break down the evidence: Shared Infrastructure: Reports indicate that Grinex is utilizing the same infrastructure that previously powered Garantex. This suggests a direct continuation of technical setup and operational frameworks. Fund Transfers: Onchain data reveals significant transaction activity on Grinex, totaling around $30 million. Notably, billions of A7A5 stablecoins have been moved from Garantex to Grinex wallets, a strong indicator of fund migration. Sanctions Workaround Marketing: Perhaps the most telling sign is the alleged marketing of Grinex as a sanctions workaround . This directly suggests an intention to provide services to users seeking to bypass international financial restrictions. The Implications of a Sanctions Workaround If these allegations are true, the implications are significant. The establishment of a sanctions workaround crypto exchange like Grinex raises serious concerns for global regulatory bodies and the broader crypto industry. Here’s why this matters: Erosion of Sanctions Effectiveness: Sanctions are a critical tool in international policy to address illicit activities and maintain global order. If entities can easily circumvent these measures through crypto exchanges, the effectiveness of sanctions regimes is undermined. Increased Illicit Activity: Exchanges operating as sanctions workaround platforms can become hubs for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. This can damage the reputation of the entire crypto space and hinder mainstream adoption. Regulatory Backlash: Such blatant attempts to bypass regulations can trigger stronger and more stringent regulatory responses from governments worldwide. This could lead to increased compliance burdens for legitimate crypto businesses and potentially stifle innovation. Reputational Damage to Crypto: Incidents like this fuel the narrative that crypto is primarily used for illicit purposes. This negative perception can discourage institutional investment and public trust in cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Sanctions The Garantex-Grinex situation highlights the ongoing challenges in regulating the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, especially concerning sanctions compliance. What are the key challenges and potential solutions? Challenge Potential Solution Decentralized Nature of Crypto Enhanced onchain analytics and cross-border regulatory collaboration Anonymity Features Balancing privacy with KYC/AML compliance, exploring privacy-preserving technologies for compliance Rapid Technological Advancements Continuous regulatory adaptation and technological solutions for monitoring and enforcement Global Reach of Crypto Exchanges International cooperation and harmonization of regulatory standards Is Grinex a Legitimate Crypto Exchange or Just a Sanctions Workaround? The core question remains: Is Grinex a legitimate new crypto exchange , or is it merely a front for Garantex to continue its operations while evading sanctions? While Grinex is operating as a crypto exchange and processing transactions, the allegations of infrastructure sharing, fund transfers, and sanctions workaround marketing paint a concerning picture. Authorities and regulatory bodies will likely be closely scrutinizing Grinex’s activities. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the true nature of Grinex and the extent of its connection to Garantex. Further investigations and onchain analysis will be essential to unravel the full story and determine the appropriate course of action. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Businesses This situation offers several key takeaways for both crypto users and businesses operating in this space: Due Diligence is Paramount: Users should exercise extreme caution when using new or lesser-known crypto exchanges , especially those with ties to sanctioned entities or regions. Thoroughly research exchanges before entrusting them with your funds. Compliance is Non-Negotiable: For crypto businesses, robust KYC/AML compliance programs are not optional but essential. Staying ahead of regulatory requirements and implementing strong compliance measures is crucial for long-term sustainability. Transparency and Scrutiny are Increasing: The crypto industry is no longer operating in the shadows. Regulatory scrutiny is intensifying, and transparency is becoming increasingly important. Embrace transparency and proactively engage with regulators to build trust and legitimacy. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about evolving sanctions regimes and regulatory changes in the crypto space. Adapt your strategies and operations to remain compliant and mitigate risks. Conclusion: The Unfolding Saga of Crypto Sanctions and Exchange Tactics The alleged shift from Garantex to Grinex is a stark reminder of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between regulators and those seeking to operate outside the bounds of established financial rules. Whether Grinex will successfully function as a sanctions workaround remains to be seen. However, this situation underscores the critical need for vigilance, robust compliance, and international cooperation to effectively regulate the crypto space and prevent its misuse for illicit purposes. The crypto world is watching closely as this story unfolds, and the repercussions could shape the future of crypto regulation and sanctions enforcement.

In the transactions flagged by Arkham, the wallet in question sent $1.87M MELANIA to a fresh wallet from its 50M MELANIA (5% o f su pply from the MELANIA team). The transaction could mean the wallet is getting ready to dump even more tokens, as Arkham notes that previous distributions from the same address were deposited to Kraken and sold via Meteora. Donald Trump won the election after campaigning as a pro-crypto president. Since then, he has launched a meme and ran an airdrop for his loyal supporters. His wife, First Lady Melania Trump also launched a meme of her own, with other political figures like Javier Milei of Argentina also linked to the $Libra token launch. Unfortunately these launches have only worked to benefit the parties behind them, leading many to tag them pump and dump schemes. MELANIA insider wallets on the move again According to a report from Arkham , Melania insider wallets have become active once more, which means something is about to happen, and a dump is never out of the question. Transaction between the Melania team wallet and a new wallet that received $1.87M MELANIA. Source: Arkham Intelligence According to Arkham’s post, the wallet in question received 50 M MELANIA, which is 5% of the supply from the MELANIA team, and has just sent $1.87 M MELANIA to a fresh wallet. This could mean they’re getting ready to dump even more tokens, as Arkham notes that previous distributions from the same address were deposited to Kraken and sold via Meteora. “The vesting schedule for MELANIA is brief, with the first unlocks occurring 30 days after launch (19/02/2025), making today currently the end of Month 2. 2.25% of MELANIA supply is linearly vested every month,” Arkham also tweeted. In the comment section, users had mixed opinions about the news, with many implying that they believe someone in Melania’s team is getting ready to dump on the meme’s holders again. There is little doubt that things are finally looking up, adoption-wise, for BTC and crypto in general. However, these series of recent high-profile rug pulls have left newer participants concerned and forced many of the more experienced investors to acce pt t he “crypto” frenzy triggered by Trump may be tarnishing the industry’s reputation as an alternative monetary system. $TRUMP, $MELANIA & $LIBRA were holes in the Solana ship The season of political figures launching memes started when the POTUS decided to create one himself. The launch triggered a frenzy on Solana as degens quickly reallocated assets into the meme. The immediate aftermath saw $TRUMP’s market cap peak at over $15 billion. However, the value crashed by 40%, erasing $7.5 billion in market cap in minutes after the first lady blindsided the market with $MELANIA’s launch. Traders sold $TRUMP to buy $MELANIA, and by late January, $TRUMP’s daily trading volume had collapsed 90% from its $36 billion peak to $3.5 billion, and its price fell to $26.80 from a high of $73.43. A similar occurrence happened with the $MELANIA token, which was launched a few days after $TRUMP, less than 12 hours before Trump’s inauguration, sparking an instant speculative fever. ARKHAM ALERT: MELANIA INSIDER WALLETS DISTRIBUTING $MELANIA A wallet that received 50M MELANIA (5% of supply) from the MELANIA Team has just sent $1.87M MELANIA to a fresh wallet. Previous distributions from this address were deposited to Kraken and sold on Meteora. pic.twitter.com/x2dwIgdcPW — Arkham (@arkham) March 19, 2025 Many had witnessed the earliest $TRUMP buyers cash out with enormous returns and thought they were getting their own chance, so they rushed to buy. Truly, hours after the release, the token’s price surged by 24,000%, peaking at about $13 and pushing the market cap to nearly $1.8 billion. Unfortunately, the gravy train quickly rolled to a stop . That same weekend, $MELANIA fell by 80% from its peak, sinking to $0.76 by mid-February ​. This triggered questions about the token distribution and intent, with analysts noting an ownershi p concentratio n​ similar to the one observed with the Trump token. Following the success of both tokens, Argentina’s President Javier Milei, a self-proclaimed libertarian and Bitcoin supporter, endorsed the $LIBRA token and promoted it on his social media accounts as a private initiative to boost Argentina’s economy. This caused $LIBRA’s price to instantly shoot up from $0 to nearly $5 apiece as Milei’s followers and retail investors bought. It turned into a national scandal overnight when the token’s price fell by over 80% within hours as insider wallets dumped over $107 million in tokens almost immediately after launch, cashing out profits while regular holders watched helplessly. The political fallout from the scandal was swift and saw the opposition launch an impeachment request against Milei, who quickly deleted his promotional post and disavowed any ties to $LIBRA, claiming, “I was not aware of the details of the project and once I found out, I decided to not continue giving it publicit y . ”​ There was also $CAR, launched by the Central African Republic’s president on February 9, and it also mirrored $TRUMP’s pump and dump. According to DEXScreener, its $800M cap lasted only minutes before falling 84% amidst scam allegations. All four events made headlines and have blurred the lines between the OG cryptos like Bitcoin (digital gold) and speculative pump-and-dump tokens. According to estimates, these tokens also extracted significant liquidity from Solana’s ecosystem. One analyst estimated that $TRUMP and $CAR, alongside $LIBRA, drained between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion from Solana’s memecoin market. According to Nansen, the $LIBRA token sucked at least $250 million from the ecosystem alone. All the while, new memes are being launched and rugged, further tarnishing Solana’s reputation. It does not take a rocket scientist to fig ure that the value that these projects extracted from the Solana ecosystem contributed to grounding it. Since they launched, active addresses and transactions have reportedly declined o n Sola na and the SOL token value has fallen by about 40% as distrust continues to spread.

Launched as a joke in December 2013, Dogecoin was hardly expected to rise to the heights it enjoys today. With a mere $0.00026 as its trading price at launch, it was considered nothing more than a meme coin. Fast forward to today, and Dogecoin boasts a market capitalization in the billions, with early believers reaping massive gains. For those who missed Dogecoin’s ICO, the Arctic Pablo Coin presale offers a new opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a cryptocurrency poised to make waves. Dogecoin’s Early Days: A Missed Opportunity? Back in 2013, when Dogecoin was first introduced, it didn’t seem like much more than a fun internet experiment. The trading price was a mere $0.00026 per coin. Many dismissed it as just another internet fad, a joke based on the viral “Doge” meme. But over the years, something unexpected happened—Dogecoin began to gain a loyal following. As the community grew and endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk further bolstered its legitimacy, Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed. Those who believed in the potential of Dogecoin during its early days, despite the skepticism, are now sitting on massive returns. The coin’s peak reached an all-time high of over $0.70, and its current price still offers significant gains from its initial days. For those who missed the ICO or were hesitant to invest, this remarkable rise in value has undoubtedly caused some regret. However, all hope is not lost. A new opportunity to seize early investment gains is here, and it’s called Arctic Pablo Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin: The New Meme Coin with Massive ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin , currently in its presale phase, is drawing attention as one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin’s strategy is unique: the presale is divided by locations, allowing investors to “travel” along with the coin as it moves through different stages.

The exchange is tying up loose ends in what could be one of the largest acquisitions by a cryptocurrency service provider. Kraken Inches Toward Mega Deal To Buy NinjaTrader According to a WallStreetJournal (WSJ) report, Kraken is in the final third of an ambitious plan to purchase NinjaTrader. According to the post , the deal is worth $1.5 billion and will see NinjaTrader become a subsidiary of the US-based cryptocurrency exchange. Barring any eventualities, insiders say Kraken will announce the completion of the deal before the end of the week. While details are sparse, the move signals Kraken’s interest in dabbling in derivatives and crypto futures. Kraken is seeking to expand its offerings but the exchange remains wary of regulatory challenges that could bedevil the plans. The US SEC just shuttered its Kraken case that sought to view the firm as a stock exchange. To sidestep the regulatory hurdles, the purchase will allow the exchange to lean on NinjaTrader’s Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) license to offer its derivatives offering. Kraken has the funds to see the deal through given impressive financial metrics for the exchange. The US-based crypto exchange racked in over $1.5 billion in revenue, doubling its profits over the last year. Both Parties Have An Eye On Expansion Apart from sidestepping potential regulatory hurdles, purchasing NinjaTrader will introduce Kraken to a new demographic. Launched in 2003, NinjaTrader has racked up over 1.8 million retail investors with the deal offering several perks for the futures trading company. The move will see Kraken support NinjaTrader’s bid to enter the UK and Australian markets. Kraken’s EMI approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) may smoothen NinjaTrader’s entry into the UK. The top crypto exchange has previously secured a MiFID license to offer crypto derivatives to EU-based traders. In line with its expansionist goals, the exchange reintroduced cryptocurrency staking service for US customers.

For Injective, the Nivara mainnet upgrade is doing exactly that. With enhanced oracle support, security improvements, and real-time transaction tracking via InjScan, Injective is strengthening its foundation for mass adoption. Meanwhile, Toncoin has surged by 20% after Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, regained his passport, fueling speculation on the project’s future direction. These are not just routine updates—these are defining moments. But what about the future of decentralized finance and online security? That’s where Qubetics comes in. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a censorship-resistant, fully decentralized network. For businesses, professionals, and individuals, this means true digital freedom—free from surveillance, geo-restrictions, and data leaks. It stands out as one of the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Secure and Decentralized Connectivity Qubetics is more than just another blockchain project—it’s a solution to one of the most pressing problems in today’s digital world: privacy. While traditional VPNs claim to offer anonymity, they are still vulnerable to government interference, centralized control, and potential data leaks. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN (dVPN) eliminates these weaknesses, providing a censorship-resistant and secure alternative powered by blockchain technology. Consider businesses that rely on encrypted communication. Traditional VPNs can be blocked or compromised, exposing sensitive data. Qubetics’ dVPN distributes data across a decentralized network, making it nearly impossible to track or censor. Freelancers, journalists, and remote workers in restrictive regions can bypass censorship without relying on centralized providers that store user logs. Streaming platforms and global gaming communities can also benefit by accessing unrestricted content without latency or regional restrictions. Key Features & Market Adoption A fully decentralized system eliminates central points of failure, significantly reducing the risk of hacking and unauthorized control. By operating without reliance on geo-restricted servers, it ensures global accessibility, allowing users to interact with the network without restrictions. Additionally, enhanced security is a core feature, leveraging blockchain’s encryption standards to provide tamper-proof protection against data manipulation and cyber threats. This combination of decentralization, unrestricted access, and robust security makes it a reliable and future-proof solution in the evolving digital landscape positioning itself as the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics is currently in its 26th crypto presale stage, having raised over $15.2 million. More than 501 million $TICS tokens have been sold at a current price of $0.1181 per token. With over 23,400 holders already onboard, the projected return on investment (ROI) is substantial. If $TICS reaches $0.25, early buyers could see a 111% ROI. A price of $1 would yield a 746% ROI, while a surge to $5 would bring a 4,130% return. At $6, the ROI would be 4,976%, climbing to 8,360% at $10 and 12,591% at $15. The presale is nearing completion, making this a critical moment for those looking to secure $TICS before its full market launch. Injective (INJ): Bridging Blockchain with Real-World Assets Injective has been relentless in pushing blockchain adoption, especially in real-world applications. The recent Nivara mainnet upgrade brings critical advancements, including improved oracle support, heightened security against risky deposits, and greater wallet protection. These upgrades make Injective an even stronger contender for institutional adoption. With the introduction of the Ambassador Program 2.0, Injective is amplifying its community-driven approach. More contributors mean a broader reach and faster user growth. Meanwhile, InjScan, the platform’s dedicated blockchain explorer, provides real-time transaction tracking, ensuring greater transparency for both developers and participants. These advancements strengthen Injective’s positioning as a top blockchain for 2025. With enhanced security, improved data reliability, and a growing user base, Injective is setting a new standard for blockchain efficiency and real-world integration one of th best cryptos to join this month. Toncoin (TON): Market Surge and Future Outlook Toncoin has seen a surge of nearly 20% after Telegram founder Pavel Durov regained his passport and left France for Dubai. This unexpected turn has fueled optimism among community members, leading to renewed speculation about TON’s future prospects making it the best cryptos to join this month. As of mid-February 2025, Toncoin traded around $3.86, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 26.26—suggesting it was in oversold territory. Now, with renewed momentum, analysts are projecting that TON could reach $15.08 to $23.06 within the year, though precise timing remains uncertain. The renewed market confidence, coupled with Telegram’s continued influence, could push TON further into the mainstream. Conclusion: Why These Cryptos Matter Now Qubetics, Injective, and Toncoin are all making headlines for the right reasons. Whether it’s Qubetics’ revolutionary approach to online privacy, Injective’s real-world blockchain adoption, or Toncoin’s renewed momentum, each of these projects presents strong potential for those looking for the best cryptos to join this month . As blockchain adoption accelerates, the opportunities for participants continue to grow. With innovation accelerating across the blockchain space, Qubetics, Injective, and Toncoin are shaping the next era of decentralized technology. Whether through enhanced privacy, seamless DeFi solutions, or mass adoption via social integration, each project offers a compelling case for long-term relevance.

Particularly, data from on-chain analytics platform Glassnode shows that the “BTC: Long-term holder net position change” metric has flipped positive for the first time this year. This suggests that long-term Bitcoin investors are capitalizing on market conditions to add significant amounts of BTC to their holdings. Long-Term Holders Add 167,000 BTC Amid March Crash Earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price plunged from above $90,000 to around $80,000 during a rapid sell-off​. This price stunned many traders and triggered a continuous wave of liquidations among short-term investors. Yet despite this steep correction, long-term holders treated the sub-$90,000 levels as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to capitulate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price? In other words, coins are moving into wallets that haven’t spent their BTC in a long time, which is a notable reversal after starting 2025 with a negative net position change. This marks the first net accumulation by these “HODLers” in 2025. Glassnode’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change metric, which had been in the red, flipped “green” as long-term investors aggressively accumulated through the downturn​. On-chain data shows that this flip to green has seen long-term holders increase their net Bitcoin holdings by more than 167,000 BTC in the past month. This notable influx is valued at nearly $14 billion. In short, the cohort of seasoned holders began scooping up cheap BTC while short-term sentiment was at its bleakest. Is A Bitcoin Price Recovery Brewing? The timing of this flip from red selloff to green accumulation among long-term holders is striking, considering what the Bitcoin price went through in the past two weeks. This data suggests that a large part of the Bitcoin crash was caused by panic-selling among short-term holders. This behavior aligns with past market cycles between August and September 2024, where long-term holders accumulated aggressively during a price dip. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Headed For $70,000 Or $300,000? What The Charts Are Saying Interestingly, Glassnode’s long-term holder metric isn’t the only one pointing to positive Bitcoin sentiment among large holders. After weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started seeing net inflows again. On March 17, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively drew in about $274.6 million, the largest single-day inflow in 28 days and a clear signal of renewed investor interest​. The very next day brought another wave of fresh capital, with roughly $209 million pouring into Bitcoin funds on March 18​. In fact, this three-day streak represents the first sustained run of positive inflows since February 18, a period during which Bitcoin funds have experienced consecutive days of outflows. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $83,500.

Just recently, Donald Trump hosted the inaugural White House Crypto Summit. While the crypto community wasn’t thrilled with the outcomes, the event delivered key updates on the US Bitcoin Reserve and shed light on the government’s current approach to crypto regulation. Could Be A Pre-recorded Message The announcement comes after Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, spoke at DAS this week, hinting at plans to stockpile Bitcoin for a new strategic reserve. “It’s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines told the crowd on Tuesday. Some reports suggest that Trump’s appearance at the event may not be live, with some sources hinting at a pre-recorded message instead. Regardless, this still marks a historic moment as the U.S. president is set to formally address a crypto conference. Key Discussions At the event, discussions will center on Bitcoin’s adoption by institutions, regulatory updates, and the future of the crypto market. Trump is expected to outline his administration’s next steps on Bitcoin. FOX business journalist Eleanor Terrett also shared that multiple sources at the DAS Conference have clarified that President Trump is planning to livestream into the event either today or tomorrow to address the audience. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1902445688245321981 Top Lawmakers To Feature The summit will bring together top lawmakers like Representatives Ro Khanna and Tom Emmer, along with industry giants like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Michael Saylor will give a keynote speech and join a discussion with BTC historian Pete Rizzo. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will moderate a panel with key players, including Robbie Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, and Giang Bui, Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products at Nasdaq. Ripple-SEC Lawsuit Ends In a remarkable update, Garlinghouse revealed today that the SEC has dropped its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, marking a major victory for Ripple and the crypto industry. The crypto market has been showing signs of recovery this week, following a period of volatility. Besides, the Federal Reserve announced today that it won’t be making any immediate rate cuts.

Akshay Naheta, the founder of stablecoin payments infrastructure firm Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), will join Bakkt CEO Andy Main in the role, the company said on March 19. Bakkt added that it will enter into an agreement with DTR to integrate its stablecoin-based payment infrastructure with Bakkt’s crypto trading and brokerage technology, subject to regulatory approval. Bakkt said the partnership would open new revenue streams in stablecoin payments and crypto trading while increasing efficiency in cross-border payments, a popular use case for crypto. Naheta founded DTR in 2022 after a nearly six-year stint in various executive roles at investment management giant SoftBank Group, which has a history of investing in crypto firms. In a separate statement reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, Bakkt said it wants “to focus resources on core crypto offerings” and was potentially looking to sell or wind down its loyalty services business, which allows its clients to offer travel and merchandise perks. Bakkt recently shared its take on stablecoins ahead of it, sharing it had partnered with DTR. Source: Bakkt Bakkt added that it was selling its crypto custody subsidiary, Bakkt Trust, to its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, for $1.5 million. It said the sale would cut operating costs by $3.8 million a year and free up around $3 million for investment into its crypto business. The firm added it would maintain custody solutions “through a robust network of reputable custody providers.” Its moves come after Bakkt disclosed on March 17 that its major clients, Bank of America and trading platform Webull, won’t be renewing contacts with the firm when they expire in April and June, respectively. Bank of America accounted for around 16% of Bakkt’s loyalty services revenue in 2023 and 2024, while Webull represented 74% of its crypto revenues over that same period. The disclosure sent its share price tumbling on March 18, which closed the trading day down over 27% to $9.33. Bakkt improves top and bottom-line earnings Bakkt reported on March 19 that its total 2024 revenues came in at $3.49 billion, up nearly 350% year-over-year, while its yearly net loss roughly halved to $103.4 million.

CEO Discusses Pending Cross Appeal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After nearly four years of intense legal battles, the long-standing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple has finally come to an end. The SEC, which initially filed the lawsuit in December 2020, claiming Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP was an unregistered security, has now dropped the appeal. Garlinghouse Reflects on the Long Fight In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said “This has been a long battle. “But now, there is a lot more certainty for Ripple, and frankly, for me personally, because the SEC had sued me.” He revealed that the SEC has officially abandoned its appeal in the case, which had been ongoing since the lawsuit was filed in December 2020. Ripple scored a key victory in the summer of 2023 when Judge Torres ruled that XRP, the cryptocurrency at the center of the case, is not a security. This ruling marked a pivotal moment in the case. The SEC’s Appeal is Dropped Despite the SEC’s withdrawal from its appeal, Garlinghouse clarified that the case is not entirely over. A cross-appeal is still pending, but the dynamics have shifted. “We go from being the defendant to the plaintiff,” he explained. “Now, we’re in the driver’s seat, deciding how we want to proceed.” Ripple’s Legal Victory and the Industry’s Future For Ripple, the outcome of this case is crucial not just for the company itself but for the broader crypto industry. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple had spent over $150 million defending the case, a legal expense not only aimed at protecting the company but also supporting the entire cryptocurrency sector. “It was important for the whole industry,” he said. Judge’s Ruling and Ripple’s Strategy Garlinghouse also commented on the broader implications of the case’s resolution, especially in terms of the legal status of XRP. “The SEC’s decision to drop its appeal is a significant moment,” he stated. “It’s clear now that the SEC likely regrets bringing the case in the first place, especially given the judge’s ruling.” However, some elements of the case are still unresolved, such as the $125 million civil penalty Ripple was ordered to pay. This fine is currently held in escrow, pending the final resolution of the case. The $125 Million Fine and What’s Next Ripple has expressed interest in potentially reclaiming the $125 million fine, given that no investors were harmed in the process. “There was no investor harm, no investors lost money,” Garlinghouse remarked, suggesting that the penalty may be reconsidered as the case nears its conclusion.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 02:46:59

Global Ledger claims the operators of the Russian exchange have shifted liquidity and customer deposits to Grinex, which they say is “Garantex’s full-fledged successor,” in a report released to X on March 19. “We can confidently state that Grinex and Garantex are directly connected both onchain and offchain.” “The movement of funds, including the systematic transfer of A7A5 liquidity, the use of one-time-use wallets, and the involvement of addresses previously associated with Garantex, provides clear onchain proof of their link,” the Global Ledger team said in the report. After completing its investigation on March 13, Global Ledger says it had found onchain data showing Garantex laundered over $60 million worth of ruble-backed stablecoins called A7A5 and sent them to addresses associated with Grinex. Global Ledger claims Garantex has moved all its funds over to a newly launched exchange and is back in business. Source: Global Ledger “In this case, the burning and subsequent minting process was used to launder funds from Garantex, allowing new coins to be minted from a system address with a clean history,” the team said. A Garantex manager also reportedly told Global Ledger that customers have been visiting the exchange office in person and moving funds from Garantex to Grinex. “Additionally, offchain indicators, such as transactional patterns, commentaries and exchange behaviors, further reinforce this connection,” it said. The report also points to a description of Grinex on the Russian crypto tracking site CoinMarketRating, claiming that the owners of Garantex created it. The reports said this shows “Grinex is not an independent entity but rather a full-fledged successor to Garantex, continuing its financial operations despite the exchange’s official shutdown.” Source: Global Ledger By March 14, the volume of incoming transactions on Grinex was nearly $30 million, according to Global Ledger. CoinMarketRating shows that the trade volume for the month is now over $68 million, with spot trading topping $2 million. The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control first hit Garantex with sanctions in April 2022 for allegedly money laundering violations. Related: US, UK, Australia sanction Zservers for hosting crypto ransomware LockBit On March 6, the US Department of Justice collaborated with authorities in Germany and Finland to freeze domains associated with Garantex, which they claim processed over $96 billion worth of criminal proceeds since launching in 2019.

Only a few days later, on March 12, officials with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Aleksej Bešciokov, who allegedly operated Garantex , on US charges that included conspiracy to commit money laundering.

The court also ordered the man to pay a 500,000 ruble (around $6,000) fine. TASS reported that a branch of the Western District Military Court heard that the man made “multiple transfers of funds” to “armed formations” in based Ukraine.

These were all intended to help conduct military operations against soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces.” The court convicted the man of “high treason” and “assisting a terrorist activity,” both “violations of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.” The FSB released scant details about the man, noting only that he was a resident of Oryol, and that he was born in 1976. However, the FSB released a video “confession” from the man, where he addressed the camera and said: “I sent cryptoassets.

The loans had little in the way of interest; however, they have conversion features that could dilute equity. On Tuesday, MSTR announced it was issuing preferred stock with high interest rates. So the ""low interest rate convertible bond"" argument for owning MSTR is weakening. In this article, I explore why MicroStrategy is too leveraged and exposed to Bitcoin to be worth buying now. Strategy or MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has taken a beating in recent days, crashing along with the cryptocurrency it holds in vast quantities: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The company has grown from its roots as a software company into a Bitcoin holding company, investing increasing sums of money into the coin at high prices. It recently bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin when BTC traded at around $104,000 , meaning the position is sitting on major losses. The background story here is that MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin is an excellent long-term store of value and is purchasing it to make his company into a Bitcoin bank . Technically, MicroStrategy’s underlying software business still exists, but it is tiny as a percentage of MSTR’s total business. The company, with $25 billion in assets (as of the most recent reports), does just $463.5 million per year in revenue. Also, the company’s Bitcoin makes up the vast majority of its assets. So, MicroStrategy is rapidly becoming a leveraged Bitcoin play. The problem is that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset which, when bought with leverage, exposes its holders to solvency risk. It's true that MSTR has low interest expenses; however, that’s largely because its debt is mostly convertible . Convertible debt usually has lower interest rates than straight debt because the conversion option is perceived as valuable and therefore can make up for a lack of interest. However, when convertible bonds are exercised, the newly issued stock reduces the ownership claim (percentage of the company owned by) previously existing stock. So, convertible debt creates dilution. Potentially, large amounts of it. Another problem is that MicroStrategy is issuing some high interest rate preferred stock. On the day this article was written, the company announced that it was selling a $500 million block of perpetual preferred stock. The stock is being priced to yield 10% and if investors pay less than par for it, the actual yield will be greater than that. A 10% yield on $500 million is $50 million, so this is a major increase in MSTR’s “interest” expenses. When I last covered MicroStrategy, I rated it a sell because it was too exposed to Bitcoin for such a highly leveraged entity. I figured that the combination of volatility and leverage was too risky. Since that article published, MicroStrategy has fallen 26% in price, underperforming the S&P 500 in the same period. That makes the call a major win for me. However, I’m actually even more bearish on MicroStrategy now than I was then. One of the reasons why I was only mildly bearish on MicroStrategy when I last wrote about it was because its interest expenses were extremely small. The company faced the risk of underperforming Bitcoin by wide margins due to dilution, but it did not face the solvency risks that a company with high interest debt faces. That was my take on MicroStrategy for a good while. Now, however, with the issuance of perpetual preferred stock with extremely high interest rates, MSTR’s interest expenses will rise, and its liquidity/solvency will likely deteriorate. For this reason, I’m downgrading my MicroStrategy rating to strong sell. MicroStrategy Operations Although the main focus of this article is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments and the leverage used to buy them, the company’s operations are worth discussing as well. Mainly, they are worth discussing because they are losing money, and therefore part of the company’s problems, albeit to a lesser extent than the Bitcoin investments are. MicroStrategy –officially now known as Strategy–is a U.S. software company that develops data analytics solutions for enterprise clients. It uses generative AI to help businesses find and exploit trends in their data. Let’s say, for example, that a company has dozens of spreadsheets in three categories: customers, receipts, and products. Using MicroStrategy’s platform , the user could synthesize the data in these three categories to find trends in customer experiences. Further, the company’s semantic graph enables users to visualize their data. There are many companies developing data platforms similar to MicroStrategy’s. Examples include Palantir ( PLTR ), Salesforce ( CRM ) and Snowflake ( SNOW ). The aforementioned companies are all much bigger than MicroStrategy, and have deeper pockets with which to buy the costly infrastructure on which AI and data analytics platforms run. This gives these companies a competitive edge over MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy ’s financials are consistent with its competitive weakness. In the fourth quarter, MicroStrategy delivered the following earnings results: $120.7 million in revenue, down 3% year-over-year. $1.1 billion in operating expenses, up 693%. $110 million in cash operating expenses. $1 billion in impairment charges. $38.1 million in cash So we have MicroStrategy shrinking, losing money, and barely profitable if we back out investment losses. It isn’t a great picture. But of course, MSTR could turn all of this around quite easily if Bitcoin made gains. In the next section, I’ll explain why betting on that is not a smart idea. Why Leveraged Bitcoin Bets Aren’t a Good Idea The reason why MicroStrategy investing its money into Bitcoin with leverage is a bad idea, is because Bitcoin is too volatile to be safely held with heavy amounts of leverage. Bitcoin is highly volatile, with 47% volatility compared to 10.2% for equities and 12% for gold. When an asset is highly volatile, buying it with leverage creates solvency issues. Let’s say you buy $1 million worth of Bitcoin at 10% interest. That gives you $100,000 in annual interest expenses. If Bitcoin falls 90% and stays there, you will need to borrow to refinance the loan. If no creditors will lend to you, you will go bankrupt. If Bitcoin falls 91%, and stays at that level for a year, then you can’t even pay your annual interest expense by selling all of your Bitcoin. In this scenario, too, you likely go bankrupt. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy is quite similar to the example given above. The company is buying volatile Bitcoin and incurring interest-bearing liabilities to finance its purchases. Now, it’s true that MSTR pays very low interest rates on its loans. But as I’ll show in a moment, that’s not quite the saving grace it appears to be. Arguments for Why MicroStrategy is Different (and Why They’re Wrong) The argument I outlined above is pretty sound if we are considering a leveraged Bitcoin ETF with high interest expenses. If I were simply addressing such an ETF, I’d end the article here. However, the fact that MicroStrategy is an operating business with very low interest expenses appears to lend some credibility to bullish theses on MSTR stock. So, I will address the two main arguments bulls use to establish MicroStrategy’s financial soundness below. The first argument bulls use to support MicroStrategy’s soundness is that the revenue generated by its operating business offsets its Bitcoin related solvency risk somewhat. On close inspection, the offset is not that great–or even negative. In the trailing 12-month period, MSTR lost $63 million from operations, not counting crypto impairment losses. The operations eat up money, so they actually make MSTR’s solvency even worse in a stress scenario, compared to if the company were just a leveraged Bitcoin ETF. The second argument bulls use to support MicroStrategy’s soundness is its debt structure. MSTR has convertible bonds outstanding with yields between 0% and 2.25%. These low interest rates gave relatively modest interest expenses of $61.9 million in the TTM period. With $41 billion worth of Bitcoin as of March 18, MSTR can easily pay those debts by selling off small chunks of Bitcoin. However, interest isn’t the only expense that debts incur. They also have to be paid off at maturity. MicroStrategy has $8.2 billion worth of debts due by 2032. The company would have to sell 20% of its Bitcoin to pay those debts all at once today. If Bitcoin fell 80% in price (like it did in 2014), then MSTR would have to sell all of its Bitcoin to pay off its debt at maturity. All that would be left in that scenario would be a loss-making operating business worth a tiny fraction of MSTR’s current market cap. If MicroStrategy tried to refinance the debts with more debts, on the other hand, it would likely be forced to pay high interest rates, as investors would not be interested in the MSTR convertible feature in an extreme Bitcoin bear market with MSTR stock also being hit. MSTR’s equity would be near-worthless. Also, MicroStrategy’s “low interest expense” increasingly isn’t real if we use the word “interest” broadly. Preferred share dividends are much like bond interest, in that they are fixed commitments that common shareholders have no claim on. Such dividends can be considered a kind of 'interest.' Well, the latest twist in the MicroStrategy saga is that the company has started selling preferred stock! On February 5 , MicroStrategy issued 7.3 million $80 preferred shares, for a total issuance of $534 million. Expected interest expense was $58.4 million per year. On Tuesday, the company announced it was going in for a second round of preferred stock, this time 5 million shares at $100 per share yielding 10%. So, $500 million in issuance against $50 million in interest expenses. So we’ve got $108.4 in extra interest-like obligations being added here, more than doubling MicroStrategy’s “interest” expense. This is a new issue that was not present when I last covered MSTR, and the main reason I have downgraded my rating to strong sell. The Bottom Line The bottom line is that MicroStrategy has extreme liquidity and solvency issues in a stress scenario, such as a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. Considering all the factors discussed in this article, I think MicroStrategy would not survive a scenario in which Bitcoin declines 80% in price. For an asset as volatile as Bitcoin, an 80% crash is not all that unusual. So, MicroStrategy is too risky to be worthy of investment.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-20 03:10:34

The deal could be confirmed by the morning of March 20 in the US, The Wall Street Journal said in a March 19 report, citing people familiar with the matter. Kraken’s expanded offerings would be made possible through NinjaTrader’s registration as a Futures Commission Merchant. The move would help Kraken’s strategy to work across several asset classes — including plans for equities trading and payments — while enabling NinjaTrader to expand into the UK, continental Europe and Australian markets, the sources told WSJ. NinjaTrader is expected to remain a standalone platform under Kraken. Cointelegraph reached out to Kraken and NinjaTrader for comment but did not receive an immediate response. Source: Wall Street Journal Markets Kraken posted $1.5 billion in revenue and $665 billion in trading volume from 2.5 million funded customer accounts on its platform in 2024, while NinjaTrader recently said its futures trading tools are used by over 1.8 million customers. Kraken announced its intention to broaden its product offerings and services last November when it shuttered its non-fungible token marketplace. Related: Australia fines Kraken operator $5M for regulatory breaches It comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Kraken on March 3 after it initially alleged that the crypto platform acted as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange and clearing agency. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, with no admission of wrongdoing, no penalties paid and no changes to Kraken’s business. Kraken is one of many firms that stand to benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment in the US under President Donald Trump, who has promised to make America the “crypto capital” of the world. The crypto exchange was founded in 2011 by Thanh Luu, Michael Gronager and former CEO Jesse Powell, who handed the reins over to former data analytics executive Amir Orad last July. Kraken consistently ranks among the top seven to 15 largest crypto exchanges by spot trading volume, handling between $390 million and $4.4 billion in daily trades over the past three months, according to CoinGecko data.

XRP, the digital currency tied to Ripple, has found itself at the center of this conversation, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse offering details into why XRP was not specifically named in President Trump’s executive order for the U.S. digital asset stockpile. Why Was XRP Left Out? During a recent discussion with Bloomberg, Garlinghouse addressed the exclusion of XRP from the executive order that focused on creating a strategic reserve for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “XRP was named by President Trump in a post on Truth Social,” Garlinghouse pointed out, referencing a statement where the former President had discussed the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a broader crypto stockpile that would include other assets like XRP. Despite this, XRP was not specifically mentioned in the executive order itself. “I don’t know what specifically was in the executive order,” Garlinghouse said. “But my understanding is there’s going to be a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and there will be a crypto stockpile representing other cryptos. I would expect that XRP will be included.” Confidence in the Future of XRP and Crypto ETFs Garlinghouse also shared his confidence in the growing momentum of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. He said that there are currently 11 filings pending with the SEC for ETFs, with major firms like Bitwise and Franklin Templeton leading the charge. “I think those will be live in the second half of this year,” he predicted. Despite some outflows from crypto ETFs, Garlinghouse pointed to the increasing inflows into XRP, saying that this is a result of the “false negative pressure” caused by the SEC’s past actions against Ripple. “There’s a kind of exhaustion from the market with the SEC’s actions, and it’s starting to reverse,” he said. This sentiment shift could position XRP to benefit from an evolving regulatory environment and an industry that’s beginning to find its footing within U.S. borders.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 03:17:06

Kraken, founded in 2011, is already a key player in the crypto market, offering trading for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. With this acquisition, Kraken will gain access to NinjaTrader’s 1.9 million active users, boosting its position in the futures market. More importantly, NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant, which means Kraken can now legally offer crypto futures and derivatives in the U.S. This will be a major step in Kraken’s broader strategy of expanding beyond crypto trading into other asset classes, such as equities and payments. How NinjaTrader Benefits ? NinjaTrader, founded in 2003, provides futures trading tools to over 1.8 million customers. Under Kraken, it will gain access to more resources and a wider global market. Kraken reportedly plans to support NinjaTrader’s expansion into the U.K., Europe, and Australia, helping it reach new traders and increase its market influence. While NinjaTrader will become part of Kraken’s trading ecosystem, it is expected to continue operating as a separate platform. A Regulatory Shift Fuels Kraken’s Expansion This acquisition comes at a time when the regulatory environment for crypto is shifting. Under President Trump, the industry expects lighter regulations, and Kraken recently saw the SEC drop a lawsuit against it. The deal with NinjaTrader could mark one of the biggest acquisitions in the crypto space, showing that major players are looking to expand beyond just digital assets. Kraken’s growth has been impressive, with its revenue doubling to $1.5 billion in 2024 and adjusted earnings reaching $380 million.

With the Dogecoin millionaire club finally making big moves again, DOGE bulls are aiming for a sharp rebound to the $1 target. Dogecoin Millionaire Wallets Skyrocket Dogecoin, along with many other meme coins and altcoins in the market, has faced a two-month crypto-wide retrace, but large holders seem to be taking advantage of the price dip. According to reports from market intelligence platform Santiment, the number of wallet addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE tokens has steadily increased, suggesting that whales are accumulating rather than selling. Since early February, the amount of DOGE millionaire addresses has surged by 62 wallets, marking a 1.24% increase. Additionally, active addresses have skyrocketed past 150,000 per day, the highest level since mid-November 2024. This increased network activity signals sustained user engagement and a surging interest and confidence from whales. Moreover, a rising wallet count suggests that users are entering the market again, driving adoption and increasing trading activities. Historically, increased wallet numbers among large holders have correlated with bullish trends in the Dogecoin price. This is because, cumulatively, these whales hold a significant portion of the cryptocurrency circulating supply. If Dogecoin continues to see a surge in its millionaire wallets and active addresses, it could set the stage for a strong rebound once the broader market stabilizes. Santiment also shares a similar sentiment, as its report reveals that an increase in Dogecoin’s utility and smart money signals a potential turning point soon. Currently, the meme coin’s price action remains uncertain due to the market’s downturn . Dogecoin continues to face significant volatility and declines. Its price has crashed by over 40% in the past month, pushing it down to $1.67, according to CoinMarketCap. Dogecoin Bulls Target $1 Price Surge While its network records a rise in large holder wallets, Dogecoin’s price has been forecasted to reach the coveted $1 mark in this bull cycle. Sharing a technical chart analysis of the meme coin’s price action, Trader Tardigrade revealed that the weekly candle has closed with a Doji. A Doji candle is a neutral candlestick pattern that signifies indecision between buyers and sellers. It also shows a nearly identical open and close crypto price. This candle signals a potential trend reversal, particularly if a cryptocurrency is at the end of a strong downtrend or uptrend. According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s weekly Doji candle indicates a reversal to the upside. If the cryptocurrency can continue on its upward momentum, the analyst projects a surge to $1 before the end of 2025. This surge would represent a massive 498% price increase from DOGE’s current market lows.",Dogecoin|altcoins|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Active Addresses|Dogecoin Large Holders|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Doji Candle|Santiment|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-20 03:30:51

This will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has addressed a crypto conference. The speech will take place at North Javits and will be streamed live on X and YouTube. The announcement follows comments made earlier this week by Bo Hines, the Executive Director of the White House’s President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, when he confirmed that the U.S. government is actually open to actively acquiring Bitcoin as part of the newly created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Speaking at DAS on Tuesday, Bo told attendees, “It’s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away.” Trump moves Bitcoin into national strategy Trump’s administration has of course made Bitcoin a central part of U.S. financial policy, as earlier this month, he signed an executive order finally creating the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve he promised during campaign. Bo explained once again that the government’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy is similar to how countries stockpile gold reserves, telling the DAS audience, “I’ve been asked all the time, it’s like how much do you want? Well, that’s like asking a country how much gold do you want – as much as we can get.” Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have introduced proposals for the U.S. to acquire 1 million BTC over the next five years. Meanwhile, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, speaking at DAS on Wednesday, said he believes this legislation will pass before the current congressional session ends. Trump will not be the only high-profile name at DAS. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, will deliver a keynote speech and participate in a fireside chat with Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. The discussion is expected to focus on Bitcoin’s role in corporate treasury strategies and its growing adoption among institutions. The event will also include a panel discussion on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will moderate a discussion featuring BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, Giang Bui. With Bitcoin ETFs seeing increased approval and mainstream attention, the conversation is likely to cover new financial products and their impact on the market. Trump’s upcoming speech follows his previous Bitcoin-focused engagement at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference in Nashville last year, where he first promised to create the national bitcoin strategic reserve.

This move comes as the Trump administration looks to influence the sector, according to a registration statement filed with the SEC on Friday. SPAC to Raise $179M for Crypto & Defense Acquisitions Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) based in the Cayman Islands, aims to raise at least $179 million through an IPO and private placement. The $179 million fundraising target reflects TMTG’s confidence in the crypto and defense sectors. The funds will be used to acquire companies with strong growth potential and innovative solutions. Renatus Tactical is looking to acquire companies in crypto, blockchain, data security, and dual-use tech—sectors with significant government oversight, as noted in its SEC filing. With Trump appointees in charge of the SEC, DOJ, and FTC, these agencies will oversee the merger process. Strong Ties To Trump Media The company’s leadership has strong ties to Trump Media: CEO Eric Swider is a board member of Trump Media, Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO, chairs Renatus Tactical’s board, and COO Alexander Cano was president and secretary of the firm that merged with Trump Media. Renatus Tactical plans to raise the $178.9 million by offering 17.5 million shares at $10 each and 3.94 million warrants at $1 in a private placement. While the company’s registration outlines its intention to primarily target mergers in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, data security, and dual-use technologies sectors, however, it is also open to pursuing acquisitions in any industry. Trump Ties Could Lead To Challenges? In its SEC filing, Renatus Tactical notes that the current administration has taken significant steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy. Trump’s connection to the founders of Renatus Tactical may not be entirely beneficial for the company.

AI (artificial intelligence) is poised to redefine its trajectory. AI agents – already reshaping trading ecosystems and decision-making processes – could catalyze a golden age or accelerate the industry’s decline. The question isn’t whether AI will impact crypto but how we – as professionals, innovators and participants – will adapt to its rise. The rise of AI agents – A market transformed AI agents have moved from niche tools to central players in the crypto landscape. In early March 2024, AI agent tokens barely registered, with a market cap of $2 billion. By January 2025, they approached almost $11 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Platforms like Woo X and 3Commas demonstrate the profound impact of AI on trading. They offer insights and automation that reshape how markets operate. The AI trading bot market, valued at $21.7 million in 2022, is projected to hit $145 million by 2029. These numbers aren’t just statistics – t hey’re a call to action. Ignoring the rise of AI agents risks falling behind in an industry where innovation sets the pace. The convergence of AI and blockchain is also unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger – c ombined with AI’s real-time analytics – is creating a new frontier in financial transparency and security. Together, these technologies streamline processes like KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), ensuring efficiency and compliance while mitigating fraud risks. This synergy further emphasizes the indispensable role AI agents will play in the crypto market . Humans and AI – Partners, not rivals Fears that AI will replace humans in crypto reflect a misunderstanding of its role. AI agents excel at processing data and executing strategies. However, they lack the intuition, creativity and critical thinking that define human expertise. Consider the Walmart-Litecoin fiasco. A fake press release temporarily roiled markets, exposing AI’s limitations in discerning truth from misinformation. Human skepticism quickly uncovered the fraud. This proved that while algorithms are powerful, they require human oversight to navigate complex realities. The future of crypto depends on humans and AI working together. Computational efficiency – paired with contextual judgment – creates a stronger, more reliable ecosystem. Adapting to the new skill set The skills that once defined crypto expertise are no longer sufficient. Understanding blockchain basics or mastering traditional trading tools won’t cut it in a market increasingly driven by AI. Platforms like Woo X have embraced AI-powered social trading. Binance’s listing of AI-focused tokens like SWARMS highlights the shift toward intelligent systems. Professionals who fail to engage with these technologies risk obsolescence. The industry’s evolution demands a new skill set. Integrating AI fluency with crypto knowledge is essential to remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment. Moreover, smart contracts powered by AI are streamlining complex financial processes. These self-executing contracts, enriched with AI algorithms, dynamically adapt to market conditions, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors. This innovation demonstrates the practical advantages of aligning AI with blockchain in crypto operations. Continuous learning – The lifeblood of progress Education is no longer optional. It forms the foundation for relevance in an AI-driven crypto ecosystem.

BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Rewarding P2E Meme Coin With 2900% ROI Potential Ever wondered what it’s like to invest at the perfect time? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is offering right now.

Alternative’s Crypto Fear and Grid index gauges investor sentiment by examining market momentum, volatility, Bitcoin dominance, and social media trends. The shift to neutral sentiment indicates a more balanced view of the market, with investors being neither overly fearful nor excessively greedy Improving sentiment came about as markets reacted positively to the Federal Reserve’s Mar.19 decision to maintain interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, prolonging its pause on rate cuts due to economic uncertainty. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that inflation remains stubbornly high and warned that Trump’s tariffs could prolong the fight against rising prices. While the Fed’s dot plot still projects two rate cuts in 2025, Powell admitted that it’s difficult to assess the full impact of tariffs on inflation. The central bank now projects 1.7% GDP growth, down from 2.1% in December.

The total crypto market cap now stands at $2.91 trillion, up 2% in 24 hours.

Meanwhile, expectations are building around the upcoming launch of Solana exchange-traded funds, set for Thursday, Mar. 20. At the same time, following five weeks of withdrawals, Bitcoin ETFs have reversed their trend, recording weekly inflows of $483 million, according to SoSoValue data . The launch of Solana ETFs and the renewed demand for Bitcoin investment products both point to improving sentiment and rising institutional interest in digital assets. Despite the Fed’s stable stance, Powell pointed out that consumer spending, a key factor in economic growth, is beginning to slow down. Investors are closely watching inflation trends and possible tariff effects as the market navigates a volatile environment due to the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy.

The coin has taken a major hit, dropping 31% in the past week, and is now testing crucial support levels. Key Price Levels to Watch Currently, Pi Coin is hovering around $1.16, just below the important resistance level at $1.20. The price action in the coming days will likely determine the direction of the coin’s future movement. Possible Rebound? If Pi Coin manages to break above $1.20 and maintain momentum, the coin could see an upward movement toward $1.40 or even $2, offering a glimmer of hope for bulls. Possible Decline? On the other hand, if Pi Coin fails to hold its current position, the price could drop to around $1.05–$1.02. Binance’s Decision and Growing Concerns Compounding Pi Coin’s current struggles, the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently made a decision that has added to the coin’s uncertain future. Binance, known for its “Vote to List” campaigns, excluded Pi Network from the latest campaign, which allowed users to vote on which of the nine nominated projects would be listed on the platform. The decision not to include Pi Network has raised eyebrows, as many in the crypto community had expected the token to be part of the campaign. In an official statement, Binance explained that its “Vote to List” initiative was focused exclusively on projects built on the BNB Smart Chain, which effectively left Pi Coin out of the equation. “Our Vote to List campaign is focused solely on projects on the BNB Smart Chain,” Binance clarified. This exclusion comes at a time when Pi Coin was hoping for more mainstream exposure and listing on major platforms like Coinbase and Binance.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 03:56:51

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the matter, an official announcement is expected as early as Thursday, Mar. 20. Through the acquisition, Kraken will be able to leverage NinjaTrader’s Futures Commission Merchant license to increase the range of cryptocurrency futures and derivatives products it offers in the United States. NinjaTrader, which was established in 2003, serves more than 1.8 million retail investors. The deal would give Kraken access to this user base while also supporting NinjaTrader’s expansion into the UK, Europe, and Australia. Kraken’s regulatory approvals, including its Electronic Money Institution license from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and its MiFID license for the EU, could ease this process.

As per the report, the company holds $42.8 billion in assets and operates 2.5 million funded accounts. It also registered a total trade volume of $665 billion for 2024. The timing of this acquisition aligns with Kraken’s recent legal victory. On Mar. 3, the exchange announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against it with no penalties or admission of wrongdoing. This legal outcome removes a major regulatory challenge as Kraken moves forward with its expansion Meanwhile, Kraken continues to gain industry recognition. According to a Mar. 19 post on its official blog, Kraken ranked 3rd in Kaiko’s Q1 2025 exchange rankings, up from 7th last year. This is due to improvements in governance, security, and liquidity.

If we base it on the recent statements of Bo Hines, Trump’s pick to head its Digital Assets section, the industry will soon see an aggressive investment strategy from the US government. Hines shared the department’s plan during a speech at the digital assets summit. He mentioned they plan to invest “as many Bitcoins” as possible. Related Reading: XRP Vs. ETH: Bold Prediction Claims ‘Dying’ Ethereum’s Reign Is Ending The interview and Hines’s subsequent thoughts came after Trump approved an executive order on March 6th to create a cryptocurrency stockpile for altcoins and Bitcoin. However, Trump’s executive order clarified that the US government will not procure new cryptos for its stockpile; instead, it plans to hold all digital assets confiscated by the government as part of its regulation. We want “as much as we can get.” – @BoHines on Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/Sy86En8N1Q — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 18, 2025 From An Election Promise To Reality: Trump’s SBR Bitcoin, or a crypto stockpile, has been a hot topic in Washington and other crypto circles. During the elections, then-candidate Donald Trump teased the voters with his support for BTC and the blockchain and his plans to push for a crypto stockpile. At the Digital Summit in New York, Hines shared that the passage of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve reflects the president’s commitment to his campaign promise. In his election cycle, the plans for a crypto reserve faced stiff challenges, specifically from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its (former) chair, Gary Gensler. Trump positioned himself as pro-crypto and even promised to fire Gensler if he’s elected. Now that Gensler is out of the picture, Trump is more aggressive in promoting his crypto plans. Planned SBR Highlights Crypto’s Uniqueness In the same speech, Hines explained that the planned Strategic Reserve respects and promotes the digital asset’s unique features. For a start, Hines argued that the SBR is solely for Bitcoin and not for other altcoins like Cardano and Ripple’s XRP. Also, Hines shared how the department sees Bitcoin. According to the executive director, they see Bitcoin as a commodity, not a security. He said that Bitcoin has an “intrinsic store of value”. Hines also said that in Trump’s executive order, Bitcoin is compared to digital gold. Hines Calls On US Government To Invest More In BTC Hines highlighted many of Bitcoin’s unique features and claimed that the US government must hold and continue investing in Bitcoin. The current administration’s policies on Bitcoin and crypto assets starkly contrast with the Biden presidency, which exited its Bitcoin holdings and lost $17 billion. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It’s Lift-Off Time Hines shared that the government’s aim is to start building its Bitcoin holdings instead of liquidating them. He then revealed plans to work with the Secretary of Commerce and the Treasury to define budget-neutral approaches to buying more Bitcoins.
