Wedson, who has maintained a bearish stance for the past three months, now points to a lesser-known metric as a key indicator of Bitcoin’s strength: the Real Market Average Price. According to Wedson, this metric excludes BTC from mining activity and has historically acted as a strong support level. Wedson recalled that Bitcoin held firm at this level during the 2021 China Ban-induced market crash and reached an all-time high months later. “The market is complex and unforgiving,” Wedson said, noting that most investors are often too late to make the right trading decisions. Wedson, who is the CEO of cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal, warned that Bitcoin has entered what he calls a “Chained Bear Market,” a phase dominated by bearish signals. However, he believes that the real euphoria in this cycle is yet to emerge and suggests that there could still be significant upward movement. “When that happens, don’t hesitate to take profits, buy the green,” he told traders. Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)? What Price Level Needs to be Breached for a Big Rally to Come? The analyst acknowledged that Bitcoin’s price could fall below $70,000 and potentially reach its Real Market Average Price of around $64,000. Despite this, he remains confident that the bull market is intact and that BTC’s dominance could pave the way for an altcoin rally soon. With stablecoins gaining traction, he predicts a major Altcoin Season in the next few months. Wedson argued that, contrary to popular belief, macroeconomic trends currently have a weak correlation with Bitcoin’s price action. Even as traditional markets face turmoil, crypto markets will likely follow their own path. He also noted that the crypto space is extremely volatile, with corrections of 20%, 30%, and even 50% common in bullish cycles. *This is not investment advice.

Just as robust frameworks are crucial for the crypto space, ensuring the safe and ethical development of AI is becoming paramount. A recent report co-led by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li emphasizes this urgency, advocating for proactive AI safety laws to address not just current, but also potential future risks associated with advanced AI systems. Why Proactive AI Regulation is Essential Now? The report, from the Joint California Policy Working Group on Frontier AI Models, emerges from Governor Newsom’s initiative to thoroughly assess AI risks following his veto of SB 1047. This group, comprised of leading figures like Fei-Fei Li, Jennifer Chayes, and Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, argues for a shift in perspective. Instead of solely reacting to present dangers, policymakers must anticipate and legislate for future AI risks that are not yet fully understood or manifested. Think of it like this: Current Risks are Real, But Limited Scope: Existing AI regulations often focus on issues we already see, like bias in algorithms or data privacy concerns. Future Risks are Exponential and Unknown: As AI evolves, especially frontier AI models , the potential for unforeseen and far-reaching consequences increases dramatically. Proactive Laws are Preventative Measures: Just as we don’t wait for a nuclear disaster to understand its devastation, we shouldn’t wait for extreme AI-related incidents to realize the need for strong safeguards. The report highlights that while concrete evidence for extreme AI threats like AI-driven cyberattacks or bioweapons is still “inconclusive,” the potential stakes are too high to ignore. This is where the concept of “trust but verify” comes into play. Demanding AI Transparency : The ‘Trust But Verify’ Approach A core recommendation of the report is to boost AI transparency . This isn’t about stifling innovation but fostering responsible development. The report suggests a two-pronged strategy: Empowering Internal Reporting: Create safe channels for AI developers and employees to report concerns about safety testing, data practices, and security measures within their organizations. Mandatory Third-Party Verification: Require AI companies to submit their safety claims and testing results for independent evaluation by external experts. This approach aims to create a system of checks and balances, ensuring that claims about AI safety are not just taken at face value. It’s about building trust through verifiable evidence and accountability. Key Recommendations at a Glance To summarize, the report advocates for several crucial policy changes: Recommendation Benefit Why it Matters Mandatory Public Reporting of Safety Tests Increased accountability and public scrutiny Ensures AI developers are prioritizing safety Transparency in Data Acquisition Practices Identifies potential biases and ethical concerns Promotes fairness and responsible data handling Enhanced Security Measures Disclosure Reduces vulnerabilities to misuse and attacks Protects against malicious applications of AI Third-Party Evaluations of Safety Metrics Provides objective validation of safety claims Builds trust in AI safety protocols Expanded Whistleblower Protections Encourages internal reporting of safety violations Creates a culture of safety within AI companies Industry Reaction and the Path Forward Interestingly, the report has garnered positive responses from across the AI policy spectrum. From staunch AI safety advocates like Yoshua Bengio to those who opposed stricter regulations like SB 1047, there seems to be a consensus on the need for a more transparent and proactive approach. Even critics of SB 1047, like Dean Ball, see this report as a “promising step” for California’s AI safety framework. Senator Scott Wiener, who championed SB 1047, also views the report as a positive development, aligning with the ongoing legislative conversations around AI governance. The report’s recommendations echo elements of both SB 1047 and its successor, SB 53, particularly the requirement for developers to report safety test results. This report could be a significant win for the AI safety movement, which has faced headwinds recently. By emphasizing proactive measures and broad industry consensus, it provides a strong foundation for shaping future AI regulation and ensuring the responsible evolution of this transformative technology.

While many altcoins make bold claims, few truly reshape industries like Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X. Tron is expanding its cross-chain capabilities by integrating a wrapped version of TRX on Solana. Meanwhile, Immutable X continues its dominance in Web3 gaming, drawing major partnerships and unveiling new gaming innovations at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025. Amid these advancements, Qubetics ($TICS) is capturing attention for addressing the gaps in real-world asset tokenization. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that struggle with fragmented ecosystems, Qubetics seamlessly integrates multiple blockchains, making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize and trade real-world assets efficiently one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain network designed to bring real-world asset tokenization to the forefront of the digital economy. By offering an aggregated blockchain infrastructure, it allows seamless transactions between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other leading networks. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine being able to fractionalize ownership of high-value assets like real estate, luxury goods, or rare collectibles—all secured on the blockchain. Instead of requiring massive capital to purchase an entire commercial property, businesses and individuals can own portions of tokenized assets, creating a more liquid and accessible global market. Beyond accessibility, Qubetics enhances security and transparency. Smart contracts govern all transactions, eliminating fraud and manual paperwork. The blockchain ledger ensures immutable proof of ownership, making disputes nearly impossible positioning itself as the best altcoins to invest in now. The numbers speak for themselves, highlighting the remarkable momentum of $TICS. Currently in its 26th crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.1181, with over $15.2 million already raised. With more than 23,400 token holders and over 501 million $TICS sold, the rapid demand underscores strong investor confidence. Early adopters have already seen significant gains, and with projections indicating a strong upward trajectory, the potential ROI for new investors remains highly attractive. As the platform continues to gain traction across global industries, those securing tokens now may be well-positioned for substantial returns in the future. Tron: Expanding Cross-Chain Capabilities Tron (TRX) has long been a powerhouse in decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital content distribution. Built for speed, scalability, and low transaction fees, Tron has consistently been a preferred network for developers and crypto enthusiasts alike. As of now, TRX is holding above $0.20 but facing resistance at $0.23 and $0.24. While price action is always volatile, its latest cross-chain initiative positions Tron for long-term expansion. Recently, Tron announced the integration of a wrapped version of TRX on Solana, marking a significant milestone in its cross-chain interoperability strategy. This move isn’t just about connecting two blockchains—it’s about unlocking greater liquidity and making TRX more usable across multiple ecosystems. For developers, it means seamless transactions between Solana and Tron, enabling more efficient DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and payment solutions. For TRX holders, it expands the token’s utility and reach, potentially boosting demand as new use cases emerge one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Immutable X: Powering the Next Era of Web3 Gaming Immutable X (IMX) is one of the most influential names in blockchain gaming. By providing gas-free transactions and high-speed scalability, it eliminates the biggest hurdles preventing mainstream gamers from embracing blockchain technology. At GDC 2025, Immutable X took center stage, showcasing how it is revolutionizing the gaming industry through strategic partnerships and cutting-edge innovations.

Well, you might be onto something! The latest buzz from the financial world is hinting at a potentially brighter future for the crypto market, all thanks to the Federal Reserve’s recent projections. Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader digital asset space. Decoding the Fed’s Dot Plot and 2025 Interest Rate Cuts The Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States, recently released its updated “dot plot.” Think of the dot plot as the Fed’s interest rate forecast – each dot represents an individual member’s expectation for future interest rates. According to the latest data, as reported by Odaily News, the Fed is still projecting two interest rate cuts in 2025. This projection remains consistent with their outlook from December 2024, suggesting a steady hand and a continued expectation of easing monetary policy down the line. But what exactly does this mean? In simple terms, interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can slow down economic activity. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, potentially stimulating economic growth. For the crypto market, which often reacts to broader economic signals, this is significant. Here’s a quick breakdown of what we know: Consistent Projections: The Fed’s projection of two rate cuts in 2025 remains unchanged from December 2024. This consistency provides a degree of certainty and predictability for markets. Dot Plot Indicator: The dot plot is a key tool for understanding the Fed’s forward guidance on monetary policy. It’s closely watched by investors and analysts alike. Odaily News Report: The news is sourced from Odaily News, a reputable source in the crypto and financial news space, adding credibility to the report. Why Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 Could be a Game Changer for the Crypto Market So, why should crypto enthusiasts get excited about potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 ? Here are a few key reasons: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates typically lead to increased liquidity in the market. With cheaper borrowing costs, investors and institutions may have more capital to allocate to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Risk-On Sentiment: When interest rates are high, investors often prefer safer, fixed-income investments. Rate cuts can shift sentiment towards “risk-on” assets, making crypto more attractive compared to traditional investments offering lower returns in a low-rate environment. Weakening Dollar: Historically, lower interest rates can sometimes lead to a weaker US dollar. A weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. Boost to Innovation and Growth: Lower borrowing costs can spur innovation and growth in the tech and crypto sectors. Startups and established crypto companies may find it easier to secure funding for development and expansion. Navigating the Path to 2025: Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of Fed rate cuts is undoubtedly positive for the crypto market , it’s crucial to keep a balanced perspective. The journey to 2025 and beyond isn’t without its potential bumps. Here are some challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Inflationary Pressures: The Fed’s primary mandate is to control inflation. If inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed might be hesitant to cut rates as aggressively as anticipated, or even delay the cuts altogether. Economic Uncertainty: The global economic landscape is constantly evolving. Unexpected economic slowdowns or geopolitical events could influence the Fed’s decisions and alter the trajectory of interest rates. Dot Plot is Not a Promise: It’s important to remember that the dot plot represents projections, not guarantees. Economic conditions can change, and the Fed’s actual policy decisions may deviate from these projections. Crypto Market Volatility: Even with favorable macroeconomic conditions, the crypto market is inherently volatile. External factors, regulatory changes, and market sentiment can all significantly impact prices, regardless of interest rate policies. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for Potential Rate Cuts So, what can crypto investors and enthusiasts do to prepare for the potential interest rate cuts in 2025 ? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic data, Fed announcements, and expert analysis. Understanding the macroeconomic environment is crucial for making informed crypto investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in any investment strategy, especially in the volatile crypto market. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: While rate cuts can provide a short-term boost, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. Look for projects with strong use cases, solid teams, and growing adoption. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The crypto market can be highly rewarding but also carries significant risks. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility and potentially improve your average entry price over time. The Optimistic Outlook for Crypto in 2025 and Beyond The Federal Reserve’s continued projection of two rate cuts in 2025 offers a beacon of hopeful news for the crypto market . While challenges and uncertainties remain, the potential for increased liquidity, improved risk sentiment, and a weaker dollar paints an optimistic picture for digital assets. By staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, crypto investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from this evolving macroeconomic landscape. The year 2025 could indeed be a significant year for the crypto space, marking a new chapter of growth and innovation, fueled in part by these anticipated monetary policy shifts.

42012939,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=696401,1742426443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42012939.jpeg,Bitnomial ends SEC lawsuit and launches first CFTC-regulated XRP futures,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitnomial-ends-sec-lawsuit-cftc-xrp-futures/,"Crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial has launched Ripple XRP futures regulated by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Chicago-based firm announced the launch today, noting that its clients can have access to the product by March 20. According to Bitnomial ‘s announcement on X, prospective clients would have to be onboarded through any of its Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) partners, including RJ O’Brien, Marex Global, or Bitnomial Clearing, to access the product. XRP futures contracts allow traders to bet on the asset’s future price movements and hedge against its future performance. While several offshore exchanges already offer derivatives products for XRP, this is the first time a CFTC-regulated exchange will also list contracts for the token. The announcement coincides with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropping the long-running lawsuit against Ripple over the status of XRP. While there have been weeks of speculation about when the SEC filed the lawsuit, the settlement has finally kicked off an avalanche of new developments around the token. Bitnomial initially tried to launch its XRP futures in 2024 but faced opposition from the SEC then, with the regulator claiming that it would amount to security. With the SEC’s position changed, the exchange also dropped the lawsuit against the SEC. Over the past few weeks, the exchange has been busy with new products, listing derivatives contracts for cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Litecoin, HBAR, Polkadot, Solana, etc. One key feature of Bitnomial’s futures contract is physical settlement, which its CEO, Luke Hoersten , said ensures that the product interacts directly with underlying assets. Hoersten said: “Physically settled futures ensure contracts are delivered in actual crypto upon settlement, distinguishing them from cash settled alternatives that do not directly interact with the underlying asset.” Meanwhile, the firm added that the XRP contracts would be available on another CFTC-regulated exchange, Botanical, when they launch. XRP is up 12% as expectations of ETF approval rises With the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, XRP saw a massive jump in price today, rising more than 12% to reach $2.57. Although it has now dropped to $2.50, expectations about what is next for XRP have increased significantly. Many believe XRP’s chances of getting a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) are almost certain now that the SEC has a case against it. Ripple CEO Brad Garlignhouse admitted this, noting that there are about 11 filings for XRP ETFs before the SEC currently, and he expects the regulator to approve them by the second half of the year. Interestingly, the Ripple-SEC settlement does not affect Judge Torres’s ruling, which classifies the institutional sale of XRP as securities. There is no clarity on whether Ripple will drop its appeal challenging the $125 million fine. Meanwhile, the positive impact of the XRP news also moved the rest of the market, with Bitcoin gaining almost 5% to surpass $85,000 for the first time since March 9. Even ETH, which has been stuck below $2,000 for days now, finally climbed out of that rut, just as SOL and other altcoins recorded sizable gains. Solana’s positive performance is partly due to Volatility Shares’ upcoming launch of the first-ever Solana ETFs in the US on March 20. The two futures ETFs will track SOL, with one of them being 2x.

The event follows his executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning BTC as a key asset in the country’s financial framework. Donald Trump Speech at DAS and Its Context Donald Trump’s presence at the Digital Asset Summit comes amid increasing government interest in Bitcoin and digital currencies. His administration has taken steps to integrate Bitcoin into national reserves, emphasizing its role in the country’s long-term financial strategy. The U.S. president previously addressed a Bitcoin conference in Nashville during his campaign. Now, the pro-crypto President will speak at a crypto conference for the first time. Discussions at the event will focus on Bitcoin’s adoption among institutions, regulatory developments, and the future of crypto markets. Trump’s speech will touch on the next steps in his administration’s Bitcoin strategy. This development comes just a few hours after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that XRP is expected to be part of the US Digital Asset Stockpile. He cited President Trump’s previous mention of the asset on Truth Social. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Initiative Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, marking a new phase in the country’s approach to digital assets. The initiative aims to accumulate Bitcoin as a national reserve asset, drawing comparisons to traditional gold reserves. Bo Hines, Executive Director on Digital Assets for the Trump administration, stated that the government’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy is budget-neutral. He emphasized that this approach ensures it does not affect other financial priorities. Hines has emphasized that Bitcoin accumulation is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the nation’s financial resilience. Lawmakers have already proposed measures to expand the reserve, with Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich suggesting a plan to acquire 1 million BTC over the next five years. The proposal is currently under review, with legislative discussions expected to continue in the coming months. More so, the Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets revealed plans for stablecoin legislation to be finalized within two months. Bo Hines expects Senator Bill Hagerty’s GENIUS Act to be enacted, with President Trump potentially signing it into law. Industry Leaders and Lawmakers at DAS The summit will feature key figures in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, in addition to Trump’s address. Michael Saylor, a Bitcoin advocate, will deliver a keynote speech and participate in a discussion with BTC historian Pete Rizzo. The event will also host Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who will moderate a panel featuring BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, Giang Bui. President Trump’s participation in the Digital Asset Summit is changing how people view digital assets.

According to an investigation by Global Ledger , a Swiss blockchain analysis company, Garantex has moved its liquidity to Grinex and has continued business as usual after its recent shutdown. Global Ledger went on to provide evidence from its investigation, showing on-chain and off-chain activities that followed patterns similar to Garantex. As of mid-March, Grinex was reported to have received over $29 million. As part of its investigation, Global Ledger discovered that the ruble-backed stablecoin, A7A5, which was previously listed only on two exchanges, Garantex and BiFinance, is now available on Grinex. Coincidentally, Garantex transferred 4.5 billion A7A5 from its blocked wallet to Grinex. The whole process that led to this transfer of funds is well documented by Global Ledger with the transactions reminiscent of the modus operandi of Garantex. In the detailed report released by Global Ledger, the user interface of both exchanges is quite similar, with very few visible differences between them. Also, a coinmarketrating review of Grinex adds credence to the claim that Garantex has rebranded and resumed operations as Grinex. The report explicitly stated that the exchange platform was created by Garantex after its platform was sanctioned internationally and subsequently blocked. Garantex has a long history of illegal dealings Garantex is a known non-regulatory compliant crypto exchange that has served as a platform for bad actors in the crypto space. The exchange was notorious for serving as a major money laundering platform and was used by ransomware groups such as Conti and Black Basta, among others. The platform also served as a fertile ground for moving DarkNet market (DNMs) proceeds linked to drug trafficking and child sex abuse materials (CSAM). It’s also reported that Garantex also served as the platform for laundering over $22 million of funds stolen from a hacked blockchain in the US. The platform has also been linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean government-backed hacking collective known for major crypto theft globally, most recently the Bybit hack. It has also been linked to some Russian cybercriminal forums and terrorist financing. In 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury, which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security, sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating the laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. However, Garantex still continued transacting illegally in the US, using various tactics to avoid detection and occasionally changing its operations using tactics such as constantly changing wallet addresses to avoid compliance requirements. Garantex also broke US federal regulations by carrying out financial operations in the US without registering with FinCEN. An international clampdown on the platform On March 7, 2025, the platform was finally brought to its knees in a joint international effort involving a collaboration between public law enforcement and private stakeholders in the blockchain space. Tether joined in blocking its operational wallets, thereby limiting its ability to move some funds. As predicted by Chainalysis , Garantex has quickly rebranded and resumed operations, moving its customers to the new platform. This isn’t the first time a platform that was shut down by regulators sprang up with a new name with the Suex and Chatex case being a perfect example. The partnership between public and private actors to curb transnational cybercrime in the crypto space is a welcome development and organizations like Global Ledger are ensuring that there’s adequate awareness about the operations of bad actors like Garantex. While Global Ledger’s investigation conclusively showed that Garantex now has a successor in Grinex, it did not answer the question on many of our minds — how soon will the hammer of the regulator and international law enforcement bodies come down on this new exchange?

42012891,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141654,1742427009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient DeFi Lending Protocols: Maintaining Steady 15-20% TVL Share Amidst Crypto Volatility,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-lending-protocols-tvl-share/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, where volatility is often the only constant, certain sectors demonstrate remarkable resilience. One such sector is decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a compelling insight: DeFi lending protocols are steadfastly holding a significant 15-20% share of the total value locked (TVL) within the entire DeFi ecosystem. This revelation sparks a crucial question: What does this steady performance signify, especially when the broader crypto market navigates bear markets and unpredictable price swings? Let’s delve into the fascinating world of DeFi lending and understand why it’s proving to be a cornerstone of the decentralized finance landscape. Decoding DeFi Lending Protocols and Their Significance Before we dive deeper, let’s clarify what DeFi lending protocols are and why they matter. Imagine traditional lending, but without banks or intermediaries. That’s essentially DeFi lending. These protocols utilize smart contracts on blockchains to enable users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. Users can earn interest by lending out their crypto assets, while borrowers can access crypto loans without going through traditional financial institutions. This peer-to-peer system offers greater accessibility, transparency, and often, more competitive interest rates compared to traditional finance. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of DeFi lending protocols: Decentralization: Operates without central authorities, fostering trust and reducing single points of failure. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering unparalleled visibility. Accessibility: Open to anyone with a crypto wallet, breaking down geographical and bureaucratic barriers. Efficiency: Smart contracts automate processes, leading to faster transactions and potentially lower fees. Yield Generation: Lenders can earn passive income through interest on their deposited assets. The Power of DeFi Ecosystem TVL and Lending’s Consistent Share Total Value Locked (TVL) is a crucial metric in DeFi, representing the total value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols. It’s essentially the lifeblood of the DeFi ecosystem, indicating the overall health and investor confidence. The fact that DeFi ecosystem TVL consistently allocates 15-20% to lending protocols is a powerful statement. It underscores the fundamental and continuous demand for lending and borrowing within the crypto space, regardless of market conditions. Why is this 15-20% share so noteworthy? Steady Demand: It indicates that lending isn’t just a fleeting trend but a core utility within DeFi. People consistently need to borrow and lend crypto assets. Bear Market Resilience: Even when the crypto market is down, the demand for lending persists. This suggests that DeFi lending serves real-world needs beyond speculative trading. Volatility Buffer: High volatility in crypto markets doesn’t deter users from engaging in lending, highlighting the inherent value proposition of these protocols. Foundation of DeFi: Lending protocols are a foundational pillar of a mature DeFi ecosystem, enabling other DeFi applications and strategies to flourish. Why is Crypto Lending Demand So Robust? The persistent demand for crypto lending , even amidst market turbulence, can be attributed to several factors. Let’s explore the driving forces behind this robust demand: Leverage for Trading: Traders often borrow crypto to amplify their trading positions. Even in bear markets, opportunities for shorting or strategic accumulation exist, fueling borrowing demand. Yield Farming Strategies: DeFi lending is integral to many yield farming strategies. Users borrow assets to participate in various yield-generating activities across different DeFi platforms. Liquidity Needs: Individuals and institutions may need to borrow crypto for various liquidity purposes, such as covering short-term expenses or funding operational needs without selling their crypto holdings. Hedging Risk: Borrowing can be used as a hedging strategy to mitigate risk in volatile markets. For instance, borrowing stablecoins against volatile assets can provide a degree of stability. Access to Capital: DeFi lending offers a faster and often less cumbersome way to access capital compared to traditional loans, particularly for those in regions with limited access to traditional banking. Benefits of Decentralized Finance Lending: Beyond the Numbers The steady TVL share is just one piece of the puzzle. The true strength of decentralized finance lending lies in its inherent benefits, which are attracting users and driving adoption: Benefit Description Financial Inclusion DeFi lending opens up financial services to a global audience, including the unbanked and underbanked populations. Higher Yields for Lenders Lenders can potentially earn significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. Faster Loan Processing Automated processes through smart contracts result in quicker loan approvals and disbursals. Collateralized Loans Loans are typically collateralized, reducing risk for lenders and making the system more secure. Transparency and Auditability All transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, enhancing transparency and auditability. Navigating the Challenges in DeFi Lending While DeFi lending presents a compelling alternative to traditional finance, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks involved. Understanding these hurdles is essential for both users and the continued growth of the sector. Smart Contract Risks: Smart contracts are code, and code can have vulnerabilities. Exploits and bugs in smart contracts can lead to loss of funds. Volatility Risk: The value of crypto assets used as collateral can fluctuate significantly, potentially leading to liquidation of collateral if prices drop sharply. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving, and potential regulatory changes could impact DeFi lending protocols. Complexity for New Users: Navigating DeFi can be complex for newcomers. Understanding concepts like impermanent loss, liquidation ratios, and gas fees requires a learning curve. Scalability Issues: Some blockchains face scalability challenges, which can lead to network congestion and higher transaction fees, impacting the efficiency of DeFi lending. Examples of Leading DeFi Lending Protocols The DeFi lending space is populated by a variety of innovative protocols, each with its unique features and offerings. Here are a few prominent examples: Aave: A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with a wide range of supported assets and innovative features like flash loans. Compound: Another major player, known for its algorithmic interest rate model and integration with various DeFi platforms. MakerDAO: The protocol behind DAI, a decentralized stablecoin, allowing users to generate DAI by locking up collateral like ETH. Venus: A decentralized money market on Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), offering fast and low-cost lending and borrowing. Cream Finance: A protocol focused on long-tail assets, providing lending and borrowing opportunities for a broader range of cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Participating in DeFi Lending Wisely Interested in exploring DeFi lending? Here are some actionable insights to guide your journey: Do Your Research: Thoroughly research different lending protocols, understand their mechanisms, and assess their security measures. Start Small: Begin with small amounts to get comfortable with the process and understand the risks involved before committing larger sums. Understand Smart Contract Audits: Look for protocols that have undergone reputable smart contract audits to minimize smart contract risks. Monitor Collateralization Ratios: If borrowing, closely monitor your collateralization ratio to avoid liquidation. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the DeFi space and be aware of potential regulatory changes. Conclusion: The Enduring Strength of DeFi Lending The data is clear: DeFi lending protocols are not just surviving; they are thriving as a fundamental component of the decentralized finance ecosystem. Maintaining a consistent 15-20% share of the DeFi TVL, even amidst market volatility, speaks volumes about the inherent value and demand for decentralized lending and borrowing. While challenges and risks exist, the benefits of financial inclusion, higher yields, and efficient access to capital are undeniable. As the DeFi space continues to mature, lending protocols are poised to remain a cornerstone, driving innovation and expanding access to financial services for a global audience. The resilient nature of DeFi lending offers a compelling glimpse into the future of finance, where decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment take center stage.

This level often acts as a crucial support or resistance zone, dictating the next major price direction. A breakout above it could fuel a fresh bullish rally, while rejection might lead to renewed downside pressure. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, anticipation is whether buyers gather enough strength to push past this critical threshold, or will sellers step in to stall the momentum. As UNI tests this key technical level, the outcome could shape its short-term trajectory and provide insights into the broader market trend. Uniswap Current Price Action: A Closer Look Uniswap price is steadily advancing, nearing a key moving average that could determine its next major move. After experiencing fluctuations in recent sessions, UNI has found renewed bullish momentum, pushing toward this critical technical level. The price action suggests growing buyer confidence, but resistance remains a key obstacle to short-term rallies. Related Reading: Uniswap Bleeds 20%—Is This Whale Behind The Drop? Technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are flashing bullish signals, suggesting that Uniswap may be gearing up for a breakout. The MACD has crossed above the signal line and has risen above average. If this trend continues, it may confirm increasing buying pressure and set the stage for a strong breakout. Trading volume has also increased, indicating heightened interest from both bulls and bears. A decisive push above the moving average could reinforce positive sentiment toward the upside. Conversely, a rejection at this level might signal weakness, inviting renewed selling pressure and a possible retracement. Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios: What’s At Stake? As Uniswap approaches a key moving average, the battle between bulls and bears has intensified, with both sides eyeing a decisive move. The outcome of this price action hints at a short-term uptrend, making this a crucial turning point. Related Reading: Uniswap Price Surges Past $10 — Bullish Pattern Suggests Further 30% Gain If UNI manages above the 100-day SMA with strong volume, bullish momentum will be renewed. A confirmed breakout may encourage more buyers to enter the market, driving the price toward the $6.7 resistance level. A surge past this key resistance could set Uniswap on track for a sustained uptrend to the $8.7 mark. On the other hand, if UNI fails to hold above the 100-day moving average and faces rejection, bearish pressure could increase. Profit-taking and renewed selling are likely to push prices lower to $5.5 with a failed breakout attempt. Should this key support level fail to hold, a deeper retracement would come into play, leading to a loss of momentum.

The firm’s executive maintained that the Ledger team was knowledgeable about and concerned about security in the aftermath of Bybit. He argued that security was not static but constantly evolving. Gauthier cautions about security vulnerabilities in crypto companies Security isn’t an option. It’s a necessity. — Ledger (@Ledger) March 18, 2025 Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier revealed that companies reached out to him after the Bybit hack last month, looking to solve “security vulnerabilities.” Gauthier explained that the institutions also reached out while looking to de-risk since Ledger can offer them that. Gauthier noted that security vulnerabilities were emerging at an alarming rate, and attackers were exploiting them rapidly. He also highlighted his displeasure with how organizations typically took months to implement fixes. The Chairman of Ledger argued that any trusted partner in the crypto space will continuously look for any vulnerabilities in their products to give customers peace of mind. He said the crypto industry as a whole needed to raise its security standards. Gauthier also warned institutional investors against using retail-grade products. He urged them to start the right way with “true enterprise-grade self-custody that has a governance layer.” “Likewise, financial institutions must make tamper-resistant hardware, like Secure Element chips or enterprise-grade systems, the foundations of any security strategy, while implementing comprehensive encryption and clear transaction signing protocols to prevent sophisticated attacks.” -Pascal Gauthier, Ledger Chairman and CEO He maintained that protecting investors should be the highest priority in the crypto industry moving forward. Gauthier believes that the crypto community must be patient to see whether the industry can adapt to new security needs. The company’s executive argued that security wasn’t the best conversation, but it showed a level of maturity in the industry that wasn’t even present at DAS London last year. He believes that the industry had left the more hypothetical stage and entered the planning stage since conversations were evolving to the point of discussing what was actually viable. Guillemet calls for security advancements in the crypto space Crypto industry expert ZachXBT highlighted in a Telegram message yesterday that the time spent freezing funds after the Bybit hack had been “eye-opening.” He also said that the industry was “unbelievably cooked when it comes to exploits/hacks.” ZackXBT argued that he was unsure if the industry would fix itself unless the government forcibly passed regulations that might hurt the entire industry. Ledger’s chief technology officer, Charles Guillemet, mentioned in February after the Bybit hack that 2025 was “the worst year for cybercrime in history.” Guillemet argued that the incident highlighted the need for the industry to move beyond trust-based security models as attackers become more sophisticated. He also acknowledged that the notable evolution was the shift toward enterprise-grade security solutions that combine Clear Signing with robust governance frameworks. Guillemet believes that attackers such as the North Korean group Lazarus linked to the Bybit attack were evolving, and the industry’s current security measures must also evolve. He urged that the crypto industry needed proactive security infrastructure that would eliminate vulnerabilities like blind signing. Ledger’s CTO also expressed concern that the Bybit hack was not the end of Lazarus’s targeting of the company. He argued that Bybit’s machines and networks were probably compromised, and the attackers were still at work attempting a lateral move to compromise other parts of the firm’s IT. Ledger was also a victim of a cyber attack in 2023 after a former employee was phished and gave attackers access to the firm’s package manager. The company said that the attackers stole roughly $600,000 from users, which was a smaller number than the $1.4 billion that Bybit suffered. The phishing scheme led to Ledger removing the blind signing ability back in June of last year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a recent interview, Garlinghouse addressed why XRP was not explicitly mentioned in a recent executive order regarding the U.S. government’s digital asset stockpile. He pointed to a post by President Trump on Truth Social that suggested creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a broader crypto stockpile encompassing other digital assets. While XRP was not mentioned by name in the executive order, Garlinghouse believes it would be part of a broader initiative. “My understanding is that there will be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto stockpile representing other cryptos. I would expect that to include XRP,” he said. Garlinghouse also noted the shift in regulatory stances under the current administration, comparing it to the Biden administration, which Ripple claims has failed to secure meetings with White House officials, noting that the current administration is more open to discussions regarding cryptocurrency regulation and industry development. Related News: JUST IN: SEC- Is Ripple Case Coming to an End! Ripple CEO Explained! XRP Price Started to Rise! In addition to the cryptocurrency stock speculation, Garlinghouse expressed strong confidence that an XRP ETF will be approved in the U.S. this year. He said the number of ETF applications pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing, including applications from major financial firms such as Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. He also noted that while some crypto ETFs have seen outflows, XRP-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) in international markets have seen increased inflows. He attributed this to the decline in negative pressure from the SEC’s legal actions against Ripple, noting that previous regulatory hurdles artificially suppressed market interest in XRP. Responding to questions about the potential inclusion of XRP in the U.S. crypto stockpile, Garlinghouse suggested that seized coins could play a role. “As I understand it, the stockpile will be represented by cryptocurrencies seized other than Bitcoin. Various law enforcement agencies have seized cryptocurrencies, including XRP, and these will go into the stockpile along with the Bitcoin strategic reserve,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The winds of economic policy are shifting, and the latest announcement from the Federal Reserve (Fed) could ripple through the crypto market. The Fed, in its recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, signaled a change in its approach to tapering its asset purchases. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader economic landscape? Let’s dive deep into the Fed’s decision and uncover the potential implications. Decoding the Fed’s Cautious Stance on Fed Tapering The Fed has decided to adjust the pace of Fed tapering starting in April. Instead of aggressively reducing its asset purchases, the central bank is opting for a more gradual approach. This decision is primarily driven by increasing economic uncertainty . But what exactly does ‘tapering’ mean, and why is the pace adjustment significant? Essentially, tapering refers to the gradual reduction of the Fed’s quantitative easing (QE) program, where it buys bonds to inject liquidity into the market and keep interest rates low. Slowing down the tapering pace indicates a more cautious approach by the Fed, signaling concerns about the economic outlook. Key Takeaways from the FOMC Announcement: Slower Tapering: The Fed will reduce the pace of asset purchase reductions starting in April. Rate Hike Support: The Fed remains committed to maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate, suggesting potential future interest rate hikes. Revised Economic Outlook: The Fed has adjusted its economic projections for 2025, indicating a more tempered outlook. Why Economic Uncertainty is Driving the Fed’s Decision The Fed explicitly cited “increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook” as the primary reason for slowing down the tapering pace. Several factors could be contributing to this uncertainty: Geopolitical Instability: Global events can create economic volatility and impact supply chains, inflation, and overall economic growth. Inflationary Pressures: While the Fed is aiming to combat inflation, aggressive tapering could potentially stifle economic growth. The current inflation outlook remains a key concern. GDP Growth Concerns: The Fed has lowered its GDP growth outlook for 2025 from 2.1% to 1.7%, indicating a less optimistic view of future economic expansion. Unemployment Rate: While still low, the Fed has slightly raised its unemployment outlook, suggesting potential concerns about labor market strength. Decoding the Revised Inflation Outlook and its Crypto Connection The Fed’s revised inflation outlook is particularly noteworthy. They have raised their PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation outlook for 2025 from 2.5% to 2.7%. While seemingly a small increase, it signals persistent inflationary pressures that the Fed is grappling with. How does this tie into the crypto market ? Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have often been viewed as a hedge against inflation. In an environment of rising inflation, investors may seek alternative assets like crypto to preserve purchasing power. Therefore, a higher inflation outlook, even if modest, could potentially bolster interest in the crypto market. Inflation Outlook – Key Changes: Metric Previous Outlook (2025) Revised Outlook (2025) GDP Growth 2.1% 1.7% Unemployment 4.3% 4.4% PCE Inflation 2.5% 2.7% Interest Rates and the Crypto Market: A Delicate Balance The Fed’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate while slowing tapering creates a complex scenario for interest rates and the crypto market. While the Fed is not aggressively raising rates immediately, the commitment to the current target range suggests future rate hikes are still on the table. Higher interest rates generally make traditional investments like bonds more attractive, potentially reducing the appeal of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the slower tapering pace could also be interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be less aggressive in raising rates than initially anticipated, which could be seen as positive for the crypto market in the medium term. Impact on Crypto Market – Potential Scenarios: Short-Term: Initial market reaction might be muted due to the cautious approach. However, any perceived dovishness could provide some short-term relief to crypto prices. Medium-Term: The interplay between inflation concerns and interest rate hikes will be crucial. If inflation persists, crypto’s appeal as an inflation hedge could strengthen. However, aggressive future rate hikes could still exert downward pressure. Long-Term: The overall economic health and the Fed’s ability to manage inflation and growth will dictate the long-term trajectory of both traditional and crypto markets. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in light of the Fed’s cautious tapering and the prevailing economic uncertainty ? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases, Fed announcements, and geopolitical developments. Understanding the evolving economic landscape is crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification across different asset classes, including crypto, can help mitigate risk in uncertain times. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your crypto portfolio accordingly. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and economic uncertainty can amplify it. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Seek Expert Advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands both traditional and crypto markets to create a tailored investment strategy. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Forward The Fed’s decision to adjust the pace of tapering reflects a cautious approach amidst growing economic uncertainty . The revised inflation outlook and the delicate balance between managing inflation and supporting economic growth will continue to shape the financial landscape, including the crypto market . For crypto investors, navigating this environment requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. The Fed’s actions are a crucial piece of the puzzle, but understanding the broader economic context is key to thriving in the evolving world of crypto.

This statement has sent ripples across traditional markets and, notably, the cryptocurrency sphere, leaving investors and analysts alike pondering the potential ramifications. Are we entering an era of unpredictable economic tides? Let’s delve into Powell’s comments and what they might signify for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Powell’s Uncertainty on Inflation Impact During a press conference following the latest FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell articulated the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on the inflation impact stemming from current tariff policies. His words, while measured, conveyed a clear message: the future is less certain than previously anticipated. Here’s a breakdown of Powell’s key points: Early Stages of Assessment: Powell emphasized that it is “too early to make a comment” on the definitive inflation impact of tariffs. This suggests the Fed is still in the initial phases of analyzing the economic data and gauging the long-term effects. Price Increases Observed: He acknowledged that “prices have risen to some extent,” hinting at the potential inflationary pressures already at play. However, he stopped short of directly attributing these increases solely to tariffs. No Clear Policy Signal Yet: Powell stated he doesn’t believe there’s been a definitive “policy signal related to tariffs yet.” This implies a level of ambiguity and potential future policy adjustments depending on how the situation unfolds. Temporary Inflation Tolerance: He subtly suggested that “sometimes it’s appropriate not to worry about temporary inflation,” indicating a possible tolerance for short-term price fluctuations as the economy adjusts. These points collectively paint a picture of a central bank grappling with new variables in the economic equation. The uncertainty surrounding the inflation impact of tariffs is now a significant factor influencing market sentiment. Tariffs and the Crypto Market: A Tangled Web Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts pay close attention to tariff policies and central bank statements? The answer lies in the intricate relationship between macroeconomics and the crypto market . Here’s how tariffs and inflation can indirectly and directly influence digital assets: Factor Impact on Crypto Market Inflation Historically, some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been viewed as a hedge against inflation. Rising inflation could increase demand for these assets as investors seek alternatives to fiat currencies. Economic Uncertainty Tariffs can contribute to broader economic uncertainty, leading investors to diversify into assets perceived as less correlated with traditional markets, potentially benefiting the crypto market . Dollar Strength Tariff policies and inflation expectations can influence the strength of the US dollar. A weaker dollar could make dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies more attractive to international investors. Risk Appetite Uncertainty stemming from tariff disputes can dampen overall risk appetite in financial markets. This could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market as investors adjust their portfolios. Powell’s cautious remarks regarding the inflation impact of tariffs inject an additional layer of complexity into this already intricate web. The lack of clear predictions from the Fed adds to the ambiguity, potentially leading to increased market fluctuations. Jerome Powell’s Words: A Double-Edged Sword for Crypto? Jerome Powell’s statements can be interpreted in various ways by the crypto market . On one hand, uncertainty can breed volatility, which some crypto traders thrive on. On the other hand, prolonged economic ambiguity can deter institutional investment and dampen overall market sentiment. Here are potential scenarios: Scenario 1: Inflation Surges Unpredictably: If tariffs do lead to a significant and unforeseen surge in inflation, as Powell suggests is hard to predict, we could see a flight to perceived safe-haven assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Scenario 2: Fed Reacts Aggressively: Faced with rising inflation, the Federal Reserve might adopt a more aggressive monetary policy, potentially raising interest rates more sharply than anticipated. This could negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the short term. Scenario 3: Temporary Inflation and Market Correction: If the inflation impact remains temporary, as Powell hinted might be acceptable, the market could experience a period of adjustment and correction as it recalibrates to the new economic data. Navigating these scenarios requires a nuanced understanding of both macroeconomic factors and the specific dynamics of the cryptocurrency space. Powell’s acknowledgement of the unpredictable nature of tariff-induced inflation adds a layer of complexity that investors must consider. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Crypto Investor’s Action Plan Given the uncertain inflation impact of tariffs and the resulting market ambiguity highlighted by Jerome Powell, what steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic news, especially updates on tariff policies, inflation data, and Federal Reserve statements. Reliable news sources and economic calendars are crucial tools. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Consider diversifying across different types of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets to mitigate the impact of market volatility. Risk Management Strategies: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital during periods of uncertainty. Long-Term Perspective: Maintain a long-term perspective. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and short-term fluctuations driven by macroeconomic news are part of the landscape. Focus on the long-term potential of your chosen crypto assets. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to navigate these complex economic conditions, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. By staying informed, proactive, and adopting a balanced approach, crypto investors can navigate the current economic climate effectively, even amidst the uncertainties flagged by Jerome Powell regarding tariffs and inflation impact . Conclusion: Embracing Uncertainty in the Crypto Sphere Jerome Powell’s candid acknowledgment of the difficulty in predicting the inflation impact of tariffs has injected a dose of realism into market expectations. For the cryptocurrency market, this translates to heightened uncertainty and potential volatility. However, within uncertainty lies opportunity. By understanding the potential macroeconomic forces at play, staying informed, and employing prudent risk management strategies, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for long-term success. The key takeaway is to embrace the uncertainty, adapt to the evolving economic landscape, and remain vigilant in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

According to Santiment, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is “signaling a potential turning point once crypto markets stabilize” as the number of wallets increases. “Dogecoin, like most meme coins, has been hammered during the two-month crypto-wide retrace. However, we recommend keeping an eye on the rising level of wallets holding at least one million DOGE, which has recovered during the price dump. Active addresses are also at four-month highs.” Santiment says that the number of Dogecoin wallets holding over one million DOGE has surged by over 1% since the start of February. In March, the largest memecoin by market cap has also recorded spikes in address activity, with the number rising to more than 150,000 active addresses per day severally. Source: Santiment/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.166 at time of writing, down by about 62% from the 2025 high of around $0.434. Turning to development activity among the leading crypto projects, Santiment says there has been a decline in the number of contributors over the past month. “And if we switch the perspective and zoom in to just the past one month, it’s a bit discouraging to see that every ecosystem in the top 10 has taken their foot off of the gas. Development activity events have declined across the board, with only Cosmos and Solana seeing a rise in contributors.” Source: Santiment Over the past six months, Santiment says the only ecosystem that has recorded a rise in the number of contributors is the layer-2 scaling solution Optimism ( OP ).

The Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock is set to release 92.65 million ARB tokens, sparking debates on how the added supply might affect its price. Meanwhile, Celestia (TIA) price analysis points to a potential market shift, as key support levels hold and signs of a reversal emerge. As traders monitor these developments, developers have their eyes on BlockDAG (BDAG) for a different reason. After raising $204 million in its presale, the project is set to launch a global hackathon series, drawing top developers to expand its ecosystem through new blockchain applications. As one of the top crypto coins, BlockDAG is creating opportunities for builders to shape the future of Web3. Arbitrum (ARB) Token Unlock Set for March—What It Means for Investors Arbitrum is preparing for a significant event as 92.65 million ARB tokens are set to be unlocked on March 16, 2025. This Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock, valued at approximately $30.75 million, accounts for 2.1% of the circulating supply. Token unlocks, designed to gradually release vested allocations, can introduce selling pressure, often influencing price movements. In response, Offchain Labs has announced a buyback initiative aimed at absorbing some of the newly available supply. While this effort signals confidence in the project’s long-term stability, analysts remain divided on its effectiveness in counteracting potential downward price trends tied to the Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis: Is the Correction Phase Ending? After a prolonged correction, Celestia (TIA) price analysis suggests that the asset may be forming a base near the $2.67–$3.14 demand zone. This level aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels and has historically supported price rebounds. The daily chart reflects early signs of a trend shift, with an impulsive five-wave structure forming. A breakout above $5.65 could confirm a reversal, while failure to hold the current range may lead to further downside. As market sentiment remains uncertain, Celestia (TIA) price analysis highlights critical levels traders are watching for potential bullish momentum or continued consolidation. Fierce Competition for BlockDAG Hackathon Spots as Developers Rush to Sign Up BlockDAG’s momentum is impossible to ignore. Raising over $204 million and selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, the project has already attracted a strong community of 170,000+ holders. The BDAG coin’s value has surged by 2,380%, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 since its first presale batch. Now, the focus shifts to innovation. In collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG is rolling out a global hackathon series, inviting developers to build projects that will expand its ecosystem. These events aren’t just about competition—they offer a real chance to contribute to blockchain’s next phase. But what’s in it for ethical hackers and devs? Those entering the series gain direct access to BDAG rewards, industry connections, and opportunities to integrate with the BlockDAG network. Expectations are high, with 200+ new projects expected to emerge, backed by one of the largest developer communities. The demand for fresh ideas is growing, and BlockDAG is becoming a recognised name among top crypto coins as more builders bring their concepts to life. Joining the initiative is straightforward, but the seats are limited. Registration is available on HackerEarth , where upcoming hackathons are listed. Participants can enter online or in-person events, developing blockchain solutions alongside other skilled teams. Top-performing projects secure funding, prizes, and the opportunity to scale their ideas within the expanding BlockDAG ecosystem. The Bottom Line The Arbitrum (ARB) token unlock will test the market’s ability to absorb new supply, with its long-term impact hinging on investor sentiment and Offchain Labs’ intervention. The Celestia (TIA) price analysis points to a potential turnaround, but sustained recovery depends on breaking resistance and regaining momentum. While traders await these shifts, BlockDAG is moving full steam ahead. With more than $204 million raised and its upcoming global hackathon series attracting top developers, the project is turning momentum into action. Limited spots are driving intense competition, and as developers rush to join, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just another name among top crypto coins—it’s becoming a movement.

42014211,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141665,1742428862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Dubai Real Estate: Tokenization Pilot Targets $16 Billion Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dubai-real-estate-tokenization-pilot/,"Dubai, a city synonymous with innovation and futuristic visions, is once again making headlines in the global investment landscape. This time, it’s not about towering skyscrapers or luxury resorts, but about transforming the very foundation of property ownership. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has officially launched a groundbreaking pilot project focusing on real estate tokenization . Imagine owning a fraction of a prime Dubai property with the ease of trading cryptocurrency – that’s the future Dubai is building, powered by blockchain technology. What is Real Estate Tokenization and Why Dubai? Real estate tokenization is essentially the process of converting rights to a property into digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating digital shares for real estate assets. Instead of cumbersome paperwork and lengthy processes, property ownership becomes fractionalized, easily transferable, and more accessible to a wider range of investors. Why is Dubai the perfect place for this innovation? Innovation Hub: Dubai’s commitment to embracing cutting-edge technologies is well-established. From smart city initiatives to pro-crypto regulations, Dubai is a fertile ground for blockchain advancements. Investment Magnet: Dubai’s real estate investment market is globally renowned. Tokenization can further enhance its appeal by lowering entry barriers and increasing liquidity. Government Support: The DLD, along with VARA (Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) and DFF (Dubai Future Foundation), are actively collaborating on this pilot, signaling strong governmental backing. Unlocking the Potential of Blockchain in Dubai Real Estate The core technology behind this pilot is, of course, blockchain. But how does blockchain real estate tokenization actually work and what are the game-changing benefits? How it Works: Property Valuation and Legal Framework: The process begins with a thorough valuation of the property and establishing a clear legal framework for tokenization under Dubai law. Token Creation: Digital tokens, representing fractional ownership, are created on a secure blockchain platform. Each token’s ownership and transaction history is transparently and immutably recorded. Digital Marketplace: A platform or marketplace is established where these tokenized real estate assets can be bought, sold, and traded, much like cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts automate processes like rent distribution, voting rights for fractional owners, and other governance aspects, ensuring transparency and efficiency. Key Benefits: Benefit Description Increased Accessibility Fractional ownership lowers the barrier to entry, allowing smaller investors to participate in Dubai’s lucrative property market. Enhanced Liquidity Tokenized assets are easier to trade than traditional real estate, offering quicker and more efficient buying and selling processes. Greater Transparency Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides clear records of ownership and transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust. Reduced Costs Streamlined processes and automation through smart contracts can significantly reduce transaction costs associated with traditional real estate deals. Global Investment Reach Tokenization can attract a global pool of investors, as digital tokens can be traded across borders more easily than physical properties. Dubai’s Ambitious Vision: $16 Billion Tokenized Real Estate Market The Dubai Land Department isn’t just testing the waters; they are projecting significant growth for the tokenized real estate sector. Their estimate that tokenized properties could constitute 7% of all real estate transactions by 2033, translating to a staggering $16 billion market, showcases their confidence in this innovative approach. This projection underscores Dubai’s ambition to become a global leader in digital real estate and solidify its position as a future-forward investment destination. This ambitious target is not just a pie-in-the-sky dream. Several factors support this optimistic outlook: Growing Investor Appetite: The increasing global interest in digital assets and fractional ownership models fuels the demand for tokenized real estate. Dubai’s Regulatory Environment: Dubai’s proactive and supportive regulatory framework for virtual assets, spearheaded by VARA, provides a safe and conducive environment for blockchain real estate innovation. Technological Advancements: Continued advancements in blockchain technology and the development of user-friendly platforms are making tokenization more practical and accessible. Challenges and Considerations for Real Estate Tokenization While the potential of real estate tokenization is immense, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed for successful widespread adoption: Regulatory Clarity: While Dubai is taking a proactive approach, consistent and clear regulations across different jurisdictions are crucial for global scalability. Issues like taxation, legal recognition of tokenized ownership, and investor protection need careful consideration. Security and Custody: Ensuring the security of blockchain platforms and the safe custody of digital tokens is paramount to prevent fraud and protect investors’ assets. Education and Adoption: Widespread adoption requires educating both real estate professionals and investors about the benefits and mechanics of tokenization. Overcoming skepticism and fostering trust in this new technology is essential. Valuation and Liquidity in Early Stages: Establishing robust and transparent valuation mechanisms for tokenized properties and ensuring sufficient liquidity in the initial stages of market development are crucial for investor confidence. Actionable Insights: Is Tokenized Real Estate Right for You? The Dubai real estate investment tokenization pilot presents exciting opportunities for both seasoned and new investors. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Investors: Diversification: Explore tokenized real estate as a way to diversify your investment portfolio and gain exposure to the Dubai property market with smaller capital outlays. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the platforms and projects offering tokenized real estate . Understand the legal framework, security measures, and the underlying property assets. Start Small: Begin with smaller investments to familiarize yourself with the process and assess the risks and rewards before committing larger sums. For Real Estate Professionals: Embrace Education: Educate yourself about real estate tokenization and its potential impact on the industry. Understand how it can create new business models and attract a wider client base. Explore Partnerships: Consider partnering with technology providers and platforms specializing in tokenization to explore pilot projects and stay ahead of the curve. Adapt to Change: Be prepared to adapt your business practices to incorporate digital assets and blockchain technology as tokenization gains traction. Conclusion: Dubai Leading the Charge in Digital Real Estate Revolution Dubai’s pilot project for real estate tokenization is more than just a technological experiment; it’s a bold step towards revolutionizing the future of property ownership and investment. By leveraging the power of blockchain, Dubai is poised to unlock new levels of accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in its already vibrant real estate market. The projected $16 billion market by 2033 is a testament to the transformative potential of this innovation. As Dubai continues to pioneer in this space, the world will be watching closely, learning from its journey into the exciting realm of digital real estate.

The decision to maintain the current interest rate was unanimous among Fed officials. However, a point of disagreement arose regarding the pace of balance sheet reduction. Fed member Christopher Waller opposed any slowdown in the balance sheet reduction process and wanted to continue at the current pace of reduction. Josh Jamner, senior investment analyst at Clearbridge, said the Fed’s economic forecasts point to a more challenging economic environment for 2024. “Policymakers are predicting a moderate economic slowdown with rising inflation and unemployment,” Jamner said. “However, these forecasts are consistent with recent estimates from Wall Street banks and macroeconomic research organizations. Therefore, we do not expect these revisions to have a significant impact on financial markets.” Jamner also noted that the Fed’s policies could eventually lag behind fiscal policy. Market pricing in federal funds futures suggests the next rate cut isn’t expected until July, and that outlook is unlikely to change in the near term. Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)? What Price Level Needs to be Breached for a Big Rally to Come? Whitney Watson, global co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, noted the Fed’s cautious stance, describing the latest meeting as a “wait-and-see” approach. “The revisions to the FOMC’s forecasts carry a hint of stagflation, with economic growth and inflation expectations moving in opposite directions,” Watson said. The Fed is expected to observe whether the current slowdown in economic activity turns into a more significant problem before making any policy changes. Michele Raneri, Transunio’s Vice President and Head of US Research and Consulting, said that while the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was relatively optimistic, the market is not expecting an immediate rate cut. However, upcoming labor market data could influence future decisions. “Despite the Fed’s current stance, the possibility of a rate cut later this year remains, and multiple cuts could occur in 2025,” Raneri said. “If interest rates start to fall, consumers may be more inclined to use credit products that they have avoided in recent years, such as mortgage refinancing and auto loans. A more favorable credit environment could encourage new borrowing activity and support consumer confidence.” *This is not investment advice.

The live price of UNI now stands at $7.01, with a trading volume of approximately $292 million. The price increase reflects growing optimism among investors as the long-discussed “fee switch” initiative moves closer to activation. Additionally, the open interest in UNI derivatives has seen a significant rise, marking a 17.69% increase, reaching $196.96 million. Uniswap Foundation Secures Funding for Ecosystem Growth The Uniswap community has voted in favor of two governance proposals that allocate $165.5 million in funding. This capital will help support the growth of the Uniswap ecosystem following the launch of Uniswap v4 and the Unichain Layer 2 network. Of this amount, $95.4 million will be directed towards the Uniswap Foundation’s grants budget, and $45 million will be set aside for liquidity incentives. The remaining $25.1 million will go towards operational costs for the next two years. The Uniswap Foundation is an independent non-profit organization responsible for overseeing the growth of the protocol. The decision to allocate substantial funds to ecosystem development is aimed at increasing the network’s scalability and creating new opportunities for growth. The foundation’s long-term goal is to transition Uniswap from a decentralized exchange into a platform that can also cater to developers and bring significant value to the Uniswap community. Liquidity Incentives to Support Uniswap v4 and Unichain Growth Part of the funding will be used to establish liquidity incentives for the newly launched Uniswap v4 and Unichain platforms. Gauntlet, a Web3 risk management protocol, will manage these incentives to draw in new users and maintain growth across both networks. The proposal also includes developer-focused campaigns designed to sustain ecosystem expansion and encourage further participation from the broader community. Uniswap v4, launched in mid-January 2025 , introduced the concept of “hooks” or contracts that allow developers to customize interactions within pools, swaps, and fees. The launch of Unichain, built on the Optimism tech stack, further enhances Uniswap’s scalability by providing a Layer 2 network that can support more transactions at lower fees. Fee Switch Moves Closer to Reality, Potentially Reshaping Revenue Distribution One of the most significant aspects of the governance decision is the advancement of the long-awaited “fee switch.” This would direct a portion of protocol fees, currently earned by liquidity providers, towards UNI token holders. This change has been eagerly awaited by the community, as earlier proposals to activate the fee switch were unsuccessful. The Uniswap Foundation has stated that it will now proceed with the necessary legal steps to activate this switch. Subsequently, the Uniswap fee switch would enable UNI token holders to earn protocol revenue, which has been a major topic of discussion within the community. Over $1 billion in annualized fees have been generated by the Uniswap protocol, and this shift would allow token holders to capture a portion of that revenue. The activation of the fee switch represents a significant step in Uniswap’s ongoing efforts to align the interests of its governance members with the protocol’s long-term success.

Recent statements from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have offered a potentially reassuring market outlook , directly impacting investor sentiment and, consequently, the crypto sphere. Let’s dive into Powell’s perspective on the looming specter of recession and what it could mean for your digital assets. Is a Recession Really Unlikely? Powell’s Perspective on the US Economy Following the latest FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell addressed concerns about a potential recession in the United States. While acknowledging that some experts are forecasting economic downturn, Powell presented a contrasting view, suggesting that a recession is not the most probable scenario. He emphasized the underlying strength of the US economy , pointing to key factors that support his outlook. Here’s a breakdown of Powell’s key arguments: Strong Labor Market: Powell highlighted the robust labor market as a significant buffer against recession . Unemployment rates remain low, and job creation continues, indicating a healthy economic engine. Resilient Consumer Spending: Consumer spending, a major driver of the US economy , has shown resilience despite inflation. This suggests continued economic activity and demand. Banking System Stability: Powell reassured that the U.S. banking system is sound and well-capitalized, reducing systemic risks that could trigger or exacerbate a recession . Inflation Moderation: While acknowledging that inflation is still too high, Powell indicated that there are signs of moderation, suggesting that the Fed’s monetary policy is beginning to have the desired effect. Expert Views vs. Fed’s Confidence: Decoding the Market Outlook It’s crucial to understand that Powell’s optimistic stance on the market outlook is not universally shared. Several economic experts and analysts have voiced concerns about potential recession triggers. These concerns often stem from: Aggressive Interest Rate Hikes: The Federal Reserve’s own strategy to combat inflation involves raising interest rates. While intended to cool down the economy, aggressive hikes can also stifle growth and potentially induce a recession . Global Economic Slowdown: Global economic headwinds, including geopolitical instability and slower growth in major economies, can impact the US economy and increase recession risks. Lag Effect of Monetary Policy: The full impact of interest rate hikes on the US economy can take time to materialize. Some experts believe the negative effects of past rate increases are yet to be fully felt, increasing the likelihood of a future recession . The differing opinions create uncertainty in the market outlook . Investors are left to weigh the Fed’s confidence against expert skepticism, leading to market volatility, especially in the inherently sensitive cryptocurrency market. Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve’s Stance: What Does It Mean for Crypto? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and Jerome Powell’s pronouncements have a significant ripple effect across all financial markets, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Here’s how Powell’s current stance and the broader Federal Reserve policy can influence crypto: Interest Rates and Risk Appetite: Higher interest rates, a tool of the Federal Reserve , generally reduce investors’ appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a pause or potential reversal in rate hikes, if inflation is tamed without triggering a recession , could boost crypto markets. Dollar Strength and Crypto Valuations: Federal Reserve policies impact the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, as crypto is often priced against the dollar. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While the effectiveness of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges is debated, persistent inflation, even if not leading to a full-blown recession , can strengthen the narrative for crypto as an alternative asset class. Regulatory Landscape: The overall economic climate and the Federal Reserve ‘s actions can indirectly influence the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies. Economic instability might lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, while a stable US economy could foster a more balanced regulatory environment. Navigating the Uncertain Economic Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the contrasting views on the US economy and the possibility of a recession , what should crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, and expert analyses of the market outlook . Knowledge is your best defense in volatile times. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including but not limited to crypto, can help mitigate risk. Risk Management is Key: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your crypto portfolio accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of economic uncertainty, focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Projects with strong technology, real-world use cases, and solid teams are more likely to weather economic storms. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy, especially during periods of market volatility. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations, which can smooth out your entry point and reduce the impact of short-term market swings. Conclusion: Confidence Amidst Uncertainty Jerome Powell’s assertion that a recession is unlikely provides a degree of reassurance in an otherwise uncertain economic landscape. However, the divergence of opinions among experts underscores the complexity of the current market outlook . For cryptocurrency investors, navigating this environment requires vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced approach to risk. While Powell’s confidence offers a positive signal, prudent investment strategies remain crucial in the dynamic world of crypto.

BTC's rise rate in the last 24 hours was recorded as 4.39%. The general financial markets also responded positively to the Fed's decision, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all gaining over 1%. Addressing inflation concerns, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that tariff-related price increases were expected to be temporary and that recession risks remained low. Despite the initial market optimism, some analysts remain cautious. Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian said Powell’s use of the term “temporary” to describe the inflationary effects was reminiscent of past policy missteps. “The word ‘temporary’ has returned to the Fed, with Chairman Powell characterizing the price effects of tariffs as a one-off,” El-Erian said. “It is too early to say with any confidence decline that the inflationary effects will be temporary.” Related News: What's the Latest on Solana (SOL)?

Coinbase International Exchange has just dropped some thrilling news that’s set to excite traders. If you’re into futures trading and have been looking for more flexibility and options, you’re in for a treat. Coinbase, a leading name in the cryptocurrency world, is now accepting Cardano’s ADA and Coinbase Wrapped ETH (cbETH) as collateral for Coinbase Futures Trading . This move is a significant leap forward, offering users enhanced opportunities to engage in perpetual futures trading with leverage. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto market. Unlocking New Potential: ADA and cbETH Join the Coinbase Futures Trading Collateral List Coinbase International Exchange made the official announcement via X, confirming that both ADA and cbETH are now live as collateral options. This expansion is available on both Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, catering to a wide range of traders from beginners to seasoned professionals. What does this mean in simple terms? If you hold ADA or cbETH, you can now use these assets to open and maintain positions in perpetual futures contracts. This opens up exciting avenues for leveraging your holdings and participating more actively in the derivatives market. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this update brings to the table: Increased Flexibility: Traders are no longer limited to traditional collateral options like USD or major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The inclusion of ADA and cbETH provides greater flexibility in managing their portfolios and accessing Coinbase Futures Trading . Leverage Opportunities: By using ADA and cbETH as collateral, users can amplify their trading positions through leverage. This means you can control larger positions with a smaller amount of your own capital, potentially magnifying both profits and losses. Expanded Asset Utility: This move increases the utility of both ADA and cbETH. Holders of these assets can now utilize them not just for spot trading or staking but also for engaging in sophisticated derivatives trading strategies on Coinbase Futures Trading platforms. Wider Market Participation: The addition of popular altcoins like ADA and cbETH as collateral could attract a broader range of traders to Coinbase’s derivatives exchange, further enhancing market liquidity and dynamism. Why is this a Big Deal for Coinbase Futures Trading and the Crypto Community? This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic move by Coinbase with several significant implications: Catering to Diverse Crypto Preferences: Coinbase is recognizing the growing diversity within the crypto market. By adding ADA and cbETH, they are acknowledging the strong communities and market capitalizations behind these assets. This inclusivity is likely to attract users who are primarily invested in these ecosystems. Enhancing Coinbase’s Derivatives Platform: In the competitive landscape of crypto exchanges, offering a wider range of collateral options is a key differentiator. This move strengthens Coinbase International Exchange’s appeal as a go-to platform for crypto derivatives trading. Driving Adoption of ADA and cbETH: Being accepted as collateral on a major exchange like Coinbase enhances the legitimacy and utility of ADA and cbETH. This could potentially drive further adoption and demand for these assets within the broader crypto ecosystem. Boosting Trading Volumes: More collateral options typically lead to increased trading activity. As users leverage their ADA and cbETH holdings for futures trading, we can anticipate a potential surge in trading volumes on Coinbase International Exchange. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Potential Challenges of ADA and cbETH Collateral Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this exciting development: Benefits: Diversification of Collateral: Traders are no longer restricted to using only Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. This diversification can be beneficial for risk management and portfolio optimization in crypto derivatives trading. Unlock Value from Altcoin Holdings: Users who hold significant amounts of ADA or cbETH can now put these assets to work in futures trading without needing to convert them to other cryptocurrencies or fiat. Potential for Higher Returns: Leveraged trading, facilitated by ADA and cbETH collateral, offers the potential for amplified returns compared to spot trading, although it also comes with increased risk. Seamless Integration within Coinbase Ecosystem: For users already familiar with the Coinbase platform, this integration provides a seamless and convenient way to access futures trading using their preferred assets. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: ADA and cbETH, like most cryptocurrencies, can be volatile. Using them as collateral means that fluctuations in their prices can impact your margin and potentially lead to liquidation if not managed carefully. Traders need to be acutely aware of market risks when engaging in leveraged trading with these assets. Complexity of Derivatives Trading: Futures trading, especially with leverage, is inherently complex and carries significant risks. New users need to educate themselves thoroughly about the mechanics of futures contracts, margin requirements, and liquidation risks before diving in. Regulatory Scrutiny: The derivatives market is often subject to regulatory scrutiny. As crypto derivatives become more mainstream, regulatory developments could impact platforms and users. It’s crucial to stay informed about the evolving regulatory landscape.

But what exactly does this mean, and why should the crypto community care? Let’s dive into this exciting development. Decoding the Nvidia Acquisition of Gretel: A Strategic Play Nvidia, the giant known for its powerful GPUs that are the backbone of both high-end gaming and complex AI computations, is making a bold move by acquiring Gretel. This San Diego-based startup isn’t your average tech company; Gretel focuses on something incredibly valuable in today’s AI landscape: synthetic data . Think of synthetic data as artificially created information that mimics real-world data. It’s used to train AI models when real data is scarce, sensitive, or biased. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Deal: Nvidia is reportedly acquiring Gretel for a nine-figure sum, exceeding Gretel’s last valuation of $320 million. Team Integration: Gretel’s team of around 80 employees will become part of Nvidia, bolstering their generative AI service offerings. Gretel’s Expertise: Founded in 2019, Gretel has developed a platform that fine-tunes AI models to generate high-quality synthetic data, addressing the growing need for AI training datasets. Why Synthetic Data is a Game Changer for AI Training The acquisition highlights the escalating importance of AI training data. As AI models become more sophisticated, they demand vast amounts of data to learn effectively. However, real-world data can be: Limited: In many niche areas, collecting enough real data is simply impossible. Expensive: Gathering and labeling real-world data can be incredibly costly and time-consuming. Privacy-Sensitive: Data often contains personal information, raising significant privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles. Biased: Real-world datasets can reflect and amplify existing societal biases, leading to skewed AI models. This is where synthetic data steps in as a powerful solution. By creating artificial datasets, Gretel’s technology can overcome these challenges, making AI training more accessible, efficient, and ethical. The Generative AI Revolution Fueled by Synthetic Data Generative AI , the technology behind groundbreaking applications like image and text generation, relies heavily on vast datasets. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft are already leveraging synthetic data to train their flagship AI models. As real-world data sources become exhausted, synthetic data is emerging as the next frontier for fueling the generative AI revolution. Consider these benefits of using synthetic data in generative AI: Benefit Description Scalability Generate virtually unlimited amounts of data on demand. Cost-Effectiveness Significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and labeling. Enhanced Privacy Synthetic data is inherently privacy-preserving as it doesn’t contain real personal information. Bias Mitigation Allows for the creation of balanced datasets, reducing bias in AI models. Nvidia and Data Privacy: A Forward-Thinking Approach For the crypto-savvy audience, data privacy is a paramount concern. Nvidia’s acquisition of Gretel signals a proactive stance on addressing privacy issues in AI development. Synthetic data offers a pathway to train powerful AI models without compromising individual privacy. This aligns with the core principles of decentralization and data control that resonate deeply within the cryptocurrency community. Imagine the implications for blockchain and decentralized AI projects: Secure AI Models: Train AI models for blockchain applications without exposing sensitive user data. Democratized AI: Enable smaller crypto projects to access high-quality training data, leveling the playing field in AI innovation. Compliance with Regulations: Navigate increasingly stringent data privacy regulations with ease. What’s Next? The Impact of the Nvidia Acquisition Nvidia integrating Gretel’s technology into its generative AI services suite could have far-reaching consequences. We can anticipate: Accelerated AI Development: Easier access to synthetic data will speed up the development and deployment of AI applications across industries. Innovation in Generative Models: Synthetic data can unlock new possibilities in generative AI, leading to more creative and versatile models. Enhanced Data Security: The focus on privacy-preserving synthetic data will drive advancements in secure AI practices. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this acquisition is a clear indicator of the growing importance of AI and the need for privacy-centric solutions. As Nvidia pushes forward with synthetic data, we can expect to see innovative applications emerge that bridge the gap between AI power and data privacy . Conclusion: A Strategic Move Towards an AI-Driven Future Nvidia’s acquisition of Gretel is more than just a business transaction; it’s a strategic investment in the future of AI. By embracing synthetic data, Nvidia is positioning itself at the forefront of a new era in AI development – one that prioritizes scalability, efficiency, and crucially, data privacy . This move has the potential to revolutionize how AI models are trained and deployed, impacting every sector from tech giants to emerging cryptocurrency projects. Keep a close watch on how this acquisition unfolds – it’s a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI and its integration with the decentralized world.

Yakovenko said he will use the learning experience to ensure Solana stays focused on open-source software development and decentralization while staying “out of cultural wars.” Source: Anatoly Yakovenko Solana hasn’t made an official comment on the matter, though its X account reshared Yakovenko’s post to its 3.3 million followers. Cointelegraph also reached out to the Solana Foundation shortly after the ad was taken down but didn’t receive a response. The two-and-a-half-minute ad for the Solana Accelerate conference showcased a man acting as America in a therapy session who said he was having thoughts “about innovation” such as crypto. The therapist responded that he should instead do “something more productive, like coming up with a new gender” and later said the man should “focus on pronouns.” The man snapped back, stating that he wanted “to invent technologies, not genders.” Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it. They rolled it back because it hurt… pic.twitter.com/kPMERDpTcn — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2025 The now-deleted ad came nine days after Solana’s X account posted: “Solana is for everyone.” Related: Solana rallies 8% as crypto markets recover — Is there room for more SOL upside? Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran pointed out that transgender people contribute to open-source software and cryptography in an “insanely disproportionate amount.” A GitHub survey from 2017 found that of the 5,500 randomly selected open-source developers, 1% were transgender, and another 1% were non-binary. Most data obtained during 2017 and 2018 suggest that transgender and non-binary people combined represented somewhere between 0.1% and 0.6% of the population.

Experts believe this is capable of thrusting up prices, with estimates pointing up to $5 target. This uptrend has escalated due to the recent ending of the Ripple vs SEC case that has had a massive impact on the XRP price. XRP Price Signals Bullish Momentum Amid Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Resolution After the news of the Ripple lawsuit conclusion, Analyst Dark Defender was quick to comment on how the Ripple token was affected. The crossing above the long-term descending trend is revealing the bulls’ forecasts. A strong green candlestick confirmed the breakout, signaling substantial buying pressure. With this movement, Fibonacci retracement levels suggest strong support for further gains. Analysts anticipate XRP price will move past $3.40 and $3.78 before reaching the $5 target. The momentum shift follows a prolonged consolidation phase, aligning with the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which has been ongoing for over five years. Source: X Market analysts have outlined an Elliott Wave structure projecting a continued XRP price increase. According to this analysis, the asset is in an impulsive wave pattern, which suggests further gains. The breakout from the trendline supports the projection of a strong bullish phase. The conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has eliminated a significant barrier that previously restrained XRP’s potential growth. Concerns Over Whale Accumulation and Leverage While the bullish outlook remains strong, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out concerns regarding the nature of the Ripple token rally. Data from Santiment suggests that large whale investors did not contribute to the price increase. The absence of substantial whale accumulation raises questions about the rally’s sustainability. Further analysis indicates that open interest in XRP futures increased by $200 million, signaling a surge driven by leverage rather than organic buying. When leverage dominates price movements, the market may experience heightened volatility, leading to potential corrections. Source: X Ripple Price Prediction The breakout above key resistance levels has sparked renewed interest in XRP price movements. Analysts remain optimistic about a potential climb toward $5, supported by technical indicators and the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. More so, a recent CoinGape report highlighted that the top altcoin might rally to $20 if the US SEC approves the pending 18 XRP ETF applications . This aligns with Amonyx’s prediction that institutional inflows from these ETFs could drive a parabolic surge in XRP’s price. At the timing of writing this report, the altcoin was trading at $2.51, reflecting a 9% increase in the past 24 hours. Additionally, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume surged by 178.83%, reaching $9.74 billion, indicating heightened market activity.

This shift in investment strategy has seen these investors reallocating funds into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. The project shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $4 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6100 investors while simultaneously raising funds. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback. MUTM could hit $3 to deliver 50x returns A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6100 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $3 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. A major Cardano (ADA) whale is offloading ADA, priced at $0.71, and shifting funds into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi project. Currently in Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02, MUTM has raised $4 million from 6100+ investors. The next phase will push the price to $0.025, with early buyers set for a 200% ROI at launch ($0.06). Analysts predict a surge past $3. Mutuum Finance is attracting smart money, with its dual-lending model, secure USD-backed stablecoin and staking rewards.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be dominant forces, newer altcoins are gaining attention for their advancements in blockchain efficiency, decentralized finance, and AI-powered applications. BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out among them, having raised over $203.9 million in its presale, with 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold at $0.0248. The upcoming listings on 10 major exchanges make it one of the most awaited launches of 2025. Other notable projects gaining traction include Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), and Filecoin (FIL). Below is an in-depth look at why these are among the best long-term cryptos to buy now. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem Raised over $203.9M BlockDAG (BDAG) brings an advanced Layer-1 solution that removes the inefficiencies of older networks by processing multiple transactions at the same time. Unlike other blockchains that handle one transaction per block, BlockDAG executes many at once, boosting both speed and scalability. With its presale exceeding $203.9 million, this project is attracting considerable attention ahead of its exchange launch. Plans are in place for listings on 10 major CEX platforms, ensuring high liquidity and price discovery after release. Key Reason Why BlockDAG is a Top Pick: Over $203.9M raised – A strong sign of demand and confidence. 10 confirmed exchange listings – Will boost liquidity and access. Testnet launch in March 2025 – Demonstrates real-world application. $30M in grants for developers – Encourages dApp growth and Web3 adoption. X1 Miner App’s success – Over 500,000 downloads indicate strong ecosystem engagement. BlockDAG’s ability to process transactions in parallel gives it a major advantage over traditional Layer-1s like Ethereum and Solana, which still face congestion issues. Many are comparing BDAG’s early-stage potential to Solana’s early days, with predictions of significant price increases upon launch. Avalanche (AVAX): Scalable Network for DeFi and Enterprises Avalanche provides a high-performance Layer-1 platform designed to handle congestion issues faced by Ethereum. It achieves this through subnets—custom blockchains that allow decentralized applications to run independently while benefiting from Avalanche’s security. This structure has made Avalanche a preferred choice for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise adoption. The network continues to attract major projects and companies, strengthening AVAX’s utility and long-term outlook. Why Avalanche is Among the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Near-instant transaction finality – Processes transactions in under two seconds. Expanding DeFi ecosystem – Supports lending, yield farming, and NFT platforms. Enterprise interest – Companies integrating Avalanche for efficiency. 3. Arbitrum (ARB) – A Strong Layer-2 Solution for Ethereum Scaling Arbitrum is a widely used Layer-2 solution that enhances Ethereum’s efficiency by reducing gas fees and increasing transaction speed. By utilizing optimistic rollups, it processes transactions off-chain before securing them on Ethereum’s main network. This reduces costs while keeping security intact. As Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform, Arbitrum is set to benefit from the increasing need for Layer-2 scalability. The DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum is also expanding, drawing more projects to its network. Reasons Arbitrum is One of the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Lower transaction costs – Optimistic rollups reduce Ethereum’s fees. Thriving DeFi activity – Hosts numerous decentralized applications. Growing institutional and retail adoption – The Demand for efficient scaling solutions is rising. 4. Filecoin (FIL): A Decentralized Storage Leader for AI and Web3 Filecoin is transforming data storage by decentralizing the process, moving away from centralized services such as AWS and Google Cloud. It enables users to rent out unused storage space, providing a secure and cost-effective alternative for Web3 applications and AI-based projects. With the rise of AI and blockchain-driven applications, the demand for reliable decentralized storage solutions is increasing, positioning Filecoin as a major player in this space. Why Filecoin is One of the Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now: Decentralized cloud storage – A secure alternative to centralized providers. AI and Web3 applications – More demand for censorship-resistant storage. Strategic enterprise partnerships – Large institutions adopting Filecoin’s technology. As businesses and developers prioritize secure data solutions, Filecoin’s decentralized storage model continues to gain adoption. Best Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! Opportunities are emerging for those looking to enter high-potential blockchain projects before they gain widespread traction. Among the best long-term cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG leads the way with its $203.9M in presale, confirmed CEX listings, and fast blockchain processing capabilities, making it an attractive early-stage opportunity. Meanwhile, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Filecoin continue to evolve, providing essential solutions for DeFi, Layer-2 scaling, and decentralized storage. Each offers strong utility and growing adoption, making them solid picks for those looking at long-term crypto options. With BlockDAG’s presale advancing toward its next phase, now may be the time to acquire BDAG coins before increasing demand pushes prices up.

42016702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=714860,1742432451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42016702.jpeg,Bitcoin Transfer Count Lowest Since 2023—Is This Bearish?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-transfer-count-lowest-2023-is-this-bearish/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin transaction count has plunged to the lowest level since October 2023. Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Transactions Have Seen A Significant Slowdown Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in a new post on X, the BTC transfer activity has dropped to relatively low levels recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Number of Transactions” from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which measures, as its name suggests, the daily number of moves that addresses across the network are making. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shark & Whale Population Rises—Price Turnaround Incoming? Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Number of Transactions has seen a large drop for Bitcoin recently, suggesting that investors are making much fewer moves on the blockchain now. Generally, a drop in network transaction activity is a sign that the traders are losing interest in the cryptocurrency. Any notable move in the price is only sustainable when a large number of investors are providing the fuel to support it, so it can be hard for BTC to mount up a rally when the Number of Transactions declines to a low level. From the chart, it’s visible that the investors were making a high number of moves in the lead-up to the Bitcoin price rally beyond $100,000. But interestingly, the indicator plunged before the price peak arrived, implying that signs of the rally not having too much time left may have already been there from an on-chain perspective. Recently, the Number of Transactions briefly saw a crash to a level that it hasn’t touched since October 2023. Back then, the low transfer count didn’t last for too long and was in fact followed up by a burst of activity that accompanied a price rally. It’s possible that something similar could happen this time as well, but one key difference between then and now is that the recent downturn in the indicator has been more prolonged. Naturally, if things are indeed going to be different this time, then a lasting lack of interest from the investors could be a bad sign for the bulls. That said, an indicator that may provide for an argument against a shift away from a bull market is the Cycle Extreme shared by Axel Adler Jr, another CryptoQuant author. “Cycle Extreme identifies the extreme points of price cycles,” explains the analyst. The indicator makes use of various popular Bitcoin on-chain indicators like the MVRV Ratio and SOPR to determine this. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks Under Parallel Channel: Analyst Predicts This Target As is apparent from the graph, the indicator has often been reliable for pointing out inflection points in Bitcoin. “At the moment, this metric does not give any clear signals,” notes Adler Jr. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $83,600, up almost 1% in the last week.

42016782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141677,1742432515,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Exchange Shift: Garantex Operators Exposed Transferring Funds to Grinex – Sanctions Workaround?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/garantex-grinex-crypto-exchange-shift/,"In a stunning turn of events in the crypto world, a new report has surfaced alleging a clandestine operation involving sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. Are we witnessing a sophisticated attempt to circumvent international regulations? Let’s dive into the details of how Garantex operators are reportedly shifting funds to a newly launched exchange, Grinex, and what this could mean for the future of crypto sanctions and compliance. This is a developing story that demands attention from anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency landscape. Garantex’s Sanction Woes and the Rise of Grinex Earlier this month, authorities took decisive action against Garantex, a Russia-based crypto exchange, due to its alleged role in facilitating illicit transactions. This move sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting the increasing scrutiny on exchanges and their compliance with global sanctions. However, the story doesn’t end there. Blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger’s recent report paints a picture of a calculated maneuver to keep the operations alive, albeit under a new guise. According to the report, Grinex, a freshly launched crypto exchange, isn’t just another newcomer on the block. It’s alleged to be a direct successor to Garantex. The Block, citing Global Ledger’s findings, reports that even as Garantex faced shutdown for enabling illicit activities, its operators were allegedly busy orchestrating a transfer of customer funds and crucial liquidity to Grinex. This alleged transfer points to a deliberate attempt to maintain operations and potentially continue facilitating transactions that might be under regulatory scrutiny. What Makes Grinex a Suspected Successor? Several key factors point towards Grinex being more than just a coincidence. Let’s break down the evidence: Shared Infrastructure: Reports indicate that Grinex is utilizing the same infrastructure that previously powered Garantex. This suggests a direct continuation of technical setup and operational frameworks. Fund Transfers: Onchain data reveals significant transaction activity on Grinex, totaling around $30 million. Notably, billions of A7A5 stablecoins have been moved from Garantex to Grinex wallets, a strong indicator of fund migration. Sanctions Workaround Marketing: Perhaps the most telling sign is the alleged marketing of Grinex as a sanctions workaround . This directly suggests an intention to provide services to users seeking to bypass international financial restrictions. The Implications of a Sanctions Workaround If these allegations are true, the implications are significant. The establishment of a sanctions workaround crypto exchange like Grinex raises serious concerns for global regulatory bodies and the broader crypto industry. Here’s why this matters: Erosion of Sanctions Effectiveness: Sanctions are a critical tool in international policy to address illicit activities and maintain global order. If entities can easily circumvent these measures through crypto exchanges, the effectiveness of sanctions regimes is undermined. Increased Illicit Activity: Exchanges operating as sanctions workaround platforms can become hubs for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. This can damage the reputation of the entire crypto space and hinder mainstream adoption. Regulatory Backlash: Such blatant attempts to bypass regulations can trigger stronger and more stringent regulatory responses from governments worldwide. This could lead to increased compliance burdens for legitimate crypto businesses and potentially stifle innovation. Reputational Damage to Crypto: Incidents like this fuel the narrative that crypto is primarily used for illicit purposes. This negative perception can discourage institutional investment and public trust in cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Sanctions The Garantex-Grinex situation highlights the ongoing challenges in regulating the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, especially concerning sanctions compliance. What are the key challenges and potential solutions? Challenge Potential Solution Decentralized Nature of Crypto Enhanced onchain analytics and cross-border regulatory collaboration Anonymity Features Balancing privacy with KYC/AML compliance, exploring privacy-preserving technologies for compliance Rapid Technological Advancements Continuous regulatory adaptation and technological solutions for monitoring and enforcement Global Reach of Crypto Exchanges International cooperation and harmonization of regulatory standards Is Grinex a Legitimate Crypto Exchange or Just a Sanctions Workaround? The core question remains: Is Grinex a legitimate new crypto exchange , or is it merely a front for Garantex to continue its operations while evading sanctions? While Grinex is operating as a crypto exchange and processing transactions, the allegations of infrastructure sharing, fund transfers, and sanctions workaround marketing paint a concerning picture. Authorities and regulatory bodies will likely be closely scrutinizing Grinex’s activities. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the true nature of Grinex and the extent of its connection to Garantex. Further investigations and onchain analysis will be essential to unravel the full story and determine the appropriate course of action. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Businesses This situation offers several key takeaways for both crypto users and businesses operating in this space: Due Diligence is Paramount: Users should exercise extreme caution when using new or lesser-known crypto exchanges , especially those with ties to sanctioned entities or regions. Thoroughly research exchanges before entrusting them with your funds. Compliance is Non-Negotiable: For crypto businesses, robust KYC/AML compliance programs are not optional but essential. Staying ahead of regulatory requirements and implementing strong compliance measures is crucial for long-term sustainability. Transparency and Scrutiny are Increasing: The crypto industry is no longer operating in the shadows. Regulatory scrutiny is intensifying, and transparency is becoming increasingly important. Embrace transparency and proactively engage with regulators to build trust and legitimacy. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about evolving sanctions regimes and regulatory changes in the crypto space. Adapt your strategies and operations to remain compliant and mitigate risks. Conclusion: The Unfolding Saga of Crypto Sanctions and Exchange Tactics The alleged shift from Garantex to Grinex is a stark reminder of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between regulators and those seeking to operate outside the bounds of established financial rules. Whether Grinex will successfully function as a sanctions workaround remains to be seen. However, this situation underscores the critical need for vigilance, robust compliance, and international cooperation to effectively regulate the crypto space and prevent its misuse for illicit purposes. The crypto world is watching closely as this story unfolds, and the repercussions could shape the future of crypto regulation and sanctions enforcement.

In the transactions flagged by Arkham, the wallet in question sent $1.87M MELANIA to a fresh wallet from its 50M MELANIA (5% o f su pply from the MELANIA team). The transaction could mean the wallet is getting ready to dump even more tokens, as Arkham notes that previous distributions from the same address were deposited to Kraken and sold via Meteora. Donald Trump won the election after campaigning as a pro-crypto president. Since then, he has launched a meme and ran an airdrop for his loyal supporters. His wife, First Lady Melania Trump also launched a meme of her own, with other political figures like Javier Milei of Argentina also linked to the $Libra token launch. Unfortunately these launches have only worked to benefit the parties behind them, leading many to tag them pump and dump schemes. MELANIA insider wallets on the move again According to a report from Arkham , Melania insider wallets have become active once more, which means something is about to happen, and a dump is never out of the question. Transaction between the Melania team wallet and a new wallet that received $1.87M MELANIA. Source: Arkham Intelligence According to Arkham’s post, the wallet in question received 50 M MELANIA, which is 5% of the supply from the MELANIA team, and has just sent $1.87 M MELANIA to a fresh wallet. This could mean they’re getting ready to dump even more tokens, as Arkham notes that previous distributions from the same address were deposited to Kraken and sold via Meteora. “The vesting schedule for MELANIA is brief, with the first unlocks occurring 30 days after launch (19/02/2025), making today currently the end of Month 2. 2.25% of MELANIA supply is linearly vested every month,” Arkham also tweeted. In the comment section, users had mixed opinions about the news, with many implying that they believe someone in Melania’s team is getting ready to dump on the meme’s holders again. There is little doubt that things are finally looking up, adoption-wise, for BTC and crypto in general. However, these series of recent high-profile rug pulls have left newer participants concerned and forced many of the more experienced investors to acce pt t he “crypto” frenzy triggered by Trump may be tarnishing the industry’s reputation as an alternative monetary system. $TRUMP, $MELANIA & $LIBRA were holes in the Solana ship The season of political figures launching memes started when the POTUS decided to create one himself. The launch triggered a frenzy on Solana as degens quickly reallocated assets into the meme. The immediate aftermath saw $TRUMP’s market cap peak at over $15 billion. However, the value crashed by 40%, erasing $7.5 billion in market cap in minutes after the first lady blindsided the market with $MELANIA’s launch. Traders sold $TRUMP to buy $MELANIA, and by late January, $TRUMP’s daily trading volume had collapsed 90% from its $36 billion peak to $3.5 billion, and its price fell to $26.80 from a high of $73.43. A similar occurrence happened with the $MELANIA token, which was launched a few days after $TRUMP, less than 12 hours before Trump’s inauguration, sparking an instant speculative fever. ARKHAM ALERT: MELANIA INSIDER WALLETS DISTRIBUTING $MELANIA A wallet that received 50M MELANIA (5% of supply) from the MELANIA Team has just sent $1.87M MELANIA to a fresh wallet. Previous distributions from this address were deposited to Kraken and sold on Meteora. pic.twitter.com/x2dwIgdcPW — Arkham (@arkham) March 19, 2025 Many had witnessed the earliest $TRUMP buyers cash out with enormous returns and thought they were getting their own chance, so they rushed to buy. Truly, hours after the release, the token’s price surged by 24,000%, peaking at about $13 and pushing the market cap to nearly $1.8 billion. Unfortunately, the gravy train quickly rolled to a stop . That same weekend, $MELANIA fell by 80% from its peak, sinking to $0.76 by mid-February ​. This triggered questions about the token distribution and intent, with analysts noting an ownershi p concentratio n​ similar to the one observed with the Trump token. Following the success of both tokens, Argentina’s President Javier Milei, a self-proclaimed libertarian and Bitcoin supporter, endorsed the $LIBRA token and promoted it on his social media accounts as a private initiative to boost Argentina’s economy. This caused $LIBRA’s price to instantly shoot up from $0 to nearly $5 apiece as Milei’s followers and retail investors bought. It turned into a national scandal overnight when the token’s price fell by over 80% within hours as insider wallets dumped over $107 million in tokens almost immediately after launch, cashing out profits while regular holders watched helplessly. The political fallout from the scandal was swift and saw the opposition launch an impeachment request against Milei, who quickly deleted his promotional post and disavowed any ties to $LIBRA, claiming, “I was not aware of the details of the project and once I found out, I decided to not continue giving it publicit y . ”​ There was also $CAR, launched by the Central African Republic’s president on February 9, and it also mirrored $TRUMP’s pump and dump. According to DEXScreener, its $800M cap lasted only minutes before falling 84% amidst scam allegations. All four events made headlines and have blurred the lines between the OG cryptos like Bitcoin (digital gold) and speculative pump-and-dump tokens. According to estimates, these tokens also extracted significant liquidity from Solana’s ecosystem. One analyst estimated that $TRUMP and $CAR, alongside $LIBRA, drained between $3.6 billion and $6.6 billion from Solana’s memecoin market. According to Nansen, the $LIBRA token sucked at least $250 million from the ecosystem alone. All the while, new memes are being launched and rugged, further tarnishing Solana’s reputation. It does not take a rocket scientist to fig ure that the value that these projects extracted from the Solana ecosystem contributed to grounding it. Since they launched, active addresses and transactions have reportedly declined o n Sola na and the SOL token value has fallen by about 40% as distrust continues to spread.

Launched as a joke in December 2013, Dogecoin was hardly expected to rise to the heights it enjoys today. With a mere $0.00026 as its trading price at launch, it was considered nothing more than a meme coin. Fast forward to today, and Dogecoin boasts a market capitalization in the billions, with early believers reaping massive gains. For those who missed Dogecoin’s ICO, the Arctic Pablo Coin presale offers a new opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a cryptocurrency poised to make waves. Dogecoin’s Early Days: A Missed Opportunity? Back in 2013, when Dogecoin was first introduced, it didn’t seem like much more than a fun internet experiment. The trading price was a mere $0.00026 per coin. Many dismissed it as just another internet fad, a joke based on the viral “Doge” meme. But over the years, something unexpected happened—Dogecoin began to gain a loyal following. As the community grew and endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk further bolstered its legitimacy, Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed. Those who believed in the potential of Dogecoin during its early days, despite the skepticism, are now sitting on massive returns. The coin’s peak reached an all-time high of over $0.70, and its current price still offers significant gains from its initial days. For those who missed the ICO or were hesitant to invest, this remarkable rise in value has undoubtedly caused some regret. However, all hope is not lost. A new opportunity to seize early investment gains is here, and it’s called Arctic Pablo Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin: The New Meme Coin with Massive ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin , currently in its presale phase, is drawing attention as one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin’s strategy is unique: the presale is divided by locations, allowing investors to “travel” along with the coin as it moves through different stages.

The exchange is tying up loose ends in what could be one of the largest acquisitions by a cryptocurrency service provider. Kraken Inches Toward Mega Deal To Buy NinjaTrader According to a WallStreetJournal (WSJ) report, Kraken is in the final third of an ambitious plan to purchase NinjaTrader. According to the post , the deal is worth $1.5 billion and will see NinjaTrader become a subsidiary of the US-based cryptocurrency exchange. Barring any eventualities, insiders say Kraken will announce the completion of the deal before the end of the week. While details are sparse, the move signals Kraken’s interest in dabbling in derivatives and crypto futures. Kraken is seeking to expand its offerings but the exchange remains wary of regulatory challenges that could bedevil the plans. The US SEC just shuttered its Kraken case that sought to view the firm as a stock exchange. To sidestep the regulatory hurdles, the purchase will allow the exchange to lean on NinjaTrader’s Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) license to offer its derivatives offering. Kraken has the funds to see the deal through given impressive financial metrics for the exchange. The US-based crypto exchange racked in over $1.5 billion in revenue, doubling its profits over the last year. Both Parties Have An Eye On Expansion Apart from sidestepping potential regulatory hurdles, purchasing NinjaTrader will introduce Kraken to a new demographic. Launched in 2003, NinjaTrader has racked up over 1.8 million retail investors with the deal offering several perks for the futures trading company. The move will see Kraken support NinjaTrader’s bid to enter the UK and Australian markets. Kraken’s EMI approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) may smoothen NinjaTrader’s entry into the UK. The top crypto exchange has previously secured a MiFID license to offer crypto derivatives to EU-based traders. In line with its expansionist goals, the exchange reintroduced cryptocurrency staking service for US customers.

For Injective, the Nivara mainnet upgrade is doing exactly that. With enhanced oracle support, security improvements, and real-time transaction tracking via InjScan, Injective is strengthening its foundation for mass adoption. Meanwhile, Toncoin has surged by 20% after Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, regained his passport, fueling speculation on the project’s future direction. These are not just routine updates—these are defining moments. But what about the future of decentralized finance and online security? That’s where Qubetics comes in. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a censorship-resistant, fully decentralized network. For businesses, professionals, and individuals, this means true digital freedom—free from surveillance, geo-restrictions, and data leaks. It stands out as one of the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Secure and Decentralized Connectivity Qubetics is more than just another blockchain project—it’s a solution to one of the most pressing problems in today’s digital world: privacy. While traditional VPNs claim to offer anonymity, they are still vulnerable to government interference, centralized control, and potential data leaks. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN (dVPN) eliminates these weaknesses, providing a censorship-resistant and secure alternative powered by blockchain technology. Consider businesses that rely on encrypted communication. Traditional VPNs can be blocked or compromised, exposing sensitive data. Qubetics’ dVPN distributes data across a decentralized network, making it nearly impossible to track or censor. Freelancers, journalists, and remote workers in restrictive regions can bypass censorship without relying on centralized providers that store user logs. Streaming platforms and global gaming communities can also benefit by accessing unrestricted content without latency or regional restrictions. Key Features & Market Adoption A fully decentralized system eliminates central points of failure, significantly reducing the risk of hacking and unauthorized control. By operating without reliance on geo-restricted servers, it ensures global accessibility, allowing users to interact with the network without restrictions. Additionally, enhanced security is a core feature, leveraging blockchain’s encryption standards to provide tamper-proof protection against data manipulation and cyber threats. This combination of decentralization, unrestricted access, and robust security makes it a reliable and future-proof solution in the evolving digital landscape positioning itself as the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics is currently in its 26th crypto presale stage, having raised over $15.2 million. More than 501 million $TICS tokens have been sold at a current price of $0.1181 per token. With over 23,400 holders already onboard, the projected return on investment (ROI) is substantial. If $TICS reaches $0.25, early buyers could see a 111% ROI. A price of $1 would yield a 746% ROI, while a surge to $5 would bring a 4,130% return. At $6, the ROI would be 4,976%, climbing to 8,360% at $10 and 12,591% at $15. The presale is nearing completion, making this a critical moment for those looking to secure $TICS before its full market launch. Injective (INJ): Bridging Blockchain with Real-World Assets Injective has been relentless in pushing blockchain adoption, especially in real-world applications. The recent Nivara mainnet upgrade brings critical advancements, including improved oracle support, heightened security against risky deposits, and greater wallet protection. These upgrades make Injective an even stronger contender for institutional adoption. With the introduction of the Ambassador Program 2.0, Injective is amplifying its community-driven approach. More contributors mean a broader reach and faster user growth. Meanwhile, InjScan, the platform’s dedicated blockchain explorer, provides real-time transaction tracking, ensuring greater transparency for both developers and participants. These advancements strengthen Injective’s positioning as a top blockchain for 2025. With enhanced security, improved data reliability, and a growing user base, Injective is setting a new standard for blockchain efficiency and real-world integration one of th best cryptos to join this month. Toncoin (TON): Market Surge and Future Outlook Toncoin has seen a surge of nearly 20% after Telegram founder Pavel Durov regained his passport and left France for Dubai. This unexpected turn has fueled optimism among community members, leading to renewed speculation about TON’s future prospects making it the best cryptos to join this month. As of mid-February 2025, Toncoin traded around $3.86, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 26.26—suggesting it was in oversold territory. Now, with renewed momentum, analysts are projecting that TON could reach $15.08 to $23.06 within the year, though precise timing remains uncertain. The renewed market confidence, coupled with Telegram’s continued influence, could push TON further into the mainstream. Conclusion: Why These Cryptos Matter Now Qubetics, Injective, and Toncoin are all making headlines for the right reasons. Whether it’s Qubetics’ revolutionary approach to online privacy, Injective’s real-world blockchain adoption, or Toncoin’s renewed momentum, each of these projects presents strong potential for those looking for the best cryptos to join this month . As blockchain adoption accelerates, the opportunities for participants continue to grow. With innovation accelerating across the blockchain space, Qubetics, Injective, and Toncoin are shaping the next era of decentralized technology. Whether through enhanced privacy, seamless DeFi solutions, or mass adoption via social integration, each project offers a compelling case for long-term relevance.

Particularly, data from on-chain analytics platform Glassnode shows that the “BTC: Long-term holder net position change” metric has flipped positive for the first time this year. This suggests that long-term Bitcoin investors are capitalizing on market conditions to add significant amounts of BTC to their holdings. Long-Term Holders Add 167,000 BTC Amid March Crash Earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price plunged from above $90,000 to around $80,000 during a rapid sell-off​. This price stunned many traders and triggered a continuous wave of liquidations among short-term investors. Yet despite this steep correction, long-term holders treated the sub-$90,000 levels as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to capitulate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price? In other words, coins are moving into wallets that haven’t spent their BTC in a long time, which is a notable reversal after starting 2025 with a negative net position change. This marks the first net accumulation by these “HODLers” in 2025. Glassnode’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change metric, which had been in the red, flipped “green” as long-term investors aggressively accumulated through the downturn​. On-chain data shows that this flip to green has seen long-term holders increase their net Bitcoin holdings by more than 167,000 BTC in the past month. This notable influx is valued at nearly $14 billion. In short, the cohort of seasoned holders began scooping up cheap BTC while short-term sentiment was at its bleakest. Is A Bitcoin Price Recovery Brewing? The timing of this flip from red selloff to green accumulation among long-term holders is striking, considering what the Bitcoin price went through in the past two weeks. This data suggests that a large part of the Bitcoin crash was caused by panic-selling among short-term holders. This behavior aligns with past market cycles between August and September 2024, where long-term holders accumulated aggressively during a price dip. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Headed For $70,000 Or $300,000? What The Charts Are Saying Interestingly, Glassnode’s long-term holder metric isn’t the only one pointing to positive Bitcoin sentiment among large holders. After weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started seeing net inflows again. On March 17, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively drew in about $274.6 million, the largest single-day inflow in 28 days and a clear signal of renewed investor interest​. The very next day brought another wave of fresh capital, with roughly $209 million pouring into Bitcoin funds on March 18​. In fact, this three-day streak represents the first sustained run of positive inflows since February 18, a period during which Bitcoin funds have experienced consecutive days of outflows. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $83,500.

Just recently, Donald Trump hosted the inaugural White House Crypto Summit. While the crypto community wasn’t thrilled with the outcomes, the event delivered key updates on the US Bitcoin Reserve and shed light on the government’s current approach to crypto regulation. Could Be A Pre-recorded Message The announcement comes after Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, spoke at DAS this week, hinting at plans to stockpile Bitcoin for a new strategic reserve. “It’s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away,” Hines told the crowd on Tuesday. Some reports suggest that Trump’s appearance at the event may not be live, with some sources hinting at a pre-recorded message instead. Regardless, this still marks a historic moment as the U.S. president is set to formally address a crypto conference. Key Discussions At the event, discussions will center on Bitcoin’s adoption by institutions, regulatory updates, and the future of the crypto market. Trump is expected to outline his administration’s next steps on Bitcoin. FOX business journalist Eleanor Terrett also shared that multiple sources at the DAS Conference have clarified that President Trump is planning to livestream into the event either today or tomorrow to address the audience. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1902445688245321981 Top Lawmakers To Feature The summit will bring together top lawmakers like Representatives Ro Khanna and Tom Emmer, along with industry giants like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Michael Saylor will give a keynote speech and join a discussion with BTC historian Pete Rizzo. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will moderate a panel with key players, including Robbie Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, and Giang Bui, Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products at Nasdaq. Ripple-SEC Lawsuit Ends In a remarkable update, Garlinghouse revealed today that the SEC has dropped its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, marking a major victory for Ripple and the crypto industry. The crypto market has been showing signs of recovery this week, following a period of volatility. Besides, the Federal Reserve announced today that it won’t be making any immediate rate cuts.

Akshay Naheta, the founder of stablecoin payments infrastructure firm Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), will join Bakkt CEO Andy Main in the role, the company said on March 19. Bakkt added that it will enter into an agreement with DTR to integrate its stablecoin-based payment infrastructure with Bakkt’s crypto trading and brokerage technology, subject to regulatory approval. Bakkt said the partnership would open new revenue streams in stablecoin payments and crypto trading while increasing efficiency in cross-border payments, a popular use case for crypto. Naheta founded DTR in 2022 after a nearly six-year stint in various executive roles at investment management giant SoftBank Group, which has a history of investing in crypto firms. In a separate statement reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, Bakkt said it wants “to focus resources on core crypto offerings” and was potentially looking to sell or wind down its loyalty services business, which allows its clients to offer travel and merchandise perks. Bakkt recently shared its take on stablecoins ahead of it, sharing it had partnered with DTR. Source: Bakkt Bakkt added that it was selling its crypto custody subsidiary, Bakkt Trust, to its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, for $1.5 million. It said the sale would cut operating costs by $3.8 million a year and free up around $3 million for investment into its crypto business. The firm added it would maintain custody solutions “through a robust network of reputable custody providers.” Its moves come after Bakkt disclosed on March 17 that its major clients, Bank of America and trading platform Webull, won’t be renewing contacts with the firm when they expire in April and June, respectively. Bank of America accounted for around 16% of Bakkt’s loyalty services revenue in 2023 and 2024, while Webull represented 74% of its crypto revenues over that same period. The disclosure sent its share price tumbling on March 18, which closed the trading day down over 27% to $9.33. Bakkt improves top and bottom-line earnings Bakkt reported on March 19 that its total 2024 revenues came in at $3.49 billion, up nearly 350% year-over-year, while its yearly net loss roughly halved to $103.4 million.

CEO Discusses Pending Cross Appeal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After nearly four years of intense legal battles, the long-standing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple has finally come to an end. The SEC, which initially filed the lawsuit in December 2020, claiming Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP was an unregistered security, has now dropped the appeal. Garlinghouse Reflects on the Long Fight In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said “This has been a long battle. “But now, there is a lot more certainty for Ripple, and frankly, for me personally, because the SEC had sued me.” He revealed that the SEC has officially abandoned its appeal in the case, which had been ongoing since the lawsuit was filed in December 2020. Ripple scored a key victory in the summer of 2023 when Judge Torres ruled that XRP, the cryptocurrency at the center of the case, is not a security. This ruling marked a pivotal moment in the case. The SEC’s Appeal is Dropped Despite the SEC’s withdrawal from its appeal, Garlinghouse clarified that the case is not entirely over. A cross-appeal is still pending, but the dynamics have shifted. “We go from being the defendant to the plaintiff,” he explained. “Now, we’re in the driver’s seat, deciding how we want to proceed.” Ripple’s Legal Victory and the Industry’s Future For Ripple, the outcome of this case is crucial not just for the company itself but for the broader crypto industry. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple had spent over $150 million defending the case, a legal expense not only aimed at protecting the company but also supporting the entire cryptocurrency sector. “It was important for the whole industry,” he said. Judge’s Ruling and Ripple’s Strategy Garlinghouse also commented on the broader implications of the case’s resolution, especially in terms of the legal status of XRP. “The SEC’s decision to drop its appeal is a significant moment,” he stated. “It’s clear now that the SEC likely regrets bringing the case in the first place, especially given the judge’s ruling.” However, some elements of the case are still unresolved, such as the $125 million civil penalty Ripple was ordered to pay. This fine is currently held in escrow, pending the final resolution of the case. The $125 Million Fine and What’s Next Ripple has expressed interest in potentially reclaiming the $125 million fine, given that no investors were harmed in the process. “There was no investor harm, no investors lost money,” Garlinghouse remarked, suggesting that the penalty may be reconsidered as the case nears its conclusion.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 02:46:59

Global Ledger claims the operators of the Russian exchange have shifted liquidity and customer deposits to Grinex, which they say is “Garantex’s full-fledged successor,” in a report released to X on March 19. “We can confidently state that Grinex and Garantex are directly connected both onchain and offchain.” “The movement of funds, including the systematic transfer of A7A5 liquidity, the use of one-time-use wallets, and the involvement of addresses previously associated with Garantex, provides clear onchain proof of their link,” the Global Ledger team said in the report. After completing its investigation on March 13, Global Ledger says it had found onchain data showing Garantex laundered over $60 million worth of ruble-backed stablecoins called A7A5 and sent them to addresses associated with Grinex. Global Ledger claims Garantex has moved all its funds over to a newly launched exchange and is back in business. Source: Global Ledger “In this case, the burning and subsequent minting process was used to launder funds from Garantex, allowing new coins to be minted from a system address with a clean history,” the team said. A Garantex manager also reportedly told Global Ledger that customers have been visiting the exchange office in person and moving funds from Garantex to Grinex. “Additionally, offchain indicators, such as transactional patterns, commentaries and exchange behaviors, further reinforce this connection,” it said. The report also points to a description of Grinex on the Russian crypto tracking site CoinMarketRating, claiming that the owners of Garantex created it. The reports said this shows “Grinex is not an independent entity but rather a full-fledged successor to Garantex, continuing its financial operations despite the exchange’s official shutdown.” Source: Global Ledger By March 14, the volume of incoming transactions on Grinex was nearly $30 million, according to Global Ledger. CoinMarketRating shows that the trade volume for the month is now over $68 million, with spot trading topping $2 million. The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control first hit Garantex with sanctions in April 2022 for allegedly money laundering violations. Related: US, UK, Australia sanction Zservers for hosting crypto ransomware LockBit On March 6, the US Department of Justice collaborated with authorities in Germany and Finland to freeze domains associated with Garantex, which they claim processed over $96 billion worth of criminal proceeds since launching in 2019.

Only a few days later, on March 12, officials with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Aleksej Bešciokov, who allegedly operated Garantex , on US charges that included conspiracy to commit money laundering.

The court also ordered the man to pay a 500,000 ruble (around $6,000) fine. TASS reported that a branch of the Western District Military Court heard that the man made “multiple transfers of funds” to “armed formations” in based Ukraine.

These were all intended to help conduct military operations against soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces.” The court convicted the man of “high treason” and “assisting a terrorist activity,” both “violations of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.” The FSB released scant details about the man, noting only that he was a resident of Oryol, and that he was born in 1976. However, the FSB released a video “confession” from the man, where he addressed the camera and said: “I sent cryptoassets.

The loans had little in the way of interest; however, they have conversion features that could dilute equity. On Tuesday, MSTR announced it was issuing preferred stock with high interest rates. So the ""low interest rate convertible bond"" argument for owning MSTR is weakening. In this article, I explore why MicroStrategy is too leveraged and exposed to Bitcoin to be worth buying now. Strategy or MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has taken a beating in recent days, crashing along with the cryptocurrency it holds in vast quantities: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The company has grown from its roots as a software company into a Bitcoin holding company, investing increasing sums of money into the coin at high prices. It recently bought $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin when BTC traded at around $104,000 , meaning the position is sitting on major losses. The background story here is that MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin is an excellent long-term store of value and is purchasing it to make his company into a Bitcoin bank . Technically, MicroStrategy’s underlying software business still exists, but it is tiny as a percentage of MSTR’s total business. The company, with $25 billion in assets (as of the most recent reports), does just $463.5 million per year in revenue. Also, the company’s Bitcoin makes up the vast majority of its assets. So, MicroStrategy is rapidly becoming a leveraged Bitcoin play. The problem is that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset which, when bought with leverage, exposes its holders to solvency risk. It's true that MSTR has low interest expenses; however, that’s largely because its debt is mostly convertible . Convertible debt usually has lower interest rates than straight debt because the conversion option is perceived as valuable and therefore can make up for a lack of interest. However, when convertible bonds are exercised, the newly issued stock reduces the ownership claim (percentage of the company owned by) previously existing stock. So, convertible debt creates dilution. Potentially, large amounts of it. Another problem is that MicroStrategy is issuing some high interest rate preferred stock. On the day this article was written, the company announced that it was selling a $500 million block of perpetual preferred stock. The stock is being priced to yield 10% and if investors pay less than par for it, the actual yield will be greater than that. A 10% yield on $500 million is $50 million, so this is a major increase in MSTR’s “interest” expenses. When I last covered MicroStrategy, I rated it a sell because it was too exposed to Bitcoin for such a highly leveraged entity. I figured that the combination of volatility and leverage was too risky. Since that article published, MicroStrategy has fallen 26% in price, underperforming the S&P 500 in the same period. That makes the call a major win for me. However, I’m actually even more bearish on MicroStrategy now than I was then. One of the reasons why I was only mildly bearish on MicroStrategy when I last wrote about it was because its interest expenses were extremely small. The company faced the risk of underperforming Bitcoin by wide margins due to dilution, but it did not face the solvency risks that a company with high interest debt faces. That was my take on MicroStrategy for a good while. Now, however, with the issuance of perpetual preferred stock with extremely high interest rates, MSTR’s interest expenses will rise, and its liquidity/solvency will likely deteriorate. For this reason, I’m downgrading my MicroStrategy rating to strong sell. MicroStrategy Operations Although the main focus of this article is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments and the leverage used to buy them, the company’s operations are worth discussing as well. Mainly, they are worth discussing because they are losing money, and therefore part of the company’s problems, albeit to a lesser extent than the Bitcoin investments are. MicroStrategy –officially now known as Strategy–is a U.S. software company that develops data analytics solutions for enterprise clients. It uses generative AI to help businesses find and exploit trends in their data. Let’s say, for example, that a company has dozens of spreadsheets in three categories: customers, receipts, and products. Using MicroStrategy’s platform , the user could synthesize the data in these three categories to find trends in customer experiences. Further, the company’s semantic graph enables users to visualize their data. There are many companies developing data platforms similar to MicroStrategy’s. Examples include Palantir ( PLTR ), Salesforce ( CRM ) and Snowflake ( SNOW ). The aforementioned companies are all much bigger than MicroStrategy, and have deeper pockets with which to buy the costly infrastructure on which AI and data analytics platforms run. This gives these companies a competitive edge over MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy ’s financials are consistent with its competitive weakness. In the fourth quarter, MicroStrategy delivered the following earnings results: $120.7 million in revenue, down 3% year-over-year. $1.1 billion in operating expenses, up 693%. $110 million in cash operating expenses. $1 billion in impairment charges. $38.1 million in cash So we have MicroStrategy shrinking, losing money, and barely profitable if we back out investment losses. It isn’t a great picture. But of course, MSTR could turn all of this around quite easily if Bitcoin made gains. In the next section, I’ll explain why betting on that is not a smart idea. Why Leveraged Bitcoin Bets Aren’t a Good Idea The reason why MicroStrategy investing its money into Bitcoin with leverage is a bad idea, is because Bitcoin is too volatile to be safely held with heavy amounts of leverage. Bitcoin is highly volatile, with 47% volatility compared to 10.2% for equities and 12% for gold. When an asset is highly volatile, buying it with leverage creates solvency issues. Let’s say you buy $1 million worth of Bitcoin at 10% interest. That gives you $100,000 in annual interest expenses. If Bitcoin falls 90% and stays there, you will need to borrow to refinance the loan. If no creditors will lend to you, you will go bankrupt. If Bitcoin falls 91%, and stays at that level for a year, then you can’t even pay your annual interest expense by selling all of your Bitcoin. In this scenario, too, you likely go bankrupt. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy is quite similar to the example given above. The company is buying volatile Bitcoin and incurring interest-bearing liabilities to finance its purchases. Now, it’s true that MSTR pays very low interest rates on its loans. But as I’ll show in a moment, that’s not quite the saving grace it appears to be. Arguments for Why MicroStrategy is Different (and Why They’re Wrong) The argument I outlined above is pretty sound if we are considering a leveraged Bitcoin ETF with high interest expenses. If I were simply addressing such an ETF, I’d end the article here. However, the fact that MicroStrategy is an operating business with very low interest expenses appears to lend some credibility to bullish theses on MSTR stock. So, I will address the two main arguments bulls use to establish MicroStrategy’s financial soundness below. The first argument bulls use to support MicroStrategy’s soundness is that the revenue generated by its operating business offsets its Bitcoin related solvency risk somewhat. On close inspection, the offset is not that great–or even negative. In the trailing 12-month period, MSTR lost $63 million from operations, not counting crypto impairment losses. The operations eat up money, so they actually make MSTR’s solvency even worse in a stress scenario, compared to if the company were just a leveraged Bitcoin ETF. The second argument bulls use to support MicroStrategy’s soundness is its debt structure. MSTR has convertible bonds outstanding with yields between 0% and 2.25%. These low interest rates gave relatively modest interest expenses of $61.9 million in the TTM period. With $41 billion worth of Bitcoin as of March 18, MSTR can easily pay those debts by selling off small chunks of Bitcoin. However, interest isn’t the only expense that debts incur. They also have to be paid off at maturity. MicroStrategy has $8.2 billion worth of debts due by 2032. The company would have to sell 20% of its Bitcoin to pay those debts all at once today. If Bitcoin fell 80% in price (like it did in 2014), then MSTR would have to sell all of its Bitcoin to pay off its debt at maturity. All that would be left in that scenario would be a loss-making operating business worth a tiny fraction of MSTR’s current market cap. If MicroStrategy tried to refinance the debts with more debts, on the other hand, it would likely be forced to pay high interest rates, as investors would not be interested in the MSTR convertible feature in an extreme Bitcoin bear market with MSTR stock also being hit. MSTR’s equity would be near-worthless. Also, MicroStrategy’s “low interest expense” increasingly isn’t real if we use the word “interest” broadly. Preferred share dividends are much like bond interest, in that they are fixed commitments that common shareholders have no claim on. Such dividends can be considered a kind of 'interest.' Well, the latest twist in the MicroStrategy saga is that the company has started selling preferred stock! On February 5 , MicroStrategy issued 7.3 million $80 preferred shares, for a total issuance of $534 million. Expected interest expense was $58.4 million per year. On Tuesday, the company announced it was going in for a second round of preferred stock, this time 5 million shares at $100 per share yielding 10%. So, $500 million in issuance against $50 million in interest expenses. So we’ve got $108.4 in extra interest-like obligations being added here, more than doubling MicroStrategy’s “interest” expense. This is a new issue that was not present when I last covered MSTR, and the main reason I have downgraded my rating to strong sell. The Bottom Line The bottom line is that MicroStrategy has extreme liquidity and solvency issues in a stress scenario, such as a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. Considering all the factors discussed in this article, I think MicroStrategy would not survive a scenario in which Bitcoin declines 80% in price. For an asset as volatile as Bitcoin, an 80% crash is not all that unusual. So, MicroStrategy is too risky to be worthy of investment.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-20 03:10:34

The deal could be confirmed by the morning of March 20 in the US, The Wall Street Journal said in a March 19 report, citing people familiar with the matter. Kraken’s expanded offerings would be made possible through NinjaTrader’s registration as a Futures Commission Merchant. The move would help Kraken’s strategy to work across several asset classes — including plans for equities trading and payments — while enabling NinjaTrader to expand into the UK, continental Europe and Australian markets, the sources told WSJ. NinjaTrader is expected to remain a standalone platform under Kraken. Cointelegraph reached out to Kraken and NinjaTrader for comment but did not receive an immediate response. Source: Wall Street Journal Markets Kraken posted $1.5 billion in revenue and $665 billion in trading volume from 2.5 million funded customer accounts on its platform in 2024, while NinjaTrader recently said its futures trading tools are used by over 1.8 million customers. Kraken announced its intention to broaden its product offerings and services last November when it shuttered its non-fungible token marketplace. Related: Australia fines Kraken operator $5M for regulatory breaches It comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Kraken on March 3 after it initially alleged that the crypto platform acted as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange and clearing agency. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, with no admission of wrongdoing, no penalties paid and no changes to Kraken’s business. Kraken is one of many firms that stand to benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment in the US under President Donald Trump, who has promised to make America the “crypto capital” of the world. The crypto exchange was founded in 2011 by Thanh Luu, Michael Gronager and former CEO Jesse Powell, who handed the reins over to former data analytics executive Amir Orad last July. Kraken consistently ranks among the top seven to 15 largest crypto exchanges by spot trading volume, handling between $390 million and $4.4 billion in daily trades over the past three months, according to CoinGecko data.

XRP, the digital currency tied to Ripple, has found itself at the center of this conversation, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse offering details into why XRP was not specifically named in President Trump’s executive order for the U.S. digital asset stockpile. Why Was XRP Left Out? During a recent discussion with Bloomberg, Garlinghouse addressed the exclusion of XRP from the executive order that focused on creating a strategic reserve for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “XRP was named by President Trump in a post on Truth Social,” Garlinghouse pointed out, referencing a statement where the former President had discussed the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a broader crypto stockpile that would include other assets like XRP. Despite this, XRP was not specifically mentioned in the executive order itself. “I don’t know what specifically was in the executive order,” Garlinghouse said. “But my understanding is there’s going to be a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and there will be a crypto stockpile representing other cryptos. I would expect that XRP will be included.” Confidence in the Future of XRP and Crypto ETFs Garlinghouse also shared his confidence in the growing momentum of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. He said that there are currently 11 filings pending with the SEC for ETFs, with major firms like Bitwise and Franklin Templeton leading the charge. “I think those will be live in the second half of this year,” he predicted. Despite some outflows from crypto ETFs, Garlinghouse pointed to the increasing inflows into XRP, saying that this is a result of the “false negative pressure” caused by the SEC’s past actions against Ripple. “There’s a kind of exhaustion from the market with the SEC’s actions, and it’s starting to reverse,” he said. This sentiment shift could position XRP to benefit from an evolving regulatory environment and an industry that’s beginning to find its footing within U.S. borders.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 03:17:06

Kraken, founded in 2011, is already a key player in the crypto market, offering trading for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. With this acquisition, Kraken will gain access to NinjaTrader’s 1.9 million active users, boosting its position in the futures market. More importantly, NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant, which means Kraken can now legally offer crypto futures and derivatives in the U.S. This will be a major step in Kraken’s broader strategy of expanding beyond crypto trading into other asset classes, such as equities and payments. How NinjaTrader Benefits ? NinjaTrader, founded in 2003, provides futures trading tools to over 1.8 million customers. Under Kraken, it will gain access to more resources and a wider global market. Kraken reportedly plans to support NinjaTrader’s expansion into the U.K., Europe, and Australia, helping it reach new traders and increase its market influence. While NinjaTrader will become part of Kraken’s trading ecosystem, it is expected to continue operating as a separate platform. A Regulatory Shift Fuels Kraken’s Expansion This acquisition comes at a time when the regulatory environment for crypto is shifting. Under President Trump, the industry expects lighter regulations, and Kraken recently saw the SEC drop a lawsuit against it. The deal with NinjaTrader could mark one of the biggest acquisitions in the crypto space, showing that major players are looking to expand beyond just digital assets. Kraken’s growth has been impressive, with its revenue doubling to $1.5 billion in 2024 and adjusted earnings reaching $380 million.

This will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has addressed a crypto conference. The speech will take place at North Javits and will be streamed live on X and YouTube. The announcement follows comments made earlier this week by Bo Hines, the Executive Director of the White House’s President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, when he confirmed that the U.S. government is actually open to actively acquiring Bitcoin as part of the newly created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Speaking at DAS on Tuesday, Bo told attendees, “It’s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away.” Trump moves Bitcoin into national strategy Trump’s administration has of course made Bitcoin a central part of U.S. financial policy, as earlier this month, he signed an executive order finally creating the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve he promised during campaign. Bo explained once again that the government’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy is similar to how countries stockpile gold reserves, telling the DAS audience, “I’ve been asked all the time, it’s like how much do you want? Well, that’s like asking a country how much gold do you want – as much as we can get.” Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have introduced proposals for the U.S. to acquire 1 million BTC over the next five years. Meanwhile, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, speaking at DAS on Wednesday, said he believes this legislation will pass before the current congressional session ends. Trump will not be the only high-profile name at DAS. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, will deliver a keynote speech and participate in a fireside chat with Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. The discussion is expected to focus on Bitcoin’s role in corporate treasury strategies and its growing adoption among institutions. The event will also include a panel discussion on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart will moderate a discussion featuring BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, and Nasdaq’s Head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, Giang Bui. With Bitcoin ETFs seeing increased approval and mainstream attention, the conversation is likely to cover new financial products and their impact on the market. Trump’s upcoming speech follows his previous Bitcoin-focused engagement at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference in Nashville last year, where he first promised to create the national bitcoin strategic reserve.

This move comes as the Trump administration looks to influence the sector, according to a registration statement filed with the SEC on Friday. SPAC to Raise $179M for Crypto & Defense Acquisitions Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) based in the Cayman Islands, aims to raise at least $179 million through an IPO and private placement. The $179 million fundraising target reflects TMTG’s confidence in the crypto and defense sectors. The funds will be used to acquire companies with strong growth potential and innovative solutions. Renatus Tactical is looking to acquire companies in crypto, blockchain, data security, and dual-use tech—sectors with significant government oversight, as noted in its SEC filing. With Trump appointees in charge of the SEC, DOJ, and FTC, these agencies will oversee the merger process. Strong Ties To Trump Media The company’s leadership has strong ties to Trump Media: CEO Eric Swider is a board member of Trump Media, Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO, chairs Renatus Tactical’s board, and COO Alexander Cano was president and secretary of the firm that merged with Trump Media. Renatus Tactical plans to raise the $178.9 million by offering 17.5 million shares at $10 each and 3.94 million warrants at $1 in a private placement. While the company’s registration outlines its intention to primarily target mergers in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, data security, and dual-use technologies sectors, however, it is also open to pursuing acquisitions in any industry. Trump Ties Could Lead To Challenges? In its SEC filing, Renatus Tactical notes that the current administration has taken significant steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy.

AI (artificial intelligence) is poised to redefine its trajectory. AI agents – already reshaping trading ecosystems and decision-making processes – could catalyze a golden age or accelerate the industry’s decline. The question isn’t whether AI will impact crypto but how we – as professionals, innovators and participants – will adapt to its rise. The rise of AI agents – A market transformed AI agents have moved from niche tools to central players in the crypto landscape. In early March 2024, AI agent tokens barely registered, with a market cap of $2 billion. By January 2025, they approached almost $11 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Platforms like Woo X and 3Commas demonstrate the profound impact of AI on trading. They offer insights and automation that reshape how markets operate. The AI trading bot market, valued at $21.7 million in 2022, is projected to hit $145 million by 2029. These numbers aren’t just statistics – t hey’re a call to action. Ignoring the rise of AI agents risks falling behind in an industry where innovation sets the pace. The convergence of AI and blockchain is also unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger – c ombined with AI’s real-time analytics – is creating a new frontier in financial transparency and security. Together, these technologies streamline processes like KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), ensuring efficiency and compliance while mitigating fraud risks. This synergy further emphasizes the indispensable role AI agents will play in the crypto market . Humans and AI – Partners, not rivals Fears that AI will replace humans in crypto reflect a misunderstanding of its role. AI agents excel at processing data and executing strategies. However, they lack the intuition, creativity and critical thinking that define human expertise. Consider the Walmart-Litecoin fiasco. A fake press release temporarily roiled markets, exposing AI’s limitations in discerning truth from misinformation. Human skepticism quickly uncovered the fraud. This proved that while algorithms are powerful, they require human oversight to navigate complex realities. The future of crypto depends on humans and AI working together. Computational efficiency – paired with contextual judgment – creates a stronger, more reliable ecosystem. Adapting to the new skill set The skills that once defined crypto expertise are no longer sufficient. Understanding blockchain basics or mastering traditional trading tools won’t cut it in a market increasingly driven by AI. Platforms like Woo X have embraced AI-powered social trading. Binance’s listing of AI-focused tokens like SWARMS highlights the shift toward intelligent systems. Professionals who fail to engage with these technologies risk obsolescence. The industry’s evolution demands a new skill set. Integrating AI fluency with crypto knowledge is essential to remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment. Moreover, smart contracts powered by AI are streamlining complex financial processes. These self-executing contracts, enriched with AI algorithms, dynamically adapt to market conditions, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors. This innovation demonstrates the practical advantages of aligning AI with blockchain in crypto operations. Continuous learning – The lifeblood of progress Education is no longer optional. It forms the foundation for relevance in an AI-driven crypto ecosystem. The migration of AI PhDs from academia to industry – falling from 42.1% in 2010 to 23.7% in 2019 – signals the growing demand for specialized expertise. Hedge funds and tech companies offer premiums for AI proficiency. This reflects its critical role in shaping the future. Professionals must embrace lifelong learning to stay ahead. Those who rest on past achievements risk being surpassed by newcomers bringing fresh, AI-informed perspectives. The road ahead – Embrace or obsolescence AI agents represent more than a technological trend. They signify a paradigm shift in how crypto operates. The choice is clear. Adapt, evolve and lead in this new era, or cling to outdated practices and face irrelevance. By embracing AI, the crypto community can actively shape its future. This revolution drives growth and innovation, rather than leaving participants behind. The time to act is now. This isn’t just about survival in a changing market. It’s about thriving in crypto’s next great chapter. Dominick John spearheads market analysis, delivering insights to the marketing and sales teams.

Alternative’s Crypto Fear and Grid index gauges investor sentiment by examining market momentum, volatility, Bitcoin dominance, and social media trends. The shift to neutral sentiment indicates a more balanced view of the market, with investors being neither overly fearful nor excessively greedy Improving sentiment came about as markets reacted positively to the Federal Reserve’s Mar.19 decision to maintain interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, prolonging its pause on rate cuts due to economic uncertainty. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that inflation remains stubbornly high and warned that Trump’s tariffs could prolong the fight against rising prices. While the Fed’s dot plot still projects two rate cuts in 2025, Powell admitted that it’s difficult to assess the full impact of tariffs on inflation. The central bank now projects 1.7% GDP growth, down from 2.1% in December.

At the same time, following five weeks of withdrawals, Bitcoin ETFs have reversed their trend, recording weekly inflows of $483 million, according to SoSoValue data . The launch of Solana ETFs and the renewed demand for Bitcoin investment products both point to improving sentiment and rising institutional interest in digital assets. Despite the Fed’s stable stance, Powell pointed out that consumer spending, a key factor in economic growth, is beginning to slow down. Investors are closely watching inflation trends and possible tariff effects as the market navigates a volatile environment due to the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy.

The coin has taken a major hit, dropping 31% in the past week, and is now testing crucial support levels. Key Price Levels to Watch Currently, Pi Coin is hovering around $1.16, just below the important resistance level at $1.20. The price action in the coming days will likely determine the direction of the coin’s future movement. Possible Rebound? If Pi Coin manages to break above $1.20 and maintain momentum, the coin could see an upward movement toward $1.40 or even $2, offering a glimmer of hope for bulls. Possible Decline? On the other hand, if Pi Coin fails to hold its current position, the price could drop to around $1.05–$1.02. Binance’s Decision and Growing Concerns Compounding Pi Coin’s current struggles, the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently made a decision that has added to the coin’s uncertain future. Binance, known for its “Vote to List” campaigns, excluded Pi Network from the latest campaign, which allowed users to vote on which of the nine nominated projects would be listed on the platform. The decision not to include Pi Network has raised eyebrows, as many in the crypto community had expected the token to be part of the campaign. In an official statement, Binance explained that its “Vote to List” initiative was focused exclusively on projects built on the BNB Smart Chain, which effectively left Pi Coin out of the equation. “Our Vote to List campaign is focused solely on projects on the BNB Smart Chain,” Binance clarified.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the matter, an official announcement is expected as early as Thursday, Mar. 20. Through the acquisition, Kraken will be able to leverage NinjaTrader’s Futures Commission Merchant license to increase the range of cryptocurrency futures and derivatives products it offers in the United States. NinjaTrader, which was established in 2003, serves more than 1.8 million retail investors. The deal would give Kraken access to this user base while also supporting NinjaTrader’s expansion into the UK, Europe, and Australia. Kraken’s regulatory approvals, including its Electronic Money Institution license from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and its MiFID license for the EU, could ease this process.

As per the report, the company holds $42.8 billion in assets and operates 2.5 million funded accounts. It also registered a total trade volume of $665 billion for 2024. The timing of this acquisition aligns with Kraken’s recent legal victory. On Mar. 3, the exchange announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against it with no penalties or admission of wrongdoing.

If we base it on the recent statements of Bo Hines, Trump’s pick to head its Digital Assets section, the industry will soon see an aggressive investment strategy from the US government. Hines shared the department’s plan during a speech at the digital assets summit. He mentioned they plan to invest “as many Bitcoins” as possible. Related Reading: XRP Vs.

During the elections, then-candidate Donald Trump teased the voters with his support for BTC and the blockchain and his plans to push for a crypto stockpile. At the Digital Summit in New York, Hines shared that the passage of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve reflects the president’s commitment to his campaign promise. In his election cycle, the plans for a crypto reserve faced stiff challenges, specifically from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its (former) chair, Gary Gensler. Trump positioned himself as pro-crypto and even promised to fire Gensler if he’s elected. Now that Gensler is out of the picture, Trump is more aggressive in promoting his crypto plans. Planned SBR Highlights Crypto’s Uniqueness In the same speech, Hines explained that the planned Strategic Reserve respects and promotes the digital asset’s unique features. For a start, Hines argued that the SBR is solely for Bitcoin and not for other altcoins like Cardano and Ripple’s XRP. Also, Hines shared how the department sees Bitcoin. According to the executive director, they see Bitcoin as a commodity, not a security. He said that Bitcoin has an “intrinsic store of value”. Hines also said that in Trump’s executive order, Bitcoin is compared to digital gold. Hines Calls On US Government To Invest More In BTC Hines highlighted many of Bitcoin’s unique features and claimed that the US government must hold and continue investing in Bitcoin. The current administration’s policies on Bitcoin and crypto assets starkly contrast with the Biden presidency, which exited its Bitcoin holdings and lost $17 billion. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It’s Lift-Off Time Hines shared that the government’s aim is to start building its Bitcoin holdings instead of liquidating them.

The deal comes at a time when industry trends are shifting, with many players looking to capture opportunities across various asset classes including equities and derivatives. Market analysts suggest that this acquisition could serve as a catalyst for further innovation in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The SEC, which initially filed the lawsuit in December 2020 over claims that Ripple’s XRP was an unregistered security, has now dropped its appeal, marking a major shift in the legal battle. Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, Garlinghouse clarified that the case isn’t fully over. A cross-appeal is still pending, but the situation has changed. “We go from being the defendant to the plaintiff,” he said. “Now, we’re in the driver’s seat, deciding how we want to proceed.” Ripple’s Legal Victory Sets Industry Precedent Notably, this decision has been seen as a win not only for Ripple but for the broader cryptocurrency industry, as it set a precedent that could influence future regulatory decisions. Following this news, FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared in an X post that following the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal against Ripple, the crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial plans to dismiss its lawsuit against the SEC.

(Analyst Weighs In),https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-the-crypto-market-escape-its-stagnation-analyst-weighs-in/,"The crypto market is stuck in “no man’s land,” with stagnation and speculation shaping its uncertain future. This is according to crypto analyst Aylo, who says the sector is struggling to find direction, with prices dropping significantly and triggers for bull runs becoming rare. Stagnation and Weak Demand Weigh on Crypto In a lengthy post on X, Aylo said that outside of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the market has barely seen any growth in the last four years. Trading volumes have also stalled, and the overall market cap has failed to register any meaningful growth. He also decried the lack of strong narratives and projects with real utility, saying the situation has hindered momentum and raised concerns about long-term investor confidence. “We are lacking narratives and projects that people actually believe in (tokens that people actually want to buy and hold),” the expert wrote. Adding to the uncertainty, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently warned that Bitcoin’s bull cycle may have already ended . He said the next 6 to 12 months could experience a sideways or bearish trend. The number one cryptocurrency’s price has fallen more than 23% from its January high of $109,000, with liquidity inflows also slowing. Furthermore, the selling pressure from investors who recently accumulated BTC but are now offloading at lower prices has worsened the downturn. In Aylo’s opinion, Bitcoin’s fate is intertwined with macroeconomic factors. He observed that the asset has often struggled to rally independently of stock market movements, a view that fellow analyst CrediBULL previously downplayed . While gold has historically performed well in uncertain conditions, BTC is still treated as a short-term risk asset. However, the market watcher contended that if the precious metal sustains the multi-month uptrend that saw it break beyond $3,000 to register a new all-time high, the cryptocurrency could eventually follow suit. Meanwhile, data from CryptoQuant indicates resilience is building among Bitcoin owners. The number of those holding the asset for 3 to 6 months has increased, suggesting long-term investors remain confident even with prices fluctuating. Institutional Adoption and Regulation Offer Hope Despite the sluggishness in the market, some observers believe upcoming regulatory changes could offer a much-needed boost. Reacting to Aylo’s post, Ignas, a decentralized finance (DeFi) expert, pointed out that institutional players are changing strategies. He mentioned Coinbase’s new KYC pools for tokenized assets and increased stablecoin involvement from major firms like Revolut and PayPal as signs of a shifting crypto landscape. At the same time, the U.S. government’s mellowing stance on digital assets could shape market direction. A user noted that improved regulations might benefit quality projects, even though broader market activity will likely remain muted until traditional financial markets stabilize.

After the Federal Reserve’s statement confirmed that the US central bank intended to leave interest rates unchanged in its target range between 4.25% and 4.5%, Bitcoin’s price barely moved, as the market had already widely expected no change in the interest rate. However, after Fed chair Jerome Powell said the probability of a recession is “not high,” despite independent economists raising the odds of one, the overall crypto market saw an upswing, leaving traders betting on the downside caught off guard. “A guaranteed recipe to lose money,” MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said in a March 19 X post. CoinGlass data, which tracks a 12-hour window, shows $188.77 million was liquidated from the crypto market, with $127.80 million of that being short positions. Approximately $257.03 million in short positions have been liquidated over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged 3.84% in six hours after Powell’s speech to hit $87,427 before pulling back to $85,760 by publication. Ether ( ETH ) climbed 2.27% in the same period, while XRP ( XRP ) gained 2.40%, adding to its 7.50% rally leading into the interest rate announcement, according to CoinMarketCap data. “The initial statement isn’t as important. The words from J. Powell are,” van de Poppe said, adding, “That’s what likely defines Bitcoin price action for the coming period.” Bitcoin is up 3.49% over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Related: Bitcoin risks new 'death cross' as BTC price tackles $84K resistance Crypto analyst says the Bitcoin rally will not continue in the near term Crypto trading account BitcoinHyper said , “FOMC meeting made Bitcoin pump directly into the big liquidation level.” “Even if BTC goes higher, this is not a good level to look for new long positions,” the trading account said. Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, made a similar forecast, saying that while the US Federal Reserve’s “dovish shift” on interest rates could give Bitcoin a short-term boost, it may not be sustainable. “Bitcoin is likely to remain in consolidation mode until a clear catalyst emerges,” Mena said. “Looking further ahead, the broader macro environment remains supportive of a bullish case for BTC,” Mena said in a statement viewed by Cointelegraph. According to Powell, the median forecast from FOMC members is that interest rates will be at 3.9% at the end of 2025 and 3.4% at the end of 2026.

April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held its meeting on Wednesday and decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25%-4.5% for the second straight time. But economic forecasts are shifting. The Fed cut its growth projection to 1.7%, down from 2.1% just a few months ago. At the same time, inflation expectations jumped to 2.8%, up from the previous 2.5% estimate. This means the U.S. economy could be facing stagflation, a combination of slow growth and rising prices. Federal Reserve warns of economic risks The FOMC acknowledged the uncertainty, saying the risks around the economic outlook have increased. Officials also made it clear that they are closely watching inflation and economic growth, but they didn’t move to cut rates just yet. Inflation concerns are growing as Trump’s trade policies start hitting American businesses. Tariffs on major U.S. trading partners are expected to raise costs for companies and consumers, making everything more expensive. Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed this issue, saying, “Inflation has started to move up now. We think partly in response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.” He also noted that businesses and households are showing “significant large rising uncertainty and significant concerns about downside risks.” Despite inflation concerns, the Fed still expects to cut rates twice before the end of 2025. The dot plot, which shows where officials expect interest rates to be, now predicts a 3.9% rate by year-end, meaning a target range of 3.75%-4%. But not everyone agrees. In January, only one official opposed rate cuts, but now four FOMC members believe rates should stay where they are for the rest of the year. Markets react as investors watch economic data Stock markets moved after the Federal Reserve confirmed it still plans to cut rates later this year. Dow Jones futures went up 71 points, S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Markets have been trying to recover from losses that started in February. On Wednesday, the Dow gained 0.9%, the S&P 500 jumped 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.4%. But the Nasdaq is still in correction territory, meaning it remains more than 10% below its high. The S&P 500, which briefly slipped into correction last week, is now 7% off its record high and could break its four-week losing streak. Some investors aren’t too worried about inflation just yet. Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said , “The market reaction, to me, says that investors are willing to believe that tariffs and other policies won’t create lasting inflationary pressures and that the Fed can stay in control.” Earlier this month, Trump warned that the economy could go through a “period of transition” as his tariff policies take effect. He temporarily lifted duties on some Canadian and Mexican imports, but that exemption is set to expire on April 2. Now, investors are waiting for more data. Weekly jobless claims, the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing survey, and a report on existing home sales are all scheduled for release on Thursday.

The rush of getting in early, the anticipation of the next price surge — it’s all part of the adventure. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is capturing this excitement as it blazes through its presale stages, turning heads with its unique narrative and rapid growth. While Arctic Pablo Coin has been making waves, other cryptos like Sudeng and Brett are also making headlines with fresh updates. Whether it’s cutting-edge tech or community-driven growth, these coins are creating a buzz across the crypto landscape. This article covers the latest on Arctic Pablo Coin, Sudeng, and Brett — three top meme coins to buy for 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Fiery Token Burn Mechanism — Top New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s most intriguing features is its powerful token burn mechanism. Unlike many other projects, APC actively reduces its total supply during the presale, making each coin rarer as time passes. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, intensifying scarcity and potentially driving value. But that’s not all — after the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will be burned as well. This approach builds a deflationary environment designed to reward long-term holders. To ensure full transparency, every burn transaction is recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), allowing investors to track the process in real-time. As Arctic Pablo Coin keeps burning tokens, its allure as a top new meme coin to buy for 2025 grows stronger. Arctic Pablo Coin Reaches Nippy Nook — Meme Coin Presale Turning Heads Arctic Pablo Coin has reached an electrifying milestone in its adventure: the 15th phase, aptly named Nippy Nook. This project has been traveling through unique locations, each marking a new stage in the meme coin presale. The previous 14 locations were explored faster than anyone anticipated, proving just how much demand APC is generating. Right now, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000079, with a jaw-dropping ROI of 10,027.85% from Nippy Nook to the listing price of $0.008. Over $1.94 million has already been raised, and the price is set to rise as Arctic Pablo Coin enters each new location. Nippy Nook won’t last forever — with APC’s track record, it’s clear this is a rare chance to get in before the next price hike. Sudeng Unleashes Game-Changing Smart Contracts Sudeng has taken a bold step forward with the recent launch of its advanced smart contracts. These contracts aim to revolutionize transaction efficiency and security, positioning Sudeng as more than just a meme coin. The update has sparked interest across the crypto space, with analysts praising its ability to streamline processes while maintaining decentralization. As the Sudeng community grows, this latest development strengthens its foundation and sets the stage for broader adoption. Many believe Sudeng’s smart contracts could pave the way for its evolution beyond memes, potentially transforming into a serious player in the DeFi arena. Brett’s Bold Community Expansion Takes Center Stage Brett Coin has made headlines with its aggressive community expansion strategy. The project recently launched a series of initiatives aimed at onboarding new members, from online competitions to influencer collaborations. This move has not only increased engagement but also positioned Brett as one of the most dynamic meme coins in the market. With its strong focus on building a loyal following, Brett continues to harness the power of its community to drive growth. As interest peaks, many are keeping a close eye on Brett’s next move, eager to see how this bold expansion unfolds. The Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out in the Meme Coin Presale Arena As the meme coin market evolves, Arctic Pablo Coin , Sudeng, and Brett each offer unique opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s ongoing presale sets it apart, especially with the Nippy Nook phase heating up. Its token burn mechanism, thrilling journey through unique locations, and rapid presale progress make it a standout in the list of top new meme coins to buy for 2025. As prices are set to rise soon, this could be the last chance to secure APC at such a low entry point before its next explosive move. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What makes Arctic Pablo Coin unique among meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out due to its location-based presale and token burn mechanism, reducing supply and enhancing long-term value. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s token burn work? Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly during the presale, creating scarcity and potentially boosting value. What is the current price of Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin is currently priced at $0.000079, with an ROI of over 10,027.85% from the Nippy Nook phase to the listing price. Why is Sudeng gaining attention in the crypto world?

Mitchnick said Bitcoin ( BTC ) is catalyzed by increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus — all of which tend to happen in recessions. “And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick pointed out. “And that too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” 🚨 LATEST: BlackRock Global Head of Digital Assets Robbie Mitchnick says, “If you look at Bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis, it really seems like an asset that should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors that exist.” pic.twitter.com/bC0zKqF3xB — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 19, 2025 The BlackRock executive said the market is “not particularly well calibrated” to Bitcoin, and many still view it as a risk-on asset . Risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities and high-yield bonds, tend to suffer during times of economic crises, but Mitchnick said in September that he believed the asset was mislabeled. “But that’s where the opportunity comes in for education in a market and asset class that’s still very nascent.” Mitchnick said BlackRock has been helping some of its clients see through some of these conflicting narratives. He added that some of BlackRock’s more “sophisticated long-term Bitcoin accumulator” clients see the market correction as a buying opportunity and aren’t bothered by the current economic headwinds. Meanwhile, researchers from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase were less bullish, saying crypto’s positive outlook for the first quarter had “clearly been misplaced” by recession fears and the recent tariffs imposed. “Fears of a dramatic US economic slowdown or even recession have caused sentiment to turn sharply,” Coinbase Institutional said in its monthly outlook report on March 17. Related: Crypto market’s biggest risks in 2025: US recession, circular crypto economy BlackRock has played a key role in the institutional and wealth advisory adoption of Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF — which holds the most net assets of any Bitcoin investment product at $48.7 billion. Mitchnick isn’t worried about the mass net outflows across most spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds of late — pointing out that it has mostly come from hedge funds’ unwinding of the spot futures arbitrage trade, not the long-term buy-and-hold investors. Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,000, up 3.8% over the last 24 hours.

While the Fed Chair’s comment had lifted the markets above the bearish influence, the win bolstered the upswing. In the meantime, the launch of a new ETF is expected to circulate bullish waves across the markets. This suggests a potential end to the ongoing bearish influence over the crypto markets. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana ETFs are set to launch in the US tomorrow. With this, the SOL price rally could take off soon. Florida-based Volatility Shares LLC is launching a pair of funds tracking Solana futures. The Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) will track Solana futures, while the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT) will offer twice the leveraged exposure. With this, crypto veterans and market participants have turned bullish on Solana, which is testing resistance at $133. Now, the question arises as to whether the price will manage to breach the crucial resistance zone that has been providing strong support since March 2024? The SOL price remains under the bearish influence after breaking down the rising parallel channel in the weekly timeframe. In the short term, the price is trying to break the resistance that has been a strong barrier since the start of the month. This has formed a double-bottom pattern or the w-shaped pattern, which results in a strong upswing if the price breaks the neckline. The RSI is forming consecutive higher highs and lows, suggesting the growing strength of the bulls. Hence, a rise above the resistance may elevate the levels to $150, while a rise above $160 validates a momental shift. With this, one can expect the SOL price to reach $200. Until then, the token may continue to consolidate below the pivotal range.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 04:56:19

The Chicago-based firm said in a March 19 statement to X that its XRP ( XRP ) futures are regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will be available from March 20 for current users. “Bitnomial is launching the first-ever CFTC-regulated XRP futures in the US — physically settled for real market impact,” Bitnomial said. “Plus, we’ve voluntarily dismissed our case against the SEC as regulatory clarity improves,” it added. Source: Bitnomial The exchange filed a self-certification with the CFTC to list XRP futures contracts on its exchange in August 2024 . However, the SEC blocked the move, pushing for Bitnomial to register as a securities exchange before it could list the futures. Bitnomial sued the SEC and its five commissioners on Oct. 10, accusing the agency of overextending its jurisdiction by claiming that XRP is a security. Bitnomial’s XRP futures launch follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s March 19 announcement the SEC opted out of continuing an appeal against a ruling that found XRP is only a security for retail sales. A July 13, 2023 judgment from Judge Analisa Torres deemed XRP is not a security for retail sales ; however, she opined it was when sold to institutional investors, as it met the conditions set in the Howey test. The SEC was appealing Torres’s decision. The SEC initially launched legal action against Ripple Labs in December 2020 , accusing the firm of illegally selling its token as an unregistered security.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the news and celebrated the decision, marking a key victory for Ripple . Following the announcement, XRP saw a price surge , gaining more than 10% and peaking at $2.57. However, the excitement was short-lived, with the price now stabilizing at $2.47 as the market adjusts. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , as of now, XRP continues to experience a larger bearish divergence on the 3-day time frame. This trend has been actively playing out for several months, with a consistent expectation of limited bullish momentum. While short-term price action may show occasional bullish moves, the overall technical outlook suggests that XRP is unlikely to see upward momentum anytime soon. Short-Term Positive Price Action: A Bounce from Key Support XRP has bounced off a previous resistance level and successfully flipped it into new support. This is a positive price structure, indicating that the market may see short-term recovery. The key support zone for XRP is between the $2.25–$2.30 range. The fact that XRP has held this level and bounced from it suggests some stability in the short-term outlook. Resistance Levels to Watch As XRP pushes higher, the next resistance to watch lies in the $2.60–$2.80 range. Previous resistance levels in this range will likely continue to exert downward pressure. Specifically, the $2.65 and $2.80 levels will be critical for determining whether XRP can maintain momentum beyond this point. Additionally, if XRP breaks through these resistance zones, the $3 mark will likely be the next major hurdle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Ends: What’s Next for XRP Price and Ripple’s Future? , RSI Indicator: Potential Overbought Conditions Ahead? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an important tool to watch during this rally. Right now, the RSI is getting close to overbought levels, which suggests XRP may be near its peak for the short term. In the past, when the RSI reached these levels, it often led to a small price drop. While there’s still some room for XRP to rise, the increasing RSI may signal it’s approaching a resistance point, which could cause the price to cool down. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Price Movement XRP’s price is also closely tied to Bitcoin’s movements. If Bitcoin continues to see bullish momentum , XRP is likely to follow suit with positive price action. However, if Bitcoin experiences a decline, XRP may also face downward pressure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42026948,https://coingape.com/?p=244944,1742447761,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Bitcoin Price Rally Ahead As Fed Rate Cuts to Start April 1, Says Arthur Hayes",https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-rally-ahead-as-fed-rate-cuts-to-start-april-1-says-arthur-hayes/,"Bitcoin price has surged 3.5% following Wednesday’s FOMC meeting as the US Federal Reserve keeps rates unchanged at 4.5%. However, Arthur Hayes predicts that the Fed rate cuts would likely resume from April 1, which could bode well for BTC and the overall crypto market, moving ahead. Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price Bottom and Fed Rate Cuts Commenting on the reaction of the crypto market following the FOMC meeting , BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated that the recent Bitcoin price drop to $77,000 could mark its bottom. Hayes noted the conclusion of QT (quantitative tightening) by April 1, as well as the potential for bullish momentum fueled by either an exemption to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) or the resumption of QE (quantitative easing). Hayes also predicted that the correction in the US equity market could continue in order to push Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell toward adopting policies favorable to the Trump administration. “Stay nimble and cashed up,” Hayes advised. In a post on Truth Social, US President Donald Trump wrote : The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!! BTC Action and M2 Money Supply Following yesterday’s FOMC meeting, Bitcoin price staged a quick recovery jumping 3.5% and moving all the way to $87,000. Popular analyst IncomeSharks noted that BTC has bounced back from the supertrend support. However, for BTC to resume the uptrend, it must close above the diagonal resistance of $86,351. Source: IncomeSharks Furthermore, the Bitcoin price action could soon follow the M2 money supply which has been rising recently. M2 is expected to grow over time for various reasons, and its high correlation with Bitcoin, combined with a power-law leverage factor of 9, indicates that even small changes in liquidity can have a substantial impact on BTC price. Also, the BTC price prediction data shows it moving to $90,000 by mid-April. For instance, a 10% increase in liquidity could result in more than doubling BTC price. On the other hand, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have resumed once again with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the show. Apart from Bitcoin, altcoins have also shown strength following the FOMC meeting. Top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have bounced back 4-10% in the last 24 hours. Will the US Fed End QT In April? As the Trump trade war impact intensifies putting American economy on a slowdown, some market analysts believe that the Fed could be the first to blink. While addressing the media on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated: “The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the Fed Funds Rate will be 3.9% at the end of this year and 3.4% at the end of next year, unchanged from December.” Responding to Arthur Hayes, popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen refuted that quantitative tightening (QT) will conclude by April 1. Addressing the matter, Cowen clarified that while QT has been adjusted, it is far from over. “QT is not ‘basically over’ on April 1,” Cowen stated. He explained that the Federal Reserve is still reducing its balance sheet by $35 billion per month through mortgage-backed securities. Although the pace of QT has slowed from $60 billion per month to $40 billion per month, the process remains ongoing.

The SEC has officially dropped its case against Ripple , marking a huge win for the crypto community. But just as the dust settles, Ripple CEO brad garlinghouse brad garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of the financial technology company Ripple Labs, he is an extremely popular name across the global crypto landscape. He has previously served as the CEO of Hightail, a file-sharing service, and is also an active angel investor. He joined Ripple as COO in April 2015, answering to the CEO and prime supporter, Chris Larsen. He was elevated to CEO in December 2016. Initially, he worked at AOL and Yahoo! From 2003 to 2008, he filled in as Senior Vice President at Yahoo!, where he ran its Homepage, Flickr, Yahoo! Mail, and Yahoo! Courier divisions. While at Yahoo!, he wrote an inner update known as the ""Peanut Butter Manifesto,"" requiring the organization to zero in on its core business instead of extending itself excessively far, much like peanut butter.Details:Organization: RippleLocation: United StatesEducation: MBA from Harvard Business School and BA from The University of KansasSkills: Venture capital and StartupsExperience:CEO at Ripplefrom from Jan 2017 - Present ·President and COO at Ripple logo from Apr 2015 - Dec 2016Board Member at Animoto from 2012 - Dec 2017Tonic Health, an R1 company logoBoard Member at Tonic Health from 2011-2016Board Member at Ancestry from 2013 - 2016CEO at Hightail from May 2012 - Sep 2014FAQsWho is Brad Garlinghouse?The CEO of Ripple, a financial technology business that specializes in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency XRP, is Brad Garlinghouse. He has played a significant role in advancing cross-border payments using blockchain technology.What is Brad Garlinghouse's role at Ripple?Garlinghouse is in charge of Ripple's expansion and strategic direction in his capacity as CEO. Ripple has concentrated on using blockchain technology to enhance international payment networks under his direction. Entrepreneur Investor Chief Executive Officer Board Member has made another big statement—hinting that the company might cut back on XRP sales in the future. This comes at a time when Ripple is gaining momentum , shaking off legal hurdles, and setting its sights on bigger goals in the crypto world. Less XRP Selling in the Future? In an interview with Bloomberg, Garlinghouse responded to criticism about Ripple’s XRP sales. He acknowledged that while the company currently holds 42% of XRP’s total supply, there may be a time when they “won’t be selling as much.” He also dismissed claims from critics, calling them “falsehoods” and pointing out that Ripple is often criticized for both holding and selling XRP. XRP army in disbelief. Ripple sells XRP as revenue, an operating cash inflow. It’s not financing, you are not investing in Ripple, you’re just getting tokens created out of thin air dumped on you. Ripple doesn’t owe you anything post-sale. pic.twitter.com/jUtqGW4UJN — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) March 4, 2025 Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms also said previously that Ripple sells XRP purely for revenue, not as an investment. He claims XRP holders aren’t investing in Ripple but are simply buying tokens that are continuously sold into the market. According to him, these tokens are created out of thin air, and Ripple has no obligations to buyers after the sale. His comments add fuel to the long-running debate over Ripple’s XRP sales and their impact on the market. SEC Steps Back, Ripple Moves Forward Ripple recently scored a major win as the SEC decided to drop its appeal against the company, a move that Garlinghouse says has given Ripple much-needed clarity. However, Ripple isn’t backing down entirely, as it is still pursuing its own cross-appeal against the regulator. Garlinghouse believes this puts Ripple in “the driver’s seat” and allows the company to be on the offense rather than the defense. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Ends: What’s Next for XRP Price and Ripple’s Future? , Big Plans for Ripple’s Stablecoin Ripple isn’t just focused on XRP—it’s also making moves in the stablecoin space.

This comes after RLUSD was recently added to LMAX Digital, signaling big ambitions for Ripple’s regulated digital currency.

With a $2.9 trillion comeback, investors are now eyeing potential rate cuts after the Fed tweaked its GDP forecast. This decision comes as the central bank continues to monitor economic conditions, inflation, and job growth. The Fed now expects fewer rate cuts this year, with only 11 out of 19 FOMC members seeing at least two cuts, down from 15 in December. Slower Reduction of Balance Sheet Starts in April Crypto analyst MartyParty highlights that the Federal Reserve will slow Quantitative Tightening (QT) starting April 1st, just as he predicted. This means the Fed will reduce the pace of balance sheet reductions, signaling a shift in monetary policy. FOMC Statement: I called it. QT starts ending April 1st. pic.twitter.com/wp9zh8PTe9 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) March 19, 2025 As per the plans, they will cut monthly Treasury redemptions from $25 billion to $5 billion while keeping the limit for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at $35 billion. This move is aimed at maintaining financial stability while gradually reducing the Fed’s holdings. Crypto Impact One crypto analyst Fefe Demeny points out that Quantitative Tightening (QT) isn’t ending soon, despite some crypto traders expecting a bull run once Quantitative Easing (QE) begins. While, Powell confirmed that the Fed will slow QT again but extend it for a longer period, meaning liquidity won’t flood back into the markets as quickly as some hoped. Santiment highlighted that though Powell confirmed expectations for two rate cuts later this year, economic growth is now projected to slow to 1.7%, down from the previous 2.1% forecast. Inflation remains a concern, especially with new tariffs potentially delaying price stability. Following the announcement, both crypto and equities reacted positively, with Santiment noting that crypto markets may continue to mirror the S&P 500, though altcoins could experience increased volatility. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media Execs Launch SPAC to Raise $179M Targeting Crypto & Tech , Meanwhile, The crypto market rebounded before the Fed meeting, hitting a $2.9T market cap.

Powell Warns of Inflation and Consumer Weakness However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the U.S. economy remains strong, but there are signs that consumers may be struggling. Inflation, while lower than before, is still somewhat high. Powell also warned that new tariffs and global economic shifts could slow down progress in reducing inflation. However, he reassured that the Fed will closely monitor the situation and adjust policies if needed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42027586,https://coinpaper.com/8105/first-us-solana-futures-et-fs-to-launch-as-institutional-interest-grows,1742448600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,First US Solana Futures ETFs to Launch as Institutional Interest Grows,https://coinpaper.com/8105/first-us-solana-futures-et-fs-to-launch-as-institutional-interest-grows,"Solana has found itself at the center of two major developments this week, highlighting both its growing institutional adoption and the challenges of brand messaging in a rapidly evolving industry. On one front, Volatility Shares is set to launch the first-ever Solana futures ETFs in the US, marking a significant milestone for the network's institutional presence. Meanwhile, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko has addressed backlash over a controversial advertisement that drew criticism for its political undertones, reaffirming the project’s commitment to open-source development and decentralization. Volatility Shares to Launch First Solana Futures ETFs in the US, Signaling Institutional Adoption Volatility Shares is set to launch two Solana futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 20. These ETFs, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), mark the first Solana -based ETFs in the United States, offering investors new avenues to gain exposure to the fast-growing blockchain network. The launch of these ETFs follows the recent debut of Solana futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, signaling increasing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the standard SOLZ ETF will feature a 0.95% management fee until June 30, 2026, after which it will increase to 1.15%. Meanwhile, the SOLT ETF, which offers investors 2x leveraged exposure to Solana, will carry a 1.85% management fee. These ETFs will allow traditional investors to access Solana futures contracts without directly holding the cryptocurrency, similar to the structure used by Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. The ability to trade SOL ETFs on major US exchanges could significantly impact market liquidity, price discovery, and institutional adoption. The development comes at a time when the SEC is facing a leadership transition and increased political interest in cryptocurrency regulation. Following Donald Trump’s reelection as US President, ETF firms and asset managers have flooded the SEC with ETF applications, reflecting optimism that the new administration may be more open to crypto-based financial products. The launch of the CME Group’s Solana futures on March 17 set the stage for the ETF approval. While the first day of SOL futures trading recorded approximately $12.1 million in volume, this figure was significantly lower than Bitcoin’s $102 million debut and Ethereum’s $30 million launch volume in their respective futures markets. Despite the lower initial volume, analysts believe the introduction of SOL futures contracts will play a crucial role in boosting institutional demand and fostering a more stable price discovery mechanism for Solana. Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan, emphasized that the CME’s recognition of SOL futures indicates that Solana has matured into an asset class that institutional investors can confidently engage with. Chung also noted that these developments position Solana not just as a network for meme coins but as a blockchain with real-world applications, including payments and financial services. With Bitcoin ETFs attracting billions in institutional investment in 2024, many market participants believe that altcoin ETFs could spark a new wave of capital inflows into alternative digital assets. Since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, institutional capital has largely remained concentrated within Bitcoin, leading to stagnation in altcoin markets. A Solana ETF, however, could change that trend, creating a sustained rally for SOL while leaving other altcoins without ETF access at a disadvantage. The launch of futures-based ETFs is often seen as a precursor to spot ETF approval, much like the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If demand for SOL ETFs grows, it could prompt asset managers to pursue spot Solana ETFs, offering direct exposure to SOL rather than futures contracts. Solana’s Growing Institutional Legitimacy Solana has long been recognized for its high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it a preferred blockchain for NFTs, DeFi, and payments. With the introduction of ETFs and CME futures, the network is further solidifying its place in the institutional crypto landscape. This move also reflects a shift in financial regulators’ stance toward digital assets, as they increase their willingness to integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional investment vehicles. The next few months will be pivotal in assessing whether SOL ETFs gain traction among institutional investors, but early signs suggest that Solana’s presence in the mainstream financial market is only beginning to unfold. Solana Labs CEO Apologizes for Controversial Ad, Vows to Keep Solana Out of Cultural Wars In related news, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko has publicly addressed the growing backlash over a controversial advertisement that blended American patriotism, tech innovation, and political messaging around gender identity. The ad, titled ”America Is Back — Time to Accelerate,” aired briefly before being deleted, but not before it amassed 1.2 million views and sparked heated debates within the crypto community. Taking to X on March 19, Yakovenko admitted the ad was a mistake and expressed regret over his initial response. “The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul,” Yakovenko stated, acknowledging that he initially downplayed the controversy instead of calling it out for what it was. He went on to say he was ashamed for not condemning the ad outright, describing it as ”mean and punching down on a marginalized group.” The advertisement, which was intended to promote the Solana Accelerate conference, featured a man representing America in a therapy session, lamenting his struggles with innovation. The therapist, in turn, dismissed his concerns and suggested that he focus on gender identity issues instead. The exchange ended with the character snapping back, ”I want to invent technologies, not genders.” The ad received immediate criticism, with many in the crypto space calling it a tone-deaf political statement that clashed with Solana’s brand identity. The backlash was strong enough that the post was deleted within nine hours, but by then, the damage had already been done. Some critics pointed out the hypocrisy of the ad appearing just nine days after Solana’s X account had tweeted: ”Solana is for everyone.” Others argued that crypto should remain politically neutral, focusing on open-source innovation rather than divisive culture wars. Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran was among those who criticized the ad, pointing out that transgender and non-binary developers have made significant contributions to open-source software and cryptography. He referenced a 2017 GitHub survey that found that 1% of open-source developers were transgender and another 1% were non-binary, a number that is disproportionately high compared to their estimated population share of 0.1% to 0.6%. Despite the controversy, Yakovenko commended the Solana community members who were quick to call out the ad, ensuring that the project remains focused on its core values. “I will use this as a learning experience to ensure Solana stays focused on open-source software development and decentralization while staying out of cultural wars,” he stated. Solana’s official X account reshared Yakovenko’s post to its 3.3 million followers, signaling alignment with his apology, but the organization has yet to release an official statement of its own. Solana’s Future: Staying on Mission? Yakovenko’s response indicates that Solana intends to distance itself from divisive social debates, refocusing on its blockchain ecosystem. The project has seen significant growth in recent years, with increased institutional adoption, new DeFi projects, and an expanding NFT marketplace. However, this incident serves as a cautionary tale for crypto brands navigating the intersection of technology and politics. While some companies actively engage in political and social discourse, others—especially in decentralized communities—may find that such engagement alienates portions of their user base.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-20 05:30:00

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/is-ethereum-breaking-free-from-the-bear-trap-analysts-weigh-in/,"According to an X post by crypto analyst CryptoGoos, Ethereum (ETH) may be nearing the end of a bear trap. The analyst predicts that the cryptocurrency could surge past its recent range high of $4,000, potentially eyeing a new all-time high (ATH) of $10,000. Ethereum Breaking Out Of The Bear Trap? Ethereum appears poised to break free from a potential bear trap, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap continues to trade in the low $2,000 range after enduring a strong sell-off since December 2024. Related Reading: Historical Pattern From 2020 Hints Ethereum Could Be Poised For A Parabolic Rally, Analysts Explain For the uninitiated, a bear trap refers to a false signal that makes it seem like an asset’s price is continuing to fall, tempting traders to short it – only for the price to suddenly reverse and rise, causing those short positions to get liquidated. In a recent X post, CryptoGoos emphasized that ETH may be nearing the end of such a trap. The analyst shared an ETH weekly chart illustrating how the cryptocurrency could be on the brink of a trend reversal after months of relentless sell-offs. Fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader echoed CryptoGoos’ sentiment, highlighting similarities between ETH’s current price action and patterns seen in 2020. He noted that the last time this setup emerged, “panic turned into a historic rally.” Crypto investor Rekt Capital also weighed in, pointing out that Ethereum is trading within a “historical demand area.” The investor stated: If price can generate a strong enough reaction here, then #ETH will be able to reclaim the $2196-$3900 Macro Range (black). If ETH does this before the March Monthly Close, then this entire sub-$2200 downside would end up as a downside wick. ETH About To Exit Accumulation Phase Seasoned crypto commentator Ted shared a chart indicating that ETH has broken out of its short-term accumulation phase. He explained that the digital asset has been in accumulation since its drop from $3,000 to $1,800. Ted added that sustained price action above $2,000 could ignite a significant price rally. Noted analyst Daan Crypto Trades revealed that he recently converted some of his long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holdings into ETH for the “first time in years.” He cited the current ETH/BTC trading pair as presenting an attractive risk/reward setup. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed – Will ETH Soar Again? Beyond bullish price action, several technical indicators are signaling a potential ETH rally in the near term. Notably, ETH’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently hit a multi-year low – a sign that a trend reversal could be imminent. However, rising ETH reserves on crypto exchanges remain a point of caution, as they could suppress bullish momentum if investors opt to sell. At press time, ETH trades at $2,029, up 7.8% in the past 24 hours.

The firm aims to raise about $179 million to acquire businesses in cryptocurrency, blockchain, data security, and dual-use technology. According to a Forbes report published on Mar. 20, Renatus Tactical’s leadership has close ties to Trump Media. CEO Eric Swider is a Trump Media board member and previously led the firm that merged with it. Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO, chairs Renatus Tactical’s board, while COO Alexander Cano was also involved in the Trump Media merger. Renatus Tactical has planned to raise $178.9 million by selling 17.5 million shares at $10 each in an initial public offering. Additionally, it will offer 3.94 million warrants at $1 each through a private placement. The company is targeting industries with strong government oversight, a factor that could be influenced by Trump- appointed regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, and Federal Trade Commission.

However, it also acknowledged that some businesses might be reluctant to work with the company because of its ties to Trump Media and Trump. Renatus Tactical now faces the challenge of securing investor confidence while managing political and regulatory concerns. This launch coincides with Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto sector. On Mar. 13, his World Liberty Financial project announced it had raised $250 million in its second token sale, bringing total sales to $550 million since launching last October. Reports suggest that the Trump family could receive up to 75% of net revenue.

The trio is targeting a $179 million public and private offering through the Cayman Islands-based special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, according to a March 14 regulatory filing first reported by Forbes. Renatus Tactical’s CEO, Eric Swider, is a director at Trump Media and was the CEO at Digital World Acquisition Corp., a SPAC that merged with the firm, allowing it to go public. Renatus Tactical’s operating chief, Alexander Cano, was Digital World’s president, while Trump Media CEO and chair Devin Nunes also chairs Renatus Tactical. Renatus Tactical wasn’t specific about what it was looking to buy. It said it could acquire “one or more businesses” and is also looking to invest in data security and technology used for both military and non-military applications. It said it could pursue a business in any of the industries anywhere in the world but intends to focus its search “on high-potential businesses based in the United States.” Renatus Tactical aims to raise over $178.94 million through 17.5 million public shares at $10 each and over 3.94 million private placement warrants at $1 each. Source: SEC In the filing, Renatus Tactical said US President Donald Trump’s administration “has taken unprecedented steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy,” citing Trump’s early March executive order to create both a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve and a crypto stockpile and his January order tasking a working group to propose crypto laws . Related: Kraken nears $1.5B deal allowing it to offer US crypto futures: Report However, the company said that its Trump ties could be a problem, as some “may not want to engage with us to provide services due to the affiliation of our management team and our board of directors” with Trump and Trump Media. That’s been an issue for car maker Tesla, which has seen its share price tank over 40% this year due in part to its CEO Elon Musk taking up a role as White House cost-cutting czar, which has sparked attacks that have burned Tesla cars and vandalized dealerships across the US. Trump has a majority stake in Trump Media which runs the social media platform Truth Social. Forbes estimates that Trump is worth about $4.8 billion, while Bloomberg has put his wealth at over $6.5 billion, but both said his 114.75 million shares in Trump Media account for the bulk of his wealth, worth $2.36 billion at the company’s current closing price of $20.59. Trump put the shares into a trust in December in an effort to dampen a conflict of interest ahead of his inauguration.

Since President Donald Trump took office last month, the agency has dismissed several high-profile lawsuits and abandoned investigations that once loomed over the industry. Among the most notable reversals, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, which was accused of operating as an unregistered securities platform. Robinhood’s crypto division is also no longer under scrutiny, OpenSea faces no legal challenges, and the SEC has dismissed its case against Consensys, the company behind MetaMask. Additionally, the regulator recently withdrew its investigation into Gemini, reinforcing the broader retreat from crypto enforcement. This wave of dismissals fueled speculation that Ripple would be next . The lawsuit, which has dragged on since 2020, has now concluded in favor of the blockchain company. Earlier this week, legal expert Fred Rispoli questioned why the SEC was still pursuing the case while others, including Coinbase, have been dropped. “I don’t know why SEC v. Ripple is still going considering other major cases, especially Coinbase, have been dropped… The case is over regardless, either now or in a few months,” Rispoli stated . He speculated that the SEC’s hesitation stemmed from the $125 million judgment tied to the case. According to Rispoli, Commissioners Uyeda and Peirce may be reluctant to take responsibility for modifying such a substantial sum. “Not a great excuse—it shows cowardice—but it does make some sense,” he added. “The case is over regardless, either now or in a few months.” Elsewhere, former SEC Chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement John Reed Stark echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the collapse of the SEC’s crypto-enforcement program. “So, this is how the SEC dies. The rapid-fire demolition of the SEC crypto-enforcement program continues… Dropping of the SEC’s Ripple appeal next up for sure,” he tweeted . Stark also noted that the SEC’s regulatory actions have halted mainly under the new administration, emphasizing that Ripple’s appeal was likely to end soon. “ The SEC’s frantic and unprecedented rampage to dismantle its crypto-enforcement program continues: This time, halting two SEC appeals dead in their tracks. Buckle up XRP Army, the Ripple appeal has got to be next on the SEC chopping block.” Pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan had also expressed optimism, suggesting that the case could be resolved by May. That said, with Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda at the helm, experts are optimistic that the regulator’s pullback from aggressive enforcement will persist, ultimately paving the way for the “Large One.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-20 05:55:34

The central bank maintained its benchmark rate as expected, while Chair Jerome Powell offered measured remarks regarding the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. However, shares in China bucked the upward trend despite the Fed easing tariff concerns. Powell cited the possibility that any increase in inflation would be transitory, noting that the risk of a recession was “not high,” a statement that helped calm investor nerves. MSCI’s regional stock benchmark reached its highest level since early November as equities in Taiwan, Australia, and South Korea posted gains. US equity futures also rose in Asia after the Financial Times reported that Nvidia Corp. is planning to spend several hundred billion dollars over the next four years to procure US-made chips and electronics. The rally was tempered by a holiday closure in Japan, which kept its markets shut for the day. Chinese shares, however, bucked the upward trend seen elsewhere in the region. The mainland benchmark CSI 300 Index fell for the first time in three days as technology companies, which had enjoyed a recent surge, posted significant losses. CSI 300 Index chart. Source: Google Finance In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index declined by as much as 1.7%. “The risk-reward for China looks slightly less reasonable,” commented Sundeep Gantori, an analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management in Singapore, on Bloomberg Television . He added that the risk-reward appeared much better for US tech following the recent correction, though he did not rule out modest gains for China. Hang Seng Index chart.

In contrast, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. experienced a rise in its share price after pledging to strengthen its position in the high-bandwidth memory chip market amid shareholder criticism. Tencent Holdings Index chart. Source: Google Finance The Fed’s decision to trim its growth assessments and hold rates boosted a bond rally and reinforced an outlook that supports rate cuts later in the year. Following the announcement, President Donald Trump urged Powell on Truth Social to “do the right thing” and cut rates, diverging from the Fed’s current stance. Meanwhile, Chinese banks held their benchmark lending rates for a fifth straight month without further monetary easing. President Trump’s recent post on Truth Social.

The latest data from yesterday showed that there was a net outflow of $408,000. This means that there were a lot more funds being taken out of the market than were being put into it. The memecoin market had total inflows of $1.41 million and total outflows of $1.81 million. This left the market with a net volume of -$408,000. The total volume for the day across all memecoins was $3.22 million. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 16/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $1.41M Outflow: $1.81M Volume: $3.22M Net Volume: -$408K There was inflow into: $MNDE ($75K) $JLP ($39K) $HNT ($53K) $FWOG ($42K) $DOGEAI ($39K)… pic.twitter.com/q0g03x8b0t — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 17, 2025 Inflow and Outflow Trends: Which Memecoins are Gaining and Losing Traction? When examining the data more closely, some intriguing trends become apparent. Certain memecoins reaped the rewards of large inflows, while others were not so lucky and faced sizable outflows. The top three memecoins that secured notable inflows were: 1. $MNDE— inflow of $75,000 2. $JLP— inflow of $39,000 3. $HNT— inflow of $53,000. Notable inflows were also seen with other memecoins, such as $FWOG with $42,000 and $DOGEAI with $39,000. These inflows are indicative of informed investors who, based on the evidence of these recent inflows, are seemingly placing bets on the near-future performance of these memecoins. Conversely, some memecoins dealt with major outflows. FARTCOIN had the worst off, losing $202,000. Other memecoins with considerable outflows include HONEY with a drop of $51,000, POPCAT with a drop of $105,000, and PWEASE with a loss of $90,000. What is interesting is that WBTC also had a significant outflow of 112,000. This may be suggestive of a broader trend. It could be that smart money is moving out of more established assets and into speculative memecoins. Memecoins are a funny thing in the cryptocurrency world; they are perhaps the simplest form of cryptocurrency without a real-world use case. But for many people, particularly younger generations, they are to all intents and purposes money. Their monumental growth over the past year has been the subject of much incredulity—even within the crypto community itself. That growth is obviously tied in some way to the adoption and use of real cryptocurrencies, but not in a direct function of demand and supply. In fact, meme money these days increasingly seems to be a form of wealth creation via a revenant of the ‘financialization of everything’. To summarize, the on-chain data gathered yesterday shows that there is a net outflow from the memecoin market. Some assets in that marketplace are definitely experiencing significant inflows and outflows, however. But the memecoin market itself, when looked at on the whole, is seeing a lot of money shift away from it. As we peer into the evolving memecoin marketplace, it will be interesting to see which assets emerge as the new favorites. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Following the recent Bybit attack, a notorious group of cybercriminals related to North Korea known as the Lazarus Group has successfully converted their stolen Ethereum into Bitcoin, now controlling a breathtaking 13,562 BTC. This stash of Bitcoin is currently worth roughly $1.14 billion, ensuring that North Korea is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, state-sponsored holders of Bitcoin anywhere in the world. After the Bybit attack, the North Korean hacker group has converted ETH into BTC and now owns 13,562 BTC, worth about $1.14 billion. North Korea's Bitcoin holdings have surpassed El Salvador (6,117 BTC) and Bhutan (10,635 BTC), becoming the third largest government entity in the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 16, 2025 North Korea’s Rise as a Bitcoin Giant The Lazarus Group, an entity closely tied to the North Korean regime, has long been associated with many notorious cyber crimes targeting worldwide cryptocurrency exchanges and organizations. Most recently, the group turned its focus on these cyber targets into making Bitcoin for themselves, converting Ethereum into Bitcoin and in the process further beefing up their already substantial Bitcoin holdings. Because of this latest operation, North Korea now holds 13,562 BTC and has surpassed both El Salvador and Bhutan in terms of the largest government Bitcoin holders, right behind the United States and the United Kingdom. To put this in perspective, the global leader is the United States with 198,109 BTC, while the United Kingdom comes in second with 61,245 BTC. El Salvador, which holds 6,117 BTC, and Bhutan, which holds 10,635 BTC, are way behind North Korea now. Looking at all these numbers, you can’t help but marvel at how North Korea has parlayed its cyber capabilities into a leading position in the world of crypto. In recent years, the Lazarus Group has carried out numerous attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. Many of these operations, including the assault on the Coincheck exchange in Tokyo in January 2018, are believed to be state-sponsored. The group has a long and well-established track record of infiltrating platforms; stealing large and significant sums of digital fortune; and laundering it, and them, across various aliases, platforms, and wallets. The D.F.I.R. Lab from Cyber Kismet has directly implicated North Korean intelligence services in these activities. The international community is becoming ever more concerned over the role that cryptocurrencies might be playing in helping rogue states like North Korea evade worldwide financial regulations. North Korea’s impressive Bitcoin haul only intensifies that concern. It was already apparent that the hermit kingdom was actively engaging in the crypto space, trying to mine and steal as many coins as it could. But this week’s news suggests that North Korea might now have an unrealized BTC convertible wealth of more than $5 billion—largely untouched thanks to crypto’s untraceable private wallet feature. OKX Takes Action to Combat Lazarus Group’s Exploits OKX, which ranks among the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is now taking actions to protect its users. The company has announced a suspension of services for its DEX aggregator, in the wake of what appears to be a freshly uncovered plot by the North Korean hackers of the Lazarus Group to target DeFi platforms. NOW: OKX announced pausing its DEX aggregator temporarily after detecting a coordinated effort by Lazarus group to misuse its DeFi services. pic.twitter.com/u7hGG4rfAD — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 17, 2025 It is suspected that the ill-begotten funds arising from the hacks of the past several months, including the $100 million cash haul from the Harmony Layer incident last June, are being funneled through DeFi platforms. The growing need for cryptocurrencies to be so well protected that they can be considered bulletproof is underscored by the world of DeFi, in which a virtual goldmine of unregulated services is ripe for the taking by anybody with the will—and the way—to do so. A group of hackers we know well indeed has by now not only used protection afforded by DeFi to go after centralized and heavily protected crypto outfits like CoinEx; they’ve also—in pursuing that double-take operation—gone after the very regulators and virtual police whose job is to keep the crypto world safe. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has become a key target for hackers. DeFi platforms, which are built to be decentralized and operate without central authority, are not yet sufficiently secured. And the reason for that is the same reason that a relatively wide range of DeFi platforms have become unsecured: They are underregulated and, in some cases, completely unregulated, with the way that financial authorities interact with platforms built on blockchain technology often resembling the way that financial authorities used to interact with platforms that operated in the Internet wild west of the late 1990s. The issue of hackers targeting DeFi platforms has raised some pretty big alarm bells. The Growing Threat of State-Sponsored Cybercrime The Lazarus Group is continuing to grow its cryptocurrency portfolio, and this is making something very clear: State-sponsored cybercriminals are a significant and possibly growing risk to the global crypto market’s stability and security. Doing what it evidently does best, the group has sent out a number of alarming signals lately that all is not well in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Exchanges for cryptocurrency, DeFi platforms, and regulatory bodies need to beef up their security infrastructure to push back against this ever-expanding threat. These actions must be taken both because of and in light of the fact that North Korea’s Bitcoin hoard now rivals and likely surpasses the holdings of several nation-states. Furthermore, as the actions of the Lazarus Group remind us, there’s really no way to secure the future of digital finance when potential avenues for further illicit activity in the crypto space remain open and largely unregulated. Bybit attack’s events and OKX’s response to it are a reminder of the importance of keeping a strengthened vigilance in the crypto industry. With attacks becoming an almost daily occurrence in this space, we have to face the fact that cybercrime is a growth industry. And it’s one that increasingly looks to exploit not just the crypto world but also the real currencies that increasingly are being used to fund the cybercriminals’ operations.

Unprecedented expectations had people excited about Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade to restore its fall trajectory in prices and Ripple’s increasingly ambitious adoption was behind bullish forecasts. However, the Phase 3 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving at breakneck speed as investors get the fire burning. $4,100,000 has already been raised and 6,200 holders have locked in their tokens for $0.02 — a cost set to increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. Those who invest now can reap 200% returns at its $0.06 KYC exchange listing, while estimates post-launch suggest it could climb to beyond $3. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Evokes Optimism Ethereum’s price has stumbled in 2025, falling from a January peak of $3,635 to $1,931.64 amid postponed updates and ETF outflows. The Pectra upgrade is all the rage now for developers, including combined upgrades from Prague and Electra focused on linear scaling and staking usage. If it manages a successful mainnet launch between April and May, then momentum could spark once again with one analyst targeting $5,000. If Ethereum has long-term potential, its short-price volatility is a stark contrast to that of Mutuum Finance’s presale — a difference that is spurring capital migration into predictable profits. Ripple News: Potential for Massive Rally with Ripple Technical Breakout This Ripple (XRP) price is breaking out above a six-year symmetrical triangle. Others, such as analysts Ali Martinez and Mikybull Crypto, assign targets in the $10-$15 region based on regulatory clarity and a distribution to adoption surges. These figures show confidence in the very presence of 6.87 million XRP wallets. However, XRP’s dependence on macroeconomic factors leaves room for uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand alleviates speculation with a lending ecosystem, where demand is correlated with platform usage, directly opposed to Ripple’s transactional nature. Mutuum Finance Participants who grab phase 3 tokens at $0.02 will see a 25% bump to $0.025 in phase 4 and listings coming in at $0.06 on launch guarantee 200% gains. After presale, experts see an explosion to $3 as platform adoption rises—a 14,900% increase from today’s prices. All of this is supplemented with the tokenomics of the project, which guarantees sustainability, as 20% of the platform fees buy MUTM from the markets and redistribute them to stakers, while limiting sales of the token. Improvements in Audit Progress Bolster Investor Confidence The security of Mutuum Finance is highly prioritized. A proper Certik audit of the smart contracts being performed is underway and results will be shared through the project’s social channels. This transparency builds trust, unlike opaque mechanisms employed by older projects. And the protocol’s overcollateralized loans and mtTokens — interest-bearing deposit certificates — offer passive income streams too in contrast to rivals such as Ethereum or Ripple. Phase 3 is filling fast, and the opportunity to get MUTM at $0.02 is coming to a close very soon. Early buyers secure 200% pre-launch profits and stand to gain in multiples as the platform’s lending volumes increase. The real-world utility provided by Mutuum Finance — loans, yields & liquidity without selling assets — means it is likely to become the cornerstone of DeFi, while speculative tokens are set for reckoning. While Ripple and Ethereum present intriguing narratives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides instant ROI catalysts and structural demand enablers. With the Certik audit almost finished and Phase 4 around the corner, postponing could risk missing $THEIR lowest entry.

The new firm intends to acquire companies in crypto, blockchain, and security tech, sectors that are experiencing growing government oversight under the Trump administration. The SPAC , Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, is led by Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, board member Eric Swider, and executive Alexander Cano—all key players in Trump Media’s controversial merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Renatus Tactical eyes $179M IPO amid deep Trump Media ties The blank-check firm incorporated in the Cayman Islands, Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, intends to raise at least $179 million through a private placement and initial public offering. This money will be used to acquire another business. To raise around $178,942,500, the company intends to sell 3,942,500 warrants at $1 each and 17.5 million shares to the general public for $10 each. The executives of Renatus Tactical have strong ties to Trump Media & Technology Group. Eric Swider, CEO of Renatus Tactical and a Trump Media board member, previously led the company that merged with Trump Media. Devin Nunes, the president, CEO and chair of Trump Media, is also listed as board chair of Renatus Tactical. Meanwhile, Alexander Cano, Renatus Tactical’s chief operating officer, served as both president and secretary of the firm that merged with Trump Media. These executives were key to Trump Media’s highly anticipated merger with DWAC, which was held up for 29 months by SEC probes into insider trading, allegations of financial misstatements, and other concerns before getting approval in March 2024. Renatus Tactical navigates government-tied sectors Renatus Tactical’s SEC filing focuses on acquisitions in data security, dual-use technology, and cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors, all of which have significant government involvement as regulators or clients. There could be challenges with Trump’s involvement. In its filing with the SEC, Renatus Tactical cautioned that some partners “may be hesitant to do business” with the company because of the ties between its team and Trump Media and President Donald J. Trump. Despite these concerns in the broad market, Renatus Tactical is strategically tapping sectors with heavy government influence. Trump appointees now sit atop all key market regulatory agencies, including the SEC, DOJ and FTC, which govern mergers and other financial compliance. The SEC filing also described the firm’s focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain, explaining that “the current administration has taken unprecedented steps to involve digital assets in the national financial strategy.” As Renatus Tactical moves forward, its close association with Trump Media could be both a strategic asset and a potential drawback. If Trump’s pro-crypto stance translates into a friendlier regulatory environment, the firm could benefit from a change in policy that promotes blockchain adoption. Yet, with the SEC’s record of investigating Trump-affiliated undertakings, Renatus Tactical’s success ultimately could come down to whether political support can outweigh regulatory concerns.

In this past week, those outflows amounted to $1.7 billion, and while that number is tough enough on its own, it gets even tougher when you realize that these outflows have now reached a record streak — the longest such streak since 2015. The market has now experienced 17 straight days of outflows, and it’s hard to pinpoint which assets are being impacted the most. However, if common sense comes into play, we can surmise that the two largest digital assets by market cap — Bitcoin and Ethereum — are likely among the most impacted. This trend of outflow seems to be gaining strength, and it’s hard to see at this point what could reverse it. Some analysts—most of them Bitcoin bulls—go so far as to say that if the trend doesn’t reverse soon, it could set off a death spiral for the cryptocurrency market. When investors pull money out of assets en masse, those assets tumbling in value can trigger even more outflows. A New Strategy for Acquiring Bitcoin Although these outflows show that investors are being cautious, one notable countertrend comes from the investment firm Strategy, which has sharply increased its exposure to Bitcoin. On March 16, 2025, the firm said it had bought 130 BTC for $10.7 million, or an average price of about $82,981 per Bitcoin. Buying into Bitcoin with such a large uptick at such a specific price point is a move that many asset managers would not have envisioned making just three months earlier. Strategy has kept its eyes on Bitcoin for the long term, which is clear in the firm’s enormous stash of the top cryptocurrency by market cap. As of March 14, 2025, the firm held 499,226 BTC, worth $33.1 billion. Those bitcoins were bought at an average price of $66,360 per bitcoin, making the firm a top five holder of bitcoin on the planet and an even bigger player in the private sector. With a return of 6.9% year-to-date (YTD) in 2025, Strategy’s acquisition approach seems to be paying off, even as overall investment in digital asset products takes a downturn. The firm appears to be well positioned to take advantage of a potential market rebound, having acquired Bitcoin at a number of points during recent volatility and holding a significant reserve of the asset. A Shift in Investor Behavior The steady outflows from digital asset investment products emphasize how the sentiment among cryptocurrency investors is shifting. Many investors are taking a fresh look at how much of these risk assets they hold, and the current state of the global markets—with inflation and interest rates quite high—has these folks even more on edge. And then there’s the regulatory environment, which everyone’s been obsessing over for ages now. While we hear plenty of talk about an impending crypto regulatory framework, most investors have seemed to reach a conclusion: it’s going to be rough, and some assets might not make it out alive. Additionally, investor caution is likely shaped by the growing number of institutional players in the cryptocurrency space. Though we have not yet reached a point of fully transformed price trends, institutional players like Grayscale and other crypto hedge funds now occupy a significant place in the market. These entities are much less speculative than our token speculators last summer, and their price movements are far less correlated with the price jumps that weekend retail investors try to generate. Even with the outflows, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, with institutional players like Strategy continuing to amass large quantities of the digital currency at varied price points. This contrast between the sentiment of retail investors and the strategies of institutional acquirers hints that crypto might be maturing. If we are observing a divergence between the two, then the one’s acquiring power at price points far below recent highs could be the lead signal for the next up phase. The Road Ahead for Digital Asset Investment Products The sustained net outflows from digital asset investment products raise important questions about the future direction of the market. Although it is currently primarily engulfed in stormy seas, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ships have so far managed to avoid any significant capsizing. Right now, however, we could very well be 20,000 leagues under the sea in a downward-spiraling dive in which other digital assets might soon find themselves if investor sentiment remains this muted. This might make individual investors out there shiver in fear. And don’t even get me started on what this will mean for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. Investors peering past the price of Bitcoin today and tomorrow and gazing into the “faithful long-term value of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin” that we may have in the future, can see a silver lining in the price we spend for Bitcoin today. While global markets are mired in uncertainty, digital asset investment products seem likely to see some variable interest from investors. At this point, firms such as Strategy appear to be continuing their accumulation of Bitcoin and positioning themselves for whatever these digital assets’ future might hold. The next several months should reveal whether this strategy pays off or if the aforementioned outflows continue to set the market tone more generally. In any case, the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market requires that investors strategically plan in view of an uncertain horizon. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42032643,https://nulltx.com/?p=147215,1742456083,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana Memecoins: Smart Money Insights and Net Flow Trends,https://nulltx.com/solana-memecoins-smart-money-insights-and-net-flow-trends/,"The world of memecoins is always changing, influenced by both meme culture and speculative investment behavior. There has been growing interest lately in Solana-based memecoins, with a few tokens really standing out and attracting a lot of attention from what are called “smart money” investors. These are experienced, strategic investors who usually give us the best idea of what might have longevity and positive growth in the volatile memecoin market. So we wanted to investigate and rank the Solana memecoins, talk about the net inflows we’ve seen to these tokens, and share some insights into current market dynamics. Ranking Solana Memecoins: The Smart Money Playbook $MNDE has the highest net flow during this 24-hour period, a pretty clear sign of strong recent demand from the smart money capital. This is a clear influx of capital that says all the right things about the $MNDE token—namely that it has prospects and that experienced, institutional-level investors are placing bets on it in a way that strongly resembles a pattern of buying up something with good potential. The consistent growth pattern of $MNDE shows at least two things: 1) It seems to be in the right place at the right time, and 2) It looks to be in one of the most consistent upward trends of anything you might consider a “meme coin” on Solana. In second place is $FARTCOIN, which, while not exhibiting some of the explosive growth of other tokens, is still managing a significant net flow. The inflow suggests that smart money continues to have confidence in the token. Net flow is not, however, sufficient to short-term surge any more than the token was already surging. The real takeaway is that there is some kind of steady demand for $FARTCOIN—demand that by all accounts seems to be maintaining momentum. Whether that is leading to or from any more significant price actions in the short term is hard to say. One token that stands out is $MLG, with a net flow of $45.20K, despite a much smaller market cap of only $7.4 million. This combination—of a solid net flow with a much lower market cap—suggests to me that $MLG could either be on the verge of some significant growth or a pretty decent rebound play. Tokens with much lower market caps can often experience much stronger percentage growth, which makes them attractive to smart money investors who are looking for opportunities in definitely undervalued assets. Given its market cap and that noticeable net flow, $MLG is one to watch if you believe in the power of memecoins still having some room to run. Ranking of solana memecoins smart money are buying and thier net flow today. Insights and observation: $MNDE has the highest net flow compared to other tokens which means strong recent demand from smart money. #FARTCOIN has the second highest net flow but not necessarily an… pic.twitter.com/W7PIIoyoHR — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 17, 2025 Market Trends: Large Caps vs. Smaller Tokens Although $JUP and $LAYER enjoy considerable market capitalizations, they seem to be drawing very little interest from investors at the present time. The au courant that these tokens might be on the verge of a breakout has not yet caught the imagination of much money that is smart. Not only is this potentially a bearish sign, but it also means that, if you’re considering taking a position in these tokens, you might be doing so in a market that is nevertheless in consolidation or melting down. Some of the tokens, such as these: $SWARMS, $GIGA, $SSE, and $PWEASE, are actually not doing too badly, with some appearing quite well and good throughout. Now, these are what I consider investment tokens—you can do pretty much anything with them, and you should feel confident holding onto them, even if their prices might not be shooting up like they are with some other tokens. This is what I call holding. And I don’t think there’s a damn thing wrong with that. In fact, there are many who esteem this action as one worthy of performing virtuously. Low-Cap Tokens: Speculative Opportunities At the other end of the spectrum are $HAWK, $SYMX, and $PROME. These are low-market-cap tokens that could present speculative opportunities for investors who are willing to gamble for the chance of high rewards. Viewed generally, these three tokens might be considered undervalued or overlooked. But these tokens, while perhaps attractive to some investors, also present a significant risk because of their price volatility. If the three tokens manage to accomplish something—like generating sales or getting their story out—their price could change significantly and relatively quickly. Those investors who have an interest in these tokens should be cognizant of the fact that their volatility can lead to both rapid gains and sharp losses. The essential quality of these kinds of speculative plays is timing, which could be complemented by the potential for a surge in interest or community support that could push the token into the spotlight. Conclusion: A Market of Contrasting Trends The solana memecoin space remains highly dynamic, with tokens from the promising $(MNDE) to the more speculative $(HAWK). It’s pretty clear that smart money is flowing into certain tokens like $(MNDE) and $(FARTCOIN), but we’re also seeing a variety of tokens showing steady, if not slightly dramatic, growth. Who are the top stable coingrowth actors in Solana? The layout of Solana memecoins offers us a chance to play in many different ways. Here are the top tokens giving us steady growth and the chance for some outrageous plays. Like all investments, especially in the speculative realm of memecoins, investors should do their own research and think hard about both the risks and rewards of particular assets before buying them. That the smart money is now playing in this sandbox is certainly a good sign for the future of these tokens; still, it’s the risk appetite of the broader market that’ll determine which memecoins make it big in the months ahead.

Wallets belonging to smart money are often seen as forerunners and precursors to what will next happen in the space. Recent analysis has plugged into an emerging narrative that those kinds of wallets are accumulating certain tokens. Narratives in Focus: AI, MEME, and Payment Solutions Smart money wallets are seen accumulating assets across three primary narratives: AI and tech innovation, MEME, and payment solutions. Within these narratives, certain projects are standing out and getting their attention. $KTA, the native token of Keeta Network, has become a notable accumulation for smart money wallets. The project has a potential ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt involved, and while some skepticism is still present, seven smart money wallets now hold over $157,000 worth of $KTA, which is a significant amount. Another initiative that is gaining momentum is BankrCoin ($BNKR), an AI-driven cryptocurrency companion that is fostering a burgeoning community. Two “smart money” wallets have stacked up $8,000 in $BNKR, indicating that this is a project on the verge of something big. In the MEME domain, Melania Meme ($MELANIA) is capturing a lot of attention even with the volatile market conditions. 1 smart money wallet has stacked up $20,000 worth of the MEME as an indication that the project has some promise and could blossom into something with more significance. Finally, Vertical AI ($VERTAI) is another eye-catching project for smart money wallets. Thanks to its innovative AI models and partnerships, 1 smart money wallet has picked up $7,500 worth of $VERTAI. Valuable insights into the trends and opportunities emerging within the cryptocurrency space are afforded by these accumulations. They offer a peak, if you will, into the projects that are amassing capital from the most sophisticated kinds of investors. As those investors—which include many of the large, smart wallets in the cryptocurrency space—continue to increasingly allocate resources to these projects, it will be captivating to see how these initiatives develop and grow. Finally, the most recent accumulation of smart money wallets provides a unique opportunity to glance into the narratives and projects that are gaining traction in the cryptocurrency space. From AI and tech innovation to MEME and payment solutions, these narratives and projects offer a glimpse of the future of this rapidly evolving market.

42032815,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141745,1742456292,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surge in Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Market Sentiment Improves Dramatically,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-improves/,"The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and keeping a pulse on market sentiment is crucial for investors. One key tool for gauging this sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . In a noteworthy shift, this index has just signaled a significant change in the crypto landscape. Are you ready to understand what this means for your crypto holdings? Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Dramatic Leap Towards Neutral As of March 20th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a product of Alternative.me, has made a remarkable leap. It now stands at 49, a substantial 17-point increase from the previous day. This impressive surge has propelled the index out of the “Fear” zone and firmly into “Neutral” territory. This transition indicates a notable improvement in overall crypto sentiment and suggests a potential shift in market dynamics. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does It Measure? For those new to this indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is designed to quantify the emotions driving the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0 – Extreme Fear: This end of the spectrum suggests investors are excessively worried, often leading to potential buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. 100 – Extreme Greed: Conversely, a reading of 100 signals excessive optimism and potential market overheating, which might precede a correction. 50 – Neutral: A score around 50 indicates a balanced market sentiment, where neither fear nor greed dominates. Understanding where the index lies can provide valuable insights into the prevailing market sentiment and potential future price movements. What Factors Drive the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a data-driven tool that aggregates six key market indicators to provide a comprehensive view of market emotions. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can contribute to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and volume to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong momentum suggests greed, while weak momentum can indicate fear. Social Media (15%): Primarily analyzes sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, tracking hashtags and engagement to gauge public opinion on the crypto market . Surveys (15%): Conducts regular polls of crypto investors to directly measure their sentiment. (Note: This is currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Analyzes Bitcoin’s dominance relative to other cryptocurrencies. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes reflect a “flight to safety” during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. A surge in searches like “Bitcoin crash” can indicate fear, while increased searches for “Bitcoin buy” might suggest growing greed. By combining these diverse factors, the index aims to provide a holistic and nuanced picture of the prevailing crypto sentiment . Why is the Shift to Neutral Important? The move from “Fear” to “Neutral” in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is significant for several reasons: Reduced Market Anxiety: It suggests that the pervasive fear that might have gripped the market previously is subsiding. This can lead to a more stable and less volatile trading environment. Potential for Price Recovery: Historically, periods of extreme fear can precede market bottoms. As fear diminishes, there’s often increased buying pressure, potentially leading to price recovery for assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Increased Investor Confidence: A neutral sentiment can attract more investors back into the market. When fear is high, many investors stay on the sidelines. A shift towards neutral can signal a safer entry point. Healthier Market Dynamics: A market driven solely by fear or greed is often unsustainable. A neutral zone can indicate a more balanced and potentially healthier phase for the crypto market . Actionable Insights: Navigating a Neutral Crypto Market So, what should you do now that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is neutral? Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto holdings in light of the improved sentiment. Are your allocations still aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals? Conduct Further Research: Don’t rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Dig deeper into specific projects and market trends. Is this improved sentiment supported by fundamental developments in the crypto space? Consider Strategic Investing: A neutral market can be an opportune time for strategic investing. Look for projects with strong fundamentals that may have been undervalued during the “Fear” phase. Manage Risk: While sentiment is improving, the crypto market remains volatile. Continue to practice prudent risk management, diversify your portfolio, and avoid investing more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep tracking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and other market indicators to stay ahead of potential shifts in sentiment. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Optimism in the Crypto Space The recent 17-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , pushing it into neutral territory, is a noteworthy development. It reflects a tangible improvement in crypto sentiment and suggests that the intense fear that may have dominated the market is easing. While caution and due diligence remain paramount in the volatile crypto world, this shift offers a glimmer of optimism and potentially signals a more balanced and constructive phase for the crypto market .

Recent on-chain data has revealed a significant support zone for ETH, just under $1,900, where a substantial accumulation of coins has taken place. However, this support zone is precarious, and if ETH slips below this range, the risk of capitulation grows. On-chain data indicates a significant support zone for ETH just under $1,900, where around 3.56 million ETH was acquired between $1,843 and $1,900. This accumulation suggests robust support, but if ETH slips below this range, the risk of capitulation grows, as demand appears… pic.twitter.com/MbGgvuwNAG — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 17, 2025 The data indicates that around 3.56 million ETH was gathered between $1,843 and $1,900. This accumulation suggests that ETH has strong support at this level. A considerable number of investors would have to sell to push ETH down to around $1,800. Conversely, if ETH can’t hold this support and falls below, it looks like capitulation! Whales and Institutional Investors: A Cautionary Tale Besides the support zone, current whale activity has raised some concerns. In the past week, whales have distributed over 130,000 ETH, which could be signaling a lack of confidence in the market. Even though the big boys are known to make big moves, this one may not be an isolated incident. On top of that, we’re hearing that institutions might not be feeling too bullish these days, either. Last week, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net outflow of $178 million in just one week—not precisely a vote of confidence coming from the institutional direction. Whales have moved off over 130,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week! pic.twitter.com/lrin2Npj8l — Ali (@ali_charts) March 17, 2025 These factors, when combined, create a delicate balance for ETH’s pricing. The support zone at $1,900 provides a strong base, but below that base, demand is shaky. Add to that the price agitation caused by not just whale but also unbelieving institutional investor activity (more on that shortly), and what emerges is a picture of an ETH that is very possibly primed to drop. Last week (March 10 to March 14, EST), Bitcoin spot ETFs had a net outflow of $838 million. Blackrock ETF IBIT had a net outflow of $338 million, and Fidelity ETF FBTC had a net outflow of $317 million. Ethereum spot ETFs had a net outflow of $178 million in a single week.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 17, 2025 The market is changing all the time, and all of us in this ecosystem must pay close attention to those changes and trend them. As we trend them, we must also adjust our expectations and, ultimately, our plans because these are living, breathing creatures. What was a support zone last month might be a resistance zone this month, and vice versa. To sum up, the latest on-chain data and market activity imply that ETH’s price is at an essential point. The support zone at $1,900 is a solid foundation, but demand under this level is weak and getting weaker. Moreover, whale and institutional investor activity tells a cautionary tale that makes ETH’s price seem vulnerable to a downturn. These trends need to be monitored carefully as the market evolves.

This indicator measures the number of coins that have been held for less than 155 days and are being sold, signaling panic selling among short-term holders. Historically, these spikes have aligned with fear-driven sell-offs, adding to downside pressure. This trend is clear and has no ambiguity: if panic selling doesn’t stop, we may see more volatility coming down the pike. However, this trend also has some serious implications for investors—and not just the kinds of investors who, say, hold a retirement fund that’s getting hit hard by the recent market downturn.

42033100,https://nulltx.com/?p=147211,1742456770,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain DEX Surpasses Solana with $1.64 Billion Trading Volume, Fueled by Memecoins",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-dex-surpasses-solana-with-1-64-billion-trading-volume-fueled-by-memecoins/,"A major development in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space has taken place: the BNB Chain’s decentralized exchange (DEX) surged past Solana to hit a record $1.64 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours. This puts BNB Chain at the head of the decentralized exchange market. And while there are a lot of factors behind this potentially bullish trend for the DEX space, a key one appears to be the popularity of memecoins like Mubarak these days, which are grabbing traders’ attentions. https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1901477050697089306?t=L9dd1wd1bSyuzbG64tJtzA&s=19 PancakeSwap Leads the Charge on BNB Chain At the heart of BNB Chain’s accomplishments lies its leading decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap, which now appears to be leading in trading volume among all DeFi platforms. According to data from a variety of sources including DeFiLlama, over the past month or two, PancakeSwap has emerged as the DeFi platform with the top trading volume, and in fact some days, the top DeFi platform in all of crypto. Its trading volume seems to keep going up and up. For a long time, a prominent feature of the cryptocurrency market has been memecoins, which are often the objects of retail traders seeking quick profits. Memecoins like Mubarak have excessively contributed to the increased trading volume on PancakeSwap. Users have flocked to the platform to buy and sell these high-risk, high-reward tokens. Trading them is a serious activity now, and it’s pushing the BNB Chain DEX ecosystem to new heights. PancakeSwap itself is way ahead of Solana and other supposedly major trading platforms when we look at total trading volume. PancakeSwap is a standout performer among BNB Chain DeFi protocols. With a notional TVL of over 2 billion USD and a fully diluted market cap of around 900 million USD (coingecko.com), it is by some measures BNB Chain’s most valuable native protocol and a veritable mainstay in the DeFi tree of BNB Chain. Its speed, scalability, and low transaction fees — in its native infrastructure — offer a user-friendly experience that is particularly well-suited to the trading of a variety of assets, including crypto assets and tokenized versions of real-world assets. Binance Wallet’s New Listing Policy: A Shift in Strategy Binance Wallet has taken steps toward listing more projects in its ecosystem. It has revised its policy concerning how and where certain projects are featured. Under the new listing policy: – Once a project moves from being listed on Binance Alpha to being listed on Binance Spot, it will no longer be featured on Binance Alpha. – This is a step toward reducing redundancy and improving clarity in how projects are presented in the various layers of the Binance ecosystem. Several tokens have already been affected by this change, with seven projects moving from Binance Alpha to Binance Spot. The notable tokens impacted by this change include COOKIE, AIXBT, CGPT, Cheems, TST, SHELL, and GPS. Five of these tokens are native to BNB Chain, which underscores the growing importance of BNB Chain and its ecosystem in the cryptocurrency market. https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1901205126012191149?t=YahHkcgfK67nWItIj8-OGg&s=19 The revised directive is projected to furnish more prominence to initiatives that have effectively shifted to Binance Spot, enabling these initiatives to connect with a wider base of investors and traders. Concurrently, it might ramp up rivalry between initiatives angling for a place on Binance Spot, as the exchange remains an essential portal for both new and seasoned tokens. The Growing Influence of BNB Chain and Its Ecosystem A BNB Chain DEX market is now experiencing incredible influence and rapidly rising trading volume on PancakeSwap, and more and more users seem to really be using this platform for trading not just obscure memecoins, but a variety of different assets. Even the close rival DEXs cannot help but illustrate how entrenched BNB Chain now is as a DeFi leader. PancakeSwap consistently remains a leading decentralized exchange, but that status is based on far more than just its name. The platform offers one of the most user-friendly and cost-effective environments for trading decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, keeping its fees low and its transaction throughput high in an era when other exchanges struggle to maintain either. Traders seeking to capitalize on anything from trending DeFi assets to the latest memecoins not only can do so on PancakeSwap but also can do so in a way that’s mostly likely to leave more value in their pockets at the end of the day. Despite their volatile nature, memecoins continue to attract significant attention, and platforms like PancakeSwap are right there at the forefront of facilitating this trading frenzy. Tokens like Mubarak, which has captured the imagination of retail traders, show just how far community-driven projects can go in today’s cryptocurrency market. As these projects gain traction, platforms like PancakeSwap are banking on the trading activity that comes with it, further cementing their place in today’s decentralized exchange sector. What’s Next for BNB Chain and the Memecoin Movement? While BNB Chain expands, and PancakeSwap remains a dominant force in the decentralized exchange market, many are left wondering what the future holds for both the network and the wayward memecoin movement. While memecoins are often seen as speculative assets, their popularity has proven to be resilient. Their continued growth could further fuel the expansion of BNB Chain’s DeFi ecosystem. In addition, Binance Wallet’s recent change in listing policy will be a great experimental ground for other tokens and projects. The shift could lead to more visibility for various digital assets and potentially give rise to more partnerships and collaborations in the space—like the ones that we’ve seen with the BNB Chain. At a high level, BNB Chain’s surpassed Solana and is now growing in dominance in the decentralized exchange space; this is a clear trend that signals a very bright future for the BNB Chain network. The swap platform, PancakeSwap, is leading the charge for DEX (decentralized exchange) market share inside the BNB Chain ecosystem. The future is playing out right in front of us – the DEX market share war is taking place over the BNB Chain network, and it’s only going to continue with the rise of new tokens.

If approved, he could avoid prison time and additional fines. Andruinin and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts have reached a plea agreement that would have him forfeit $23 million in cryptocurrency assets . According to official court documents , Andruinin has pleaded guilty to one count of market manipulation and two counts of wire fraud . For his indictments, he originally faced 20 years in prison or more. However, if his plea deal gets approved, the founder of market maker firm Gotbit would only be incarcerated for up to 24 months, followed by 36 months of supervised release. During the three years of supervised release, Andruinin will not be permitted to participate in any crypto activities, according to the document. In addition, he would not be required to pay any additional fines as he agrees to forfeit all the crypto assets derived from and directly traceable to the offenses he is charged with, namely market manipulation and wire fraud. Federal prosecutors have estimated the charges could result to fines of $500,000 or twice the amount gained or lost from the offenses. Andruinin would also be subject to restitution and asset forfeiture penalties, including up to five years of probation.

Defendant agrees to promptly take all steps necessary to pass clear title to the above assets to the United States,” stated Lead B. Foley from the U.S. Attorney office within the document. As part of the deal, Andruinin agrees to forfeit USDT ( USDT ) with a value of nearly $14 million stored in two different crypto wallet addresses . Moreover, the Gotbit founder will also be giving up around $9 million in USDC ( USDC ), kept in two crypto wallets. In total, Andruinin will hand over around $23 million worth of stablecoins from four separate wallets. In the document, it is stated that while these assets are listed as property of Gotbit Consulting LLC, the wallets are solely controlled by Andruinin on Gotbit’s behalf. “Therefore, in lieu of criminal forfeiture, Gotbit consents to civil forfeiture of the above assets,” wrote Foley. In November last year, Andriunin was accused of taking part in a long-running “wash trading” scheme, which consisted of artificially boosting trading volumes and making fake trades on the market. These activities allegedly occurred between 2018 and 2024 when he was serving as Gotbit’s CEO. Gotbit is one of four companies charged by U.S. prosecutors in the first criminal prosecution targeting market manipulation and sham trading in the crypto industry. The other three companies are ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade.

Large holders withdrew significant ETH from exchanges. Despite the bounce, the larger trend remains bearish with support testing below $2K. Just yesterday, the market seemed to have written off Ethereum, with even optimistic analysts losing hope. However, in a classic crypto turnaround, Ethereum surged back, reclaiming the $2,000 mark . Now that the price is holding above this key level, the question investors are asking is: how high can Ethereum realistically go for March 21st. Key Price Levels to Watch for Ethereum Despite this recent bounce, the overall price structure for Ethereum still leans bearish. While the current recovery is underway, Ethereum is testing key support levels , and the broader trend still faces downward pressure. Ethereum had earlier seen buying interest around the high $1,800s, just below $1,900. If the current upward momentum continues, resistance is likely to be encountered in the $2,100 to $2,200 range. If Ethereum can decisively break through this resistance zone and establish it as new support, the market sentiment could shift to a more bullish outloo… The post Will ETH Hit $2,100 by March 21, 2025 After Whale Moves? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum (ETH)|Market News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-20 07:50:00

In a joint statement , the AFP, National Anti-Scam Centre, and Binance Australia revealed that the scam was uncovered through Operation Firestorm, a global crackdown on digital fraud. They warned that over 130 potential victims had already been targeted in the scheme. Scammers posed as Binance representatives and contacted victims with fake warnings, claiming that their Binance accounts had been breached. Using encrypted messaging platforms and SMS, the bad actors sent “spoofed” messages that looked like they came from Binance’s official channels. These messages often appeared in existing Binance chat threads, making them seem even more legitimate. Victims received fake verification codes and a support number, which led them straight to scammers posing as Binance representatives. Once on the call, they were pressured into moving their crypto to a so-called “trust wallet”—which was actually controlled by the fraudsters. By the time victims realized something was wrong, the funds were “transferred through a network of wallets and money laundering accounts, making seizure or recovery difficult,” authorities said. You might also like: Australians lose $122m to crypto scams, with under-50s most affected AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall urged victims who may have transferred funds to the “so-called trust wallet” to report the incident to their bank or crypto exchange and the police via ReportCyber. “The AFP has worked closely with our partners at the NASC to ensure any victims in Australia targeted by these scammers were identified swiftly and given advice to help protect their cryptocurrency accounts,” he added. As one of the biggest names in crypto, Binance has been a frequent target for scammers looking to exploit its users. A warning from Cyprus police in February 2025 highlighted a similar scam , where fraudsters sent fake SMS alerts about unauthorized logins on Binance accounts to trick users into handing over their credentials. In response, Binance is reportedly working on a new security feature to help users detect SMS phishing scams. However, details on the new feature remain scarce.

However, futures data for BTC and liquidation heatmap models suggest this uptrend could come undone soon. Let’s explore Bitcoin price predictions and key levels to watch as data hints at a bearish reversal. Bitcoin Price Rose 5%, But a Crash Seems Likely Bitcoin rose 5.44% on Wednesday , March 19, from a low of $82,501 and set up a daily high of $86,990. This move pushed it to sweep the previous weekly high of $85,270. As long as BTC stays above this level, the bullish outlook will most likely continue, pushing it higher. Bitcoin Liquidation Heatmap Model However, the liquidation heatmap mode by CoinGlass suggests that this recent price rally may come undone soon. During Wednesday’s price rally, the liquidity to the upside was swept. Now, the heatmap model shows three key liquidity levels to the downside – $85,000, $81,000, and $77,618, respectively. Combined, these three levels harbor more than $3 million in liquidity. If the buyers fail to sustain Bitcoin price above the key support level of $85K to $84, the chances of a sustained downtrend are high. While the liquidation model may not be enough to ascertain the directional bias, data from Aggr.Trade shows the recent 5.01% Bitcoin price rally was driven mostly by Perpetuals and not Spot buyers. Often, spot buyers tend to be patient with their investments, and perpetual traders are only in the trade to capitalize on short-term moves. As these perpetual traders unwind their long positions, Bitcoin price could crash, undoing the recent move to $87.5K. Bitcoin Price vs. CVD: Recent Rally Driven by Perp Buyers, Not Spot Buyers Moreover, the Spot buyer CVD is dropping since the peak a few hours ago, showing that spot buyers are actively selling, which adds credence to a potential bearish reversal for Bitcoin price. With key events such as interest rate decision and Fed’s FOMC meeting behind us, the crypto markets could show its actual intention – up only or more chop?

Despite continuing concerns about high inflation, the FED maintained its forecast of two interest rate cuts in 2025 yesterday, leaving interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5%. Bitcoin and altcoins rose amid signals of looser financial conditions from the Federal Reserve. As BTC rose above $87,000, bullish talk began to increase in the market. Stating that easier financial conditions have fueled risk appetite at this point, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts predicted that Bitcoin could enter the bull market again within three months. Speaking to Decrypt, Jamie Coutts said that recent financial changes could pave the way for a significant rally in Bitcoin over the next 90 days. Coutts also noted that historically, similar signals have often preceded major moves in BTC. “With the People's Bank of China (PBOC) increasing liquidity measures, the market is underestimating how fast Bitcoin can rise. Bitcoin is likely to reach a new ATH before the end of Q2, driven by strong bullish signals despite concerns over US President Donald Trump's tariff policy and recession risks.” *This is not investment advice.

However, the SHIB community is still optimistic that the meme coin could hit 1 cent or $0.01 before the end of 2025. This article maps Shiba Inu’s path to this key level and explores whether it can be attained this year. Can Shiba Inu Price Reach $0.01 in 2025? Shiba Inu price trades at $0.0000128 today after a slight 1.7% gain in 24 hours. Therefore, for the meme coin to reach $0.01 before the end of the year, it would have to rally by more than 78,000%. While this rally may seem far-fetched, it has happened before. During the first half of 2021, SHIB price erased more than four zeros from its price within a few months with the price skyrocketing by over 400,000%. This rally occurred after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin burned 410 trillion tokens sent to him by the Shiba Inu team. Therefore, for Shiba Inu price to rally to $0.01 in 2025, another massive burn would have to occur. This is because SHIB currently has a massive supply of 589 trillion tokens. If the price were to rally to $0.01, the meme coin would have a $5.89 trillion market cap, which is not attainable in the near term. The SHIB burn rate has been fluctuating due to reduced activity on Shibarium. However, early Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie, believes this layer 2 will gain adoption and unlock a parabolic SHIB rally , possibly to $0.01. Grok3 also outlines several conditions that SHIB would have to meet to reach 1 cent in 2025. “SHIB could theoretically reach $0.01 in 2025 if it combines aggressive token burns (reducing supply by 90%+), explosive adoption via Shibarium and real-world use, and a historic bull market fueled by hype and investment.” Meanwhile, DeepSeek shares a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction. It notes that while $0.01 can be attained in 2025, SHIB would need to attract more users through products like Shibarium and ShibaSwap, where 4.9 trillion SHIB tokens are locked. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis The Shiba Inu weekly chart shows that a bullish reversal may be underway after the meme coin formed a double bottom pattern. If SHIB defends support at the second bottom and reverses, it could trigger a 254% rally towards $0.0000455. The ADX line is also dropping, which shows that the recent downtrend that pushed Shiba Inu price down is growing weak. This supports the bullish case for SHIB. However, the RSI stands at 38, which indicates a bearish momentum. Buyers need to start accumulating SHIB at the current price level to support an uptrend. If buying pressure increases and the broader crypto market flips bullish to support an uptrend, SHIB could break out past resistance at $0.0000455 and rally toward $0.000089. SHIB/USDT: 1-Week Chart Conclusion Shiba Inu price could reach $0.01 in 2025 if there is a massive surge in the SHIB burn rate and explosive adoption of Shibarium and ShibaSwap. If SHIB can reduce its supply by more than 90% to around 5.89 trillion tokens, the meme coin can easily attain the $0.01 price target before the end of the year.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained bearish pressure after buyers failed to hold the momentum above $2.3. Will JTO price recover? If buyers defend the $2 level, we might see a strong recovery toward $2.5. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news Jito introduces TipRouter, the first decentralized Node Consensus Network (NCN), revolutionizing reward distribution across the Solana ecosystem with a focus on fairness and efficiency. TipRouter utilizes a consensus mechanism to align nodes on a shared merkle root, ensuring equitable MEV tip distribution, with a fee structure that supports the Jito DAO Treasury and stakeholders. Jito price prediction March 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $100K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $3.6 and a minimum of $2.3, with an average value of $2.9 throughout February.

Network activity exploded in March, with six times more unique wallets engaging on the blockchain. The momentum comes after the SEC officially dropped its appeal against Ripple , marking a major legal victory. This is a push factor for investors who waited long for this day. Many believe XRP will be the next big thing in the crypto space with an IPO launch to XRP ETF in the pipeline. The market is waiting for the XRP breakout in the coming months. XRP Surges as Whales Keep Accumulating XRP has surged past $2.50, jumping 14% as investors celebrate a big legal win for Ripple. The SEC dropping its appeal has lifted a major cloud over XRP’s future, fueling optimism and renewed buying interest. Despite some ups and downs in price, big investors have been steadily accumulating more XRP. Over the past two months, even when XRP briefly dropped to $2.45, large holders kept buying. Data from Santiment shows wallets with at least one million XRP have increased their stash by 6.5%, bringing the total to 46.4 billion XRP, now worth around $114 billion. At the same time, network activity has exploded, with six times more unique wallets interacting on the blockchain in March compared to earlier months. This growing interest from whales and retail traders suggests strong confidence in XRP’s future. While price movements have been mixed, major investors seem to be betting on a bigger breakout ahead. Could XRP Be Part of a U.S. Crypto Reserve? Adding to the excitement, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently hinted that XRP could play a role in a U.S. strategic digital asset stockpile. In an interview with Bloomberg, he referenced President Donald Trump’s executive order in early March, which proposed a national crypto reserve that could include XRP. With Trump’s bullish support the company is confident it will get back rolling soon once XRP ETF is approved. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: Brad Garlinghouse Hints at Reduced XRP Sales , How High Can XRP Go? With the SEC case now concluded and the FOMC meeting getting a mixed reaction, analysts believe XRP third largest crypto asset could be poised for a major breakout. The token has already touched $2.57 in recent trading, and many are now speculating whether it can surpass $3—a level it hasn’t seen since the 2017 bull run. It goes without saying that this price boost is also directly correlated with the SEC officially dropping its appeal against Ripple today. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already deemed this a 'resounding victory' for the entire crypto community. — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 19, 2025 If Bitcoin and the broader crypto market continue to rally, XRP could ride that momentum even higher. With regulatory clarity improving, institutional investors may start paying more attention to the token. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with banks and payment providers also add to its growth potential, making XRP one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies right now. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The initiative aligns with what they describe as the Trump administration’s push to integrate digital assets into national financial strategy. According to a March 14 regulatory filing , the Cayman Islands-based SPAC, named Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, aims to raise capital through a combination of public and private offerings. Trump Media-Linked Executives Lead Renatus Tactical SPAC Renatus Tactical is led by figures closely tied to Trump Media. Its CEO, Eric Swider, is a director at Trump Media and previously served as CEO of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that enabled Trump Media to go public. The company’s operating chief, Alexander Cano, was formerly the president of Digital World, while Trump Media’s CEO and chair, Devin Nunes, also serves as the chair of Renatus Tactical. While Renatus Tactical has not specified exact acquisition targets, its filing suggests an interest in companies within the crypto, blockchain, data security, and dual-use technology sectors. The firm stated that its primary focus is on high-growth businesses based in the United States, though it remains open to opportunities globally. The filing highlighted the Trump administration’s recent moves to incorporate digital assets into federal policy. Source: US SEC It cited Trump’s March executive order, which proposed establishing both a Bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile, as well as his January directive to form a working group tasked with developing cryptocurrency regulations. Despite the apparent regulatory support, Renatus Tactical acknowledged potential business challenges tied to its leadership’s association with Trump. The filing noted that some firms may be hesitant to engage with the SPAC due to its connection to the former president and Trump Media. Trump Remains Financially Tied to Media Company Leading SPAC Effort. Trump’s majority stake in Trump Media continues to be a key component of his wealth, largely through its ownership of the social media platform Truth Social. According to financial estimates, his net worth is valued at $4.8 billion by Forbes, while Bloomberg places it at over $6.5 billion. A significant portion of this—$2.36 billion—is derived from his 114.75 million shares in Trump Media, currently valued at $20.59 per share. To address potential conflicts of interest before his inauguration, Trump transferred these shares into a trust in December 2024. Last week, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project linked to former Trump and his sons, successfully completed its token sale , raising an impressive $550 million.

This funding aims to accelerate ecosystem growth, support innovation, and lay the foundation for long-term sustainability . This decision follows Uniswap’s launch of Uniswap v4 and Unichain, positioning the protocol for further expansion. The approval of these proposals has also generated a wave of optimism among community members, leading to a surge in UNI’s market activity. The Uniswap Foundation recently announced the success of these governance proposals, introduced as part of the "" Uniswap Unleashed"" initiative on February 14. The approval marks a turning point for Uniswap, enabling new opportunities to expand its network and create additional value for participants. One of the most crucial elements of this governance update is the groundwork for activating the highly anticipated “fee switch.” This mechanism is expected to enhance Uniswap’s financial sustainability and introduce rewards for UNI token holders. Additionally, it signals a broader shift toward a more balanced and incentivized ecosystem. According to the approved proposal, 65% of Unichain’s net chain revenue will be allocated to UVN validators and stakers once the UVN network launches. The Uniswap Foundation has outlined four key priorities for 2025 and beyond. The first focus is on scaling network supply by optimizing liquidity distribution across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, ensuring smoother transactions and increased efficiency. The second goal is to expand network demand by fostering DeFi innovation and attracting developers through funding programs, infrastructure support, and educational resources designed to enhance the development lifecycle. Strengthening governance is also a priority, with measures in place to activate revenue streams, onboard new contributors, and explore legal frameworks for governance purposes. A portion of Unichain’s revenue will be distributed among validators and stakers to encourage broader participation. Finally, the foundation plans to launch a Core Contributor Program that will build aligned development teams to drive protocol advancements and secure Uniswap’s long-term success. The total funding package includes $120.5 million , with $95.4 million dedicated to grants and $25.1 million assigned for operational expenses . The proposal emphasizes that this investment will be backed by industry-leading transparency standards, ensuring that funds are allocated effectively. The second proposal, which received input from Gauntlet, focuses on liquidity incentives to stimulate the growth of Uniswap v4 and Unichain. The objective is to attract liquidity providers, traders, and developers to these platforms, reinforcing their role in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). To support this effort, the Uniswap Foundation requested $45 million to fund liquidity incentives. The funds will be managed using the Aera platform, allowing Uniswap Governance to maintain control and recall any unutilized funds if necessary. Gauntlet has already established an Aera vault on the Ethereum mainnet, which will now be reactivated to support ongoing incentives. A total of 7,588,532 UNI tokens will be deposited into the vault to ensure liquidity remains strong. Following the announcement, UNI experienced a sharp increase in value, reflecting growing confidence in the protocol’s future. Trading volume also surged significantly, highlighting the increased activity within the market. With these governance updates in place, Uniswap is poised for continued expansion, driving innovation and reinforcing its position as a leading decentralized exchange in the evolving DeFi landscape.",,EN,0,0,UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-20 07:58:19

However, the unchanged inflation rates and the positive comments of the Fed Chair have reinstated confidence among the market participants. As a result, the Bitcoin price marked a local high above $87,000 and the Ethereum price managed to secure $2000. With this, the altcoins have begun to swell and some among them are on their way to form a new ATH. Ripple (XRP) The latest rounds of the SEC dropping the lawsuit against Ripple have circulated bullish waves across the markets. It is considered a huge win for the crypto markets, which may further pave the way for an XRP ETF, attracting significant volume onto the platform. The XRP price is withstanding the bearish pressure after hitting $2.59, which suggests the bulls have gained control and hence may continue to form higher highs and lows. XRP price is currently 27.9% away from its ATH and hence the rise above $3 could validate a strong rise towards a new ATH. Mantra (OM) Mantra (OM) is emerging as a new competitor to Chainlink (LINK) in the increasing world of Real-World Assets (RWA). The Mantra ecosystem has been expanding rapidly, with strategic partnerships exceeding $1 billion. Currently, the OM price is experiencing bearish heat but is just 23.9% away from its ATH at $8.99. The price has maintained higher highs and lows since the start of the year and hence is believed to revamp a strong rally and reach a double-digit figure soon. Story (IP) The Story token began its trading journey facing a significant bearish heat, but the bulls soon took over the rally and revived a strong upswing. Since then, the price has been maintaining an ascending consolidation and after reaching the apex of the accumulation phase, the IP price is expected to trigger a breakout towards new highs. The price is currently, 24.1% away from its ATH, which is around $7.31. Therefore, a rise from the current consolidation may trigger a strong upswing to $10 soon. Tron (TRX) Since the start, the Tron price has maintained a strong ascending trend. As a result, the price marched high to mark a new ATH at $0.33 before the end of 2024. After a magnificent upswing, the bulls seem to cooling off. As the accumulation phase reaches its apex, the price is expected to trigger a strong rebound and head towards its ATH, which is 46% away. Hence, the TRX price is expected to rise above $0.43 and reach $0.5 and trade strongly within the discovery phase. Bitget Token (BGB) After remaining consolidated for over a few years, the Bitget Token price triggered a massive upswing and marked a new ATH before the end of 2024. After a small correction, the price has begun to head towards the upper resistance, halting the descending trend. The BGM price is below its ATH by 43.5% and the current price action suggests a strong continuation of an ascending trend, marking a new ATH above $10.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BGB|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 07:59:14

This is seen as a bullish sign and could attract more investors and traders. However, the post on X also noted that this positive sentiment follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifying ADA’s use case as “ smart contracts for government services.” As a result, bullish sentiment for ADA has reached a four-month high.

Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset breaks out of this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially surge by 12%, reaching $0.85 in the coming days.

Within a single day, negative sentiment surged by 90%, raising concerns about potential manipulation. Supporters claim this rapid decline was not organic, pointing to the unusually high number of votes compared to other cryptocurrencies. Despite these claims, there is no concrete evidence proving any external interference, leaving the cause of the sentiment shift uncertain. Since its launch, Pi Network has faced scrutiny regarding governance, transparency, and legitimacy. Regulators in several countries have expressed concerns, while critics have questioned its long-term sustainability. However, Pi’s community has remained active and vocal, often rallying around issues affecting the project’s reputation. This has included influencing online votes, reviews, and social media discussions to counter negative perceptions. The sudden drop in sentiment coincides with a difficult period for Pi Network. The project has faced a significant decline in value , largely due to major investor sell-offs. Additionally, many users missed the Know Your Customer ( KYC ) verification deadline, preventing them from accessing their Pi holdings. This combination of factors has contributed to growing frustration within the community. Pi Network has also seen tensions with other platforms and exchanges. In the past, community members have reacted strongly to delays in exchange listings, negative coverage, and critical remarks from industry leaders. One notable example involved a major crypto exchange, where Pi supporters flooded app store reviews with negative ratings after the platform’s CEO criticized the project. A similar reaction occurred when another exchange postponed listing Pi, triggering backlash from the community. Despite the allegations of manipulation, some analysts believe the shift in sentiment may be genuine. The platform has encountered persistent liquidity issues , making it difficult for users to convert Pi into fiat currency. Moreover, the delays in key integrations have led to growing skepticism among investors, contributing to the recent market downturn. The scale of the sentiment shift remains a key point of debate. The speed at which negative votes appeared far exceeded what is typically seen with other cryptocurrencies. Given this anomaly, some in the Pi community argue that outside actors may have played a role in altering perceptions. However, without definitive proof, it remains speculation. For now, Pi Network supporters continue to monitor the situation closely. The controversy surrounding the sentiment shift highlights the complexities of gauging true investor confidence. Whether this impacts Pi Network’s long-term adoption and reputation remains to be seen, but the situation underscores the volatility of public sentiment in the crypto space.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-20 08:02:59

The first round includes nine meme coins , with two winning projects set to receive a full listing. Among the contenders are Mubarak and two Broccoli-themed tokens, both generating significant market buzz. The initiative is part of Binance’s strategy to involve users in its listing process, a move that has sparked both excitement and debate. In this initial round, all participating tokens are built on the BNB Chain, but future voting rounds will include projects from across Binance Alpha’s list of featured assets. The exchange hopes this new system will enhance user engagement while maintaining listing quality. Mubarak has emerged as one of the standout contenders in this vote. After gaining traction on Binance Alpha, the token’s market capitalization surged, driven in part by speculation about its potential full listing. Its rapid rise was also fueled by interactions from Binance’s former CEO, who has previously influenced market trends by engaging with specific tokens. Additionally, the inclusion of Broccoli-themed meme coins reflects an ongoing trend in the crypto space, where tokens inspired by cultural or social phenomena gain massive traction. The popularity of these tokens has been amplified by discussions around Binance’s community-driven approach, as many traders see this as an opportunity to influence market listings directly. However, Binance’s decision to introduce community voting for listings has sparked mixed reactions. Some traders appreciate the transparency and engagement, while others remain skeptical about the influence of hype-driven tokens. The exchange had previously faced criticism for its meme coin listings, and some argue that a public vote could lead to unpredictable market trends. A notable concern is that Binance’s last community-driven decision favored a well-known crypto project, yet the exchange never moved forward with the listing. This has raised questions about whether the winning tokens will be guaranteed a place on Binance’s main exchange. In response, Binance emphasized that all voting candidates have already passed its Alpha listing standards, ensuring a base level of credibility. Despite the controversy, the new voting process is expected to boost user participation and create stronger engagement between traders and the exchange. By allowing users to have a direct say in listings, Binance is testing a new model for market-driven token adoption. If the approach proves successful, it could set a precedent for other exchanges looking to implement similar strategies. As the vote unfolds, crypto enthusiasts are closely watching which tokens gain the most support. The outcome could not only shape Binance’s future listings but also influence broader market trends as traders speculate on the next big meme coin to make it onto the exchange.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-20 08:06:01

This will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has formally spoken at a cryptocurrency conference, marking a significant moment for the industry. His appearance, whether live or pre-recorded, is expected to generate major discussions about the future of digital asset regulation. Reports indicate that while Trump’s participation may not be in person, his address will still be a key highlight of the event. Sources suggest he might deliver a pre-recorded speech rather than appearing via live stream. The crypto community is closely watching for any policy signals he might give, as his stance on digital asset regulations could influence market sentiment. Earlier this month, Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit , an event that sparked mixed reactions within the community. While some expected major policy shifts, others were disappointed by the lack of clear directives. However, it did provide insights into the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve and the administration’s broader regulatory outlook. Trump’s speech at DAS is expected to build on these discussions and possibly offer more clarity on his administration’s approach to crypto. Alongside Trump, the summit will feature key figures from both the political and financial sectors. Notable speakers include Representatives Ro Khanna and Tom Emmer, both of whom have been involved in legislative efforts concerning digital assets. Industry leaders such as Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse will also take the stage, making this one of the most significant gatherings for the crypto sector this year. Adding to the anticipation, Garlinghouse recently announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had dropped its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, marking a pivotal moment for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. The regulatory landscape remains a major concern for investors, and Trump’s remarks at the summit could provide crucial insights into how his administration plans to approach digital asset policies. The timing of this address is particularly noteworthy, as the Federal Reserve has recently confirmed that it will not introduce any immediate interest rate cuts, though two reductions are expected later in the year. The crypto market has shown signs of recovery, and Trump’s comments at DAS could further impact investor sentiment. If he signals a favorable stance toward digital asset regulations, the market may respond positively, reinforcing confidence among traders and institutions. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the need for clear regulatory frameworks remains one of the most pressing challenges. Trump’s speech at DAS could be a defining moment in shaping how the U.S. government approaches blockchain technology, decentralized finance, and digital currencies. Whether his comments introduce new policies or simply reaffirm existing views, they will undoubtedly be scrutinized by both policymakers and industry leaders. The growing engagement of high-profile political figures with the cryptocurrency sector underscores its increasing importance in the global economy. Events like DAS are crucial platforms for bridging the gap between regulators, investors, and technology innovators. With Trump’s participation, the conference gains even more significance, setting the stage for potential regulatory shifts in the near future. Overall, Trump’s address at DAS could mark a turning point for cryptocurrency policies in the U.S. If his administration adopts a more supportive stance on digital assets , it could lead to greater institutional adoption and investment in the sector. However, the specifics of his speech remain unknown, leaving the crypto community eagerly awaiting his remarks.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-20 08:08:51

BTC rose in early Asian hours on Thursday following the Wednesday Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the Fed kept rates intact but lowered growth outlooks until 2027. Ether (ETH) remained muted after a sudden 7% jump late Wednesday, ending the day up 3.%. Solana’s SOL, dogecoin (DOGE), and BNB Chain’s BNB showed gains under 6%, while Uniswap’s UNI surged 8% as token holders passed a $165 million foundation funding proposal. XRP jumped as high as 12% before paring gains, as closely-related Ripple Labs ended its long-standing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating Wednesday that the case had “come to an end.” The asset got a further boost in the U.S. as Bitnomial said it would launch futures tied to the token for local investors from Thursday in a first for the region. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said the Fed should cut interest rates with the U.S. reciprocal tariffs coming into play starting April 1. Separately, his national economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said he anticipated a 2.5% growth rate against the Fed’s 1.7% expectation. “The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” As such, traders remain cautious of a continual rally and noted current market action could be a relief bounce. “The rally is probably a function of a relief bounce as markets steady back after 5 weeks of consecutive equity sell-offs, and traders awaiting more hard data releases to draw a firmer conclusion on the current economic trajectory,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, mirrored the sentiment in an email to CoinDesk: “Overall market sentiment has been so weak these past few weeks that even Powell's relatively neutral speech and merely the lack of negative comments caused crypto prices to rally.” “Additionally, there haven't been any new tariff announcements to shock the market. That being said, things could change very quickly and we're advising all of our clients to stay observant and vigilant through the next few weeks and months as we move through stages of volatility,” Mei ended.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|Donald Trump|SEC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-20 08:12:05

The crypto market, which often reacts to shifts in monetary policy , saw minor losses following the announcement. However, as the decision was widely anticipated, no major disruptions occurred. The Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to keeping inflation at 2% over the long term, emphasizing its focus on balancing economic growth and stability. Despite speculation that rate cuts could provide a much-needed boost to the market, the Fed stood firm, citing economic uncertainty as a key reason. The decision aligns with prior statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell , who made it clear that immediate cuts were unlikely. Investors had been optimistic that easing monetary policy could inject fresh capital into the crypto space, which has been struggling with volatility and broader economic pressures. With no immediate relief from rate cuts, market participants will have to look elsewhere for positive momentum. While the FOMC ruled out immediate cuts, it did project that two reductions could still happen later in 2025. If these adjustments materialize, they could provide a more favorable environment for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the committee emphasized the need to balance rate reductions with inflation control, economic uncertainty, and potential market risks. Beyond interest rates, the Fed also announced a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT) , adjusting its approach to Treasury securities. This shift, while not a rate cut, is seen as a step toward increasing market liquidity. Some investors welcomed the news, as it suggests a more cautious approach to tightening financial conditions. For now, crypto traders and investors remain on edge, searching for new catalysts that could drive market growth. The decision not to cut rates has left the market in a state of cautious waiting, hoping for signs of economic recovery or fresh regulatory clarity that could reignite bullish sentiment. While the lack of immediate action from the Fed has created some disappointment, long-term investors are still watching for any signals that could indicate a shift in monetary policy .

Many believe that bot activity could be behind the sharp decline, especially as the price also dropped. Is Massive Sell-Off The Reason? Some believe mass sell-offs caused the drop, but without clear evidence, the community is left questioning the true reason for the sudden change in sentiment. While there is no solid evidence of bot activity, previous incidents of vote manipulation in the Pi community have fueled growing skepticism. Since its launch on February 20, Pi Network has faced many controversies. Critics have raised concerns about its accessibility, governance, transparency, and more, while several governments have labeled it a scam. Pi Network Faces Growing Controversy Pi Network has faced criticism and price declines recently, with its supporters influencing polls, votes, and ratings multiple times. A community member pointed out that the sudden negative shift seems unlikely to be natural, especially since other platforms show different results. Just compare the difference. 77% of the $PI community is bullish on coingecko. Why is it so different on Coinmarket? Somebody is playing with the numbers. #PiNetwork https://t.co/seJPoBGoiq pic.twitter.com/PFTAyeVTYS — MOON JEFF (@CRYPTOAD00) March 19, 2025 This user pointed out that Pi’s community sentiment dropped by 90% in less than a day, with more participants than Bitcoin’s poll. The user noticed that on other platforms with similar voting systems, Pi’s rating remained stable. Based on this, they concluded that bot activity might be responsible for the sudden drop in Pi’s rating. It’s tough to confirm the Pi Network bot claims for a few reasons. The token’s price has dropped sharply this week, with many users losing significant amounts of Pi tokens after the KYC migration deadline. Huge sell-offs from investors have also led to a price crash, so some of the negative sentiment might be real. Notably, CoinMarketCap is the only platform linked to the Pi Network bot voting allegations. Initially, CoinMarketCap refused to list Pi as one of the largest tokens by market cap, but eventually gave in. This could have caused resentment from either the platform or its community towards Pi. No Clear Evidence The Pi community has a history of vote brigading. When Bybit’s CEO criticized Pi, supporters flooded the app with negative reviews. They did the same with Binance when the exchange delayed a Pi listing. Hence it’s unlikely that Pi supporters or critics spiked the poll without bots. The negative votes came in fast, were only on one platform, and outnumbered votes for even the largest cryptocurrencies. Therefore, at this point, it’s hard to find conclusive evidence either way and no solid proof to confirm or deny the claims being made.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BTC|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 08:14:15

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has dropped a bombshell, predicting the arrival of multiple XRP ETFs in the United States as early as the latter half of this year. This exciting forecast, revealed in a recent Bloomberg Crypto interview, is sending ripples (pun intended!) throughout the digital asset community. But what does this mean for you, for XRP, and for the broader cryptocurrency landscape? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Anticipated Launch of an XRP ETF a Big Deal? Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have revolutionized traditional investment markets, offering investors a simple and regulated way to gain exposure to various asset classes. The prospect of a crypto ETF , and specifically an XRP ETF , is similarly groundbreaking for several key reasons: Increased Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a vast pool of investors who may be hesitant to directly purchase and manage cryptocurrencies. This includes institutional investors and retail investors using brokerage accounts. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, providing investors with a sense of security and trust. This is particularly crucial in the often-volatile world of crypto, where regulatory clarity is highly sought after. Mainstream Adoption: The launch of a Ripple ETF or any crypto ETF is a significant step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets. It signals growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the established financial system. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand driven by ETF investments could potentially lead to a positive price impact on XRP and the broader crypto market. What Did Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Actually Say About XRP ETFs? In his interview, Garlinghouse conveyed strong confidence about the future of XRP ETFs in the US. He stated that he anticipates “multiple” XRP ETFs launching in the latter half of 2024. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s based on Ripple’s ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and the evolving landscape of crypto regulation in the United States. His optimism stems from several factors, including: Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF Approval: The SEC’s approval of Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF earlier this year set a precedent and paved the way for other crypto-related investment products. Growing Institutional Interest: There is increasing demand from institutional investors for regulated crypto exposure, making crypto ETFs an attractive vehicle. Ripple’s Legal Progress: Garlinghouse also mentioned his expectation that the SEC would drop its appeal against Ripple, further solidifying Ripple’s position and potentially easing regulatory hurdles for an XRP ETF . Beyond XRP ETFs: The US Government’s Crypto Stockpile – What’s the Buzz? Garlinghouse also touched upon another fascinating development: the US government’s plans for a crypto stockpile . This initiative involves the government accumulating seized cryptocurrencies, including XRP, to create a strategic reserve. Imagine a digital Fort Knox, but instead of gold, it’s filled with Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital assets! This move signifies a notable shift in the government’s approach to cryptocurrency, from potential skepticism to recognizing its strategic importance. Key points to understand about this crypto stockpile : Seized Assets: The stockpile will be built using cryptocurrencies seized in criminal investigations and other enforcement actions. Strategic Reserve: Similar to strategic petroleum reserves, this crypto stockpile could be used for various purposes, including national security and potentially market stabilization (though the exact usage remains to be seen). Dual Reserve System: Garlinghouse mentioned the possibility of a separate Bitcoin strategic reserve alongside the broader crypto stockpile , highlighting Bitcoin’s unique position in the crypto ecosystem. This government initiative further underscores the growing legitimacy and integration of cryptocurrencies into the fabric of the US economy and governance. What are the Potential Benefits of XRP ETFs and Government Crypto Stockpiles? Both XRP ETFs and government crypto stockpiles , while distinct, point towards a maturing crypto market with potential benefits across the board: Benefit XRP ETFs Government Crypto Stockpile Market Maturation Signals regulatory acceptance and mainstream integration of XRP. Demonstrates government recognition of crypto’s strategic importance. Investor Access Opens XRP investment to a wider range of investors through regulated channels. Indirectly legitimizes crypto as an asset class the government holds. Price Discovery Increased trading volume in ETFs can contribute to more efficient price discovery for XRP. Potential (though speculative) for stockpile management to influence market stability. Innovation & Growth Encourages further development and innovation within the XRP ecosystem. May spur further research and development in crypto security and management by government agencies. Are There Any Challenges or Concerns to Consider? While the prospects are exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Despite positive signals, the SEC’s approval process for crypto ETFs can be unpredictable. There are no guarantees of timely approvals. Market Volatility: The crypto market remains volatile. While ETFs offer diversification, they are still subject to market fluctuations. Stockpile Management: Managing a large crypto stockpile securely and effectively presents logistical and security challenges for the government. Market Manipulation Concerns: Increased ETF trading volume needs to be monitored to prevent market manipulation, especially in the early stages. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do With This Information? So, what should you take away from this news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments regarding XRP ETF filings and regulatory announcements from the SEC. Do Your Research: Understand the risks and potential rewards of investing in XRP and crypto ETFs before making any decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider crypto ETFs as a potential part of a diversified investment portfolio, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. Follow Market Trends: Monitor market sentiment and price movements related to XRP and the broader crypto market as ETF developments unfold. Conclusion: A Thrilling Chapter for XRP and Crypto? Brad Garlinghouse’s prediction of XRP ETFs launching in the US this year, coupled with the news of a government crypto stockpile , paints a picture of a rapidly evolving and maturing cryptocurrency landscape. These developments could mark a significant turning point, potentially unlocking new avenues for investment, driving mainstream adoption, and solidifying crypto’s place in the global financial system. While challenges remain, the overall trajectory points towards an exciting future for XRP and the entire crypto industry. The potential for XRP ETFs to revolutionize access to XRP and for government stockpiles to further legitimize digital assets is undeniably significant.

The new company aims to raise approximately $179 million to acquire businesses in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, data security, and defense technology sectors. Notably, it is a blank check company incorporated provided exemption status in Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization of businesses. Leadership and Objectives of Trump Media’s New Company Renatus Tactical is spearheaded by individuals with deep ties to TMTG which includes: Eric Swider, Chief Executive Officer: A current board member of TMTG, Swider plays a pivotal role in the merger that brought TMTG public. Devin Nunes, Chairman: Serving as the CEO of TMTG since January 2022, Nunes previously represented California’s 22nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Alexander Cano, Chief Operating Officer: Formerly the president and secretary of the firm that merged with TMTG, Cano brings extensive experience in corporate operations. Notably, all these three executives were deeply involved in the drama-filled merger – the 29-months high voltage drama from October 2021 to merger’s final approval in March 2024 – between Trump Media and Digital World that made Trump’s media company and Truth Social platform public. And now this newly formed SPAC’s primary objective is to identify and merge with companies operating in sectors that are both technologically innovative and integral to national interests. According to the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Renatus Tactical is particularly interested in industries where government involvement is significant, either as a regulator or a major client. Business Purpose as stated to SEC. Strategic Timing for the New Company’s Arrival by Trump Media Execs? The launch of Renatus Tactical comes at a time when the current administration of United States is taking unprecedented steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy. This alignment with federal initiatives suggests a calculated approach to capitalize on emerging opportunities within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Moreover, the defense technology sector, other focus of SPAC, has garnered increased attention due to evolving global security dynamics. By targeting dual-use technologies—those applicable in both civilian and military contexts—Renatus Tactical positions itself at the nexus of innovation and national security. Financial Structure and Fundraising Goals Renatus Tactical plans to raise a total of $178,942,500 through its initial public offering (IPO) and private placements. The breakdown is as follows: Public Offering: 17.5 million shares at $10 each, totaling $175 million. Private Placement: 3,942,500 warrants at $1 each, amounting to $3,942,500. The funds raised will be allocated toward identifying and merging with a suitable target company that aligns with Renatus Tactical’s strategic objectives. Can its ties with TMTG Cause a Problem? While the SPAC’s leadership boasts significant experience, their affiliations with TMTG and former President Donald Trump could present unique challenges. The SEC filing acknowledges that “third parties may not want to engage with us to provide services due to the affiliation of our management team and our board of directors with TMTG and President Donald J. Trump.” Additionally, the SPAC market has experienced increased scrutiny from regulators, necessitating meticulous compliance and transparent operations. NEW SPAC’s TIES WITH TRUMP AND TMTG Implications for the Crypto and Defense Sectors Renatus Tactical’s focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies aligns with a broader trend of institutional interest in digital assets. Their potential entry into the defense technology arena could foster innovations that bolster national security while offering lucrative investment opportunities.

The analyst tells his 782,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needs to flip $84,500 into support this week in order to regain bullish momentum. However, he warns if Bitcoin fails to break through $84,500, the flagship crypto asset may collapse in price. “I really want to see some momentum on Bitcoin. If it doesn’t happen this week and we’ll break sub $82,000, likely we’ll see some new lows. Break $84,500 equals party time.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, the analyst says if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $84,500 as support this week, there are two likely outcomes. “Two scenarios, as Bitcoin faces crucial resistance here: Reject and find a higher low [around $82,000]. Reject and double-bottom retest [in the $70,000 range] before moving higher.” Bitcoin is trading for $87,315 at time of writing, up 5.7% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink may be printing a double-bottom pattern against Bitcoin ( LINK /BTC) on the weekly chart. A double-bottom pattern is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern as buyers step in to create a price floor for an asset. “LINK doing a double bottom test and back to the range low. Weekly firing up nicely. Things are heating up the right way.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that LINK/BTC will soar to as high as 0.000795 BTC worth $68.39. LINK/BTC is trading for 0.0001719 BTC ($14.92) at time of writing, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Analysts Share Their Predictions After SEC-Ripple Case Ends!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-much-can-xrp-price-rise-analysts-share-their-predictions-after-sec-ripple-case-ends/,"The Ripple-SEC case has come to an end. Yesterday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement that the SEC has withdrawn its objection. Related News: JUST IN: SEC- Is Ripple Case Coming to an End! Ripple CEO Explained! XRP Price Started to Rise! While the decision still needs the commission's approval, the move marks the end of a years-long lawsuit that has negatively impacted the company's U.S. operations. While the XRP price moved after the Ripple CEO's statement, analysts commented on the impact of the end of the SEC-Ripple case on the XRP price. At this point, analysts noted that the end of the SEC case, Ripple's progress, possible regulatory changes, and increasing adoption are important factors for the XRP price. Accordingly, B2BinPay CEO Arthur Azizov predicted that the XRP price will be between $5 and $7 in the first half of 2025. The CEO attributed this rise in the XRP price to XRP being chosen for reserve by Trump, the end of the SEC case, and Ripple making significant progress in the global payment sector. XTB analyst Hani Abuagla has predicted a wider price range for XRP. He argues that the price could reach a level between $5 and $100, citing the SEC lawsuit victory and possible regulatory relaxation under a Trump administration as the reason for his bold prediction. Bitget Research analyst Ryan Lee also offered a more conservative forecast. Lee expects the XRP price to range between $1.80 and $8.40, with $10 being possible. At this point, Lee notes that $10 and above is dependent on increased adoption and the resolution of ongoing regulatory hurdles. A bigger prediction came from the famous lawyer John Deaton, founder of CryptoLawUS. Deaton claimed that XRP could become the second largest cryptocurrency, surpassing Ethereum. Deaton said that he is confident that the SEC will approve XRP ETFs, which could lead to further price appreciation and result in it surpassing ETH. Although analysts' predictions are bullish, the future of the XRP price remains uncertain. At this point, it remains unclear whether these predictions will come true, and the expected rise continues to depend on various factors. *This is not investment advice.

Last month, I watched my crypto portfolio lose 15% overnight after the Fed announcement. As Bitcoin and top altcoins bounce around on the charts, there's this new project called Dawgz AI that's turning heads during its presale. New buyers are jumping in daily, even with all this Fed-driven drama happening. While Powell and company keep everyone guessing about inflation and when they'll finally cut rates, having the right picks in the crypto space could seriously boost your returns in the months ahead. What Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now With the Fed keeping interest rates steady , smart money is flowing into select projects that show real promise in the crypto market. These aren't your typical tokens, they're projects with actual utility, growing communities, and serious momentum. Let's examine the top three contenders that deserve attention. 1. Dawgz AI Dawgz AI is making waves during its presale phase, having raised $2,800,036 out of its $3,080,000 target. What's particularly impressive about $DAGZ is how it's attracted significant investment despite broader market uncertainty following recent Federal Reserve announcements. The project combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with cryptocurrency trading. This technological edge has garnered attention from both retail investors and crypto venture funds looking for the next breakthrough project in the crypto space. Fun Fact: The Dawgz AI algorithm processes over 840,000 market data points daily, making it one of the most data-intensive AI projects in the blockchain technology sector. Key Features: AI-Powered Trading: High-frequency algorithms running 24/7 Security First: Fully audited by SolidProof for investor protection Strong Tokenomics: 8 billion total supply with balanced distribution Staking Rewards: 20% of tokens allocated for incentives Multiple Payment Options: Buy with ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT, or USDC Community Focus: 15% allocation for rewards What makes Dawgz AI stand out as the best altcoin , is its blend of meme appeal with actual AI technology. Their promotion cleverly addresses the FOMO that drives many investors in the meme coins segment. 2. Render (RNDR) Render token (RNDR) shows significant momentum as the native currency of the Render Network, connecting GPU power with artists and developers who need rendering services. The project has been operating since 2021 and serves a specific niche in the digital assets creation ecosystem. While Render addresses genuine industry needs and has an established market presence. Key Features: Decentralized GPU Rendering for digital assets creation Strong Exchange Presence: Available on major crypto exchange platforms High Trading Volume: Nearly $10M on RNDR/USDT pair Real Utility: Solving actual problems in 3D rendering for gaming and visual effects Consistent growth trajectory, recently hitting all-time high of $13.60 The growth potential for Render comes from its practical application in high-demand industries, positioning it as a decent choice for best cheap crypto to buy with established utility. 3. Dogelon Mars (ELON) Dogelon Mars represents the evolution of dog-themed meme coins, maintaining a strong position among established projects in the crypto universe. Launched in 2021 during the initial meme coin wave, Dogelon has survived multiple market cycles and maintained community interest. However, Dogelon lacks substantive technological innovation, making it more susceptible to market volatility during periods of economic uncertainty like the current Federal Reserve policy environment. Key Features: Multi-Chain Accessibility without geographic restrictions Strong Community Rating: 4.0 user rating on tracking platforms Diverse Exchange Listings: Traded on Uniswap, OKX, and KuCoin Market Resilience: Maintained presence since 2021 despite fluctuations Crypto trading pairs available with ETH, USDC, USDT, and SOL Dogelon Mars combines the popularity of dog-themed tokens with space exploration branding, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and cosmic-themed project fans. How These Top Cryptos Compare As the Fed's decision continues to ripple through markets, buyers need to weigh their options carefully. Looking at all three contenders, $DAGZ stands out for those seeking both innovation and early-stage potential among the best crypto to buy now for 2025. Feature Dawgz AI Render (RNDR) Dogelon Mars (ELON) Current Price $0.00345 $3.34 $0.00001382 Market Cap Presale $1.72B $75.96M Use Case AI-powered trading GPU rendering Community-driven Development Early (Presale) Established Established Security Audited Multi-year track record Multi-year track record Potential ROI Highest (Pre-launch) Moderate Uncertain This comparison highlights why early-stage investors with higher risk tolerance are flocking to Dawgz AI's presale while also showing the established positions of both Render and Dogelon Mars. Which Memecoin to Buy? Among current meme coins, Dawgz AI stands out as the frontrunner. While established players like Dogelon Mars have demonstrated staying power, they lack the innovative AI technology that gives Dawgz AI its edge. Unlike purely speculative tokens, Dawgz AI combines viral appeal with practical trading algorithms, making it the top crypto to buy . Currently available at presale prices before its imminent increase, it offers that rare early entry point most buyers missed with previous meme coins successes. Conclusion The best crypto to buy now ultimately depends on individual investment goals, but $DAGZ presents a compelling case during this Federal Reserve decision period. With its presale nearly 90% complete, timing is important for potential biggest winners. While established players like Render offer proven utility and Dogelon Mars continues the meme tradition, Dawgz AI uniquely combines both worlds with AI-powered functionality. Consider allocating a small percentage of your holdings to presale projects, they often deliver the highest returns when supported by solid technology and active participation from a growing community. Frequently Asked Questions What is best to invest in crypto right now? With the Fed maintaining current interest rates, AI-integrated cryptocurrencies like Dawgz AI show the strongest potential. Projects combining technological utility with strong community backing are positioned to outperform as markets digest the latest economic signals. What crypto under $1 will explode? Dawgz AI at $0.00345 shows remarkable explosion potential with its presale nearly complete and advanced AI trading algorithms. Its combination of meme appeal and practical utility creates the perfect conditions for significant price movement upon full market launch. Which coin can go 1000x? Early-stage projects in presale phase like $DAGZ have the highest 1000x potential. The combination of AI technology, strong tokenomics with staking rewards, and being available before exchange listings creates the rare conditions needed for exponential growth. Which crypto will reach $1? While Dawgz AI would need substantial growth from its current $0.00345 price to reach $1, its AI-powered functionality and clear development roadmap make it a stronger contender than typical meme coins. Its practical utility and strategic token allocation for staking suggest stronger long-term value potential. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

42036996,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=696625,1742462337,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42036996.jpeg,Trump to sign an executive order for D.O.G.E to shut down the education department,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-eo-d-o-g-e-shut-down-education-dept/,"President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday to begin shutting down the Department of Education via the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), according to the White House. The signing will take place in the White House, with Republican governors, state education officials, and school children attending. Trump has long promised to eliminate the agency, calling it an example of federal overreach. The order will direct Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to dismantle the department and return education authority to the states. While Congress must approve a complete shutdown, this order will set the process in motion. The White House says this will allow parents and local communities to control education policy, but the decision is already facing legal challenges. Trump moves to eliminate federal education control Trump has repeatedly said that the Department of Education has too much power over schools. His campaign promise to shrink the federal government is now happening, and he is making sure the Education Department is first on the chopping block. “I told Linda (McMahon), ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job in putting yourself out of a job,’” Trump said in February. This follows mass layoffs at the Education Department earlier this month. The agency cut 1,300 employees, nearly 50% of its workforce, with many more taking voluntary buyouts. Unions are furious. “Donald Trump and Elon Musk have aimed their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities,” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said. She warned that shutting down the department would increase class sizes, eliminate job training programs, make higher education more expensive, and take away special education services. The White House insists that federal funding for students with disabilities, Title I schools, and student loans will not change. Elon Musk questions how the government spends money At the same time, Elon Musk is making headlines for calling out government spending. On a podcast with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Musk said that 14 computers in the Department of Treasury are creating money out of thin air. “I think we found now 14 magic money computers,” Musk said. “They just send money out of nothing.” Musk said the government’s financial system is so flawed that if it were a public company, it would be delisted immediately. “If this was a corporation, its officers would be in prison,” Musk said. Hedge fund manager Jay Hatfield suggested that Musk might be accusing federal agencies of not following proper accounting standards. But he admitted it’s hard to prove. The Treasury Department and Cruz’s office have not responded to requests for comment. Printing money fuels inflation and hidden taxation Musk’s comments have reignited debate over how the U.S. government funds itself. Since the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971, the government has been able to print money freely. Former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke once explained the process: “The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost.” The Federal Reserve creates money by buying assets from banks, which then lend out that money. Critics, including Sen. Ron Paul, argue that this system is a hidden tax on Americans by devaluing the dollar. “The purchasing power of the dollar has fallen to less than $0.05 of its 1913 value,” Paul wrote in his book End the Fed .

42036869,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141760,1742462415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Debt Collection: ClearGrid’s $10M AI Power Play in MENA,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-debt-collection-mena-funding/,"Is debt collection stuck in the dark ages? For many in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the answer is a resounding yes. Imagine outdated processes, costly inefficiencies, and borrowers feeling harassed – it’s a recipe for disaster in emerging markets. But hold on, a fresh wave of innovation is here! ClearGrid, a Dubai-based startup, just secured a powerful $10 million in funding to inject some much-needed AI in Debt Collection into the MENA region. Let’s dive into how they’re planning to shake things up and why this could be a game-changer for both lenders and borrowers. Modernizing Debt Collection MENA with AI: A New Dawn Traditional debt collection in MENA is facing a perfect storm. Consumer lending is booming, regulators are demanding fairer practices, and old-school methods are simply not cutting it. ClearGrid is stepping into this gap, armed with cutting-edge AI , to transform how debt is recovered. Here’s the lowdown: The Problem: Legacy debt collection often relies on outdated systems and aggressive tactics, damaging borrower trust and hindering recovery rates. ClearGrid’s Solution: They’re building an AI-driven platform to modernize the entire process, making it more efficient, ethical, and effective. The Funding Boost: A significant $10 million in funding (pre-seed and seed) signals strong investor confidence in ClearGrid’s vision and potential. The Mission: To help banks, fintechs, and lenders in MENA recover more debt while fostering better relationships with customers – no more harassment! Mohammed Al Zaben, ClearGrid’s co-founder and CEO, brings a unique perspective to this challenge. After his previous startup, Munch:On, was acquired by Careem, he recognized a critical pain point: efficient payment collection. This led him to explore the world of receivables management and, crucially, the often-problematic realm of consumer debt collection. What he found was an industry ripe for disruption. Why Now? The Perfect Storm for Fintech Innovation in Debt Recovery Al Zaben’s deep dive revealed a stark reality: many debt collection agencies in MENA were operating with outdated technology, some even relying on pen and paper! Even the more advanced agencies were only using basic CRM systems. This meant: Outdated Methods: Heavy reliance on manual processes and scare tactics. Poor Borrower Experience: Aggressive collection practices led to borrower frustration and distrust. Regulatory Pressure: Regulators in Saudi Arabia and the UAE are increasingly focused on consumer protection, demanding fairer practices. Booming Lending Market: The rise of BNPL services and unsecured lending created a larger pool of debt to manage, exacerbating existing inefficiencies. This confluence of factors created a massive opportunity for Fintech Innovation in debt collection. Al Zaben and his co-founders, Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud and Mohammed Khalili, despite lacking prior experience in the collections industry, jumped in to create ClearGrid. Their vision? To leverage software and AI to not just streamline debt recovery but to partner with existing vendors in the space, creating a collaborative ecosystem. “At a time when lending is booming, regulations are tightening, and AI is reshaping industries, we see this as an opportunity to help lenders recover debt while building trust with borrowers,” Al Zaben stated. Bader Al Saud added, “This is just the first step in building the infrastructure for the future of debt resolution.” How Does ClearGrid’s Automated Debt Recovery Work? ClearGrid acts as a bridge between lenders and borrowers, employing AI to automate and optimize the entire debt collection lifecycle. Here’s a breakdown of their Automated Debt Recovery process: Seamless Integration: Lenders integrate with ClearGrid’s platform via API, easily sending borrower account information. AI-Powered Insights: ClearGrid’s AI models analyze vast datasets to: Score repayment likelihood. Predict customer behavior patterns. Personalize communication strategies across various channels. Intelligent Automation: A staggering 95% of ClearGrid’s operations are automated, including AI voice agents that handle a massive volume of calls daily. Human Touch When Needed: For borrowers who prefer human interaction, the platform facilitates direct conversations, ensuring a balance between automation and personalized support. Crucially, these interactions also feed valuable data back into ClearGrid’s AI models, continuously improving their effectiveness. Categorization and Personalized Repayment Plans: ClearGrid’s system categorizes borrowers based on their capacity and willingness to repay. It then structures manageable repayment plans, encouraging repayment through positive nudges rather than aggressive tactics. ClearGrid claims its platform can slash collection costs by an impressive 50%. According to Al Zaben, “We’re building purpose-built tools and finding ways to make lenders better at what they do while also creating an opportunity for consumers to get out of debt.” Since launching in 2024, ClearGrid reports significant traction, managing hundreds of millions in debt portfolios and partnering with ten major fintechs and banks in the UAE. They cite impressive results: Client Type Improvement Major Bank 30% increase in recovery rates, 50% reduction in collection costs Leading BNPL Provider Doubled recoveries by automating early-stage debt resolution Overall, ClearGrid asserts that it resolves debts twice as fast as traditional agencies, achieving resolution rates between 38% and 50%, with borrowers engaging with their platform 60% more. Their revenue model is based on a percentage fee on recovered amounts, and they are experiencing a remarkable 30% month-on-month revenue growth in the UAE, where they are already profitable. Saudi Arabia is next on their expansion roadmap. Looking Ahead: 10x Growth and Building the Future of Credit Orchestration With the newly secured funding, ClearGrid has ambitious plans to “10x” its revenue and the number of accounts managed in 2024. Currently, they engage with over 130,000 borrower accounts monthly. To support this growth and further enhance their platform, ClearGrid plans to double its engineering team in the next fiscal quarter. Al Zaben envisions building the “definitive credit orchestration infrastructure for the region.” ClearGrid’s impressive investor roster includes prominent MENA-focused VCs like Beco Capital, Nuwa Capital, and Raed Ventures, alongside notable angel investors from Silicon Valley and beyond. This blend of regional expertise and global vision positions ClearGrid for significant impact in the Debt Collection MENA landscape. ClearGrid is not just about recovering debt; it’s about reimagining the entire process. By harnessing the power of AI , they are building a future where debt resolution is more efficient, ethical, and ultimately, more human.

The $2000 level is crucial in determining whether ETH continues its upward trajectory or faces a pullback. If this support holds, buyers may gain momentum to push the price higher. However, failure to maintain this level could trigger a deeper retracement. Key Support and Resistance Levels Support Levels: $2000, $1950, $1800 Resistance Levels: $2150, $2225 Bullish Outlook: Targeting $2225 and Beyond If Ethereum (ETH) remains above the $2000 support, bullish momentum may build, driving the price toward $2150, a critical resistance point. A decisive break above $2150 could spark a further rally, sending ETH toward the $2225 resistance level. At $2225, some traders may take profits, leading to a temporary pullback. However, if buyers sustain their pressure, Ethereum (ETH) could maintain its bullish momentum, setting the stage for a long-term uptrend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Outlook: Potential Drop to $1800 If ETH fails to hold $2000, increased selling pressure could drive it back to the $1950 support zone. A break below this level may result in further downside movement, with ETH potentially sliding to $1800, a crucial support area. Should bearish momentum persist, Ethereum (ETH) could experience a more extended decline, testing even lower levels before stabilizing. However, Ethereum’s (ETH) next move largely depends on how it reacts to the $2000 support level. A strong rebound from this zone could fuel a rally toward $2150 and $2225, while a breakdown might trigger a decline to $1800. Traders should monitor these levels closely as ETH prepares for its next significant move. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a note, Kendrick said he analyzed the crypto exchange's quarterly filings, which show it holds ether ( ETH ) under different categories, including investment and operational purposes. He estimates that about 80% of revenue generated by Base, Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, is profit. Notably, the timing of the company's trades aligns with price movements, he said. Coinbase net bought in the third quarter, when ETH was trading at around $2,500, and net sold in the fourth, when the second-largest cryptocurrency reached $4,000. It's now about $2,000. “The fact that they net bought in Q3 (when prices were low on average) and net sold in Q4 (higher average prices) tells me Coinbase acts like any risk-adjusting profit maximiser would do,” Kendrick wrote. Coinbase said it sold some ether to fund operations, without saying how much was involved. ""Base earns ETH from sequencer fees, and the ETH we earn is primarily held for long term investment or used for operational expenses, including tax liabilities and reinvesting in growth via things like salaries, grants, acquisitions, and public goods funding,"" a spokesperson said in an email. According to Kendrick's calculations, over the past three quarters, net ETH sales totaled 1,558, implying a pattern of strategic selling rather than accumulation. He reached his conclusion by subtracting Base’s profits in ETH from changes in Coinbase’s ETH holdings. The spokesperson reiterated that the company doesn't generally take part in trading activities. “As shared in our 10K : 'Crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term ... we do not engage in regular trading of these assets but may lend them through Prime Financing or stake them.' Our ETH held for investment grew 20% over the course of 2024,"" the spokesperson said. This isn't the first time Coinbase has had to respond to suggestions it is selling the ether generated by Base. Last month a member of Base rejected speculation surrounding potential ETH sales saying the exchange had “accumulated $300M+ in ETH, which is more than 2x all of Base's ETH earnings over time.”",Finance|Coinbase|Ethereum|Base,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-20 09:20:51

According to a recent notice , the crypto exchange platform has introduced a second tier to its EUR markets in Binance’s Fiat Liquidity Provider Program. The EUR market will have two trading tiers instead of one starting from March 24, 2025 at 00:00 UTC. The first tier will require Binance users to meet a weekly maker volume percentage of 0.5%. Meanwhile, the second tier will require users to meet a maker volume of 1%. The maker volume percentage is the percentage of a user’s weekly trading volume of maker orders in a specific fiat market compared to the total maker trading volume in that market across the platform. This metric determines eligibility for various tiers within the program, each offering different fee rebates. Based on the notice, liquidity providers will be reviewed on a weekly basis in accordance with the new program mechanism.

EUR tier 1 users will receive a maker fee rebate of -0.005%, while EUR tier 2 users will be subjected to a maker fee rebate of -0.010%. Similar to the liquidity providers, maker fee rebates will be updated weekly, starting from April 1, 2025 at 00:00 UTC. Maker fee rebates will be distributed to liquidity providers based on spot trading performance during the previous week across the selected fiat markets. With the new update, the EUR markets becomes the sixth fiat currency to receive a second trading tier. The other fiat markets with two tiers include BRL, ARS, MXN, COP, and JPY.

Murad is a well-known figure in the crypto space, and he always seems to be picking memecoins that people want to trade and invest in. Of late, he’s been picking memecoins that are based on the Solana blockchain. However, even in the world of memecoins, where unpredictability is a given, it has been a tough time lately for Murad’s picks, as they have experienced significant value declines. The Declining Price of Murad’s Memecoin Picks Murad’s Solana memecoin list hasn’t escaped the recent market downturn. Data shows the tokens he has pushed have dropped considerably, with price declines from a steep -84.3% to a staggering -97.7%. This kind of drop isn’t atypical for memecoins, which often take the elevator down when speculative traders lose interest and market conditions turn against them. These assets tend to ascend quickly, based on too much hype and probably too much community enthusiasm, and when the community traders are done trading, they tend to plummet. Murad’s Solana memecoin picks and how they’re fairing in Today's market Twitter: @MustStopMurad Insights and observation: All the memecoins in Murad's list are all down from their all time high,with drops ranging from -84.3% to -97.7%. Some memecoins like $WIF #FARTCOIN and… pic.twitter.com/ASpYJlY8ep — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 19, 2025 For instance, tokens like $WIF, #FARTCOIN, and POPCAT, despite being down substantially from their all-time highs, have somehow managed to keep relatively lofty market caps. Even with the drastic price drops these memecoins have taken, they still seem to exhibit a certain resiliency, which is likely due to very large and active user bases. Many of Murad’s picks seem to still enjoy the strength of community backing that enables them to keep token prices somewhat afloat, even while the broader market seems to be in freefall. Community Support Remains Strong The current state of these Solana-based memecoins underlines a key aspect: the strength of their communities. Even with significant decreases in worth, some tokens like $WIF, #FARTCOIN, and POPCAT still count the highest number of holders. One of the most critical factors that keep a memecoin relevant over time is a strong, active community. Many of these holders appear to be in the projects for the long haul, driven either by hope of future returns or simply by undying loyalty. It is notable that the number of holders does not always relate directly to active buying behavior. Some tokens have a larger base of holders, yet these investors are not making additional purchases. They are holding their positions, and with the possible hope that the market will recover or that new developments will make prices rise, they seem to be content. This not-so-active cadre of investors has led to a situation where far more token holders exist than there are token buyers. And, despite the number of holders being high, any semblance of price action in either the up or down direction seems to be destined to remain just that—merely a semblance. This concern is especially clear among people who entered these markets at the height of the hype. For instance, earlier buyers who bought at all-time highs are now nursing serious losses, which has definitely cooled the enthusiasm for new purchases. Many of these holders, though, are still part of the community but are entirely off the sidelines and waiting for a possible rebound. Healthier enthusiasm might eclipse the existing enthusiasm for downturns and might also eclipse the existing enthusiasm among any buyers who are still in the community. Long-Term Viability: Can These Memecoins Recover? Even in these trying times, there remains a slight possibility that Murad’s Solana memecoins could be successful—at least more successful than almost all other crypto assets this year. Why? Because tokens like $SPX, $GIGA, and $WIF have what are called strong holder bases. That is, these tokens have a core group of highly committed and engaged holders who believe in their potential and seem quite willing to be holders over the long term. Yet, for such memecoins to recover in any significant way, it isn’t enough that they have dedicated holders; they also need fresh attention and new buyers to ignite the next surge of price upticks. To attract this next wave, the projects behind these tokens have a multitude of pathways they could go down. They could roll out new features or service upgrades that are so good existing investors can’t help but get excited again. They could form partnerships that are so compelling they get new buyers in the door. They could become so good at community engagement you can’t turn around without bumping into an event they’re holding or sponsoring. Conclusion Picks from Murad’s Solana-based memecoin collection have clearly suffered in the current market, with the extent of their decline from all-time highs running the gamut from severe to catastrophic. That said, they’re still holding a decent amount of community and token holders, which gives each of them a real chance at base-building on the way to maybe something better in the future. Even the tokens that are clearly holding their communities hostage—hello, Mad!—could see some serious reassessment of their prospects if the crypto market works its way toward a recovery. Until then, the entirety of Udemy’s crew of Solana-based memecoins looks to be on a long hold. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This token has been officially listed for spot trading on HTX Global, a significant cryptocurrency exchange. With a market cap that had only been lingering at $2 million, the $SZN situation has reignited fresh interest in meme coins, especially those within the Tron ecosystem. As Tron-based meme coins go, could $SZN be the best we have seen in a while? $SZN’s Meteoric Rise and HTX Listing The recent listing of $SZN on HTX Global has without question been a catalyst for its explosive growth. In a matter of mere weeks, the coin has rocketed in value, gaining no less than 300% in market capitalization. Consequently, the token’s valuation has surged from a lovely, quiet $2 million to a breathtaking and almost mind-blowing $11 million. This attention has served as a vehicle to meme-stardom for an otherwise unknown coin that has one foot in the Tron ecosystem and seems to be gaining traction as some kind of Doxxed token. $SZN Surges Over 300% to $11M After HTX Listing – Tron Meme Season Incoming? After dipping to $2M, $SZN has made a massive comeback, soaring over 300% to $11M. @HTX_Global has officially listed SZN for spot trading. @justinsuntron confirmed that HTX is heavily… https://t.co/dTfe4YT1NN — Followin (@followin_io) March 19, 2025 The CT community seems divided regarding the spectacular growth of $SZN. On one hand, the project seems to be going supernova as meme coins continue their bull run. But on the other hand, this meteoric rise does seem to be lacking a certain amount of fundamental backing. The rise of $SZN has also been exciting, and that excitement has been amplified by strategic moves made by HTX. Not content with simply listing $SZN for spot trading, the exchange has also amped up its support for the Tron network. HTX’s commitment to backing Tron meme tokens, as articulated by Tron founder Justin Sun, isn’t really quite so simple, though, because, in essence, it’s about backing $SZN even more. And with every Tron token that HTX issues, the buzz around $SZN intensifies. A Major Push for Tron Memes Justin Sun, a key player in the virtual currency realm and the brains behind Tron, has long been a proponent of the belief that memes hold an inordinate amount of power in the crypto industry. As in recent months, when virtual currency discussions seem often to center on meme coins, Sun’s also advocating for what might be considered a Tron-based version of a meme coin, since $SZN is a Tron-based token. Sun recently hinted at the impending “Tron Meme Season,” suggesting that even bigger moves are on the horizon. He stated, “The two biggest exchanges in the world are about to have a TRX szn soon!” This has sent seekers of Shen Yun listing and partnership narratives into a tizzy. With exchanges and platforms increasingly interested in meme coins, $SZN and other Tron-based tokens would appear to be ripe for growth. With meme coins demanding ever more attention, many now see the support of heavyweight exchanges such as HTX and the backing of high-profile personalities such as Sun as the ideal scenario for the growth of the Tron meme wave. Investors and traders appear ready to boost what could be an exhilarating new chapter for the meme coin space—one where tokens based on the Tron network are seemingly front and center. Is the Tron Meme Wave Just Getting Started? $SZN’s recent surge in interest has in turn reignited the interest in the Tron ecosystem, especially in the realm of meme coins. As the token’s value not only continues to rise but seems to be on a downright skyward-bound trajectory, and as more exchanges seem to be getting in on the fun, the question of whether this is just the beginning has a tendency to come up. And if what Sun says is any indication, we might just be on the edge of a Tron-driven trend in the crypto space. Succeeding tokens such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have secured massive community support, significant market caps, and, most importantly, the very essence of meme culture: humor. Tron could serve as the next platform for the next wave of making humor into currency, with its low fees and vastly better scalability than Ethereum. And if the seeming popularity of $SZN (the latest meme token to be launched on Tron) is any indicator, meme coins may just be an underappreciated aspect of Tron’s ecosystem. At present, traders and investors are keeping a keen eye on the Tron ecosystem, particularly the recent developments, since more exchanges are now looking to support not only $SZN but also several other meme tokens. Justin Sun’s continued strategic acumen—not to mention the support of platforms like HTX—clearly has the Tron fanbase and the broader crypto community riding high on yet another potential wave of meme token success. Whether this is the precursor to something much bigger remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: the price of $SZN seems likely to continue on its impressive upward trend for at least the next little while.

As the $SOL market continues to form, dissecting its supply distribution and identifying the main price level concentrations can yield some insightful potential support and resistance zone nuggets. The very latest from the Solana analyst team involves taking a look at the Unspent Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart and seeing what it is telling us about the main supply level and key price action concentration developments. Key Support Levels for $SOL: The Case for $112.10 and Below When evaluating Solana’s all-time high (ATH) reached on January 19, 2023, and looking at the supply that was in distribution at the time, there are key levels of support and resistance that investors should be aware of. One standout price point is $112.10, where there were approximately 9.7 million $SOL (about 1.67% of total supply) at that level. When Solana was at its ATH, this price level was holding up with around 4 million $SOL, which means that the level likely has some concentration of long-term supply held by investor types that want to hold $SOL for the foreseeable future. Since the ATH, this level has seen an increase in $SOL held, meaning that if these long-term holder types still have the same outlook on $SOL, then $112.10 is very likely a level that they will defend as long as the cryptocurrency remains under the control of bulls. Should $SOL come close to this level once more, long-term holders may step in to prevent any further price declines. This might allow for the price to just stabilize and not continue to drop. So, watch for any price action that approaches this level. #Solana 's URPD chart highlights key price levels where $SOL supply has concentrated, offering insight into potential support and resistance levels. Let's examine how supply distribution has changed since January 19, when #SOL reached its ATH. pic.twitter.com/F0r2Z15v7G — glassnode (@glassnode) March 19, 2025 Nonetheless, should $SOL not maintain above $112.10, it runs the risk of facing even further downward price movement. Looking at the below-$112.10 supply distribution, there is another vital support zone between $94 and $100 that has accumulating supply. This range is based on the fact that almost 21 million $SOL, which is about 3.5 percent of the total $SOL supply, lays claim to this zone. However, the selling pressure that might come from this layer of supply could create a problem for $SOL because it is using this supply to try to hold itself up. If that selling pressure does come, then $SOL could wind up pricing itself down into the above-mentioned air pocket. Accumulation and Resistance Levels: Eyes on $123, $126, $135, and $144 The recent price action has indicated that higher price points are more in demand than seems apparent. Accumulation at significant levels in recent price action suggests that the markets are inclined to act positively at these key price points (potentially even sooner rather than later). Accumulation around key price points: Accumulating supply at recent price points suggests demand is definitely starting to pick up at these levels. If we don’t plunge through these price points, the signals we are now receiving could indicate the overall market intent to price $SOL significantly higher than it’s recent run up when it was priced below $90. Yet, the most crucial price levels to keep an eye on are those where resistance has been forming. One such level is $135. An estimated $26.6 million worth of $SOL is concentrated there. That makes it a big price hurdle for $SOL to climb. If and when $SOL gets to $135, it’s pretty probable that those who bought in and have held might try to exit at this price level. More troubling is another price level: $144. This is where approximately 27 million $SOL is concentrated, totaling around 5% of the overall supply. Conclusion: Navigating the $SOL Market with URPD Insights Solana’s recently analyzed URPD chart offers excellent information about the concentration of supply for $SOL. It gives us insight into where key potential support and resistance levels lie. The $112.10 level appears to be a very strong support zone for long-term holders of $SOL, while the region between $94 and $56 is risky due to an apparent lack of significant supply. On the upside, we have four levels that look like key resistance zones: $123, $126, $135, and especially $144. These are the four levels that $SOL needs to get above in order to change the overall trend from bearish to bullish. It is vital for traders and investors to comprehend these key levels if they are to navigate the current market conditions. Two questions are particularly pressing: 1. Will Solana (SOL) find strong support in these price areas, or conversely, will it face a high wall of resistance as it tries to recover from its recent downtrend? 2. What will long-term holders and new market entrants do? Their actions—and those of Solana itself—will likely determine this token’s immediate price trajectory.

The project has been a magnet for investors looking to escape speculative meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE), uniting its structured lending model with mechanisms generating ongoing demand. With Phase 3 coming to a close soon and Phase 4 set to increase prices to $0.025, early participants are looking at 25% profit before launch — and a potential 200% increase once listings go live at $0.06. Now, post-launch targets in the region of $3.50 from 2025 onwards are being speculated by analysts, doubling the interest surrounding a token that combines utility with aggressive growth incentives. The Momentum Of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going against the grain of the volatility which currently reigns over the crypto market, attracting whales via a lending ecosystem rooted in world financial utility. Whereas tokens dependent on hype, for example, MUTM chips away at decentralized borrowing and lending so you can store resources, for example, ETH or stablecoins, just as benefit in credits mtTokenswhich are alternative resources that proceeds to appreciate. MUTM Buyback Model This model consistently generates platform revenue, which is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating repeat buy pressure. Already more than 6,200 investors are in the ongoing presale, which trades tokens at $0.02 before Phase 4 activates a price increase. Demand is being further galvanised by the project’s tokenomics. Phase 3 early buyers could see returns of 200% at the $0.06 listing price, with post-launch projections suggesting a climb to $3.50 as adoption increases. These numbers are in sharp contrast to meme coins’ dependence on social trends, as whale investors are confirmed thing towards MUTM’s available growth trajectory. Developers are completing a smart contract audit with Certik, which should instill confidence in investors once finalized. News will come through on Mutuum Finance’s socials, although if the presale uptake stays this pace, then the time for action is short if Phase 3 is to end during your time to participate. Shiba Inu’s Speculative Constraints SHIB continues to be a household name among meme coins, but the community-driven approach behind the cryptocurrency as well as the inflationary supply of the token has led whales to avoid it. Where the 2021 rally of SHIB dazzled retail traders, its absence of intrinsic utility — no lending protocols, staking mechanisms, or revenue-sharing models — may combat its appeal to investors who see stability as a virtue. MUTM’s revenue-driven buybacks, which bypass the token throughout the process, avoids the price hiccups that tend to dampen SHIB’s price moves as it moves inversely with demand. Pepe’s Niche Appeal Pepe (PEPE) has found its footing as a cultural token, utilizing internet nostalgia to remain top of mind. Its ecosystem, however, does not provide a structure for preserving values over time. To make matters worse, it lacks mechanisms to incentivize holding, let alone generate platform revenue, leaving PEPE vulnerable to rapid sell-offs. In contrast, MUTM’s token redistribution to mtToken stakers discourages dumping, stabilizing price trajectories. A Strategic Window for Entry Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just riding a presale—it’s reshaping how DeFi projects can align investor incentives with real world utility. The current entry point of $0.02 is one of the last opportunities to lock in at a price that comes before Phase 4, which will raise the price up to $0.025, a 25% increase for Phase 3 participants. Following its launch, demand will be driven by the token’s buy-and-distribute model and mtToken integrations, with conservative targets placing MUTM at a pegged price of $0.06, and bullish predictions providing for a 17,400% rise all the way to $3.50. With Certik’s audit in its final stages, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has upgraded from a exciting presale to a valid DeFi competitor. For investors fatigued by meme coin volatility, MUTM is a bridge between the promise of decentralized finance and disciplined, sustainable growth. The timer is ticking, the remaining tokens of Phase 3 are scarce and the time for the maximum benefits is reducing.

The economic landscape is heating up as former U.S. President Donald Trump is once again making waves, this time by publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. His pronouncements come as he doubles down on his tariff policies, creating a potentially volatile mix for the global economy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and what it could mean for your investments. Why is Trump Pushing for an Interest Rate Cut? Trump’s recent remarks on his Truth Social platform are a clear indication of his desire to influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. He explicitly stated, “The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES,” just after the Fed decided to hold steady on rates. This public pressure is not new for Trump, who has consistently voiced his opinions on the Fed’s actions. His rationale likely stems from a belief that lower interest rates would stimulate economic growth, making his tariff policies less painful for the U.S. economy. But what exactly are the implications of such a move? Stimulating Economic Growth: Lower rates can make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, potentially boosting investment and spending. Offsetting Tariff Impact: Trump’s tariffs, while aimed at protecting domestic industries, can increase costs for businesses and consumers. Lower rates could be seen as a countermeasure to mitigate this economic drag. Political Leverage: Publicly pushing the Fed can also be a political strategy, allowing Trump to take credit if the economy performs well or blame the Fed if it falters. Tariff Policy: “Liberation Day” or Economic Risk? Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s “Liberation Day” comment, referring to April 2nd, signals his intent to move forward with new reciprocal tariffs. Despite earlier whispers of potential delays from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a White House official confirmed to Reuters that the tariff implementation is still on track. This aggressive stance on trade could have significant repercussions: Tariff Policy Aspect Potential Impact Reciprocal Tariffs Could lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, escalating trade tensions. Increased Import Costs Businesses may face higher costs for imported goods, potentially passing these costs onto consumers through price increases. Supply Chain Disruptions Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, making it harder for businesses to operate efficiently. The combination of tariff policy and pressure on the Fed creates a complex economic scenario. While tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they can also lead to inflation and harm overall economic growth, especially if met with retaliation from trading partners. How Could an Interest Rate Cut Impact the Market? An interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, especially if influenced by political pressure, could have wide-ranging effects on financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space: Stock Market Boost: Historically, rate cuts are often seen as positive for the stock market, as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make stocks more attractive compared to bonds. Dollar Weakening: Lower rates can weaken the U.S. dollar as it becomes less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. A weaker dollar can sometimes be correlated with increased interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Inflation Concerns: Aggressive rate cuts, particularly if combined with expansionary fiscal policies, could raise concerns about inflation. In an inflationary environment, assets like Bitcoin are sometimes viewed as a hedge against currency devaluation. Cryptocurrency Appeal: In a low-interest-rate environment, investors may seek higher returns in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, if the dollar weakens, crypto denominated in other currencies could become relatively more attractive. However, it’s crucial to remember that the market is a complex beast. The actual market impact of a rate cut will depend on numerous factors, including the magnitude of the cut, the Fed’s communication, and overall global economic conditions. Understanding Federal Reserve Rates and Independence The Federal Reserve (Fed) plays a crucial role in managing the U.S. economy through monetary policy. One of its primary tools is setting the federal funds rate, the target rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend to each other overnight. Changes to the Federal Reserve Rates influence borrowing costs throughout the economy. The Fed is designed to be independent of political influence to ensure its decisions are based on economic data and long-term stability, rather than short-term political gains. However, public pressure from political figures like Trump can create tension and raise questions about this independence. A central bank perceived as being swayed by political pressure might lose credibility, which could have negative consequences for market confidence. Navigating the Economic Policy Landscape Trump’s dual approach of pushing for rate cuts while implementing tariffs presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. For investors, especially those in the volatile cryptocurrency market, understanding these economic policy shifts is crucial. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on statements from both the Federal Reserve and the White House. Monitor economic data releases, particularly inflation figures and GDP growth. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. Risk Management: Be prepared for market volatility. Use risk management tools like stop-loss orders and position sizing to protect your capital. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective. Focus on the fundamental value of your investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Conclusion: A Wait-and-See Approach is Prudent The situation is fluid. Trump’s push for lower interest rates and his commitment to new tariffs introduce significant uncertainty into the economic outlook. Whether the Federal Reserve will yield to political pressure remains to be seen. The impact on markets, including cryptocurrencies, will depend on how these policies unfold and how the global economy responds. For now, a cautious and informed approach is advisable. Keep your finger on the pulse of economic news, understand the potential risks and rewards, and make strategic decisions to navigate these potentially turbulent times.

The stolen assets, consisting of 500,000 ETH, have largely been converted into 12,836 BTC and are now distributed across 9,117 wallets. Zhou, who posted a detailed breakdown of the hack on X, confirmed that 3.54% of the stolen funds have already been frozen, while 7.59% have disappeared into the dark web. The rest? Still within reach—but the hackers are doing everything they can to cover their tracks. The attack has pushed North Korea to third place among governments holding Bitcoin, with the country now controlling 13,562 BTC worth over $1.14 billion. The only governments holding more are the United States, with 198,109 BTC valued at $16.71 billion, and the United Kingdom, which has 61,245 BTC worth $5.17 billion. Bhutan and El Salvador have been pushed down the list, now holding 10,635 BTC and 6,117 BTC, respectively. The sudden increase in North Korea’s Bitcoin holdings came just days before Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), intensifying speculation about Pyongyang’s long-term crypto strategy. Hackers used mixers to hide stolen Bitcoin Zhou’s post revealed that 86.29% of the stolen assets—approximately $1.23 billion worth of ETH—were converted into Bitcoin and split across 9,117 wallets. The hackers began using mixers immediately, sending at least 193 BTC to Wasabi Mixer before dispersing the laundered funds through various peer-to-peer (P2P) vendors. “We believe this trend will grow as more funds will go through mixers,” Zhou wrote. He acknowledged that tracking mixed transactions has become the number one challenge, and called on bounty hunters to help decrypt them. Over the past 30 days, Bybit received 5,012 bounty reports, but only 63 were valid. Zhou made it clear—more bounty hunters are needed. Bybit ignored security risks before the attack In an interview , Zhou admitted that Bybit had warnings about security flaws months before the hack. He revealed that three to four months before the attack, the exchange noticed that Safe, the compromised software, was not fully compatible with Bybit’s security framework. “We should have upgraded and moved away from Safe,” Zhou said. “We’re definitely looking to do that now.” Rahul Rumalla, Safe’s chief product officer, responded by defending the company, saying new security features had already been introduced. “Our job is not just to fix what happened but to ensure the entire space learns from it so this doesn’t happen again,” Rumalla said. Bybit’s internal audit revealed that hackers had infiltrated Safe’s system long before the heist. A developer’s computer was compromised, allowing the attackers to plant malicious code and manipulate transactions. The final attack was executed through a fraudulent transaction request sent to Zhou himself, who unknowingly approved the transfer. The moment he signed off, the hackers drained $1.5 billion in crypto. The outflow was immediately visible on the blockchain, and crypto analysts quickly linked the theft to Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking syndicate. Zhou responded by rushing to Bybit’s Singapore office and triggering an emergency response known internally as P-1, waking the entire leadership team. Bybit users withdrew billions after the hack The market reacted fast. Zhou promised users on X that Bybit remained solvent, posting: “Even if this hack loss is not recovered, all clients’ assets are 1:1 backed. We can cover the loss.” That assurance didn’t stop the panic withdrawals. Within hours, users pulled nearly $10 billion from the platform. The entire crypto market took a hit. Other crypto companies moved in to stabilize the situation. Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, sent Bybit a 40,000 ETH loan (worth roughly $100 million)—without interest or collateral. “We never questioned their ability to pay us back,” Chen said. Between crisis meetings, Zhou kept updating users on X, even posting a health app screenshot that showed his stress levels were unusually low. “Too focused commanding all the meetings. Forgot to stress,” he wrote. “I think it will come soon when I start to really grasp the concept of losing $1.5B.” Meanwhile, Lazarus Group continued laundering the stolen funds. Using a money-laundering strategy seen in previous hacks, they spread the assets across countless wallets, funneling them through mixers and P2P networks. Despite Bybit and other exchanges freezing some funds, tracking the rest has become a race against time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Designed to rival the platform Pump.fun, recently revealed to be developing an Automated Market Maker (AMM) on its end, the new platform appears to be attempting something quite innovative. LaunchLab is described as a much “smarter” token launch, one in which, supposedly, pricing and demand are much more closely matched than in those on the two rival platforms. Pump.fun’s future in that regard is still uncertain. Meanwhile, with the news of LaunchLab’s unveiling, Raydium’s price increased over 23%.

This move comes less than a month after https://t.co/jRPyxAP8G3 revealed plans to develop… pic.twitter.com/Sd3hVf8emy — Followin (@followin_io) March 19, 2025 LaunchLab: A New Era for Token Launches Raydium’s LaunchLab seeks to provide greater flexibility and efficiency in launching tokens by using various forms of bonding curves. More specifically, the platform will make use of linear, exponential, and logarithmic bonding curves to align demand for tokens with their pricing. This is a fundamentally different approach from what most token launches have done in the past, when prices were mostly static and set ahead of time. These bonding curves, in theory, give the LaunchLab a foundational engine that can handle token launches of whatever size and scale. A key feature of LaunchLab is the ability for third-party UIs to set custom fees. This opens up the platform to a much wider range of developers and projects and allows them to customize their token launches to the very specific needs of their communities. Custom fees allow for a much greater level of control over distribution and incentive structures of the tokens that projects are launching, and that could be a game changer in terms of how projects build communities around their tokens and create much more sustainable token economies. At a crucial moment for the Solana ecosystem, Raydium has decided to introduce LaunchLab. As the Solana network sees an intensified focus on the suite of new meme tokens, LaunchLab gives developers—and, in turn, the entire Solana-based ecosystem—a platform that’s likely to make the act of creating and launching new tokens a much less painful experience than it has traditionally been. For those involved, that’s a meme-worthy improvisational jam right there. And what is the meme improvisational jam that the LaunchLab gives its audience? Why, it’s the act of creating more and more Solana-based meme tokens! $RAY Token Surges 23% The launch of LaunchLab has met with a market response that is nothing less than spectacular. The native token of Raydium, $RAY, jumped in value to the tune of more than 23% after the announcement, signifying a price point for the token that is much more alluring than just prior to the launch. This green candle for $RAY signals a likely burgeoning confidence among both community members and investors in the potential that LaunchLab has to provide long-durations (a.k.a. more than just a few days or weeks) value to the Solana ecosystem. RAY’s rising price is a testament to Raydium’s burgeoning influence in Solana’s network and its ability to draw interest from not just developers, but investors as well. With the platform now presenting a more efficient, more customizable solution for launching tokens, Raydium is placing itself front and center in Solana’s still-developing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Renewed optimism surrounds all things Solana, as evidenced by the recent surge in value of a key ecosystem token, $RAY. In the meme-coin space, where tokens like $DOGE and $SHIB have gained so much traction, LaunchLab could be a potential game changer. Its tools and infrastructure could underpin the growth—with a strong dose of stability—of such projects. So the success of $RAY, along with the excitement surrounding LaunchLab, very much is suggesting that Solana is poised for something like a fresh wave of innovation and development. Solana’s Meme Token War Heats Up LaunchLab is being launched at Solana meme token space that is seeing a surge in popularity Competition in the Solana meme token space is increasing, but so is popularity. Bitcoin and Ethereum have foundation fundamentals. Meme coins have no fundamentals. They rely on community support and viral trends. Yet these coins have gained traction and are moving the crypto market into new territory. Solana’s fast, low-cost blockchain has made it an ideal environment for these meme tokens to flourish. Furthermore, LaunchLab is fueling growth in the meme token market with its (meme-tacular) new features. The emergence of meme tokens on the Solana network has made the excitement of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem much more palpable, since many of these tokens are now competing for attention, and even virtual space, in the digital asset world. New platforms such as LaunchLab are making it even easier for usability-driven, community-focused projects to launch entirely on Solana; they recently helped launch solBRAIN, a project that combines memes, artificial intelligence, and some Monet-driven art to produce “the next generation of community interaction with our digital selves.” Huh? On the usability front, Raydium is doing some very interesting stuff. Launching LaunchLab and the rising fascination with meme coins have set the stage for Solana to become the hottest place for tokens to be created and developed. As we see new tokens popping up all the time, the token creation and development space is becoming even more competitive—meaning that it’s become way more important for platforms like Raydium to give developers the kind of help they need to succeed in an increasingly noisy marketplace. Conclusion Introducing LaunchLab is a really big step. It is a push forward as we progress along the path of token launches on Solana. LaunchLab brings forward new bonding curve models (which are dynamic). It presents the opportunity for third-party UIs to set custom fees. Overall, in comparison to the previous platform (Oxygen), LaunchLab is a way more flexible, way more dynamic, evolving way to conduct token launches. The immediate surge we saw yesterday (23% in $RAY price) indicates the market’s optimism overall. As the meme token competition intensifies on Solana, Raydium’s LaunchLab stands poised to supply next-generation meme tokens with the kind of tools and infrastructure they need to be successful. Demand is growing, and with it, the potential for Solana to stake a claim (pun intended) in the meme coin economy. If Raydium LaunchLab does what it says it will do, then future token launchers (including, almost certainly, future meme coin launchers) will have a way to do so in a more efficient and effective manner.

As institutional players seek the next big opportunity, the choice between Solana’s established network and Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge innovation is becoming a key debate. Will investors favor scalability, or will AI-driven blockchain solutions take the lead? Solana vs. Lightchain AI: Battle for investor attention ​ Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are two prominent blockchain platforms vying for investor attention, each offering unique value propositions. Solana is renowned for its high transaction speeds and scalability, achieving up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) through its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism. This efficiency has attracted a robust ecosystem encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and gaming applications. However, Solana has faced challenges, including network outages and concerns about centralization due to its validator requirements. ​ In contrast, Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence directly into its blockchain infrastructure. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for completing AI tasks, such as model training, enhancing both network security and AI development. The platform’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates seamless execution of AI-specific tasks within a decentralized framework. Currently in its presale phase at $0.007 per token, Lightchain AI offers early investors substantial growth potential. Its focus on merging AI with blockchain positions it as a versatile solution for industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance, addressing real-world challenges through advanced technology. While Solana’s established ecosystem and performance metrics provide a stable investment option, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and early-stage entry point present opportunities for exponential returns. Investors must weigh the proven capabilities of Solana against the disruptive potential of Lightchain AI, considering factors such as technological innovation, market adoption, and risk tolerance.

Safe and decentralized governance make Lightchain AI different from others. It follows the quadratic voting model and does not have any centralized elements. In the case of governance fatigue, Lightchain AI runs a process of voting by proxy, which actively maintains voters’ interests and agility in a controlled environment. Also, the project has in-built token economics for sustainability through inflation control and issuance of tokens with deflationary mechanisms such as burning and adaptive staking rewards. The platform’s workflow uses the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine to distribute AI tasks more efficiently and over a secure network. Lightchain AI’s governance and economic models place it among the e-AI solutions that are well-known by investors. Lightchain AI: Where AI and blockchain meet Institutional investors, take note that Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next big player in the blockchain space. By combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with decentralized governance, this project offers a unique and exciting way to diversify portfolios. Lightchain AI’s early-stage presale is a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game-changing project. As industries increasingly rely on AI and demand secure, scalable solutions, Lightchain AI’s smart vision makes it a clear frontrunner.

According to court documents made public on March 20, Andruinin has officially pleaded guilty to market manipulation and wire fraud charges and has agreed to forfeit the crypto assets tied to his alleged offenses as a part of a plea deal with the US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts If the deal is approved, he could face a reduced sentence of up to 24 months in prison instead of the potential 20-year sentence he initially risked. What is Gotbit? Andriunin founded Gotbit as a market-making firm that offered liquidity services to crypto projects. However, federal prosecutors claim it was essentially a market manipulation operation, running “wash trades” to artificially inflate trading volumes and mislead investors. According to court filings, between 2018 and 2024, Gotbit allegedly helped promote crypto projects, including US-based companies, by creating fake demand for their tokens. Prosecutors say the firm executed fake trades, manipulated token prices, and created misleading market trends to attract real investors. Essentially, it was a pay-to-play scheme where projects could buy visibility and credibility, even if the actual demand wasn’t there. In a separate complaint , the SEC claimed Gotbit kept detailed records of its manipulation, tracking “created volume” versus natural “market volume.” Andriunin himself seemed aware of the ethical gray area. In a 2019 interview, he admitted Gotbit’s business model was “not entirely ethical.” That admission was later referenced in Justice Department filings as further evidence of intentional wrongdoing. In October 2024, federal prosecutors charged Gotbit alongside ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade in the first-ever criminal case targeting crypto market manipulation. In total, 14 individuals and four companies were charged, with authorities seizing over $25 million in crypto. Andriunin will forfeit all assets Andriunin’s plea deal requires him to hand over $23 million in stablecoins from four wallets under his control. “Defendant agrees to promptly take all steps necessary to pass clear title to the above assets to the United States,” Lead B. Foley from the US Attorney’s office stated in court documents. These funds, stored in USDT and USDC, were technically tied to Gotbit Consulting LLC, but court documents confirm that Andriunin was the sole operator of these wallets. If the court approves the deal, Andriunin will serve up to 24 months in prison, far less than the decades he initially faced, alongside a fine of “$250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.” After his release, he will also be barred from participating in any crypto-related activities for three years under supervised release. The US crackdown on Gotbit is part of a broader effort to clean up crypto markets. As previously reported by Invezz , last year, the FBI launched its own cryptocurrency token, NexFundAI, as part of an undercover operation to expose market manipulators. Gotbit was directly implicated in this sting, working alongside Saitama, a Massachusetts-based crypto firm, in what prosecutors describe as a $7.5 billion pump-and-dump scheme. At the time, the DOJ alleged that Saitama collaborated with Gotbit to artificially inflate the value of its token while executives secretly sold off their holdings, making tens of millions in profits from the manipulated market.

The end of this lawsuit has caused positive sentiment towards XRP, with traders anticipating rising adoption from banks and pro-crypto financial institutions like MicroStrategy. If this development turns Michael Saylor’s attention away from Bitcoin to XRP, would the price rise to $100? XRP Price Prediction If Michael Saylor Buys Ripple Instead of BTC XRP price today trades at $2.47 with a 7% gain in 24 hours. As Coingape earlier reported, XRP can realistically hit $100 if US banks and institutions start buying Ripple after the lawsuit ends. The possibility of Saylor being one of the institutional buyers would make this target attainable within a few years. Earlier this month, Saylor discussed Ripple’s legal status in an interview with CNBC . He noted that XRP was a token that needed a clear regulatory framework to allow its issuance. Saylor also added that buying XRP was like supporting an investment because Ripple is a US-based company. MicroStrategy has bought nearly 500,000 BTC since it started buying in 2020. These coins were acquired for around $33 billion, suggesting that the company spends an average of $6.6 billion per year on buying Bitcoin. If Saylor changed his business model at MicroStrategy and started to use $6.6 billion every year to buy XRP, it could drive significant demand that could fuel an XRP price rally to $100. MicroStrategy’s XRP purchase could also draw the attention of other major institutions like BlackRock. Experts predict that BlackRock is preparing for an XRP ETF filing , which might also push the price towards $100. Analyst Forecasts Massive XRP Rally as Open Interest Soars XRP’s open interest has surged by more than $600 million in the last 24 hours according to data from Coinglass. This increase comes after bullish sentiment rose following the end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. Popular analyst Gert van Lagen has also identified a seven-year double-bottom pattern on Ripple’s two-week chart. In the analysis, he noted that XRP price has bounced from the neckline at $1.96, and is now ready for an over 1,400% rally towards $38. Lagen added that XRP completed a similar pattern in 2014 that pushed the price from around $0.003 to $0.40. If history rhymes, XRP could easily outperform the broader crypto market. XRP/USDT: 2-Week Chart Conclusion The end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit has stirred speculation about whether US-based financial institutions like MicroStrategy will begin buying XRP. If this happens, XRP price could easily rally past $100 and emerge as the biggest altcoin by market cap.

Gotbit founder and CEO Andriunin has agreed to forfeit about $23 million in Tether USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) in a plea deal with Massachusetts federal prosecutors, the legal news service Law360 reported on March 19. As part of the plea, Andriunin will plead guilty to three counts charging conspiracy to commit wire fraud and market manipulation, according to the letter signed by the defendant on March 19. An excerpt from letters in the Gotbix founder case related to the $23 million forfeiture as part of the plea with Massachusetts prosecutors: Law360 “Defendant understands and agrees that forfeiture shall not satisfy or affect any fine, lien, penalty, restitution, cost of imprisonment, tax liability or any other debt owed to the United States,” the letter reads. The agreement doesn’t bind the US Attorney General In the letter to the defendant, the US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Leah Foley, stressed that the agreement to forfeit $23 million is only between Andriunin and the attorney. “It does not bind the Attorney General of the United States or any other federal, state, or local prosecuting authorities,” the letter reads. The letter also states that the defendant understands that the court is not required to follow proposed sentencing calculations within the guidelines from the Massachusetts attorney. An excerpt from legal letters in the Gotbix founder case related to sentencing guidelines with Massachusetts prosecutors: Law360 “Defendant may not withdraw defendant’s guilty plea if defendant disagrees with how the court calculates the guidelines or with the sentence the court imposes,” attorney Foley wrote. Andriunin was extradited to the US in October 2025 Gotbit founder’s deal with Massachusetts prosecutors came months after Andriunin was extradited to the US in October 2024 after being arrested by Portuguese authorities. Since extradition, Andriunin has appeared in a federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was ordered to remain detained until further notice. Andriunin, 26, was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud in a superseding indictment in October 2024. Source: Alex Andriunin According to Massachusetts court documents, Gotbit was a crypto “market maker” that orchestrated a “widespread cryptocurrency market manipulation scheme.” The platform was registered in Belize and was said to provide artificial trading volume for global firms, including those in the US, between 2017 and 2024. Related: Telegram founder Pavel Durov given permission to leave France Apart from Andriunin, the criminal complaint from Massachusetts authorities in September 2024 also involved other Gotbit employees, such as marketing director Fedor Kedrov and sales director Qawi Jalili, both living in Russia. In the plea letter, Massachusetts attorney Foley mentioned that the assets listed in the forfeiture section of the Gotbit plea agreement are solely controlled by the defendant on Gotbit’s behalf despite these assets belonging to Gotbit.

Recently, a significant transaction involving World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project linked to the Trump family, has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike. Nearly 200 million WLFI tokens were transferred to an unknown address, prompting questions about the project’s intentions and future trajectory. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing crypto transaction and explore what it might signify for World Liberty Financial and the broader DeFi landscape. Decoding the Massive WLFI Token Transfer Data from Etherscan, a leading blockchain explorer, reveals that approximately 199.99 million WLFI tokens were moved from one address to another in a single transaction. This substantial amount, executed roughly five hours prior to reports, immediately raised eyebrows within the crypto community. According to Odaily, a prominent crypto news outlet, the most plausible explanation for this large-scale movement is a test of the token’s transfer functionality. But what does this mean, and why is it noteworthy? Let’s break down the key aspects of this WLFI token transfer : Scale of the Transaction: Moving nearly 200 million tokens is not a trivial matter. It indicates a significant internal operation within the World Liberty Financial ecosystem. Potential Test Scenario: The reported rationale of testing transfer functionality suggests a proactive approach to ensure the smooth operation of the WLFI token. This is crucial for any DeFi project aiming for scalability and reliability. Etherscan Visibility: The transaction’s visibility on Etherscan provides transparency and allows for public scrutiny, a hallmark of blockchain technology. Odaily Report: The reputable reporting from Odaily adds credibility to the interpretation of the transaction as a functional test. To better understand the context, consider this table summarizing the key transaction details: Metric Value Token WLFI (World Liberty Financial) Amount Transferred Approximately 199.99 million Reported Purpose Transfer Functionality Test Data Source Etherscan, Odaily Why Conduct a DeFi Token Test? Unveiling the Purpose For projects operating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, ensuring the robust functionality of their tokens is paramount. A DeFi token test , like the one potentially conducted by World Liberty Financial, serves several critical purposes: Functionality Verification: The primary goal is to confirm that the token can be transferred correctly and efficiently between different addresses. This is fundamental for user transactions, exchange listings, and overall platform usability. Smart Contract Audit: While not explicitly stated, such tests can indirectly validate the underlying smart contracts governing the token. Any issues during transfer could indicate potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract code. Scalability Assessment: Testing with large volumes of tokens, as seen in this case, can help assess the network’s capacity to handle significant transaction loads. This is crucial for future growth and adoption. Security Assurance: Identifying and resolving any transfer-related issues proactively enhances the security and reliability of the entire DeFi ecosystem built around the token. Preparation for Future Operations: Successful transfer tests pave the way for more complex operations, such as token distribution, staking mechanisms, or integration with other DeFi protocols. In essence, a token test is a crucial step in the lifecycle of a DeFi project, ensuring its operational readiness and building confidence among users and investors. The Trump Crypto Connection: Amplifying Scrutiny on the DeFi Project World Liberty Financial gains additional notoriety due to its association with the Trump family. This connection, whether direct or indirect, inevitably brings increased attention and scrutiny to the DeFi project . In the crypto world, where reputation and trust are vital, such affiliations can be a double-edged sword. Here’s how the Trump connection might influence perceptions: Heightened Visibility: The Trump name is globally recognized, instantly boosting the project’s visibility, especially in mainstream media and among politically engaged individuals. Polarizing Opinions: Depending on individual political views, the Trump association can either attract or repel potential users and investors. This polarization is a unique factor for WLFI compared to other DeFi projects. Increased Scrutiny: Projects linked to prominent public figures often face intense scrutiny from regulators, media watchdogs, and the public. Every action, including token transfers, is likely to be analyzed under a microscope. Marketing Advantage (Potentially): For certain segments of the population, the Trump connection might be seen as a positive endorsement, potentially attracting users who are supporters of the Trump family. Reputational Risk: Conversely, any negative publicity or controversy surrounding the Trump family could reflect negatively on World Liberty Financial and its token. Therefore, while the Trump connection provides a unique backdrop, World Liberty Financial must prioritize transparency, security, and functionality to succeed in the competitive DeFi landscape, regardless of its political associations. Navigating the DeFi Landscape: Potential and Challenges for WLFI World Liberty Financial, like any DeFi project , operates within a dynamic and evolving ecosystem. The potential for growth and innovation is immense, but it also faces significant challenges. Understanding both aspects is crucial for assessing the long-term prospects of WLFI and similar ventures. Potential Benefits: Decentralized Finance Access: DeFi aims to democratize financial services, offering alternatives to traditional banking and investment systems. WLFI could potentially provide access to these services to a broader audience. Innovation and Disruption: DeFi projects are at the forefront of financial innovation, exploring new models for lending, borrowing, trading, and asset management. WLFI could contribute to this innovation wave. Community-Driven Governance: Many DeFi projects embrace community governance, empowering token holders to participate in decision-making processes. This can foster a more inclusive and transparent ecosystem. Global Reach: Cryptocurrency and DeFi are inherently global, allowing projects like WLFI to reach users worldwide, bypassing geographical limitations of traditional finance. Potential for High Growth: The DeFi sector has demonstrated rapid growth, and successful projects can experience significant value appreciation and adoption. Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving globally. Unclear or unfavorable regulations could pose significant challenges to projects like WLFI. Security Vulnerabilities: DeFi platforms are susceptible to smart contract exploits and hacks. Security breaches can lead to substantial financial losses and reputational damage. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Token prices can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the value and stability of DeFi projects. Complexity and User Experience: DeFi can be complex for average users to understand and navigate. Improving user experience is crucial for wider adoption. Competition: The DeFi space is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous projects vying for users and market share. WLFI needs to differentiate itself to stand out. Conclusion: A Test with Potential Implications The crypto transaction involving nearly 200 million WLFI tokens serves as a reminder of the constant activity and developments within the cryptocurrency world. While officially reported as a transfer functionality test, such large-scale movements always spark curiosity and raise questions about the underlying strategy. For World Liberty Financial, navigating the intersection of DeFi innovation, political connections, and market dynamics will be crucial for its future success. The crypto community will be watching closely to see what the next move is for this intriguing project.

42038183,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=696635,1742463939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42038183.jpeg,Trump is driving Asia to diversify away from US,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-driving-asia-to-diversify-away-from-us/,"President Donald Trump’s economic policies and “America first” statements are changing Asia’s approach to trade and investment. Financiers and officials across the region are seeking to reduce their reliance on the United States in fear of a trade war. Since the end of World War II in 1945, the US has arguably been the most dominant country in global trade, supported by the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. According to some economists, Trump’s administration has disrupted that order with tariff policies , challenges to multilateral institutions, and a relationship with foreign countries that’s more transactional than not. Trump’s push to place the US’s needs first has left Asian markets looking for what some are calling an “America plus 1” strategy, diversifying away west-bound equities and the dollar. Asia is searching for alternatives Interviews with senior bankers, investors, and officials in Asia, cited by Reuters, suggest that discussions about reducing US dependence have grown significantly in recent months. However, Asian investors have yet to jump on any alternatives, and some believe that finding one is next to impossible. Ben Hung, President of International at Standard Chartered, coined the change in sentiment as a “once-in-100-year shift,” with the world becoming increasingly multipolar, led by the United States, China, and India. “ The post-World War II order has changed, ” Hung added. Citi reported a surge in inquiries from Asian clients trying to find some form of balance at a time when there’s heightened geopolitical uncertainty. The bank has seen double-digit growth in trade flows between Asia and emerging markets such as the Middle East and Latin America. Still, even with calls and prospects for more diversification, investments in the United States continue to rise. In a recent press briefing, White House spokesperson Kush Desai pointed to recent foreign investment commitments in the US as evidence that Trump’s economic policies are still lucrative in the eyes of foreign investors. Desai mentioned Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC and Dubai-based property developer DAMAC as examples of companies responding positively to Trump’s “America First” agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the prospect of the country’s energy expansion. China’s trade relations with the U.S. Communication between Beijing and Washington hasn’t reached the levels it was before Trump’s inauguration, and is now more “sporadic” and undefined. Official records show only a few high-profile talking sessions, including China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi’s meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in late January, and Vice Premier He Lifeng speaking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last month. Chinese officials undoubtedly want to understand what Trump wants before starting any trade negotiations. The Asian country could also have a list of priorities, including the removal of US tariffs, easing restrictions on Chinese investments and technology imports and exports, including Nvidia Chips, and assurances regarding Taiwan. For now, Beijing is responding to Trump’s tariffs with countermeasures designed to impose economic costs on the US. A Chinese official stated that China would “fight to the end” in a “tariff war, trade war, or any other war” with the United States. US markets resilient with no other opportunities in sight According to Standard Chartered’s survey, US assets are still attractive due to the strength of its economy, the depth of its capital markets, and the resilience of its institutions. For those looking to move away from the dollar, options are rather limited. The most feasible alternatives, gold, cryptocurrencies, and the Chinese yuan, come with drawbacks. Ben Hung noted that companies looking to transact in yuan face hurdles, particularly the need to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations. “ None of those three are perfect ,” he told Reuters. Yet, there is one available option; the Hong Kong Exchange’s Swap Connect , which allows investors to trade renminbi interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. Swap Connect’s daily turnover surged from 3 billion yuan when it launched in 2023 to 14.9 billion yuan last year. However, several banking executives said that hedging to manage yuan exposure is more marginal compared to dollar-denominated transactions. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Wednesday, Trump does not want to play a hand in any strengthening ties between China and Russia. Speaking to Fox News after a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said: “ As a student of history, which I am—I’ve watched it all—the first thing you learn is you don’t want Russia and China to get together. ” 🇨🇳🇺🇸🇷🇺 China and Russia want to get along with the United States. We are respected now,Trump declared. Trump always feels good about himself.🥱 pic.twitter.com/xKXvMFR8le — 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘦 (@OopsGuess) March 19, 2025 The US president told FOX that he has been in talks with China’s President Xi Jinping, adding that he would like America to be “friendly with both.” “ China needs us in terms of trade very badly, but we have to straighten out the deficit ,” Trump reckoned.

This acquisition isn’t just about adding another company to SoftBank’s portfolio; it’s a powerful statement about the future of AI Infrastructure and SoftBank’s unwavering commitment to leading the charge in the artificial intelligence revolution. Why Ampere? Unpacking the Strategic Semiconductor Acquisition Ampere Computing, founded by industry veteran Renee James, is not just another chip designer. They are pioneers in developing high-performance, energy-efficient ARM-based server chips. This is crucial because: ARM Architecture Advantage: Ampere leverages the ARM architecture, known for its power efficiency and scalability. This is increasingly important for the massive computational demands of modern AI and cloud computing. Focus on AI and Cloud: Ampere’s chips are specifically designed for cloud-native computing and, more recently, sustainable AI compute. Their customer base includes giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba, and Tencent – a testament to their technology’s relevance and performance. Synergy with Arm Holdings: SoftBank already holds a significant stake in Arm Holdings. Ampere’s ARM-based chips create a natural synergy, potentially leading to tighter integration and collaborative innovation within SoftBank’s ecosystem. The acquisition of Ampere isn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision. SoftBank has been eyeing Ampere for a while, considering a minority stake back in 2021. Now, they are going all-in, recognizing the pivotal role semiconductors play in the burgeoning AI landscape. The $6.5 Billion Question: What Does SoftBank Gain? Spending $6.5 billion in cash is no small feat, even for a tech giant like SoftBank. So, what exactly are they buying? Beyond just acquiring a company, SoftBank is strategically bolstering its position in several key areas: Benefit Description AI Infrastructure Dominance Ampere’s technology directly enhances SoftBank’s capabilities in providing the foundational compute power needed for advanced AI and superintelligence. Accelerated Growth Initiatives The acquisition is expected to expedite SoftBank’s growth in the rapidly expanding AI market, providing a crucial technological advantage. Expanded AI Ecosystem Ampere complements SoftBank’s existing AI investments, such as its partnership with OpenAI and the Stargate data center project, creating a more comprehensive and powerful AI ecosystem. Strategic Asset in US Market Ampere, based in Silicon Valley, provides SoftBank with a stronger foothold in the crucial US technology market and access to top-tier semiconductor engineering talent. Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., succinctly captured the vision: “The future of Artificial Super Intelligence requires breakthrough computing power. Ampere’s expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States.” Ampere and ARM: A Powerful Partnership Under SoftBank’s Wing The connection between Ampere and Arm Holdings is a critical element of this acquisition. Let’s break down why this partnership is so significant: Shared Architecture: Both Ampere and Arm operate within the ARM ecosystem. Ampere’s server chips are built on the ARM compute platform, creating inherent compatibility and potential for optimized performance when working with Arm technologies. SoftBank’s Leverage: As the largest shareholder of Arm Holdings, SoftBank can potentially leverage this position to foster closer collaboration between Arm and Ampere. This could lead to co-engineered solutions and enhanced performance optimizations specifically tailored for AI workloads. Market Positioning: This alignment positions SoftBank uniquely in the market, controlling key components of the AI infrastructure stack – from chip design (Ampere) to the underlying architecture (Arm). This strategic alignment is not just about internal synergies. It’s about creating a powerful force in the AI semiconductor market, capable of competing with established giants and driving innovation forward. Beyond the Chips: SoftBank’s Broader AI Ambitions The Ampere acquisition is just the latest piece in SoftBank’s ambitious AI puzzle. Consider these recent moves: OpenAI Partnership: Collaboration to develop “Cristal intelligence,” an Advanced Enterprise AI solution. Stargate Project: Investment in a massive data center project for OpenAI in the US, providing the physical infrastructure for AI development. Sharp Factory Purchase: Acquisition of a factory in Japan, potentially for expanding AI-related manufacturing or data center capacity. These actions collectively paint a picture of SoftBank’s comprehensive strategy: to not just invest in AI companies, but to build and control the entire AI infrastructure ecosystem, from chips to data centers to advanced AI models. The acquisition of Ampere is a foundational element in this grand design. What’s Next for Ampere and the Semiconductor Landscape? The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, and Ampere will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SoftBank. What can we expect in the future? Accelerated Innovation: With SoftBank’s backing and resources, Ampere is likely to accelerate its roadmap for high-performance ARM processors and AI-focused chips, potentially disrupting the market faster. Increased Competition: The strengthened Ampere, under SoftBank, will pose a greater competitive challenge to established semiconductor players, driving innovation and potentially lowering costs for AI compute. Ecosystem Expansion: We can anticipate further integration between Ampere, Arm, and other SoftBank portfolio companies, creating a more robust and interconnected AI technology ecosystem. Renee James, CEO of Ampere, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition, stating, “With a shared vision for advancing AI, we are excited to join SoftBank Group and partner with its portfolio of leading technology companies… This is a fantastic outcome for our team, and we are excited to drive forward our AmpereOne roadmap for high-performance Arm processors and AI.” Conclusion: A Future Powered by AI Semiconductors SoftBank’s $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic investment in the very foundation of the future AI landscape. By bringing Ampere into its fold, SoftBank is not just acquiring a company, but securing a crucial piece of the puzzle in its ambitious vision for AI dominance. As AI infrastructure becomes increasingly critical, moves like this will define the leaders and laggards in the tech revolution. The semiconductor industry is heating up, and SoftBank is betting big on a future powered by AI, with Ampere at the heart of its computing engine.

Solana Cost Basis Distribution Reveals Where Supply Is Most Concentrated In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) of Solana. The URPD is an indicator that basically tells us about how much of the SOL supply was purchased at which price levels. Naturally, the metric uses the last transaction price of any token in circulation as its cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Transfer Count Lowest Since 2023—Is This Bearish? First, here is how the URPD looked when the cryptocurrency set its new all-time high (ATH) back in January: From the graph, it’s apparent that a few price levels like $144 stood out in terms of the amount of supply that they hosted. At the price levels closer to the new ATH, however, supply was quite thin, meaning not many coins changed hands there. In on-chain analysis, the potential of any level to act as support or resistance is measured in terms of the amount of supply that it hosts. This means that levels that have a large cluster around them on the URPD are the ones of importance to the asset. As for why this is so, the answer lies in investor psychology: holders are sensitive to retests of their cost basis. Whenever the price touches a large cost basis cluster, the investors who are holding these coins may respond by making some panic moves. These moves can tend toward buying if the retest is happening from above, as investors may want to defend their profit-loss boundary. In retests happening from below, however, the traders could react by selling instead, as they may seek to exit at their break-even. When SOL reached its ATH, there was a lack of support nearby. This may be why the asset ended up falling into the cluster that did carry a significant amount of supply. Below is a chart that shows how the URPD has changed following the price drawdown. From the graph, it’s visible that if SOL continues its downtrend, it may have to end up relying on the freshly grown $112 level. In January, this level hosted the cost basis of 4 million tokens, but today, the figure has grown to 9.7 million, equivalent to 1.67% of the entire supply. Beyond this level, Glassnode notes, “$94, $97, and $100 collectively hold nearly 21M SOL (3.5% of supply).” In the scenario that these support levels fail, Solana may find itself in trouble, as there aren’t any major supply clusters until $53. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shark & Whale Population Rises—Price Turnaround Incoming? In terms of the levels above, the $135 and $144 levels stand out, as they hold the acquisition level of 26.6 million and 27 million coins, respectively. These levels could act as major obstacles in SOL’s recovery. SOL Price Solana has jumped more than 5% over the last 24 hours to recover to the $130 level.

Analyst Predicts Massive Rally in 90 Days,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bull-market-analyst-predicts/,"Get ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto world! A renowned crypto analyst is making waves with a bold prediction: a Bitcoin bull market could be just around the corner, possibly igniting within the next three months. Are you prepared for a potential surge in Bitcoin’s value? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting forecast and what it could mean for you. Why is a Bitcoin Bull Market Predicted Now? According to a recent report from Decrypt, Jamie Coutts, the chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, believes several key financial indicators are aligning to create the perfect storm for a Bitcoin bull market . Coutts points to historical patterns and recent economic adjustments as signals that should not be ignored. He suggests that these signals are eerily similar to those observed before previous major Bitcoin rallies. But what exactly are these signals? Historical Precedent: Coutts emphasizes that similar financial shifts in the past have consistently preceded significant upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. This historical context provides a compelling foundation for his current prediction. Global Liquidity Injections: A crucial factor highlighted by Coutts is the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) enhancing liquidity measures. Increased liquidity in major economies can often spill over into the crypto markets, providing fuel for asset appreciation. Market Underestimation: Coutts argues that the current market sentiment might be underestimating the speed and magnitude of a potential Bitcoin ascent. He believes Bitcoin could move much faster and higher than many anticipate. Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts’ Bitcoin Price Rally Forecast Jamie Coutts, a respected voice in the crypto analysis sphere, isn’t just making a vague prediction. He’s pinpointing a timeframe. His analysis suggests that this Bitcoin price rally could materialize within the next 90 days. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s based on a deep dive into market dynamics and historical trends. Coutts’ expertise at Real Vision, a platform known for in-depth financial analysis, lends credibility to his forecast. But what are the potential targets for this rally? Coutts suggests that if these conditions play out as anticipated, Bitcoin could potentially reach new all-time highs before the end of the second quarter. This is a significant statement, implying a potentially rapid and substantial increase in value. For investors, this kind of forecast is a siren call, signaling a potential window of opportunity. Factors Fueling the Potential Bitcoin Forecast Several factors are aligning to potentially fuel this bullish Bitcoin forecast . Let’s break down some of the key elements that Coutts and other analysts are watching: PBOC Liquidity Measures: As mentioned, the People’s Bank of China’s moves to inject liquidity into the financial system are seen as a major catalyst. This increased liquidity can find its way into various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Institutional Investment: While not explicitly mentioned in the original article, broader trends indicate continued institutional interest and investment in Bitcoin. Major players entering or increasing their positions can significantly impact market dynamics. Halving Cycle Narrative: Although the next Bitcoin halving is still some time away, the historical pattern of price appreciation following halving events is always in the background, influencing long-term bullish sentiment. Technical Indicators: Beyond fundamental analysis, technical analysts are likely observing chart patterns and indicators that may also suggest an impending bullish phase for Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin News and Market Concerns Despite the optimistic Bitcoin news and bullish predictions, it’s crucial to remain grounded and acknowledge the potential headwinds. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and external factors can quickly shift the landscape. Coutts himself acknowledges potential risks, including: Trump’s Tariff Policy: The article mentions concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Trade tensions and protectionist measures can introduce uncertainty and negatively impact global markets, including crypto. Recession Risk: Broader economic concerns, such as the risk of a recession, always loom in the background. Economic downturns can lead to risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting even assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains in flux globally. Unexpected regulatory changes can create significant market volatility. It’s important to remember that no prediction is guaranteed. The crypto market is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, and surprises are always possible. Therefore, while Coutts’ forecast is compelling, it should be considered as one perspective among many. Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Potential Bitcoin Bull Market So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate this potential Bitcoin bull market scenario: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on one analyst’s prediction. Conduct thorough research, explore different viewpoints, and understand the underlying factors driving market movements. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto portfolio and risk tolerance. Is your portfolio positioned to benefit from a potential bull market? Consider rebalancing if necessary. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market news, economic indicators, and regulatory developments. Being informed allows you to react quickly to changing conditions. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Implement risk management strategies such as diversification and stop-loss orders. Consider Gradual Accumulation: Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, consider a strategy of gradual accumulation (dollar-cost averaging) if you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Conclusion: Is Bitcoin on the Verge of a Meteoric Rise? Jamie Coutts’ prediction of a potential Bitcoin bull market within three months is certainly generating excitement and hope within the crypto community. Fueled by historical patterns and global liquidity injections, his analysis presents a compelling case for a significant Bitcoin price rally . While risks and uncertainties remain, the potential for substantial upside is undeniable. As always, informed decision-making, diligent research, and prudent risk management are paramount in the volatile world of cryptocurrency investment. Keep a close eye on market developments – the next 90 days could be transformative for Bitcoin.

What are Bitcoin Fundamentals and Why Do They Matter? When we talk about Bitcoin fundamentals , we’re essentially referring to the intrinsic properties that give Bitcoin its value and long-term potential. These aren’t just buzzwords; they are the foundational pillars upon which Bitcoin’s entire ecosystem is built. Think of it like the bedrock of a skyscraper – even if the upper floors sway in the wind (market volatility), the building remains structurally sound because of its strong base. Pierre Rochard, the Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms (RIOT), a prominent Bitcoin mining firm, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the current market jitters. He stated unequivocally that despite the market volatility , Bitcoin’s core fundamentals remain “stable.” But what exactly are these fundamentals he’s referring to, and why should they give investors confidence? Let’s break down the key Bitcoin fundamentals that Rochard and other proponents consistently highlight: Limited Supply: Perhaps the most crucial fundamental is Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is hardcoded into its protocol and cannot be changed. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s scarcity acts as a natural hedge against inflation. This limited supply makes each Bitcoin potentially more valuable over time as demand increases or remains constant. Censorship Resistance: Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized and permissionless. This means no single entity, be it a government or corporation, can control or censor transactions. This censorship resistance is a powerful feature, particularly in regions with unstable political or financial systems. It ensures that individuals have control over their wealth and can transact freely. Global Accessibility: Anyone with an internet connection can participate in the Bitcoin network. It transcends geographical boundaries and traditional banking systems. This global accessibility opens up financial inclusion to billions of people worldwide who are unbanked or underbanked. It allows for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions compared to traditional methods. These core tenets are not affected by short-term price fluctuations. They are inherent to Bitcoin’s design and continue to operate regardless of whether the price is up or down. This is the essence of Rochard’s reassuring message: focus on the bedrock, not the waves crashing against the shore. Navigating Cryptocurrency Market Volatility: Expert Insights The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. It’s a relatively young and evolving asset class, subject to a range of factors that can trigger rapid price swings. These factors can include: Regulatory News: Announcements regarding government regulations or policy changes can significantly impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Events: Global economic events, inflation rates, and interest rate decisions can influence investor behavior and risk appetite in the crypto market. Market Sentiment: Social media trends, news headlines, and overall investor psychology play a significant role in short-term price movements. Fear and greed can drive dramatic swings. Whale Activity: Large transactions by significant Bitcoin holders (whales) can sometimes trigger market fluctuations. It’s crucial to understand that these factors often contribute to temporary price volatility and don’t necessarily reflect a fundamental change in Bitcoin’s underlying technology or value proposition. Rochard’s statement serves as a reminder to zoom out from the daily price charts and consider the bigger picture. Think of it this way: imagine you’re investing in a tech company. The stock price might fluctuate based on quarterly earnings reports or industry news. However, if the company’s core technology is groundbreaking, its leadership is strong, and its long-term vision is sound, short-term price dips become less concerning. The same principle applies to BTC . Its underlying fundamentals are the “groundbreaking technology,” its decentralized nature is the “strong leadership” (or lack thereof, in a positive, decentralized sense), and its mission to be a censorship-resistant, global, digital currency is the “sound long-term vision.” BTC’s Limited Supply: A Cornerstone of its Fundamentals Let’s delve deeper into one of the most compelling fundamentals : Bitcoin’s limited supply. This scarcity is often compared to gold, a precious metal that has historically held value due to its finite nature. Just as there’s a limited amount of gold on Earth, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. This scarcity is programmed into Bitcoin’s code and enforced by its decentralized network. The process of “mining” new Bitcoin becomes increasingly difficult over time, and the rate at which new coins are released into circulation halves approximately every four years (a phenomenon known as “halving”). This predictable and decreasing supply issuance further reinforces Bitcoin’s scarcity. In a world where fiat currencies are prone to inflation due to increased money supply, Bitcoin’s limited supply offers a contrasting narrative. Many investors view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, a digital asset that can hold its purchasing power over time, particularly in inflationary environments. This scarcity is a fundamental aspect that distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional financial assets and contributes to its long-term investment thesis. Censorship Resistance and Global Accessibility: Key Benefits of Bitcoin Beyond scarcity, Bitcoin boasts other critical benefits that solidify its fundamental value proposition. Censorship resistance is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s design. Because the network is decentralized, no single authority can prevent transactions from being processed or control who can participate. This is a game-changer in regions where governments or financial institutions exert tight control over financial systems. Imagine individuals living under oppressive regimes or in countries with hyperinflation. Bitcoin offers them a potential escape route, a way to store and transact value outside the reach of centralized control. This censorship resistance is not just a technical feature; it’s a principle of financial freedom and empowerment. Coupled with censorship resistance is global accessibility . To participate in the traditional financial system, you often need a bank account, identification, and a physical address. Billions of people worldwide lack access to these basic requirements. Bitcoin, on the other hand, requires only an internet connection. Anyone, anywhere, can create a Bitcoin wallet and start transacting. This inclusivity has the potential to revolutionize financial access for underserved populations globally. These benefits – censorship resistance and global accessibility – are not fleeting trends; they are inherent characteristics of Bitcoin that address fundamental challenges in the traditional financial world. They are part of the reason why many believe Bitcoin has the potential to be a transformative technology in the long run. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Market While Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain robust, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and opportunities that exist within the Bitcoin market . The price volatility, while often unsettling, also presents opportunities for traders and investors. Those with a long-term perspective can view price dips as buying opportunities, accumulating Bitcoin at lower prices, believing in its long-term value proposition. However, the volatility also underscores the importance of risk management and due diligence. Investing in Bitcoin, like any asset, carries risks. It’s crucial to understand these risks, diversify your portfolio, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Looking ahead, the Bitcoin market is likely to continue to evolve. Increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements (like the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions) could further strengthen Bitcoin’s ecosystem and drive broader adoption. The journey of Bitcoin is far from over, and while volatility may be a constant companion, its core fundamentals provide a solid foundation for its future. Actionable Insights: Focus on Fundamentals: When market volatility strikes, shift your focus from short-term price charts to Bitcoin’s core fundamentals: limited supply, censorship resistance, and global accessibility. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term game. Consider your investment horizon and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price swings. Due Diligence: Educate yourself about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. Understand the risks and rewards before investing. Risk Management: Diversify your portfolio and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with developments in the cryptocurrency space, including regulatory news and technological advancements. Conclusion: Staying Grounded in Bitcoin’s Core Strength In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, it’s easy to get caught up in the daily price fluctuations and lose sight of the bigger picture. Pierre Rochard’s statement serves as a valuable reminder to stay grounded in Bitcoin’s core strength: its unshaken fundamentals. These fundamentals – limited supply, censorship resistance, and global accessibility – are not just talking points; they are the bedrock of Bitcoin’s value and long-term potential. While market volatility is likely to remain a feature of the cryptocurrency landscape, understanding and appreciating Bitcoin’s underlying principles can provide investors with the confidence to navigate the ups and downs and recognize the enduring value proposition of this groundbreaking digital asset. Don’t let the noise of short-term price action drown out the signal of Bitcoin’s fundamental strength.

Meanwhile, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently warned of a potential US recession, and argued that slowing economic activity may push policymakers toward pro-growth measures that could benefit digital assets. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, supports Bitcoin’s resilience in a downturn, due to its potential as a hedge against rising fiscal spending and economic uncertainty, though Coinbase analysts are still skeptical about the crypto market’s near-term prospects. Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin has Likely Bottomed Bitcoin’s ability to revisit the $77,000 price level seems increasingly unlikely, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. After the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement on March 19, Hayes suggested that quantitative tightening (QT) is “basically over,” which signals potential support for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Fed revealed plans to slow its securities sell-off by cutting the monthly Treasury cap from $25 billion to $5 billion starting in April , a move that could ease liquidity pressures in financial markets. On March 10, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $77,000, which was its lowest point since November. Hayes questioned whether that was the bottom, and ended up concluding that it was probable. He also pointed out that a bigger bullish catalyst will be a reinstatement of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption or a return to quantitative easing (QE). The SLR exemption, which was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowed banks to exclude US Treasury securities from leverage calculations, while QE is designed to stimulate economic growth through asset purchases. Bitcoin price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts agreed with Hayes’ view, and stated that QT is effectively dead. He stated that treasury volatility has calmed after a decline in the US dollar earlier this month, which is an indicator of improving liquidity conditions. Other market observers, like Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin , described the Fed’s policy shift as a positive development for both crypto and equities, and suggested that the central bank has room to ease financial conditions even more. Bitcoin venture capitalist Mark Moss predicted that “the dam is going to break” as QT comes to an end. Market sentiment already responded to the Fed’s stance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a key measure of investor sentiment, and it shifted to a “Neutral” rating of 49 after spending weeks in “Fear” territory since late February. Despite Bitcoin being nearly 22% below its January all-time high of $109,000, Infinex founder Kain Warwick sees this as a standard mid-bull market correction rather than a sign of broader weakness. Warwick is very confident in Bitcoin’s four-year cycle and expects prices to continue grinding higher for the remainder of the year. Cathie Wood Warns of Recession Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, believes that the White House is underestimating the risk of a recession in the United States, largely due to the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. At the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 18, Wood shared her concerns that the velocity of money is slowing down dramatically, which is a signal that economic activity is weakening. Cathie Wood at the Digital Asset Summit While US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the risk of a downturn, Wood has a different view, and suggested that a slowdown in capital movement could indicate declining GDP and ultimately push the government and Federal Reserve toward more pro-growth policies like tax cuts and monetary easing. Futures prices from CME Group show increasing confidence in multiple rate cuts during the second half of the year, reinforcing the idea that policymakers will move to support economic growth in response to weakening conditions. ARK Invest has maintained a long-term investment outlook, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector. The firm, in partnership with 21Shares, launched a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that was approved on Jan. 11 of 2024, and now holds more than $3.9 billion in net assets . Through a collaboration with Eaglebrook Advisors, ARK also offers crypto portfolio solutions to wealth managers. (Source: Farside Investors ) At the summit, Wood explained that long-term innovation is still the core of ARK’s investment philosophy despite recent market fluctuations. When asked about the viability of crypto as an investment, she pointed to the firm’s continued expansion beyond just Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which proves that the company is very confident in the broader blockchain ecosystem. The investment landscape for digital assets also benefited from improving regulatory conditions. Wood mentioned that pro-crypto policy shifts are giving institutions a lot more confidence to allocate capital to the space. She referenced ARK’s early research from 2016, which identified Bitcoin as the foundation of a new asset class, and observed that institutional investors, once skeptical, now recognize a fiduciary responsibility to provide clients with exposure to digital assets. Recession Could Boost Bitcoin BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, believes Bitcoin is poised to thrive in a recessionary macro environment, despite the skepticism from some analysts. In a March 19 interview with Yahoo Finance, Mitchnick explained that Bitcoin tends to benefit from increased fiscal spending, rising deficits, lower interest rates, and monetary stimulus, which are conditions that often accompany economic downturns. He also pointed out that fears of broader social disorder can act as a catalyst for Bitcoin, making it an attractive asset during uncertain times. While many still categorize Bitcoin as a risk-on asset that will suffer in a recession alongside equities and high-yield bonds, Mitchnick believes this classification is misguided. He thinks that the market has yet to fully grasp Bitcoin’s unique role in a changing financial landscape, seeing it as an opportunity for education in a still-nascent asset class. BlackRock has been working with clients to navigate these conflicting narratives , particularly as some of the firm’s long-term Bitcoin investors saw the recent market correction as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. On the other hand, not all analysts share BlackRock’s bullish stance. Researchers at Coinbase suggested that the optimism surrounding crypto in the first quarter was misplaced due to fears of a severe US economic slowdown. In its March 17 monthly outlook, Coinbase Institutional pointed to concerns over recession risks and recent tariff policies as major factors that have weighed on market sentiment. Despite near-term uncertainties, BlackRock remains a driving force behind institutional Bitcoin adoption. The firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds $48.7 billion in net assets, making it the largest Bitcoin investment product in existence. Mitchnick downplayed the recent net outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, and attributed them to hedge funds unwinding their spot-futures arbitrage trades rather than a shift in sentiment among long-term holders.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-20 10:11:24

But according to former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, this is just the beginning. He predicts the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on April 1, which could trigger a massive Bitcoin rally. Could BTC hit $90,000 next? Bitcoin’s Drop Is Over—Big Rally Ahead? Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin’s recent dip to $77k was the bottom. He points to April 1 as a turning point, when the Fed is expected to stop its policy of quantitative tightening (QT). If that happens, more money could flow into the market, pushing Bitcoin higher. He also suggests that the U.S. stock market might keep falling, forcing the Fed to step in with policies that could help Bitcoin. Hayes’ advice? “Stay nimble and cashed up” because big moves are coming! Additionally, Crypto and stock traders have been predicting that the Fed will slow down its tightening policy. The FOMC minutes confirmed this, revealing that the Fed will cut its monthly Treasury sales limit from $25 billion to $5 billion. Bitcoin Eying $90K Next After the FOMC meeting, Bitcoin didn’t waste any time reacting to the Fed meeting . It jumped 3.5% to $87,000 and is now testing key resistance levels. Meanwhile, crypto analyst IncomeSharks noted that if BTC closes above $86,351, it could break out and start a major rally. Bitcoin bounced at supertrend support. Pretty amazing to see it still holding a buy signal too. Now to see what $BTC does at OBV resistance and diagonal resistance. Would be a clear sign of strength to see a follow through here. pic.twitter.com/h11gRdDwSt — IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) March 19, 2025 Another key factor is the rising M2 money supply, which has a strong link to Bitcoin’s price. Experts say even a small 10% increase in liquidity could more than double Bitcoin’s price. If this trend continues, BTC could hit $90,000 or even higher in April! Experts Disagree With Hayes’s Prediction While Hayes is confident that QT will end by April 1, not everyone agrees. Analyst Benjamin Cowen argues that QT is still ongoing, with the Fed reducing its balance sheet by $35 billion per month. Still, if the Fed does lower rates as Hayes predicts, Bitcoin could be in for a massive surge.

While the price of Dogecoin rebounds off the crucial support level of $0.16, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has experienced a 400% growth in active addresses, which have now crossed 395k. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just rushed into its third presale round, with $4.1 million accumulated and 6,200 holders already in tow ahead of its exchange debut. With price is at $0.02 and Phase 3 filling rapidly, investors are rushing to secure their tokens before the next stage increases the price to $0.025 — a 25% increase for early participants. Mutuum Finance is Gaining Traction With Presale Momentum It’s not just the presale performance that makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) worthy of attention, however; with a lending model designed to create continued demand. The project’s well-thought-out tokenomics ensure short-term returns: tokens bought at the current $0.02 will jump to $0.06 when the project will be listed on an exchange — 200% profitability. Analysts predict even higher post-launch expectations, with even the most conservative estimate showing a target price of $3.50 for MUTM in the coming months, equating to a 17,400% ROI for Phase 3 purchasers. This logic comes from Mutuum Finance’s rare buy-and-distribute system that directs a share of platform income toward buying MUTM tokens back, a mechanism that exerts unyielding upward pressure on token value. Also the phased structure of the presale boosting urgency. Token price increases at each stage, rewarding early adopters disproportionately. As Phase 3 approaches its limit, investors will need to act quickly to secure lower entry points. Mutuum Finance also places a strong emphasis on security, and is currently undergoing a Smart Contract Audit by Certik. Afterward, the audits findings will be published on official channels, further promoting transparency and trust. Dogecoin’s Surge Faces Volatility Concerns The recent surge of Dogecoin, with 400% explosion in the number of active addresses, has led to a recreation of parabolic speculation. As per technical charts, DOGE is after breaking away from a falling wedge formation, and analysts such as Ali Martinez are suggesting that $6 could be a valid target should the token manage to maintain above the $0.14750 region. However, skepticism lingers. Dogecoin’s meme nature and heavy dependence on social sentiment stands in stark contrast to that of Mutuum Finance’s utility-based model. Sure, DOGE has already increased as much as 200% over a matter of days this week to $0.65 in the short term, but its long-term viability is still subject to the whims of the market rather than any real use cases. Actions Become Opportunities In A Changing Market While Dogecoin is trying to battle volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a more reasoned alternative. Unlike speculative tokens like DOGE, the project’s decentralized lending protocols and mtTokens (interest-accruing assets that represent money deposited) yield passive income streams. Early investors aren’t just buying tokens, they’re buying into an ecosystem designed for compounded growth. As the number of Ph 3 allocations diminish, the opportunity to acquire MUTM at just $0.02 is rapidly closing. Those who wait risk losing out on a launch price three times or more their current investment — and leaving on the table potential multiples beyond. Mutuum Finance’s team keeps adding to its credibility, emphasizing audits and openness. With the crypto market shifting toward projects with genuine utility, the MUTM’s combination of innovation and stability could make it a cornerstone of the coming bull run. The analyst’s prediction rests on this specific difference: Dogecoin draws ideas from nostalgia, while Mutuum Finance draws those from infrastructure. Act Now Before Phase 3 Ends Mutuum Finance’s third presale phase saw its tokens sell much quicker than in previous stages. Locking in MUTM at $0.02 ahead of Phase 4 will yield immediate profits once the project launches and early access to an innovative platform set to disrupt the future of DeFi. Whilst Dogecoin heads the news ticker, Mutuum Finance is building the framework for long-term profitability.

42041806,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141791,1742470204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Paycoin Move: Wallet Pay Suspension Signals Massive Store Coverage Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/paycoin-wallet-pay-store-expansion/,"In a significant move for the virtual asset payment landscape, Paycoin (PCI), a prominent crypto payment platform operated by South Korean blockchain innovator Danal Fintech, has announced a temporary suspension of its Wallet Pay service. This news, delivered via a recent Medium blog post, might initially raise eyebrows, but it signals a strategic pivot towards broader accessibility and enhanced user experience. Let’s delve into the details of this announcement and understand what it means for Paycoin users and the wider cryptocurrency community. What’s Happening with Paycoin Wallet Pay? The core announcement is straightforward: Paycoin will be temporarily suspending its Wallet Pay service starting March 21st at 15:00 UTC. For users accustomed to using Wallet Pay for their daily transactions, this might seem like a disruption. However, it’s crucial to understand the rationale behind this decision. This isn’t a step back, but rather a strategic pause to facilitate a significant leap forward. The suspension is temporary, paving the way for a more robust and widely accessible service in the near future. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key points: Temporary Suspension: Paycoin Wallet Pay will be suspended from March 21st, 15:00 UTC. Reason for Suspension: To facilitate expansion of store coverage and service enhancements. Future Plans: Re-launch in April with expanded support for major brand-affiliated stores. Operator: Paycoin (PCI) operated by Danal Fintech. Communication Channel: Announcement via Medium blog post. Think of it like renovating a popular store. To make the shopping experience even better and offer more products (in this case, more store options for using Paycoin), you need to temporarily close to restructure and upgrade. This is precisely what Paycoin is doing with its Wallet Pay service. Why Expand Store Coverage for Crypto Payment Platform? The decision to expand store coverage is a pivotal one for any crypto payment platform aiming for mainstream adoption. Currently, while Paycoin’s Wallet Pay is accepted at various locations, expanding its reach to include “additional major brand-affiliated stores” is a game-changer. But why is this expansion so critical? Increased Utility: More store coverage directly translates to increased utility for Paycoin holders. The more places users can spend their PCI cryptocurrency, the more valuable and practical it becomes in their daily lives. Enhanced User Experience: Imagine being able to use your Paycoin Wallet Pay at your favorite coffee shop, grocery store, or clothing retailer. Expanded coverage makes the payment process seamless and convenient, encouraging regular use. Driving Adoption: Wider acceptance is a key driver of cryptocurrency adoption. When people see they can actually use virtual asset payment options like Paycoin at places they already frequent, it demystifies crypto and makes it a tangible part of their financial routine. Competitive Edge: In the burgeoning crypto payment space, expanding store coverage is a competitive differentiator. It sets Paycoin apart by offering users a more practical and versatile payment solution compared to platforms with limited acceptance. Network Effects: As more stores join the Paycoin network, the platform becomes more attractive to both users and merchants, creating positive network effects that fuel further growth and adoption. Essentially, store coverage is the lifeline of a successful crypto payment platform . Without it, even the most technologically advanced platform remains limited in its real-world application. Paycoin’s focus on expansion demonstrates a clear understanding of this fundamental principle. The Benefits of Using Paycoin Wallet Pay for Virtual Asset Payment Even with the temporary suspension, it’s important to remember the core benefits that Paycoin Wallet Pay offers, and how this expansion will amplify them: Seamless Transactions: Wallet Pay aims to make crypto payments as smooth as traditional methods. Imagine paying with your smartphone in just a few taps using your PCI cryptocurrency. Lower Transaction Fees: Cryptocurrencies often boast lower transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems, which can be beneficial for both merchants and consumers. Faster Payments: Crypto transactions can be processed much faster than traditional bank transfers, especially for international transactions. Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology underpins Paycoin, offering enhanced security and transparency in transactions. Global Accessibility: While currently focused on South Korea and expanding store coverage there, the nature of cryptocurrency allows for potential global accessibility in the future. These benefits are not just theoretical; they translate to real advantages for users who embrace virtual asset payment methods like Paycoin. The expansion of store coverage will make these benefits even more accessible and impactful. Store Coverage Expansion: What Can We Expect in April? While the exact details of the “major brand-affiliated stores” joining the Paycoin Wallet Pay network are yet to be fully unveiled, the announcement hints at significant partnerships. We can anticipate collaborations with well-known and widely frequented retail chains. This could include: Major Retail Chains: Think department stores, electronics retailers, and large supermarkets. Food and Beverage Brands: Popular coffee chains, fast-food restaurants, and restaurant groups. Convenience Stores: Expanding into convenience store chains would drastically increase everyday usability. Entertainment and Leisure: Movie theaters, amusement parks, and other entertainment venues could be on the list. The inclusion of “brand-affiliated” stores suggests partnerships with established and reputable businesses, further legitimizing PCI cryptocurrency as a viable payment option. The April relaunch is eagerly anticipated, and Paycoin is likely to release more specific details closer to the date, generating excitement and anticipation within the crypto community and among potential new users. Navigating the Temporary Suspension of Paycoin Wallet Pay For existing Paycoin Wallet Pay users, the temporary suspension will require a slight adjustment. During this period, Wallet Pay will be unavailable for transactions. However, this is a short-term inconvenience for long-term gain. Here’s how users can navigate this period: Plan Ahead: Be aware of the suspension date (March 21st, 15:00 UTC) and make necessary adjustments to your payment methods for transactions during the suspension period. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Paycoin’s official channels (Medium blog, social media, etc.) for updates and announcements regarding the expansion and relaunch in April. Explore Other PCI Features: Paycoin likely offers other features beyond Wallet Pay. Explore these to maximize your use of the PCI cryptocurrency during the suspension. Anticipate the Relaunch: Look forward to April and the expanded store coverage. This temporary suspension is a positive step towards a more versatile and widely accepted Paycoin ecosystem. It’s crucial to view this suspension in the context of growth and improvement. Paycoin is not diminishing its service; it’s strategically enhancing it to provide a superior experience for its users and to solidify its position in the competitive virtual asset payment market. The Future Looks Bright for Paycoin and PCI Cryptocurrency Paycoin’s decision to temporarily suspend Wallet Pay to facilitate a significant expansion of store coverage is a bold and strategic move. It underscores the company’s commitment to making PCI cryptocurrency a practical and widely used payment method. By focusing on expanding accessibility and enhancing user experience, Paycoin is positioning itself for continued growth and success in the evolving landscape of digital finance. The temporary suspension, while causing minor short-term inconvenience, is a necessary step towards realizing the full potential of Paycoin Wallet Pay . The promise of expanded store coverage in April is exciting news for users and the broader crypto community. As we await the relaunch, it’s clear that Paycoin is focused on building a robust and user-friendly crypto payment platform that can truly bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday commerce. This strategic move by Paycoin demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, prioritizing long-term growth and user value over short-term continuity. The April relaunch and expanded store network will be a significant milestone for Paycoin and a testament to the growing adoption of cryptocurrency in everyday life.

Whale Accumulation Suggests A Rebound—Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/1-dogecoin-whale-accumulation-suggests-a-rebound-analyst/,"Crypto analysts predicted that Dogecoin could still reverse its current downward trend and propel itself to hit $1 per coin, a forecast that might increase investors’ optimism about the popular meme coin. Market experts said that Elon Musk’s favorite meme coin can bank on the increasing whale activity and a positive outlook from the Stochastic RSI analysis showing a potential upward price trajectory. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It’s Lift-Off Time Optimism On The DOGE Dogecoin might not have been spared by the bearish market condition affecting the broader cryptocurrency space but despite the memecoin’s facing several short-term challenges, crypto analysts remain confident in the future of the token and predict a possible increase in its value. Data showed that DOGE slightly moved upward with a 2% increase in the past week but suffered a 36% price decline in its price in the broader picture, raising concern among its investors. As of writing, Dogecoin is traded at $0.1678, down by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, reflecting the overall negative market sentiment. However, the memecoin is still dominating the market with 0.92% with a market capitalization of nearly $25 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of more than $816 million. The short-term declines and challenges that DOGE is facing right now cannot overshadow the token’s long-term growth potential. Whale Activity On The Rise Analysts said that one of the primary drivers of optimism on DOGE is its large investors which are registering positive activity that could fuel the growth of the memecoin in the upcoming months. Market observers revealed that whale activity has increased over the past week with over 110 million DOGE tokens acquired by large investors. These investors are betting that the meme token might be ripe for a possible breakout, highlighting the confidence of whales in the token’s long-term growth. It is also an indicator that whales are not looking at the coin’s short-term volatility but on its long-run prospects. #Dogecoin Stochastic RSI suggests $DOGE could stop its downtrend here and aim for the $1 mark 🔥$Doge pic.twitter.com/gkpayjUoTc — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 18, 2025 Can Dogecoin Hit $1?

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-is-about-to-explode-heres-why/,"Ash Crypto recently pointed out a notable decline in USDT dominance, signaling a potential breakout for Bitcoin . This shift suggests that investors are moving capital from stablecoins back into BTC, a pattern that has historically preceded bullish price action. What Is USDT Dominance and Why Does It Matter? USDT dominance refers to Tether’s share of the total cryptocurrency market. When this percentage rises, it often means traders are seeking safety in stablecoins, signaling fear or uncertainty. However, when USDT dominance falls, it indicates that investors are reallocating funds to riskier assets like Bitcoin, a classic sign of growing market confidence. Why Bitcoin Could Be on the Verge of a Rally The recent drop in USDT dominance suggests that more money is flowing into Bitcoin, increasing buying pressure and pushing prices higher. Historical trends show that when this shift occurs, BTC tends to surge in value . USDT DOMINANCE IS DROPPING. BITCOIN IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! pic.twitter.com/nB3j7jp2WU — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) March 20, 2025 A TradingView analysis supports this idea, showing that previous declines in USDT dominance were followed by Bitcoin price increases. Per a recent report, experts predict Bitcoin could reach $250,000 over the next year, citing similar accumulation patterns in past market cycles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for Bitcoin? If USDT dominance continues to fall, Bitcoin could be on the brink of a significant price movement. However, other factors, such as macroeconomic trends, ETF inflows, and regulatory developments, could also play a role. Ash Crypto’s observation of falling USDT dominance aligns with historical indicators of a Bitcoin rally. While no prediction is guaranteed, the market conditions suggest a strong possibility of BTC heading toward a bullish breakout.

The summit has hosted at least 150 speakers and 1,800 attendees. At least 750 institutions have participated in the event, which has conducted around 45 content sessions. Today, the third day of the session, is very crucial, as the summit will host one of its most prominent speakers, US President Donald Trump. Renowned journalist Eleanor Terrett , in an X post, reveals that Trump will send a recording to the DAS conference, dismissing rumours that the president will physically attend the event. Why Is Trump’s Address Crucial? Trump’s scheduled address at the summit is crucial for many reasons. Primarily, it is the first time a sitting US president is addressing the Digital Asset Summit. Secondly, it is doubtful whether the White House Crypto Summit , hosted last month, achieved the desired outcome. The New York summit will provide an opportunity for the Trump administration to explain its stance on the cryptocurrency industry and its pro-crypto policies, like the proposed establishment of a national strategic crypto reserve . Recently, while speaking at the summit, Bo Hines, the Executive Director of the White House’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, explained how Trump’s decision to create a strategic crypto reserve would benefit the people of America. Potential Crypto Market Impact of Trump’s Speech The US government’s attitude towards the crypto industry shifted in its favour when Trump emerged victorious in the US presidential election. The Trump administration has already introduced several policies to support the crypto industry. Trump’s speech at the summit could give more clarity about the government’s stance on the cryptocurrency industry. Providing clarity about the crypto policy is pertinent to encourage more institutional investors to enter the crypto market. Crypto’s Future & Market Growth The previous administration adopted an unfavourable approach towards the crypto industry. During the Biden regime, the US SEC launched legal actions against top crypto firms, including Ripple and Coinbase. The shift in the political approach has already benefited the cryptocurrency sector. It is evident from how the Bitcoin market has grown since November 5, 2024. The SEC has dropped some of its sensational legal battles against the industry – including the one against Coinbase . The pro-crypto policies adopted by the Trump administration are expected to support the crypto industry in growing further. Many crypto enthusiasts believe that this is the beginning of a new golden era for digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42042256,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141798,1742470808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Open Source AI Model Optimization Framework Unveiled by Pruna AI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/open-source-ai-model-optimization/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, efficiency is paramount. Just as optimized code enhances blockchain performance, optimized AI models are crucial for innovation. Pruna AI, a European startup, is now empowering developers to achieve peak AI performance with the open-sourcing of its powerful AI model optimization framework . This move promises to democratize advanced model compression techniques, making AI more accessible and efficient for everyone, from crypto projects integrating AI to individual developers. Why is Open Source AI Model Optimization a Game Changer? For years, the secrets to efficiently running complex AI models have largely been held within the walls of big tech companies. Developing and implementing model compression techniques like pruning, quantization, and distillation is a resource-intensive undertaking. Pruna AI is changing this landscape by releasing its comprehensive framework to the open-source community. But what exactly does this mean for developers and the future of AI? Imagine having a toolkit that streamlines the entire process of making AI models leaner and faster. That’s precisely what Pruna AI offers. Their framework isn’t just about applying individual AI model optimization methods; it’s about providing a standardized, easy-to-use platform that integrates multiple techniques seamlessly. Think of it as the ‘Hugging Face’ for AI efficiency, as Pruna AI CTO John Rachwan aptly describes it. Here’s a breakdown of the key benefits: Democratization of Advanced Techniques: Previously, sophisticated model compression methods were primarily accessible to large corporations with dedicated AI teams. Pruna AI’s framework levels the playing field, making these powerful tools available to startups, researchers, and individual developers. Simplified Workflow: The framework standardizes the process of saving, loading, and evaluating compressed models. This significantly reduces the complexity and time involved in AI model optimization . Combination of Methods: Unlike many open-source tools focusing on single compression methods, Pruna AI’s framework aggregates and simplifies the combination of various techniques like caching, pruning, quantization, and distillation. Performance Evaluation: A critical aspect is the framework’s ability to evaluate the trade-off between model size reduction and quality loss. Developers can confidently compress models knowing they can measure the impact on performance. Decoding Model Compression Techniques: Pruning, Quantization, and Distillation Let’s delve deeper into some of the core model compression techniques that Pruna AI’s framework empowers developers to use: Pruning: Think of pruning as trimming the unnecessary branches of a tree. In AI models, pruning involves removing less important connections or parameters, reducing the model’s size and computational load without significantly impacting accuracy. Quantization: Imagine representing colors with fewer shades. Quantization reduces the precision of numerical values in a model, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower bit representations (like 8-bit integers). This drastically reduces memory usage and speeds up computation. Distillation: This technique employs a “teacher-student” approach. A large, complex “teacher” model trains a smaller, simpler “student” model to mimic its behavior. Distillation allows for creating lightweight models that retain much of the performance of their larger counterparts. OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo and Black Forest Labs’ Flux.1-schnell are prime examples of models created using distillation. Caching: Caching, in the context of AI frameworks , is similar to how web browsers store frequently accessed data to speed up loading times. By caching intermediate computations or results, the framework avoids redundant calculations, significantly improving inference speed. Pruna AI Framework in Action: Real-World Applications While Pruna AI’s framework is versatile, supporting various model types, they are currently focusing on image and video generation models. Companies like Scenario and PhotoRoom are already leveraging Pruna AI’s technology, highlighting its practical value in real-world applications. The open-source release further expands the potential use cases. Imagine: Faster AI-powered crypto trading bots: Optimized models can lead to quicker decision-making in automated trading systems. Efficient on-device AI for blockchain applications: Smaller models can run directly on user devices, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on centralized servers. Streamlined AI integration in decentralized platforms: Open-source tools promote collaboration and faster innovation within the decentralized ecosystem. Looking Ahead: The Compression Agent and Enterprise Solutions Beyond the open-source framework, Pruna AI is developing an enterprise offering with advanced features, including a “compression agent.” This agent promises to be a game-changer for developers seeking effortless AI model optimization . “Basically, you give it your model, you say: ‘I want more speed but don’t drop my accuracy by more than 2%.’ And then, the agent will just do its magic,” explains Rachwan. This level of automation drastically simplifies the optimization process, making it accessible even to developers without specialized expertise in AI frameworks and model compression techniques. Pruna AI’s business model for the enterprise version is based on hourly usage, similar to cloud GPU rentals. This pay-as-you-go approach makes advanced AI model optimization economically viable for businesses of all sizes. The potential cost savings on inference costs, achieved through significantly smaller and faster models (like an 8x reduction in the size of a Llama model), can quickly offset the investment in Pruna AI’s services. The Future is Efficient: Embracing Open Source AI Optimization Pruna AI’s decision to open source its AI model optimization framework is a significant step forward for the AI community. By democratizing access to powerful compression techniques, they are empowering developers to build more efficient, accessible, and innovative AI applications. As AI continues to permeate various sectors, including the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the need for efficient models will only grow. Pruna AI is positioning itself at the forefront of this movement, fostering a future where powerful AI is not just for the tech giants but for everyone.

The former CEO of the market maker service faced up to 20 years for money laundering charges. Aleksey Andryunin, CEO and founder of the Gotbit market maker reached a settlement with US authorities. Andryunin avoided a 20-year sentence for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation, linked to Gotbit’s services as a market maker . Gotbit was accused of inflating volumes and creating unrealistic market valuations, which created risk for retail traders. One of the most affected tokens was Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), which later abandoned Gotbit after gaining more clarity on its wash trading practices. The Russian national struck a deal with Massachusetts federal prosecutors, in which he agreed to forfeit 23M in crypto assets in exchange for paying no additional fines or facing a prison sentence. The plea agreement was detailed in a letter , which urged Andryunin to plead guilty as fast as possible as part of the deal. For now, the sentencing has not been finalized, though the most probable outcome would be the forfeiture deal. Andryunin faced sentencing of up to $500,000 in fines, to reflect the losses caused by aggressive wash trading. He also faced prison time of between 5 to 20 years, depending on the final sentencing, unless the plea deal is finalized. Gotbit, which has existed since the 2017 bull market, was finally implicated in aggressive market-making services after the FBI launched a honeypot token . Several market markers were affected, but Gotbit was one of the most prominent cases. After the investigation, Andryunin was apprehended in Portugal and extradited to the USA for trial. The plea deal may mean Andryunin loses his right to stay in the country. US authorities return to crypto forfeiture The assets belonging to Gotbit have been stored in wallets controlled by Andryunin. The plea deal outlined the known addresses, which mostly contain stablecoins. After the forfeiture, the assets will be added to the crypto stockpile controlled by the US Government. Andryunin’s wallets contained over $9M in USDT in one address, $4M in USDC and two more wallets holding $4.9M and $4.7M in USDT. Andryunin’s assets would be forfeited and become the property of the US Government. | Source: Law360 Andryunin will have to cooperate in moving the ownership of those assets to the US government wallets. For now, it remains uncertain what the tokens would be used for. The addresses have not been frozen or blacklisted by either Tether or Circle, and the tokens are fully available. The US Government still holds over $17.4B in crypto assets, including 122M USDT from forfeitures. The assets have not been auctioned for years, and the growing portfolio has suggested the creation of a crypto reserve using the forfeited assets. Gotbit damaged the reputation of crypto projects Gotbit’s activity was hardly noticed during the previous bull markets, as traders were still inexperienced. The meme token boom, however, drew attention to the practices of wash trading, especially for new assets. On-chain investigator ZachXBT was among the first to track down assets connected to Gotbit. Those tokens were often facing pumps and crashes, causing deep losses for traders. Among assets linked to Gotbit were Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), as well as Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) and Baby Doge. NEIRO and its community were the first to react and save the token, returning to less liquid but organic trading. Without the involvement of Gotbit and the market hype, NEIRO returned to $0.0002, mostly relying on its loyal community. Gotbit’s move was to anticipate token launches and immediately perform a 10X growth pump, which served to attract the attention of traders. This also allowed insiders to sell a maximum amount of tokens at a higher price, leaving a wider community of holders with a depreciating asset. Gotbit’s actions were behind the success of the earlier wave of meme tokens, boosting memes that claimed their success was due to the community. Some of the traders even dismissed the effect of Gotbit as one of the natural features of token trading. Currently, market makers are still participating, though with less aggressive strategies. Wintermute remains one of the key market makers, with no claims of illicit activities or fake token pumps. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The initiatives, dubbed ""Uniswap Unleashed,"" introduced a new grants program and liquidity incentives while hinting at initial steps for a “fee switch,” a long-contested protocol vote that would pay out a portion of trading fees to holders of Uniswap’s UNI. Relevant governance posts have not directly mentioned a fee switch but noted plans to “activate revenue.” The foundation requested $95.4 million for its grants budget and $25.1 million for operations over two years, plus $45 million for liquidity incentives to attract users and fuel ecosystem growth through developer campaigns. Both proposals passed with more than 80% of UNI token holders in favor, governance data shows. The passage could now put into motion the fee-switch, a longtime community goal that would shift some protocol revenue — currently over $1 billion annually — from liquidity providers to UNI holders. Its activation, delayed by past failed votes, hinges on legal preparations by the foundation. The proposal was initially proposed in July 2021 to pilot the switch for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. The switch will not increase fees for users but will retain a small portion of what is currently paid out to liquidity providers (LP), or users who lock up their tokens on Uniswap in exchange for fee rewards. However, it could mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap’s LPs and more rewards for holders of Uniswap’s native token UNI, which accrues value for UNI holders — leaving the proposal hanging for the past few years. One such vote failed to pass in 2023 after being voted against by influential token holders. Part of the steps toward sharing revenue would be to make the Uniswap Foundation — a non-profit that helps develop and maintain Uniswap — a legal entity, giving it clarity on legal status and the ability to contract with other protocols. “If our vetting is successful and we believe the creation of a legal entity for Uniswap Governance is in its best interest, we would propose to Governance to implement a legal entity structure,” the proposal said. “If adopted, this step would pave the way for the potential introduction (or re-introduction) of a governance proposal for delegators to earn Protocol revenue,” it noted.",Markets|Uniswap|DAO,EN,0,0,UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-20 11:40:53

Designed to address some critical bottleneck issues on Solana, pNodes offer scalable, efficient storage for smart contracts on the network. Xandeum pNodes pNodes integrate directly with the programs on Solana to create a decentralized storage layer for data-heavy Web3 applications. As such, pNodes address Solana’s lack of a native, scalable storage mechanism by allowing smart contracts to access a distributed storage network. This unlocks new possibilities for blockchain developers , crypto traders, and potential investors looking to capitalize on the growing Web3 sector while potentially earning rewards. Developers of storage-intensive decentralized applications (dApps) will benefit the most, although crypto investors, adopters, and node operators looking to make some passive income can also look forward to new investment opportunities. Secure data storage Xandeum leverages erasure coding and configurable redundancy levels to ensure secure data storage across multiple pNodes. This ensures reliability and decentralization while giving Solana validators some room to breathe, as they traditionally have to store data and ensures blockchain-grade integrity. To accomplish their goals, Xandeum’s Validator Nodes manage and distribute storage tasks cryptographically, which helps retain data integrity intact without sacrificing speed. In addition, new Solana primitives (“peek” and “poke”) facilitate data transfers between Solana accounts and its decentralized file system abstraction. Xandeum’s “Deep South Era” Xandeum’s pNodes will mark the start of the platform’s Deep South Era, that is, the first innovation phase in 2025. The phase will also introduce XandMiner, a new management tool for registering pNodes, generating key pairs, and building (or destroying) file systems. A limited sale of 300 incentivized devnet pNodes will be introduced to mark the launch (max 3 per wallet). The mainnet version will be fully permissionless and open access to all participants.

In a new interview on Bloomberg Crypto, Cathie Wood says that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did an important thing in declaring that memecoins are not securities. “ What they essentially were saying is we are not going to regulate them and it’s buyer beware, so I have one message for those listening who are buying memecoins, buyer beware. I think the message is loud and clear from the regulators.” She says that many memecoins will eventually lose their value. “What we think will happen is there will be some fearsome declines in the prices of some of these meme assets and there’s nothing like losing money for people to learn. Now learn that the SEC and regulators are not taking responsibility for these memecoins.” Wood says that while the leading crypto assets are bound to become more valuable, this is not the case for the large majority of memecoins. “The millions of memecoins will probably end up worthless. When we’re talking about the big three – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, the use cases for those are multiplying and we think they’re going to become very important in the years ahead. Memecoins, not so.” Wood also shares her thoughts on whether President Donald Trump’s memecoin will also become worthless. “ Memecoins will be collector’s items – digital collector’s items. Of course, some will withstand the judgment of time and that may be one of them, but our working assumption is that when you’re talking about millions of memecoins, you know that that’s just a step too far and most of them are not going to be worth very much.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Focusing on international investments and economic growth, Pakistan is establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country is expanding its digital asset trading offerings, attracting global investors and reflecting the global crypto adoption. In a recent development, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed the country’s vision of solidifying its position at the forefront of the blockchain space. This development coincides with global powers, including the United States, striving to establish themselves as premier crypto hubs. Pakistan Legalizes Cryptocurrencies: What To Know According to recent reports, Pakistan is introducing a solid legal framework for cryptocurrencies, in an attempt to establish itself as a global leader in the blockchain space. With a vision of attracting international investors, Pakistan intends to expand its crypto trading offerings. Particularly, the country’s crypto initiative focuses on three key areas including Bitcoin mining, tokenization, and trading. Reflecting on the development, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib shared an X post . Saqib unveiled Pakistan’s efforts to foster crypto growth and adoption, positioning itself as a crypto leader. The Crypto Council CEO stated, We want Pakistan as the leader in blockchain-powered finance, and we want to attract international investment. Sixty percent of the population is under 30 [years old], we have a Web3-native workforce ready to build. Pakistan Joins Crypto Big Leagues Notably, blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis identified Pakistan as the ninth largest country in terms of crypto adoption. As pointed out by Saqib, Pakistan continues to be a developing crypto hub with nearly 20 million community members. During the last market rally, Pakistan reportedly witnessed $30 billion in remittances and $20 billion in crypto transactions. Experts believe that the country could thrive even more with clear crypto regulations, considering its potential for growth without them. Further, the Crypto Council CEO stated that the country’s tech-savvy citizens and budding fintech professionals contribute to Pakistan’s vision. This makes Pakistan well-positioned to compete with crypto leaders like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. This comes amid anticipations of US President Donald Trump addressing Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City on March 20. His speech is expected to focus on BTC adoption among institutions, regulatory developments, and the future of the crypto industry. Global Push for Crypto Growth and Adoption Significantly, global powers, including the United States, are establishing a crypto-friendly environment, recognizing the potential of the industry. For instance, the US is adopting a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President Donald Trump. In addition, President Trump is envisioning a regulatory overhaul that guarantees both crypto expansion and customer protection. Moreover, countries like Russia, Brazil, and Poland are also discussing to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Recently, North Korea’s increasing Bitcoin accumulation sparked speculations of the country’s possible BTC reserve plans. Thus, Pakistan’s crypto legalization has sparked widespread interest as the country aims to lift its years-long crypto restrictions. The development highlights the nation’s shifting stance on digital assets and its desire to tap into the growing crypto market.

Expert Sets Target at $10,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/can-dtx-exchange-win-against-solana-after-listing-announcement-expert-sets-target-at-10/,"The post Can DTX Exchange Win Against Solana After Listing Announcement? Expert Sets Target at $10 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News DTX Exchange has emerged as a disruptive force in the bull market, with analysts and investors in awe of its presale mania. Experts claim that the hybrid platform can win against Solana (SOL) after its listing. The DTX tokens give SOL-like features at a much lower investment cost in the current session. Its ROI potential is also similar to that of SOL, thus it is expected to touch the $10 target after its listing. Solana price is tumbling in the current session with a massive red candle ruling the Solana price charts. Experts suggest this price slump could force investors to flock to DTX Exchange as the hybrid token has become a key to massive gains in the current session. DTX Exchange’s 4x CEX Listing: A Potential Game-Changer While Solana price struggles, DTX Exchange (DTX) positioned itself as the future of hybrid trading. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, DTX provides access to over 120,000 assets, including stocks, ETFs, forex, and digital currencies, all on a Layer-1 blockchain. The platform’s hybrid model allows both institutional and retail traders to operate seamlessly without KYC restrictions, offering transparency and enterprise-grade analytics for smarter decision-making. One of DTX’s biggest advantages is its presale structure, which offers early buyers a unique chance to double their investment before the token even hits exchanges. Currently, the token is priced at $0.18, but upon listing, this is expected to rise to $0.36, a built-in 2x listing increase, and for early investors this 2x could be 4x by using the “LIST2X” promo code. With additional momentum, DTX could see exponential gains in the short term, far outpacing SOL price movements. The hybrid platform has been fully audited by SolidProof, ensuring a safe and transparent trading environment. Furthermore, DTX Exchange reaches transaction processing speeds of 200,000 transactions per second through its VulcanX blockchain framework, which positions it ahead of the competition, notably Solana, in this session. The platform also offers 1000x leverage, allowing traders to capitalize on their investments. Solana Price Path To $178: Technical Indicators Of SOL Solana’s price is currently slumping in this session while its short-term price analysis is still looking bullish. With increased investor confidence analysts are saying Solana price is heading to $178 in the short term. The technicals support this view. If Solana price breaks its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the selling pressure will ease, and the SOL token can climb to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). But there’s resistance at $178. If SOL breaks this resistance it can trigger more upside. If it falls below $120 it can correct down to $110 or $90. Thus a break through $140 can ignite a bullish momentum toward $178. In the longer term, Solana’s price chart shows the potential for a cup-and-handle pattern, which, if confirmed, could drive the Solana price to as high as $3,800. This long-term target depends on the successful breakout of key resistance levels. SOL’s performance and the recently bridged assets are making investors wait with bated breath for more. The activity on the network including the recent 5th anniversary celebrations is adding to the positive vibes around the chain. Despite the setbacks like SIMD-0228 proposal failure, the quick decision-making in the SOL community is seen as a silver lining. With increased investor interest Solana is looking good for short-term gains but market watchers will be cautious and will be watching key levels and broader market conditions to see if this rally is sustainable. For long-term gains, DTX Exchange remains the best investment option. Key Takeaways The Solana price is struggling at a critical zone with SOL tokens at the verge of a massive slump or a rally simultaneously. In these circumstances, DTX Exchange emerges as the best investment option that could possibly defeat the Solana price actions after its listing. The platform’s high demand has made it a rising star in DeFi space.

42042599,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141824,1742471459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: ECB President Flags Tariffs’ Devastating Impact on Eurozone Inflation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eurozone-inflation-tariffs-impact/,"Are you prepared for a potential jolt to the global economy? ECB President Christine Lagarde has just dropped a bombshell, and it could directly impact your finances and the broader market sentiment. In a recent address, she highlighted a significant threat looming over the Eurozone: Eurozone inflation could surge by a staggering 0.5 percentage points if tariffs escalate between the U.S. and Europe. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the future of the European economy. Why ECB President Lagarde’s Warning on Tariffs Matters Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), isn’t known for mincing words, especially when it comes to economic stability. Her recent statement on March 20th regarding the potential tariffs impact is a clear signal of concern. According to the ECB’s analysis, a 25% tariff imposed by the U.S. on European imports could immediately clip 0.3 percentage points off the Eurozone’s economic growth in the first year alone. But the story doesn’t end there. Lagarde elaborated on a potentially more alarming scenario: Initial Impact: A unilateral 25% U.S. tariff could reduce Eurozone GDP growth by 0.3 pp. Retaliatory Measures: If Europe responds by increasing tariffs on U.S. goods, the economic downturn could deepen to 0.5 pp. Inflationary Pressure: Counter-tariffs from the EU, coupled with a possible weakening of the euro, could ignite Eurozone inflation , pushing it upwards by approximately 0.5 pp. This isn’t just abstract economic theory; these are real-world implications that could affect businesses, consumers, and investors across Europe and beyond. Decoding the Economic Fallout: Growth and Inflation Dynamics To truly grasp the gravity of Lagarde’s warning, let’s break down the intertwined challenges of economic growth Eurozone and inflation in the context of tariffs. The Growth Conundrum Tariffs act as a tax on international trade. When the U.S. imposes tariffs on European goods, it makes these goods more expensive for American consumers and businesses. This can lead to: Reduced Exports: European businesses may find it harder to sell their products in the U.S. market due to increased prices, leading to decreased export volumes. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains, forcing businesses to find alternative, potentially more expensive, sources for inputs. Investment Uncertainty: The threat of tariffs creates uncertainty, discouraging businesses from investing in expansion or new projects, fearing future trade barriers. These factors collectively contribute to a slowdown in economic growth Eurozone . The initial 0.3 pp reduction is a significant hit, and a further drop to 0.5 pp with retaliatory tariffs paints a concerning picture of economic stagnation. The Inflation Inferno While slower growth is a serious concern, the potential surge in Eurozone inflation is equally, if not more, alarming. Here’s how tariffs can fuel inflation: Direct Price Increases: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported goods. These higher costs can be passed on to consumers, leading to price hikes across various sectors. Retaliatory Tariffs: When Europe retaliates with its own tariffs on U.S. goods, it makes American products more expensive in Europe. This, too, contributes to inflationary pressures within the Eurozone. Currency Depreciation: Lagarde mentioned a ‘declining euro’ as a contributing factor to inflation. Trade tensions and economic uncertainty can weaken the euro’s value. A weaker euro makes imports more expensive (as you need more euros to buy the same amount of foreign currency), further driving up inflation. An inflation spike of 0.5 pp might seem modest, but in an environment where central banks are battling to control rising prices, any additional inflationary pressure is unwelcome. It could force the ECB to maintain or even increase interest rates, further dampening economic growth Eurozone and potentially triggering a vicious cycle. Europe vs. US Trade Tensions: A Deep Dive The current trade tensions between Europe US trade partners are not happening in a vacuum. They are part of a broader global shift towards protectionism and economic nationalism. Understanding the context is crucial. Historical Perspective Trade relations between the U.S. and Europe have historically been complex, marked by both cooperation and disputes. While both regions are major economic powerhouses and allies, disagreements over trade practices, agricultural subsidies, and regulatory standards have surfaced periodically. Current Flashpoints The potential 25% tariff mentioned by ECB President Lagarde is likely related to ongoing disputes in sectors like: Automobiles: The U.S. has previously threatened tariffs on European cars, citing national security concerns. Agriculture: Disagreements over agricultural subsidies and market access have been a long-standing issue. Digital Services: Europe’s moves to tax digital services provided by large U.S. tech companies have also strained relations. The Geopolitical Dimension Beyond purely economic considerations, Europe US trade relations are also intertwined with geopolitical dynamics. A trade war could weaken transatlantic ties at a time when global cooperation is needed to address various challenges, from climate change to geopolitical instability. Navigating the Tariffs Storm: Actionable Insights For businesses and individuals within the Eurozone, understanding the potential tariffs impact and the resulting Eurozone inflation is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Businesses: Diversify Markets: Reduce reliance on the U.S. market by exploring alternative export destinations in Asia, Latin America, or within the EU single market. Supply Chain Resilience: Assess and diversify supply chains to minimize disruption from potential tariffs. Consider sourcing inputs from regions less likely to be affected by trade tensions. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different tariff scenarios. Model the potential impact of tariffs on costs, revenues, and profitability. Individuals: Budgeting for Inflation: Be prepared for potentially higher prices due to Eurozone inflation . Review your household budget and identify areas where you can cut back if necessary. Investment Strategy: Consider the potential impact of trade tensions and inflation on your investment portfolio. Diversification across asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Europe US trade relations and ECB policy announcements. Reliable news sources and financial analysis can help you stay ahead of the curve. Conclusion: A Call for Prudence and Cooperation ECB President Lagarde’s stark warning about the tariffs impact on Eurozone inflation and economic growth Eurozone is a wake-up call. Escalating trade tensions between Europe US trade partners pose a significant threat to economic stability on both sides of the Atlantic. While tariffs might be intended to protect domestic industries, the broader economic consequences, including heightened inflation and reduced growth, can be far-reaching and damaging. The path forward requires prudence, dialogue, and a commitment to international cooperation. Avoiding a trade war is not just about economics; it’s about preserving global stability and fostering a more prosperous future for all. Let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and that policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic recognize the urgent need for de-escalation and constructive engagement.

According to Ash Crypto, the country is now set to legalize cryptocurrency trading, a decision that could reshape its economic landscape and attract foreign investment. This marks a significant shift from its previously cautious stance on digital assets. Pakistan’s Crypto Revolution For years, Pakistan has grappled with uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency regulation. Despite this, crypto adoption has surged, with the country ranking ninth globally in crypto usage and an estimated 15 to 20 million Pakistanis actively trading digital assets. Recognizing this growing demand, the government is now moving to establish clear regulations that will legitimize and streamline crypto-related activities.

Boost Economic Growth: The crypto industry has the potential to create jobs, support fintech innovation , and increase financial inclusion. Enhance Financial Transparency: A well-regulated crypto sector can reduce illicit activities and ensure compliance with international financial standards. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, recently emphasized the urgency of this shift, stating, “Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines.” This highlights the government’s ambition to integrate blockchain technology and position Pakistan as a key player in the global digital economy.

Interest rate maintenance by the Fed resulted in increased pricing across most cryptocurrency markets. The Made in USA market achieved $423 billion in market value through its 6% daily market expansion. The value of several USA coins to buy has strongly increased as Trump prepares to give his crypto summit address. Best USA Coins To Buy Now Ahead of Crypto Summit Speech At the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in New York, President Donald Trump will provide a recorded communication. The appearance of President Donald Trump at the cryptocurrency conference represents his debut as a speaking president at such an industry gathering. The hype surrounding the event stems from signs that suggest the Trump administration could potentially back cryptocurrencies, specifically stablecoins. Among the USA coins to purchase are XRP, ADA, LINK, and SOL. Tweet Ripple (XRP) XRP price is among the top USA coins to buy after a strong market recovery. XRP token experienced a surge of over 10% during the day and emerged among the highest performers of the day. Ripple currently trades at $2.50 as analysts predict it will rise to $3 provided its bullish market conditions continue. After the Federal Open Market Committee decision on previous day, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced positive market trends. XRP continues to capture attention from market participants as Trump prepares to address the crypto summit which drives investors to consider its potential influence on the market. Source: TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) experienced a 5% increase during the past day which lifted its value to $0.7327. The ADA crypto follows an upward trend which shows growing strength because it aims to reach $1. An ascending value trend has gained notice before important market events such as the Crypto Summit speech from Trump. The most recent data shows Cardano (ADA) experienced substantial growth in its trading volume. Within the recent 24-hour period, whales purchased 190 million ADA tokens. The increase in purchase demand stemming from whales might result in market price growth due to their established trend-setting power in the market. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) enters a positive direction with US investors seeing their first Solana ETFs debut today. The price of Solana has rebounded while trading over the crucial $130 support threshold. SOL has achieved a 10% rise in value throughout the past 24 hours making it one of the prime USA coins to purchase at present. Investors show intense attention to this market development since they believe it represents substantial expansion possibilities. The Solana derivatives market continues to expand rapidly based on CoinGlass data. The total volume has expanded by 81.02% to achieve $8.63 billion. Open interest increased by 2.26% while reaching $3.86 billion and the change matches the current statistics. The rising market participation levels have led to increased trading volume and interest which might impact Solana’s price volatility. Source- Coinglass Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink price is among the top USA coins to buy after a notable recovery over the past 24 hours. The LINK price followed the crypto market bullish trend after the FOMC decision on the previous day. As of the reporting time, the LINK price is trading at $14.05, with a 5% surge in the past 24-hours. The Chainlink price prediction shows potential to exceed $20, while the LINK price might achieve $30 before Trump delivers his crypto summit speech, provided bulls maintain their momentum. Final Thought To sum up, the growth outlook for USA coins to buy appears strong, including the present Trump summit political event. Market development requires continuous investor observation to determine upcoming industry actions.

All that tokenized yellowcake's looking more like gold. Months after netting its first $1.7 million from venture investors, Uranium Digital raised another $6.1 million in a seed round led by Framework Ventures. The financing will accelerate Uranium Digital's buildout of a spot trading platform for uranium that uses crypto infrastructure on the backend. It claims to be the first institutional market — crypto-powered or not — for a critical clean-energy commodity that, perplexingly, doesn't enjoy the same easy trading of its dirtier peers, coal, natural gas and oil. A radioactive mix of high regulations and low mainstream demand previously stymied the emergence of a robust uranium spot market, Dolesky said in an interview. While the strict rules over who can take settlement of yellowcake, a powdered form of uranium oxide concentrate, aren't going anywhere, the global demand for nuclear energy is taking care of the rest. Nuclear power is on its comeback tour. The energy source once derided by unfortunate disasters — most recently the Fukushima meltdown — is cropping up as a salve for rapidly increasing electric needs. The surge is fueling newfound interest from investors and institutions for an accessible spot market. In crypto Dolesky said he's found an efficient avenue to create the first. He says he's ""abstracting away"" the usual pain points of on-chain trading so that Uranium Digital will look and feel familiar for institutional clients. ""Crypto rails for efficiency, speed and execution purposes — it's a unique opportunity,"" he said. As the platform nears its launch date Dolesky plans to pour more capital into his business and engineering teams. He realized after the pre-seed that the company's proposed solution had an even deeper well of potential users than what he called his most optimistic projections. Meeting the excess demand meant moving faster and raising more money. ""The response we've gotten from the traditional market has been such that we're effectively going live sooner than anticipated,"" he said.",Finance|Funding Rounds|nuclear energy,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|COMMODITY|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-20 12:00:00
42043726,https://blockworks.co/news/bitlayer-bridged-bitvm,1742472000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Bitlayer has finally bridged BitVM to the world stage,https://blockworks.co/news/bitlayer-bridged-bitvm,"Co-founders Charlie Hu and Kevin He started Bitlayer as a research-oriented passion project based on the BitVM paradigm, quickly spearheading the effort into an opportunity to unlock immense liquidity in the Bitcoin asset and ecosystem. Funnelling their extensive experience leading international teams to global success at Polygon, Polkadot, and Huobi, the two turned Bitlayer into the most relevant Bitcoin L2 in the space. In July 2024, Bitlayer announced its $11M Series A round led by Franklin Templeton and ABCDE. By October of the same year the team had raised an extended Series A round securing $9M more in funding, this time led by Polychain Capital. In less than a year’s time following the raise announcements, the team at Bitlayer has made staggering progress. Since the launch of its V1 mainnet, the project reached an all-time high TVL of 850 million with over 200 Dapps launched on the L2. Bitlayer’s ecosystem is growing and thriving with projects building Bitcoin DeFi (BTC-Fi) applications, ranging from BTC dexes, staking, restaking and liquid staking, infra, oracles, interoperability, data availability, and runes and ordinals, amongst many others. Recently, the team announced the first BitVM bridge solution testnet built in the Bitcoin ecosystem. “The bridge is an absolute necessity for Defi to happen on Bitcoin, ” said Charlie Hu, Co-founder of Bitlayer. “The main differentiator when compared to previous solutions is the trust assumption. The existing multisig set-up requires the majority of signers to be honest; if it happens that the majority of signers are malicious then the bridge becomes insecure, which is what happened during some of the major hacks we’ve seen lately in the space. Our bridging solution is trust-minimized which means that only one signer needs to be honest in order for the bridge to be secure.” The BitVM trust-minimized bridge enables the flow of bitcoin to an array of blockchains and decentralized applications. The recent announcement of Bitlayer’s partnerships with key Layer 1 blockchains such as Base, Arbitrum, Starknet, Sonic SVM, and Plume Network signal rising demand and interest. Now, with the imminent launch of Bitlayer Mainnet V2 in Q2 2025, Bitlayer is finally bringing BitVM to the world stage. “ T he Bitlayer network’s Mainnet V2 is set to transition to a Bitcoin Rollup, a first-of-its-kind innovation in the market, bringing Bitcoin-level security to the Layer 2 ecosystem,” says Kevin He, Bitlayer Co-founder. BitVM allows for trust-minimized deployment of Bitcoin into a host of blockchains, DeFi protocols, and decentralized applications in order to earn yield, staking rewards, lending and borrowing features, and much more. The BitVM paradigm does not require a fork to the Bitcoin protocol, and instead provides a technical solution built with zero-knowledge proofs, rollup architecture, and trust-minimized bridging. Institutional investors, OGs, whales, traders, and holders can deploy their Bitcoin to earn yield rewards, in a non-custodial, trust-minimized way. And so Bitlayer continues its vision to untap Bitcoin’s full Defi potential, teaming up with clients, community, and ecosystem partners to make history for Bitcoin.

Speaking before the Colorado state legislature Wednesday, Bedoya said the dismissals would suppress fair market oversight and undermine the work of independent regulatory agencies. “ I think we need to be focused on the billionaires over President Trump’s shoulder at his inauguration and what this attempt will do for them ,” Bedoya said. “ Above all else, we need to be asking ourselves, who will win from this attempt to illegally remove us, and frankly, who will lose? ” Bedoya: Trump firing Democratic party-aligned commissioners is illegal As reported by Cryptopolitan on March 19, Bedoya and fellow Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were fired on Tuesday evening, an action they have coined “illegal and unlawful.” Their removal appears to violate legal precedent that restricts a president from firing FTC commissioners without cause. The following day, in a CNBC interview, Slaughter cautioned that the dismissals breach government agencies’ ability to work independently. “ This isn’t just about the FTC, and it’s not about my job ,” Slaughter said on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street . “ This is about policing the ability of the FTC to police markets and ensure honest businesses are protected instead of allowing companies that lie and cheat to get ahead. ” Slaughter also asked if the firings could be extended to other independent agencies or if it was just a ploy to take out the liberals from the agency. “ If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired ,” referring to the Federal Reserve chairman. “ As head of the executive branch, President Trump is vested with all of the executive power in our government ,” said FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson, defending Trump’s decision. “I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government. ” Washington has not specified the reasons for the dismissals, but White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Trump is exercising his “lawful authority” to manage personnel. “ President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for ,” Rogers remarked. Is Trump protecting his tech friends? Bedoya asserted that his firing may be linked to his statements on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Bezos, along with other tech executives such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, stood behind Trump at his inauguration on January 20. “ I issued a statement criticizing Mr Bezos for working his people and warehouses so fast, so hard that they literally have to put up vending machines on the warehouse floor, dispensing and capping the amount of painkillers each of those workers has to get, ” Bedoya told Colorado lawmakers. Mr. Bezos, when I think about “free markets and personal liberties” I don’t think about the Post editorial page. I think about this vending machine in an Amazon Fulfillment Center, which is stocked not with chips but with painkillers. https://t.co/emxXutsDzP pic.twitter.com/R1pMOHz3Aj — Alvaro Bedoya (@BedoyaFTC) February 28, 2025 Although he didn’t directly accuse Bezos of having influenced his dismissal, Bedoya said the timing of his firing was “interesting.” “ I’m not alleging that this was why I was fired, but I think it’s an interesting coincidence .” The FTC has also been investigating Amazon, Meta, and X, which the ex-commissioner revealed he had been working on. “ I stress an uncomfortable fact, which is that the issue of the corrupting influence of money in politics, I don’t think, is limited to one party . So I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, who will win from this effort to remove us? ” he inquired. Bipartisan concerns and the Senate pushback More than two dozen Democratic senators have called on Trump to reinstate the fired commissioners. In a letter signed on Tuesday by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Dick Durbin, and Maria Cantwell, among others, they argued that Trump is ignoring the FTC’s independence. “ This action contradicts Congress’s constitutional authority to create bipartisan, independent commissions and upends more than 110 years of work at the FTC to protect consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power, ” the senators wrote. “ We urge you to rescind these dismissals so the FTC can get back to the people’s work .” Still, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt swatted away concerns about any legal repercussions, saying the removals were well within the US president’s authority. “ They were given ample notice in a letter that I believe your outlet reported on, ” Leavitt reckoned. When asked if the administration’s goal was to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling that protects the independence of commissions, she responded, “ The goal was to let these individuals go. If we have to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court, we certainly will. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

BNB Discusses the Evolution of GameFi in 2025 On March 11, 2025, BNB Chain published a blog on web3 gaming this year. According to BNB, GameFi is becoming better, bigger, and more immersive. BNB said this growth is due to new mechanics, real player ownership, and sustainable economies. Despite increased activities on the BNB chain, BNB struggled in early March. For context, BNB traded for $566 on March 4. By March 11, BNB had only lost 0.73% of its market value and sold for $562. While most BNB investors are observing the market, the smart ones are pivoting to a profitable new token, $FXG, to secure a 500% profit in 2025. Ethereum Foundation Appoints New Executive Directors On March 1, 2025, Ethereum Foundation welcomed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak as co-executive directors. Before their appointments, they both served well in various roles within Ethereum’s ecosystem. Wang was a researcher at Ethereum Foundation for seven years before leaving to become a crypto community builder in Taiwan, while Stanczak was a development leader for NethermindETH, an engineering and research firm based on Ethereum. However, ETH couldn’t capitalize on the new development and saw a price dip in early March. On March 4, ETH traded for $2,085. A week later, ETH had lost over 7% of its market value and sold for $1,921. Ethereum investors know that the token will likely not gain 500% this year.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL’s price is trading at around $134, up more than 6% in the last 24 hours. Solana price has rebounded roughly 20% from its local low of around $112 reached on March 11. SOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Several factors driving the SOL price up today, including: SOL price rally comes following the launch of the first Solana futures ETF. Approximately $18 million in shorts were liquidated over the last 24 hours. SOL’s strengthening technicals target is $220. Launch of Solana futures ETF boosts SOL price Today’s debut of Solana futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Volatility Shares has injected fresh enthusiasm into SOL investors. 🚨 BREAKING: The first-ever Solana futures ETFs are launching tomorrow. Volatility Shares is debuting two ETFs: • SOLZ: Tracks Solana futures • SOLT: Offers 2x leveraged exposure pic.twitter.com/Wt2gt6oBPc — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 19, 2025 Key takeaways: Volatility Shares, a US-based investment firm, is set to launch the first-ever Solana futures ETFs on Thursday, March 20. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveals that two Solana-based ETFs issued by Volatility Shares ETFs will begin trading on Thursday, March 20. These include Solana ETF (SOLZ), which will track Solana futures and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), which offers leveraged exposure. SOLZ will have a management fee of 0.95%, while traders will be charged 1.85% for SOLT. The ETFs, following a path similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures products, signal growing institutional acceptance and provide easier access for traditional investors. Market participants believe that the launch of these funds could be significant in the approval of a spot Solana ETF . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Franklin Templeton and VanEck , have applied for spot Solana ETFs, which are yet to be approved by the SEC. Bloomberg ETF analysts believe there is a 75% chance of approval by this year’s end. Analysts see this as a regulatory green light, boosting confidence in Solana and across the broader market. “​​Solana ETF dropping right after BTC/ETH ETFs? The TradFi gates are opening wide,” said crypto analyst Kolin in a March 19 post on X. “Futures are just the start - spot ETF inevitable. $SOL's just warming up and the Solana ecosystem’s about to get flooded with institutional liquidity.” “This is wild,” asserted Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in response to the developments, adding that it is probably a good sign as Solana futures “arguably bode well for spot ETF odds.” Short liquidations push SOL price higher Solana’s price rise on March 20 is accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market, according to data from CoinGlass. The crypto futures market witnessed the liquidation of over $359 million worth of leverage positions in the last 24 hours, with $258.7 million being short liquidations. Over $18.64 million short SOL positions have been liquidated against $3 million long liquidations over the same period. Total crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Bearish traders’ short positions are automatically closed when the price exceeds their liquidation price, which can fuel the rally further. Furthermore, the SOL price gains accompany a recovery in its funding rates . SOL’s 8-hour funding rates have flipped positive from -0.0050% on March 19 to 0.0049% on March 20, as shown in the chart below. SOL funding rates performance. Source: CoinGlass A rise in funding rates indicates increased demand for long positions and increased interest among SOL traders.

However, the bulls have established support around $110 and $125 at the upper boundary of a descending channel. The daily relative strength index (RSI) has recorded higher highs since March 10 with no divergence, indicating that the upward momentum remains strong. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The next immediate barrier sits at $140, which, if broken, SOL price would rise higher to confront resistance from the $165 to $190 supply zone—this is around where all the major moving averages sit. Bulls will be required to flip this area into support to increase the chances of rising toward $220, where the price could pause for a while. According to analyst Cryptobits, SOL’s recent low at $112 marked the local bottom for the altcoin. He added that Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, with increasing “investment interests from institutions” supporting its upside. “With all the above remaining intact, I see $SOL returning above $200 and eventually breaking its ATH high at $296.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Memecoins have also taken part in this recovery. The top 3 memecoins by market cap are analysed. Are $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE making a comeback? Total2 will signal altcoin rally or rejection Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. Therefore it enables a reasonable assessment of how the altcoins are doing in general. It can be seen that a minor rally is currently taking place. For this rally to really take off, the descending trendline will have to be broken, and higher highs will need to be made. If this does take place, expect some of the prominent memecoins to take advantage. $DOGE potentially finds a bottom Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE does show that this $25.5 billion memecoin may have finally found a bottom. The price was able to bounce from the ascending trendline, which was perhaps the very bottom, and is now battling to stay above the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci retracement levels. A big plus is that the bulls have broken through the descending trendline. The price may be coming back down to retest this, possibly at $0.16 before going higher. If the bottom is indeed in for $DOGE, potential bounces from the indicators in the RSI, and Stochastic RSI, could help to get a powerful rally started. $SHIB in favourable position Source: TradingView The $SHIB price does look to be in a favourable position in the weekly chart. The bulls have forced it through the descending trendline, and the price is currently maintaining at the major horizontal support level. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame inclining upward from the bottom, all would appear to be perfect for a rally from here. That said, the support and the trendline would have to hold, and Bitcoin would need to take the lead. Important targets are at $0.000016, and then $$0.000021. Horizontal support proves its worth for $PEPE Source: TradingView $PEPE can probably be classed as a true memecoin, because all it has backing it is the air that we breathe. Even so, it has a market cap of more than $3 billion, and the price appears to be recovering nicely so far. The horizontal support at $0.000006 has proved its worth, and the price has bounced from there. Targets, according to the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above.

Ethereum’s dip has incurred significant losses for its holders, with about 70% of ETH addresses clearly out of money. The token is plunging even deeper despite the network’s activity, such as the Pectra upgrade deployed on the Sepolia testnet to increase ETH’s worth. Despite the bear market, DuragDoge ($DURAG) is the real winner right now. Its features equip it with the resilience and longevity it needs to beat market conditions, so analysts rank it as the best cryptocurrency. The $DURAG token is among the best crypto pre-sales right now, and it continues to hit new records with its utility-driven features. Read on to discover why $DURAG is ten steps ahead in the game. Ethereum (ETH) Still in the Dip as its New Upgrade on Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues Ethereum’s most anticipated upgrade, Pectra , was deployed on its final testnet on March 5. The upgrade marks a significant milestone towards Ethereum’s goal of achieving the mainnet activation. Pectra has received immense support from community members, who hope the upgrade will boost ETH’s value. The upgrade also aims to improve Ethereum’s network activity and scalability. However, Pectra has yet to live up to its promises, as the developers encounter a hurdle on the Sepolia testnet. Tim Beiko , Ethereum Protocol Support Lead, said the problem is due to a custom deposit contract on Sepolia. This caused execution layer (EL) clients to face issues such as transaction delays within blocks. With this issue onboard, the mainnet activation launch date might be postponed, killing token holders’ hopes. This also means the ETH token might continue to plummet, as the upgrade was supposed to cause ETH to rally. The dip is affecting investors and token holders, as data from IntoTheBlock shows only about 26% of ETH addresses are making slight profits. This means that over 70% of Ethereum addresses have lost everything. No wonder holders are shifting to $DURAG, one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Rallies, Emerges as the New Token With the Highest Potential DuragDoge is the new hot deal in the crypto market. It tops the chart as the best cryptocurrency to buy now. DuragDoge is a new meme coin with revolutionary features that will shake the meme coin sector. Its token, $DURAG, is fortified with features that will promote the hustle culture, reflect members’ identity and creativity, drape members with the ultimate drip, and promote longevity. DuragDoge is headed for the global stage while creating an ecosystem that supports staking and other developments that benefit token holders. These features place $DURAG many steps ahead of other meme coins, which is why it is currently recording one of the best crypto presales. $DURAG’s presales aim to give everyone early access to this golden token. This is why 1,240,000,000 $DURAG tokens are available at exclusive rates. The $DURAG token is gathering interest from crypto whales and users as it is one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Gains Whales’ Approval With its Reward Features The $DURAG token is gaining widespread adoption due to its reward features that increase holders’ gains. One of $DURAG’s most profitable features is the staking and reward. Holders who stake their $DURAGs will earn up to 20% APY in rewards, boosting their portfolios significantly. There will be community incentives, where members receive rewards for their activeness and creativity in DuragDoge’s ecosystem. There will also be periodic burns to assure holders and investors of $DURAG’s security and longevity. These burns will regulate $DURAG’s circulation, making it a deflationary token whose value will continue to rise. Conclusion With many changes in the crypto market, DuragDoge might be the new leading crypto. The $DURAG token continues to see increased adoption, with the presales surging beyond expectations.

XYZVerse, a rising sports memecoin with explosive growth potential, is capturing investor attention. Table of Contents XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? Tron stagnates Binance Coin fluctuates Conclusion Prominent investors in Asia are reportedly offloading significant holdings of Tron and Binance Coin. At the same time, a lot of attention has shifted to an obscure altcoin priced at a fraction of a cent, which is rumored to have massive growth potential. This unexpected move is stirring curiosity in the crypto community as the details behind this hidden gem begin to emerge. XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? The excitement around XYZVerse isn’t just noise; it’s a genuine phenomenon. As the pioneering all-sports meme token, XYZVerse is rapidly bridging the gap between sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, sparking major interest. Unlike typical memecoins that thrive solely on fleeting trends, XYZVerse is carving out its own niche. By merging the exhilarating world of sports with the contagious energy of meme culture, XYZVerse has captured significant momentum. The presale is accelerating, allowing early adopters to secure tokens at prices far below their anticipated future value. Currently, XYZVerse remains in its presale stage, but investor demand is already high. The token’s price has impressively surged from an initial $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, and over 70% of the $15 million presale target has been achieved. With a final projected presale price of $0.1, early participants are set for significant returns. XYZVerse’s popularity is evident on CoinMarketCap, where the community sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. With a remarkable 95% of voters forecasting further growth for XYZ, optimism is undeniably high. Influential crypto figures have also noticed XYZVerse’s potential. Crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, who boasts nearly 800,000 followers, recently labeled XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” While the crypto market always involves risks, the buzz surrounding XYZVerse is undeniably strong. Beyond mere speculation, XYZVerse boasts structured and sustainable tokenomics. A significant 15% allocation to liquidity ensures robust market foundations, while another 10% is set aside for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses. Additionally, a substantial 17.13% of the supply is earmarked for deflationary burns, potentially enhancing token scarcity and value. What truly distinguishes XYZVerse is its emphasis on community involvement. Through initiatives like the Ambassador Program, supporters can earn tokens by actively promoting the project. Furthermore, discussions with prominent sports celebrities are underway, aiming to amplify XYZVerse’s visibility. By uniting passionate sports communities with the dynamic crypto ecosystem, XYZVerse is crafting an engaging and entertaining experience. Backed by a rapidly growing presale, enthusiastic community, and ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse possesses all the elements of a memecoin poised for explosive growth. While crypto markets are inherently unpredictable, savvy investors recognize the opportunity to participate early in a potentially promising project. With the presale window rapidly closing, the time to explore XYZVerse might be now.

Over the last month, it dipped by 3.93%. Looking at the past six months, TRX surged by 53.66%, showing strong growth over time. Currently, TRX trades between $0.20 and $0.23. The 10-day moving average is $0.24, while the 100-day average is $0.22. This places the price below the short-term average but above the long-term one. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.83, indicating a neutral market stance. The MACD level is 0.0037, hinting at slight bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.25. If TRX breaks through, it could reach $0.27, which is about a 17% increase from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.19. If the price falls below this, it might drop to $0.17, roughly a 13% decrease. With the stochastic at 50.57, the market seems balanced. TRX could move upward if buying interest grows. Binance Coin fluctuates BNB has shown mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 11.81%, indicating short-term bullishness. However, over the last month, it declined by 8.29%. Over six months, there’s an overall increase of 8.81%, reflecting moderate long-term growth. Trading between $532.97 and $647.57, BNB is approaching the nearest resistance at $692.63. A break above this could target the second resistance at $807.23, implying a potential gain of around 25%. If the price falls below the support at $463.43, it might drop to $348.83, representing a decrease of about 35%. Technical indicators are sending cautious signals. The RSI is at 39.37, nearing oversold territory, suggesting a possible rebound. The Stochastic indicator is low at 20.51, also pointing to overselling. However, the MACD level is negative at -3.1273, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, showing a lack of clear trend direction. Based on these factors, BNB’s future movement is uncertain, but a significant breakout could occur soon. Conclusion Though TRX and BNB remain strong, investors are turning to XYZVerse, a pioneering sports memecoin poised for significant growth in the 2025 bull market.

Analyst Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/has-bitcoin-really-entered-a-bear-market-analyst-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin’s recent price movement has sparked debate among analysts over whether the original cryptocurrency has entered a bear market. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared an in-depth analysis assessing Bitcoin’s (BTC) trend using multiple technical indicators and on-chain data. In his study, Martinez suggested that while BTC might be shifting into a bearish phase, certain factors could still support a recovery. Key Indicators Signal Bearish Momentum First, Martinez highlighted the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, a metric tracking Bitcoin movement between spot and derivative exchanges. According to the analyst, BTC is currently in a “corrective phase,” often marked by declining prices or stabilization after a strong rally. Bitcoin has corrected 23% from its peak of over $109,000 in late January during President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He also pointed to the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which has turned negative—a historical signal of weakening momentum. Additionally, his Market Cycle Indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be in the early stages of a bear market, aligning with past downturns. Further evidence comes from large investor activity, particularly among miners and whales. On-chain data shared by Martinez showed that miners recently sold over $27 million in bitcoin profits, which often signals a shift toward caution in the market. Meanwhile, whale activity shows that major BTC holders have liquidated more than $260 million, adding to overall selling pressure. Compounding these concerns is a sharp decline in capital inflows—new investments entering Bitcoin. Monthly inflows have dropped significantly from $135 billion in December 2024 to just $4 billion on March 18, 2025, indicating weaker demand and a potential lack of fresh buying power. Can Bitcoin Hold Key Support Levels? Despite these bearish signals, Martinez identified key support levels that could stabilize Bitcoin’s price. According to the analyst, the $66,000–$69,000 range has emerged as a crucial zone where buyers might step in. To back this, Martinez shared a chart from IntoTheBlock that shows that 750,000 investors purchased 313,000 BTC around the $69,000 price range. He also shared Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution, which suggests strong support near $69,354—further reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin could find a floor in this range. Moreover, he pointed out that the Mayer Multiple and Bitcoin’s position relative to its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggests $66,000 as another critical level to watch. However, Martinez mentioned a potential bullish scenario tied to global liquidity. According to his analysis, rising liquidity levels have historically helped BTC recover, pointing to April as a possible turning point. If the leading crypto asset manages to reclaim $93,700 as support, it could signal a renewed uptrend, with a potential move toward $111,000, Martinez said. Despite these bearish concerns, BTC surged 4% to enter a 10-day high of $85,900 following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady.

The price initially climbed within an ascending triangle on the 1-hour chart but faced sharp rejection at resistance, triggering a pullback. Now, LINK is testing the $14.40 support zone, a key battleground for buyers. Key Levels to Watch A drop below $14.40 could accelerate selling, pushing LINK toward $14.20. Losing this level may break the ascending triangle’s trendline support, shifting momentum bearish and increasing downside risk. If buyers defend $14.40, a rebound toward $15.17 is likely. A breakout above this resistance would reverse the failed breakout, turning sentiment bullish. If momentum builds, LINK could target $17.40, a critical resistance for confirming a larger uptrend. Breakout Potential A decisive move above $17.40 could spark a long-term rally , attracting more buyers and strengthening market confidence. This scenario would favor both short-term traders and long-term holders.

42043554,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=245015,1742473015,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction as S&P 500 Index Rockets, Gold Hits ATH",https://coingape.com/markets/btc-eth-xrp-price-prediction-as-sp-500-index-rockets-gold-hits-ath/,"Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rose modestly on Thursday after Jerome Powell’s transitory statement on inflation. BTC price retested the important resistance at $86,000, while ETH rose to $2,000 and XRP price hit $2.5. So, how will these blue-chip crypto market coins react as the S&P 500 index and gold prices surge? S&P 500 Index and Gold Prices Are Soaring Popular players in the crypto market, like BTC, ETH, and XRP may benefit from the ongoing surge of other risky assets. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the biggest US companies, rose to $5,700, up by over 3% from the lowest point this month. Popular American indices like the Dow Jones and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have also jumped. At the same time, gold price has continued surging this year and is sitting at its all-time high. It has jumped in the last three consecutive weeks, making it one of the year’s best-performing assets. US stocks and gold continued rising after the Fed interest rate decision . The bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged and hinted that it would start tapering its quantitive tightening (QT) process. Most notably, Jerome Powell said that Trump tariff would cause transitory inflation, meaning that the bank would consider delivering more rate cuts this year. Mohamed El-Erian blasted that view, saying : “ I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility . It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” The soaring S&P 500 index and gold prices are bullish for crypto prices like BTC, ETH, and XRP since these assets have some correlation. BTC Price Technical Analysis While the ongoing S&P 500 index and gold price rally is positive for the BTC price, technicals point to uncertainties ahead. The main risk is that Bitcoin price has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. Bitcoin has also formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. It often leads to a bearish breakout. As CoinGape wrote earlier, Bitcoin key liquidation levels point to more downside. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where BTC price crashes to $73,587, the highest point in March last year. BTC price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis While ETH price has bounced back from the lowest point this month, it remains below the important resistance point at $2,138. This is a crucial level since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. The bearish ETH price forecast will remain as long as it is below that resistance level and the 50-day moving average at $2,300. More downside will be confirmed Ethereum price drops below $1,763. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis Ripple price rose after the end of the SEC vs Ripple case . However, it is notable that the coin has struggled to move above the resistance at $3, which is its make-or-break level. A clear bullish outlook will be confirmed if it rises above that level since it is the right and left shoulders of the head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that it will resume the downtrend as investors sell the fact. A drop to $1 will be confirmed if it crashes below $1.9, the neckline. XRP price chart Summary The crypto market, US stocks, and gold prices rose after the Fed decision. However, crypto prices like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP may struggle to sustain those gains, leading to an eventual crash.

On March 17, Solana’s official X account posted a 2.5-minute ad. In the video, a man named “America” tells a therapist about his thoughts on innovation, like interplanetary travel, AI, and crypto. The therapist diagnoses him with “rational thinking syndrome” and suggests he focus on creating a new gender identity instead. America insists he’ll keep thinking about innovation and action, but the therapist advises him to shift his focus from verbs (like “doing” and “innovating”) to pronouns. The ad was deleted 9 hours after being posted, despite having garnered 1.2 million views, with the crypto community divided over its tone and messaging. https://twitter.com/blocknewsdotcom/status/1901822169015050240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1901822169015050240%7Ctwgr%5E35b26baacb6d6548d4ebf24e9aa8cfd380b84399%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fblocknews.com%2Fsolanas-controversial-ad-sparks-community-outrage-leading-to-its-removal-here-is-what-happened%2F Many called the ad “ cringe “, “ toxic ,” and offensive , prompting several interesting takes on the current state of the culture war in crypto. One user said that the ad was probably trying to “highlight the fact that USA woke up from the woke mind virus and is focusing on crypto,” stopping short of condoning in: https://twitter.com/basedkarbon/status/1901809992514052319 Others didn’t take the ad so seriously. For example, one user said that there was not anything in it to get mad about. If it was the pronoun part, he wrote, “that’s been pushed harder over the last four years than any real innovation.” Source: Crypto-Vapour’s X Joshua Jake from Discover Crypto called the ad “brilliant marketing.” “Everyone crying that “crypto is supposed to be decentralized and apolitical” is missing the point entirely. The ad is designed to be cringy rage bait, and you’re all taking the bait—pushing its reach even further,” said Joshua. Echoing Jake’s sentiment, disinformation researcher Mike Solana wrote: “have you noticed people digging back to 2020 for unhinged article headlines, and posting them today for rage bait? that is because culture has changed, and people who built identities as demon slayers have no more demons left to slay. they will be turning on each other next.” Another point of contention was the fact that Solana deleted the ad in response to the community backlash , saying it was an overreaction. “Deleting it means Solana was shook,” one user remarked , pointing out that Solana would be better off if it focuses on the network’s issues rather than reacting to social media noise. Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, said that Solana deleted the ad to avoid further damage to the business—not because they thought it was wrong. Took them 9 hours to delete it. Also all the major players in the Solana ecosystem suddenly delete their tweets promoting/supporting the ad and RT’d and liked takes about it being bad. They approved this, supported it and celebrated it.

At this point, while it is estimated that 10 million people in Türkiye have invested in cryptocurrencies, new statements came from BinanceTR, the Turkish arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Speaking to AA, BinanceTR CEO Mücahit Dönmez answered questions about cryptocurrencies. Can Be Inherited! Answering the most frequently asked questions in the field of inheritance and enforcement regarding the legal status of cryptocurrencies, Dönmez said that cryptocurrencies are included in the estate as inheritance and passed on to the heirs. Mücahit Dönmez, who stated that cryptocurrencies could be subject to death-related dispositions such as wills and inheritance contracts, told AA: “If the deceased's crypto assets are held by a crypto asset service provider or, following the new regulations, by a custodian, it will be sufficient for the heirs to apply to the relevant crypto asset service provider or custodian with the inheritance certificate, death certificate and other required documents. However, if the deceased's crypto assets are stored in a cold wallet, knowing or learning the password to the wallet is the only option to access the assets. May Be Subject to Enforcement Proceedings! Stating that cryptocurrencies can also be subject to enforcement proceedings, BinanceTR CEO said that enforcement proceedings can also be initiated for the debtor's cryptocurrency assets. Finally, Mücahit Dönmez added that it is clearly stated in the Capital Markets Law (CMB) that all kinds of administrative and judicial demands such as precautions, seizures and similar requests regarding cash and crypto assets belonging to their customers will be fulfilled exclusively by crypto asset service providers. *This is not investment advice.

In a blog announcement , Gemini said the ETFs aim to provide investors with 1.25x exposure to BTC and ETH, using cash borrowing instead of derivatives to amplify returns. Unlike traditional levered ETFs that use derivative strategies, these products “will rely on cash borrowing to amplify returns that will optimize the costs of the leverage for the funds,” according to Evolve ETFs. “As Canada’s first modestly leveraged crypto ETF offerings available to retail investors, these products exemplify the spirit of innovation that defines today’s rapidly changing digital assets industry.” Evolve ETFs You might also like: Gemini sets new world record with Bitcoin lightshow featuring 1,000 drones Gemini pointed out that its custody services include “SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 security examinations by Deloitte,” adding that assets would be “segregated on our internal ledger for the benefit of fund owners.” The partnerhip comes as the New York-headquartered crypto exchange, backed by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has been working with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup on a possible public offering that could happen as soon as this year, though no final decision has been announced so far.

BTC Price Analysis: Crypto Landscape Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Demand At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading just above $81,000 with a slight increase as compared to last week. However, looking at the 30 day chart, the price went to $77,000 on March 11 but is now recovering with $80,000 as a strong support level. The recent technical patterns, such as the formation of a cup-and-handle, suggest that the BTC price can have a bullish trajectory and could target the $130,000 range. Source: CoinMarketCap As for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, it has experienced fluctuations after a period of outflows of around $912 million over five weeks with inflows of $275 million recorded on March 17. This shift may signal renewed investor confidence in spot Bitcoin ETF and related investments.

This position is consistent with Schlegel’s earlier remarks . In a November 2024 event, he expressed caution regarding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), labeling them as niche phenomena unsuitable for payment purposes due to significant value fluctuations. He also highlighted concerns about the high energy consumption required for cryptocurrency operations and their association with illegal activities, making them difficult to regulate.

His track record of navigating complex investment landscapes and implementing innovative financial products aligns with Bakkt’s vision of expanding its market influence. Strategic Partnership with DTR In parallel with its leadership change, Bakkt has entered into a strategic partnership with DTR, a rising stablecoin payment firm known for its robust cross-border transaction solutions. The collaboration aims to integrate DTR’s stablecoin technology into Bakkt’s ecosystem, facilitating seamless and low-cost digital transactions. Stablecoins have gained significant traction in the crypto industry due to their ability to maintain price stability while enabling faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional payment rails. By leveraging DTR’s infrastructure, Bakkt is positioning itself as a major player in digital payments, particularly for institutional clients seeking efficient settlement solutions. What Is it Preparing for? The appointment of Akshay Naheta and the strategic partnership with DTR underscore Bakkt’s broader ambitions to lead in the cryptocurrency and digital payment sectors. They also suggest new product offerings in digital assets, payments, or blockchain services and aimed expansion of Bakkt into emerging markets where digital finance is rapidly growing. A push for acquisitions or investments in crypto-related companies to strengthen Bakkt’s ecosystem can also be expected given Akshay Nehta’s leadership. Notably, since its launch by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2018, Bakkt has evolved from a Bitcoin futures trading platform into a diversified digital asset company offering crypto custody, trading, and payment solutions. In recent months, Bakkt has been actively expanding its institutional offerings, targeting enterprises looking for secure and compliant digital asset services. Further, the integration of DTR’s stablecoin payment system could provide Bakkt with a crucial edge in the rapidly evolving digital finance space, particularly as global regulations around stablecoins continue to take shape. Thus, with Naheta’s experience in structuring billion-dollar deals and fostering fintech innovation, Bakkt is poised to navigate the complexities of the digital asset market while expanding its footprint in the payments industry.

Semler Scientific’s $270M in Bitcoin plus $15M in cash nearly covers its $372M market cap, pricing the core med-tech firm at only $87M. Its QuantaFlo business generated $24.4M in free cash flow last year, suggesting a rare 3.6× FCF multiple. At 3.6× FCF, the market is valuing a steadily profitable healthcare business at a deep discount, making Semler an intriguing ""arbitrage"" crypto opportunity. I haven't posted an article for a while, but the time seems to have arrived, as I think I might have uncovered a unique value play in today’s market. Today, we are looking at Semler Scientific ( SMLR ), for which you can effectively pay $270 million ($27.7 per share for the company’s Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings and its $14.85 million net cash and effectively get its entire medical tech business for around $87 million. Some Useful Background I know most of you are unfamiliar with Semler. Unless you follow companies building Bitcoin Treasuries (and if you have not even noticed this is a theme, it is a major one), you have probably never heard of it. So basically, Semler has been around since 2007 and is based in Santa Clara, California. Its bread-and-butter is QuantaFlo, a device that measures blood flow in just a few minutes, helping healthcare providers detect peripheral arterial disease early. For context, for 2024, Semler reported $56.3 million in revenue, $51.5 million in gross profit, and $24.4 million in free cash flow, which reveals a high-margin specialized med-tech player. These aren't one-off numbers. The company has grown consistently for years, and while revenues did dip last year, the company still reported excellent gross profits and record free cash flow. Semler's Revenues, Gross Profits, Free Cash Flow (Koyfin) The moment that changed everything was around mid-2024 when Semler decided to follow a strategy birthed by MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) (now Strategy), the Michael Saylor-led company famous for accumulating the largest Bitcoin treasury in the world. MSTR, which I have explored in recent articles, now holds 499,096 Bitcoins (or about 2.38% of all the Bitcoins to ever exist), worth about $41.7 billion. But back to Semler. In May 2024, the company acquired $40 million worth of BTC, about 581 coins, and saw its stock jump 25% in a day. But that was only the beginning. By February 2025, when the company reported its Q4 earnings through a mix of operating cash flow, share offerings, and $100 million in convertible notes, Semler had amassed 3,192 BTC , which continues to stand true today. What was a diagnostics business now carries a substantial crypto position and is the 10th largest non-government Bitcoin Treasury in the world. The Logic Behind the Bitcoin Pivot By listening to earnings calls and management interviews, you can quickly see that shifting to a Bitcoin treasury strategy wasn’t a publicity move. Semler’s management does actually believe that Bitcoin’s scarcity, inflation resistance, and long-term growth potential could outpace what the company would earn from idle cash in bank accounts. With $24.4 million in free cash flow in 2024 and a CAPEX-light business model, Semler had and will have more than enough cash to make a large, meaningful investment. And if you are orange-pilled into believing that Bitcoin is the best asset in the world (let's not open this discussion today), of course, you will take all your existing cash and upcoming cash flows and throw them into BTC. You will even borrow to buy BTC, and that's exactly what Semler has done. The Saylor Connection At this point, I should mention that leading the charge in Semler is CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian, who has openly admired Michael Saylor’s approach. His social media activity features retweets of Saylor’s Bitcoin commentary and photos of each other in Bitcoin-related events. No wonder Semler’s Bitcoin strategy closely mirrors MicroStrategy’s. Beyond the initial $40 million buy, Semler tapped several funding avenues (including an ATM share offering that raised $119.6 million) to keep adding BTC. By early 2025, the company had spent $280.4 million on Bitcoin, replicating Saylor's moves (apart from the preferred stock offering ( STRK ), for which Semler is likely yet too small to pursue). Semler even adopted the controversial-for-Wall-Street “BTC Yield” metric, celebrating a 152.2% return on its BTC investment since July 2024 and totally embracing Saylor’s gold standard for quantifying performance in crypto-centric terms. Tallying the Numbers: $258 Million in BTC, $60 Million for Everything Else Today, Bitcoin hovers around $84,500 per coin. With 3,192 BTC, Semler’s holdings stand at roughly $270 million. Add $15 million in net cash, and the total liquid assets come to around $285 million. Meanwhile, SMLR is trading at $38.84, giving the company a market capitalization of about $372 million. Subtract the $285 million in BTC and net cash, and you’re left with $87 million for the entire medical tech business. That’s the part raising my eyebrows. This same division produced $24.4 million in free cash flow last year, implying a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of around 3.6. For a company with a proven product and consistent customer demand, 3.6 times FCF is a ridiculously cheap multiple by almost any industry standard. One could argue that the healthcare arm's revenue declined 17% last year to $56.3 million. Nevertheless, Semler still managed $20.9 million in operating income. Even factoring out crypto gains, the diagnostics side remains highly profitable. A typical firm with stable free cash flow might trade at 10 to 15 times FCF, especially in med-tech, where specialized solutions tend to carve out loyal client bases. Yet we see here Mr. Market slapping a steep discount on a company that might otherwise attract a higher multiple because ""Bitcoin?"". Key Risks Now, I do believe Semler offers a strong ""arbitrage"" opportunity. But also, I have to mention a couple of noteworthy risks attached to Semler's investment case, which is none other than the underlying volatility. Bitcoin maxis embrace it, but traditional investors hate it. Even with Semler’s dependable cash flow from diagnostics, sudden drops in BTC’s price will overshadow the med-tech success and shake investor confidence. This is especially the case if ATM share issuance finances BTC purchases, meaning that they hurt shareholders if the price of BTC falls below the purchasing price. We have seen this play out, and it has certainly played a role in the company's discounted valuation. Then, as I mentioned, Semler financed part of its Bitcoin purchases with $100 million in convertible notes. If these convert to equity, current shareholders could face dilution. Still, note that it should still be accretive to BTC/share deep in the money. Furthermore, this factor complicates the free cash flow multiple calculations since future share count changes could influence how investors perceive the company’s valuation. But once again, this point is countered by the fact that the company has a net cash position even after the convertible. But other than that, most risks have already been stripped away. Given the current administration's stance on BTC, including the fact that they essentially recognize it as the only truly decentralized crypto and that the President himself has urged to ""never sell"" it, confidence in its regulatory status has solidified. On top of that, with the U.S. government confirming i t will not sell Bitcoin held in its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, treating it as a permanent store of value, the legal and regulatory outlook for Bitcoin is becoming more favorable than many BTC bulls might have anticipated. And don't forget that BTC is classified as a commodity, not a security. This means there are no restrictions on how much can be held, even by publicly traded companies. Final Thoughts Sometimes, investment ideas don't have to be complex. I think this one is pretty straightforward. At a market cap of around $372 million, against $270 million in BTC and $15 million in cash, the market is attributing a mere $87 million to a healthcare business that produced $24.4 million in free cash flow last year. Semler could donate all of its Bitcoin away I bet you the market would still value the core business at around $200 million just to assign it a fair FCF multiple. The current valuation, therefore, likely presents a unique opportunity, in my view.",SMLR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-20 13:16:49

Now, there's some good news that could set Solana off to a brilliant rally, but traders are treading carefully. Cardano is also getting bullish nods from traders across the crypto market. Social sentiments are increasingly positive on Cardano, and the token could be off to a rally soon. Even as Solana gets a boost from the latest crypto news, the new Remittix token is plotting a takeover in the DeFi space. Already, traders prefer its PayFi use cases to the ones on Ripple and the Remittix presale is raking in the numbers. We have more information on the Remittix token here. Solana Price Keeps Bobbing on the Weekly Charts The past week saw SOL rise to a peak at about $136, owing largely to a return of traders to the Solana ecosystem. News of the LIBRA rug pull in February cost Solana significantly in terms of trading activity, leading to a price crash that saw it trade at as low as $114. The past week's price spark eventually corrected to even $122 in a mix of regular market correction and bearish strongholds. A poor Solana marketing campaign went wrong, causing the bears to take over briefly on Tuesday, but the Solana price seems to have stabilized now. The token is trading at about $126.02, with some 1.7% profits on the weekly charts. It's slow progress on Solana, but progress nonetheless, as the SOL ecosystem readies for a price rally. More Bullish News For Solana and Cardano! While the past week has had its ups and downs, the future of Solana could be set for more ups than downs. The project celebrates five years of consistent building on March 16, leading to its all-time high of $293 in January 2025. Also, even more positive indicators have come to light about the Solana ETFs. SOL Futures are live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a move that most experts consider to be significant progress in the appeal for Solana ETFs. Cardano is also preparing for a bullish rally. The latest news in the crypto market shows that social sentiments around the Cardano price are getting bullish , averaging 3.5 positive comments on social media. The sentiments have been at their highest proportion since November, and it could be down to the recent addition of the crypto strategic stockpile in the US. Speculations are that ADA is used in government-backed blockchain operations and traders are anticipating favourable times ahead for the Cardano price. Somewhere else in the crypto-verse, the Remittix (RTX) tokens are cooking at the moment. The ongoing presale is evidence of general adoption across the crypto market.

After the SEC decided to drop its case against Ripple, the blockchain company will have the opportunity to renegotiate the $125-million judgment against it, said Deaton. “Everything’s turned,” since the election of Donald Trump, said Deaton. “The election’s turned, the industry turned, the SEC [has] completely done a 180 as it relates to the industry. Why should we pay $125 million?” Earlier in the day, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the regulator’s XRP reversal a “victory for the industry and the beginning of a new chapter.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-20 13:23:28

This move comes amid a global shift in attitudes towards bitcoin and crypto after the United States pushed for greater mainstream acceptance. The new stance is a stark change for Pakistan, which had previously banned crypto. By embracing bitcoin and crypto early, Pakistan is looking to position itself as a regional leader and attract investors. Pakistan’s central bank had expressed concerns earlier. However, the government now seeks to mitigate risks through prudent legislation . Clear rules could boost innovation and prevent potential abuse of decentralised networks.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that 193 BTC, valued at $16 million, were funneled through the Wasabi mixer before being distributed across various P2P networks. Hackers Convert Stolen Ether to Bitcoin Following the February 2025 Bybit hack, hackers exchanged 86 of the stolen funds for ether to Bitcoin. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said that the amount of 440,091 ETH, equivalent approximately to $1.23 billion, was swapped for 12,836 BTC. The received Bitcoin was then divided into 9,117 wallets, with an average balance per wallet of 1.41 BTC. Cross-chain liquidity protocols such as THORChain have been identified as the principal means through which the conversion occurred. This method enables users to interchange assets between different blockchains without dealing with centralized exchanges. Use of Mixers to Obscure Fund Movements Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said that while the hackers are suspected to be from the North Korean Lazarus Group, they have been trying to wash the stolen Bitcoin through several mixers. Some of the presently available mixers are Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun, and Tornado Cash. The main purpose of using a mixer is to hide the history of the transactions to ensure that the traces cannot be followed. “Decoding mixer transactions is the problem which is on the top of the list,” said Bybit CEO Ben Zhou for X. He further noted that the laundering activity will continue to rise with more funds being channeled through these services. Wasabi is a Bitcoin mixing service that introduced the CoinJoin technique which unites several transactions into one to increase anonymity. This way, blockchain investigators are unable to easily trace movements of funds by an individual. Bybit Hack Stolen Funds Moving to Peer-to-Peer Vendors After passing through mixers, the stolen Bitcoin is being sent to P2P vendors. These vendors facilitate direct transactions between individuals without requiring intermediaries. Since P2P trading often bypasses centralized oversight, it adds another layer of complexity to tracking and recovering stolen assets. According to Bybit , 88.8% of the stolen funds remain traceable, while 7.6% have become untraceable due to laundering efforts. Additionally, 3.5% of the funds have been successfully frozen through cooperation with industry partners. Bounty Program to Track Stolen Assets Post the Bybit hack, the exchange launched a bounty program to incentivize individuals and organizations to help trace and freeze the stolen funds. The program has allocated a total of $140 million in rewards, with $2.2 million already awarded. The bounty is structured to provide 10% of any recovered funds, with half going to the entity that successfully freezes them and the other half to the first reporters who contribute to the freezing process. In the past 30 days, Bybit received 5,012 bounty reports, of which 63 were deemed valid. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou emphasized the need for more experts who can analyze mixer transactions and track stolen funds. Data from Arkham Intelligence suggests that the Lazarus Group currently holds 13,400 BTC, much of which is linked to the Bybit hack. Investigators continue monitoring these assets while working with exchanges and blockchain analytics firms to prevent further laundering.

This week, the Nillion (NIL) token is under attention, as it received the Binance listing and airdrop allocation, exciting investors. How to participate? Let’s discuss this. Binance Launchpool Project News & Nillion Airdrop Details According to the official announcement, Nillion (NIL) is Binance’s 65th Launchpool project. NIL is a newly launched cryptocurrency token of the popular decentralized that uses blind computing to bring secure data processing and storage while preserving privacy. It is making its debut with a popular crypto exchange listing. With the notification, the demand and hype are building among investors. Interestingly, this listing also includes a significant Nillion airdrop, where Launchpool investors can earn significant NIL tokens. According to the Binance announcement , it will officially list NIL on 2025-03-24 at 08:00 A.M. (EST) with trading pairs like NIL/USDT, NIL/BNB, NIL/FDUSD, NIL/USDC, and NIL/TRY. More importantly, the webpage will go live 12 hours before the Launchpool starts. However, as this is a new project, it will come with a seed tag. Additional details to the project reveal that NIL will be launched with a token supply of 1,000,000,000, and the initial circulation supply will be 195,150,000 NIL (19.52% of the total token supply). How to Participate & Receive Nillion Airdrop? The Binance launchpool players can participate in the airdrop, where the Launchpool reward is 35,000,000 NIL (3.5% of the total supply). In addition, the official airdrop launcher is live, where the community allocation is 20%. Out of this, 7.5% is for the current participants, and the remaining 12.5% is reserved for the future initiatives. The steps to receive NIL Tokens are: The users need to have a Binance account with completed KYC verification There’s a farming period, so interested users need to participate in the farming, which will run from March 21, 2025, 07:00 P.M. (EST) to March 23, 2025, 06:59 P.M. (EST). Users must select their Launchpool asset from BNB, FDUSD, or USDC to farm NIL tokens.

The listing price of the NIL token is uncertain due to lacking information. However, its takeoff with the Binance Launchpool could influence its price right after the launch due to increased investors’ attention and credibility. The Nillion token has a pre-listing price of $0.79, so the launch price may come near this. Investors must await further details on the Nillion airdrop and listing. For now, the Binance listing is just a few days away, and investors can begin farming from March 21, 2025, to receive the trending crypto airdrop.

PEPE Millionaire Says This Underrated AI Coin Might Be the Next Big Thing",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/500-to-75000-pepe-millionaire-says-this-underrated-ai-coin-might-be-the-next-big-thing,"An investor who invested $500 in PEPE achieved fame by transforming it into $75,000. The infamous PEPE millionaire claims that one underrated AI coin could be the next big breakout. IntelMarkets (INTL) received much attention from investors because they recognized its great potential. The platform has received much praise, due to their expert team of Open AI, MIT and Renaissance Technologies engineers. During its presale, IntelMarkets succeeded in raising more than $11.6 million, being one of the most successful presales of the year. With tokens priced at $0.09, over 150,000 investors have joined the presale for massive returns. Explosive Growth Potential and Presale Success During its current presale stage, INTL tokens are priced at $0.09 per token. The PEPE millionaire claimed that post-launch, INTL tokens could rally 150x. Similar to PEPE in its early days, savvy investors recognize the potential of the IntelMarkets AI platform. This makes INTL tokens a highly attractive investment opportunity due to the low market cap. The lack of a bull run history, coupled with technological integration between blockchain technology and DeFi with AI positions IntelMarkets as one of the highest potential coins on the market. Why IntelMarkets (INTL) Is the Smart Investor’s Choice PEPE brought big gains to its initial investors, and one millionaire claimed that IntelMarkets is the next breakout. IntelMarkets (INTL) is an AI-operated cryptocurrency solution which transforms the way traders interact with the market. Many investors praise the platform, because it allows users to maximize their profitability. IntelMarkets operates as the next-generation AI trading system which provides retail investors sophisticated quantitative analytics while deploying autonomous trading algorithms. Self-learning AI trading bots on the platform constantly adapt to market movements because they surpass typical trading algorithms in efficiency. The dual-chain architecture at IntelMarkets combines operation on Solana and Ethereum platforms to provide users advantages from both blockchain networks. PEPE: From a Viral Sensation to a Reality Check PEPE, the memecoin based on the viral “Frog” meme launched in the early months of 2023. It was an immediate hit, and many early backers made millions from its debut. In December 2024, the memecoin reached its maximum value of $0.00002825. This means that if you invested even $1 in PEPE on launch, that would be worth $2.8 million today. Following its highest point the token entered a massive downward trend that caused substantial price reductions. At the time of writing, PEPE had reached $0.0000072, with its price plummeting by 75% from its ATH levels. Because it has lost the majority of its appeal and room for growth, many investors have chosen to pivot to IntelMarkets’ AI coin for similar gains. Conclusion: The Time to Invest Is Now Users who purchased PEPE at its beginning were lucky, but established coins face challenges in replicating the same kind of growth. IntelMarkets (INTL) introduces investors to access forefront AI technology through a new investment opportunity space. The PEPE millionaire revealed that he already has bought a significant stake in the INTL presale. Led by a team of leading experts, IntelMarkets offers investors a promising AI-driven ecosystem and has both growing presale demand and a predicted 150x price increase making it one of the most exciting crypto opportunities for 2025.

This gives Kraken direct access to regulated U.S. futures markets through NinjaTrader’s status as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). Kraken was founded in 2011 and it operates under Payward Inc. and owns Crypto Facilities and CF Benchmarks. Meanwhile, NinjaTrader was founded in 2003, and it allegedly serves 1.8 million customers and specializes in futures trading tools with a registration as an FCM. With the new acquisition, Kraken will reportedly be stepping into new markets, like the UK, continental Europe, and even Australia. The company is also working toward becoming a one-stop trading platform for both crypto and traditional assets, per the report. Even when Kraken owns NinjaTrader, the company will continue to operate as an independent platform. That means users won’t see major changes right away. The transition is expected to be gradual, with Kraken focusing on expanding NinjaTrader internationally. This acquisition comes at a time when crypto companies are pushing forward under President Donald Trump’s administration. The SEC recently dropped its lawsuit against Kraken last month, which accused the exchange of acting as an unregistered stock exchange. Trump has positioned himself as pro-crypto, calling himself the “first crypto president.” His administration has been working to reduce restrictions on digital assets, creating an environment where companies like Kraken can expand aggressively. Kraken prepares for IPO in 2026 While Kraken is growing its business, it’s also preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, according to Bloomberg. The listing is expected to happen in the first quarter, making Kraken one of the few crypto firms to enter the public market. The company has not confirmed a specific timeline, but in response to Bloomberg, it said it was closely watching the market. “We recently disclosed 2024 financial highlights to be more transparent about our business,” Kraken said. “We’ll pursue public markets as it makes sense for our clients, our partners, and shareholders.” Financially, Kraken is growing fast. In 2024, its revenue doubled to $1.5 billion, with $380 million in adjusted earnings. That puts it behind Coinbase, which reported over $6 billion in revenue last year. Trump administration continues to develop the crypto landscape As Kraken moves forward, the White House is taking steps of its own. Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Small Business Administration head Kelly Loeffler attended the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit. The event focused on government strategy for digital assets. Trump celebrated the event on X, writing, “Welcome to the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit. Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world, AND WE’RE TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE.” A day before the summit, Trump signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto czar David Sacks explained the plan on X, saying the reserve will be funded by Bitcoin seized by the federal government through civil and criminal asset forfeiture cases. “The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, meaning it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks wrote. “It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 Bitcoin, but there has never been a full audit. The E.O. orders a complete accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The US financial regulator has apparently dropped an appeal against Ripple, the issuing firm of crypto asset XRP. The industry saw the case as a prime example of regulatory overreach by the SEC under former chair Gary Gensler. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the decision “provides a lot of certainty for RIpple” and that while the case is effectively over, there are still some loose ends the firm needs to tie up with the SEC. “We now are in the driver’s seat to determine how we want to proceed.” Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, wrote on X, “Today, Ripple moves forward — stronger than ever. This landmark case set a precedent for the domestic crypto industry.” Ripple and the crypto industry as a whole are counting this as a major victory, but the SEC’s decision provides no legal precedent, and the “guardrails” the industry has lobbied for are yet to be defined. Consequences of Ripple case on lawmaking and precedent The cryptocurrency lobby was quick to celebrate the SEC decision, announced by Garlinghouse at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 19. Markets took notice — XRP price spiked 9% in the first hour following the announcement. Supporters and observers posted on X about the precedent the case would set for the crypto industry. But legal observers are less certain about the overall impact the SEC’s appeal decision will have on the broader crypto industry. Lawyer Aaron Brogan told Cointelegraph that the Ripple case “creates no precedent that any other firm can rely on.” He added there is “no question that the regulatory environment is more favorable to crypto firms today,” but the SEC’s exact policy won’t become clear until Paul Atkins is nominated as chair of the commission. Related: Crypto regulation must go through Congress for lasting change — Wiley Nickel Brian Grace, general counsel at the Metaplex Decentralized Autonomous Organization, further noted that the 2023 decision to which the SEC was appealing does not set a legal precedent. He wrote on March 19, “The Ripple decision is not binding legal precedent. It was a single district court judge’s ruling based on the facts of that case.” The SEC appeal repeal also has limited influence on the ongoing legislative efforts to create a framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the US. Grace said that the onus is on Congress, not the SEC, to make lasting legal changes for the cryptocurrency industry. “The U.S. crypto industry needs new legislation to provide clarity and protection. Without it, the Plaintiffs bar can continue to sue in district courts across the country relying on Howey. A friendly SEC also does not change this. We need a crypto market structure law,” he said . Brogan said that he didn’t think the decision would have any direct effect on the lawmaking process, but the SEC could still solve questions regarding rulemaking. “I think many in Congress would welcome that as the market structure legislation currently percolating appears dead in the water,” he said. Garlinghouse wants to tie up loose ends with SEC The SEC appeal decision may put the “final exclamation point” on whether XRP is a security, but the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC could be set to rage on. In a March 19 Bloomberg interview, Garlinghouse brought up the possibility of going on the offensive with a cross-appeal, i.e. an appeal from an appellee requesting that a higher court review a lower court’s decision. Related: Bitnomial drops SEC lawsuit ahead of XRP futures launch in the US Namely, Garlinghouse wants to revisit the 2023 decision in which Judge Analisa Torres, while ruling Ripple’s publicly sold tokens did not constitute a security, levied a $125 million fine on Ripple , stating that the tokens should have been sold to institutional investors. The firm is also subject to a five-year “bad actor” prohibition on fundraising which, says Brogan, could meaningfully impact its operations. “At this point, all we’re fighting for is do we want to fight to get the $125 million back,” said Garlinghouse. He added that while the XRP-securities decision was a “clear legal victory,” there are “pieces of it that we think could be kind of cleaned up. And the question is, do we want to fight that fight? Or can we come to an agreement with the SEC to drop everything?” Outside of the courtroom, Congress is still working to make meaningful progress on the stablecoin bill. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, expects the final version to be ready in a couple of months. The crypto framework bill FIT 21 failed to make it through the Senate in the 2024 legislative session, but some lawmakers are optimistic that it will make it through this session with “modest changes.” The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobby group, expects both laws to pass by August, while US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, says they could be finalized by year’s end.

The Shocking Prediction You Can’t Ignore,https://coingape.com/markets/is-cardano-price-about-to-skyrocket-the-shocking-prediction-you-cant-ignore/,"Cardano price has sold off and moved into a bear market after soaring to a multi-year high in December last year. ADA has plunged by over 45%, and sentiment among market participants has worsened after it formed a death cross. Nonetheless, one crypto analyst believes that Cardano may soon skyrocket by about 264%. Crypto Analyst Believes Cardano Price May Surge Trend following or following the crowd is one of the most popular approaches in crypto analysis. In most cases, going against the crowd and embracing a contrarian approach is usually for the brave. Javon Marks, a popular crypto analyst on X with over 53k followers, has taken the contrarian view on Cardano price and predicted that it will surge by 264%. He believes that the ADA price will surge to as high as $7.8 in the long term. Such a move would signal a surge of 975% from the current level. As shown below, he used a five-day chart and noted that the Cardano price has formed a series of higher highs, and higher lows since 2023. As such, he believes that the coin will surge if Cardano repeats its previous cycles. Cardano Price Forecast Marks’ ADA price forecast needs a caveat, though: it is based on a five-day chart, which can be lagging since each bar represents 5 days. As such, it can take many months or even years for the prediction to happen. For example, the coin formed a falling wedge pattern for a whole year in 2024 before breaking out. ADA Price Mid-Term Forecast In the short term, Cardano price will depend on the overall movement in the crypto market. Cardano also has more catalysts like a spot ADA ETF approval , a broader crypto market rally, and the upcoming BitcoinOS integration. The weekly chart shows that the ADA price has remained in a tight range in the past few months. It has remained below the important support at $0.80, the highest swing in March 2024. This price was also the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, a popular continuation. The most bullish Cardano coin forecast is its Elliot Wave pattern . It is now in the second phase of this pattern, which is characterized by a pullback. The next phase, the third one, is usually the longest and is characterized by a huge uptick. Cardano Price Chart ADA Target Prices In this case, the most likely scenario is where it surges to $2, which coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. This target is about 180% above the current level. In the long term, Cardano price will rise and retest the all-time high at $3.1, up by 335% from the current price. The bullish ADA price forecast will be invalidated if it invalidates the Elliot Wave pattern by moving below the lower side at $0.512. The post Is Cardano Price About to Skyrocket?

TEEs protect sensitive computations from tampering or unauthorized access through an isolated, cryptographic electronic structure. They are a giant leap in the direction of privacy, authenticity, and system integrity. The two key features of TEEs are confidentiality and attestation. A TEE prevents external entities from viewing data inside it by leveraging encrypted memory, hardware-based isolation, and remote attestation. It operates as a segregated environment within a processor, where neither hypervisors nor malicious insiders can access its contents. Remote attestation is a cryptographic process that enables external verification and confirmation that the code the TEE is running is legitimate and unmodified. The hardware generates a hash (cryptographic measurement) of the environment state and code when a program is loaded into the TEE. It is then signed using a private key embedded in the hardware. A remote verifier receives the signed measurement and uses the manufacturer’s public key to compare it to known valid values. Upon successful verification, the remote party can trust that the TEE hasn’t been tampered with and is executing authentic code. Some TEEs use so-called Roots of Trust, which allow the connected service within which they’re attempting to enroll to verify the legitimacy of a device. How TEEs work To support a TEE, a device must define a security perimeter (Trusted Area) separated from the main OS and applications by hardware, in which only trusted code is executed. All code executed within a TEE is properly authorized, with each stage of execution verified by previously authorized code, starting from the ROM (Read-Only Memory) boot process. Code and data inside a TEE cannot be modified or accessed externally because ROM code is set during the design stage and cannot be changed thereafter. TEEs can use multi-signature (multisig) models to enhance security in asset custody and transactions, as these models ensure redundancy and prevent single points of failure. Traditionally, the simplest multisig arrangement that addresses both loss and theft of private keys is 2-of-3, which is also the most common quorum for safekeeping Bitcoin in cold storage. Another popular arrangement is 3-of-5, but it introduces more complexity than needed in most cases. Real-world applications and risk mitigation TEEs securely store private keys for cross-chain execution and allow decentralized apps to manage assets across multiple chains. In healthcare, blockchains can leverage TEEs to process sensitive patient data safely and compliantly. Handling electronic health records on-chain is an example. TEEs can also replace cross-chain bridges, which are inextricably linked to risks of hacking and smart contract vulnerabilities. Risks of cross-chain bridges also include high fees and transaction delays, especially during high demand, and reliance on third-party validators, which can be points of failure. Bridges are exposed to a higher risk of attacks because their functionality relies on data collaboration both on- and off-chain. Attacks on cross-chain bridges have incurred losses of almost $4.3 billion between June 2021 and September 2024. Decentralization, trustlessness, and full-chain abstraction Flare , a full-stack L1 solution for data-intensive use cases, provides a secure and efficient approach to cross-chain transaction execution via TEE integration. Its Protocol Managed Wallets (PMWs) allow protocols to execute transactions directly across blockchains while preserving trustlessness, decentralization, and freedom from censorship. Flare ensures security because the PMWs are not based on a single TEE. If they were, there would be two significant risks: a lack of redundancy and unknown exploits the manufacturer has embedded within the TEE. The lack of redundancy would become problematic if the TEE were to become non-operational due to a power outage. Alternatively, an exploit of the TEE might compromise a private key, leading to a loss of funds. Flare’s PMW system mitigates both risks because multiple TEEs are involved in its multisig scheme, under which a transaction on an address the PMW controls is only possible with the agreement of a quorum of distinct, globally distributed execution environments. The addition of PMWs does away with the need to interact with other blockchains when building applications. Users interact with one protocol on Flare, and that protocol executes across linked blockchains, manifesting a leap into full-chain abstraction. TEEs also augment DeFi security by isolating liquidation calculations, lending, staking, transaction matching, and other sensitive computations. Privacy-preserving DEXs can leverage them to protect user details. One of Flare’s many additional use cases is FAssets V2 , which makes it possible to leverage XRP, BTC, and DOGE in DeFi on the platform, secured by Flare’s consensus. TEEs’ ability to process and validate multichain data securely without exposing transaction details or private keys allows lending and staking protocols to trust that account states, liquidity data and cross-chain price feeds are accurate. In addition, they enable lending protocols to accept collateral from one blockchain and provide yield rewards or loans on another. The attestation-based trust model verifies the identity of the application running inside the TEE, its integrity (ensuring it has not been tampered with), and confirmation that it is executing within a genuine, secure enclave. TEEs enhance trust and security in decentralized systems by enabling secure multiparty computation for decentralized key management, verifiable and trust-minimized oracles for smart contracts, and trust-minimized cross-chain bridges that reduce reliance on centralized entities. Promising applications in cloud computing and smart contracts TEEs can be used to process AI models and data securely, ensuring integrity and privacy within blockchain-based federated learning systems. Applying them to cloud environments transforms the trust model in that clients don’t need to rely on the cloud provider’s reputation anymore. The TEE makes executing arbitrary code in isolation from the hypervisor and the underlying OS possible. TEEs provide a trust layer for Web3, ensuring privacy-preserving smart contracts and secure off-chain execution. TEE-based smart contracts are very well-equipped to protect transaction data and guarantee fully confidential DeFi operations. They benefit Web3 developers by allowing for the private, trustless execution of AI applications and potentially AI-driven smart contracts. AI can operate transparently and autonomously in the new realm TEEs have unlocked, setting the stage for genuinely autonomous AI systems that can maintain cryptographic proof of their independence while meaningfully engaging in computational and economic networks.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 13:36:05

Volatility Shares is launching two Solana ( SOL ) futures ETFs, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), on March 20. The debut of the first Solana futures ETF may bring significant new institutional adoption for the SOL token, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. Volatility Shares Solana ETF SEC filing. Source: SEC The analyst told Cointelegraph: “The launch of the first Solana ETFs in the US could significantly boost Solana’s market position by increasing demand and liquidity for SOL, potentially narrowing the gap with Ethereum’s market cap.” The Solana ETF will grow institutional adoption by “offering a regulated investment vehicle, attracting billions in capital and reinforcing Solana’s competitiveness against Ethereum,” said Lee, adding that “Ethereum’s entrenched ecosystem remains a formidable barrier.” Still, other industry participants are concerned that the Solana futures ETF will lead to investor disappointment due to a lack of inflows, as we’ve seen with the spot Ether ETF launch, which was only a “sidekick” to Bitcoin ETFs in terms of inflows, as predicted by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. Related: Bitcoin beats global assets post-Trump election, despite BTC correction Solana futures ETF may see disappointing inflows, but spot Solana ETFs may be next While the futures ETF may not bring significant inflows, it legitimizes Solana’s status as a top cryptocurrency, especially after US President Donald Trump announced that his Working Group on Digital Assets would include Solana in the US crypto strategic reserve, along with Cardano’s ( ADA ) token and XRP ( XRP ). “Solana ETFs are in motion creating the possible avenues for more wide-scale adoption,” according to Anmol Singh, co-founder of Bullet, a Solana-native perpetual futures decentralized exchange. Singh told Cointelegraph: “Solana spot ETF is yet to be approved but given the increased awareness around Solana and the Futures ETFs this would be a logical next step.” “We can expect moderate inflows into the futures ETF - spot ETF is generally a better instrument for getting exposure and that will be the major milestone,” he added.

SOL and XRP ETPs could attract $3–8 billion. Source: JP Morgan “When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion-$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion-$8 billion in net new assets,” the report stated. However, “the timeline could extend into 2026 due to the SEC’s precedent of taking 240–260 days to review filings,” James Seyffart, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said on Jan. 16.

Today, March 20, 2025, the meme coin has registered a price surge of 2%, indicating it is on the verge of a significant upside rally. Current Price Momentum DOGE is currently trading near $0.172, and with its bullish price action, it has attracted significant attention from traders and investors, resulting in a 45% jump in trading volume. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bullish as it has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame, with a neckline at the $0.178 level. Based on historical price momentum, if the meme coin breaches this level and closes a four-hour candle above $0.18, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach $0.205 in the coming days. Conversely, if the meme coin fails to break this level, it could decline to $0.165 in the future. Source: Trading View Traders’ Bullish View on DOGE With the positive price action, intraday traders also seem bullish on DOGE, as they have been betting on the long side, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.168 on the lower side, where they have built $16.20 million worth of long positions, while $0.175 is another over-leveraged level with $5.30 million worth of short positions. Source: Coinglass These over-leveraged levels and traders’ bets clearly indicate that bulls are currently dominating and could push the meme coin to breach the current resistance level. Besides all this, the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment today is bullish, as top assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, have registered impressive gains.",Price Analysis|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-20 13:49:31

Strategy’s issuance of preferred shares (STRK and STRF) strengthens my thesis that it channels BTC through its capital structure, creating BTC-backed securities. MSTR benefits from BTC volatility by monetizing it, increasing BTC per share, and generating a BTC Yield, despite potential risks in a bear market. The company’s strong brand creates the potential for sustainable cash flows, mitigating dividend payment concerns. Dividends obligations on preferred shares are risks. They get very bad if BTC has a long bear market. Time to review developments since I last wrote about Strategy ( MSTR ) . I am still issuing a strong buy rating because my core thesis of Strategy being Bitcoin’s only investment bank is, in my view, only strengthening. I estimate that such an entity would be worth multiple trillions of dollars in market cap, meaning that today’s $80 billion market cap has a 20X in store over the next decade. Here are the updates since early January 2025: Strategy has opened a $21 billion ATM for STRK , the perpetual preferred stock that is convertible to 1/10 share of MSTR common with an 8% dividend on $100 liquidation preference. Strategy has announced Strife (STRF) , a perpetual preferred stock paying 10% on $100 liquidation preference. Strategy has issued $2 billion in 0-coupon convertible bonds due 2030 . This has a lower conversion price than the last one. Strategy tapped the STRK ATM to acquire 130 BTC sometime between 9–15 March. Each of these developments strengthen my core thesis that Strategy has effectively become Bitcoin’s investment bank by channeling BTC through its capital structure to create de facto BTC-backed securities which give investors exposure to BTC in a less volatile and more palatable form. This is the role of an investment bank: to sit in the middle of capital markets underwriting various securities for its clients. In Strategy’s case, the client is the Bitcoin network since almost every dollar raised by Strategy goes directly into buying more BTC and the issued securities only have value to the extent that BTC continues to generate excess returns and volatility. Many people see this as a very dangerous leveraged bet on BTC which will end horribly. While this view makes sense, and there is, in fact, a scenario for this to happen, people are often mistaken in thinking that Strategy can somehow get a margin called if BTC falls in value. A margin call cannot happen because all its debts are unsecured, non-callable, and multi-year durations. The only way Strategy can be “liquidated” is if BTC goes through an unprecedented multi-year bear market (over 3 years or more) which kills all BTC-related investment appetite from the capital markets. This could put Strategy in a position where they must sell BTC at bear market prices to pay back the debt and service dividends on liquidation preference on preferred stock. If this ever happens, then MSTR shareholders will be left with close to 0 equity value. As long as you remember that this is a possible scenario, you can accurately assess your risk tolerance towards MSTR as an investment. With that out of the way, I will now discuss the impact of the developments listed above. There are two big bullish factors and one emerging risk I see. More Capital Preferred stock is the gateway to a lot more capital. Below is a breakdown of global asset classes by total value. Preferred stock, as bond-like instruments, sit in the $300 trillion square that says “Bonds.” STRK and STRF serve a much larger category of investors and investment capital than MSTR common. Global Assets (Strategy) Within this $300 trillion square, some want fixed income with possible upside, which is serviced by STRK, since this is convertible preferred stock. Others want a fixed income without such upside, which can be serviced by STRF: a strict income stream and nothing else. Other investors in the $300 trillion “Bonds” square are interested in volatility arbitrage, which is serviced by convertible bonds. The main point is that as Strategy unveils more offerings with different covenant structures, it will gradually grow its TAM to the whole $300 trillion bond market. To put this into perspective, a mere 1% of this market is roughly twice the market capitalization of BTC and around the entire market capitalization of all crypto assets. And of course, if $3 trillion did enter BTC, it would add a lot more than $3 trillion to the BTC market cap, since price is determined at the margin. More Optionality For MSTR Implied Volatility Generation This next point is very underappreciated, even amongst MSTR and BTC bulls. One of the persistent headwinds of MSTR valuation is the so-called NAV Premium. Many people do not understand why MSTR trades at a sizable premium to its BTC holdings. The simple answer is that MSTR has persistently increased its BTC per share over time. But it takes a lot of financial background knowledge on derivatives markets to understand how this is done and why it is quite sustainable. I have covered this very topic in previous articles like: MicroStrategy: Recent Numbers And Basic Math Show The Tremendous Value In This Company MicroStrategy Could Be A Multi-Trillion Dollar Company The bottom line is that MSTR monetizes the volatility of its own equity and then sweeps its proceeds into BTC. Unlike BTC, which does not benefit from its own volatility, MSTR can benefit from the volatility of BTC. MSTR also dynamically boosts its own volatility over that of BTC’s volatility by borrowing money to buy BTC, thereby gaining leveraged exposure to BTC. This volatility can then be sold in the form of embedded options like STRK and convertible bonds. The proceeds of these volatility sales are then swept into BTC to increase BTC per MSTR share. Strategy calls this generating a “BTC Yield.” In short, MSTR is an operation that creates, packages, and exports BTC volatility to the capital markets and then generates a BTC Yield for shareholders using the proceeds from these sales. Buyers of volatility use it to generate profits via dynamic delta hedging. This is also called gamma scalping, or volatility arbitrage. If volatility is the product, then MSTR IV is really an index of its BTC Yield potential. What is MSTR’s IV composed of? Two things: BTC’s volatility The volatility of the NAV premium multiple If the NAV premium multiple is always 1X (0 volatility), then MSTR would simply move with BTC. This would cause the IV to shrink from the current ~100 IV to BTC’s current ~60 IV. This would be a significant decrease in BTC Yield potential. The problem right now is that MSTR has not fully convinced the market that it should trade meaningfully higher than 1X NAV. After the rally in November 2024, the multiple to NAV has collapsed from over 3X to just over 1.5X. The introduction of the STRK ATM program gives Strategy the option to do ad-hoc buybacks on MSTR, which will have the effect of defending a floor NAV multiple, effectively injecting volatility into the NAV premium multiple and creating more volatility for the common stock. While it is unlikely that Strategy will take this course of action in the near term, it is nevertheless in the toolbox as a way to fix future IV lulls. If the market knows that the preferred stock ATM may be used at any time to boost the NAV premium, then the 1X NAV argument significantly weakens. The uncertainty of how and when Strategy might do buybacks will also add more natural volatility to MSTR. Also, if the STRK ATM is used to push the NAV premium above a floor multiple, the MSTR ATM can be used to push the NAV premium below a ceiling multiple. This allows Strategy to inject volatility into MSTR common while realizing a guaranteed spread from selling MSTR for high while buying it for low (note that high/low prices will technically be in BTC terms because we are talking about multiples of Strategy’s BTC NAV). I think of the STRK ATM as a very convenient line of credit which the company can tap for its own purposes. The Risk That Is Forming “Mo’ money, mo’ problems” – The Notorious B.I.G. More money provides more opportunities. But, as Biggie Smalls has aptly stated, more money can also mean more problems. As Strategy expands to service other corners of the capital markets, the risk is that it gets ahead of itself and obtains too many liabilities to service. The current view of how dividend obligations on STRK will be serviced is that the MSTR ATM can be used to raise the funds. This logic also applies to STRF. There are two issue with this: When the MSTR ATM is used to pay dividends rather than buy BTC, it will generate a negative BTC Yield since share count would have increased but total BTC would not have increased. The cost of capital for dividends at the current STRK price of $84 per share is 9.5% (dividend is $8 per STRK share, since it is 8% on the $100 liquidation preference). This is like borrowing money at 9.5% to buy BTC up front, and then never paying back the loan and keeping the 9.5% annual interest forever. While this is okay if BTC (the thing you spent the money on) increases by more than 9.5% each year, it is very problematic in a bear market. Using the MSTR ATM in a bear market will mean selling shares at lower NAV premiums and lower prices to pay a fixed dollar obligation. Strategy would have to sell a lot more shares just to meet the obligated dividends. The other possibility is to use the STRK ATM (since STRK would not be as exposed to BTC downturns) to pay STRK dividends. But this method will increase the dividend obligation for future years. While this can be used to “wait out” a bear market, it is only compounding problems as time goes on. A more sustainable option might be to issue convertible bonds with lower conversion premiums so that the coupons are negative. This creates fixed positive financing cash flows which can be used to offset the negative financing cash flows from dividends. The bottom line is that no matter how you look at it, the fact that the company does not have cash flows to survive a bear market without selling a bunch of shares or racking up a lot more debt at bad terms is potentially problematic when it has the ability to issue $21 billion in preferred stock at a 9.5% cost of capital. This could very well end up being a case of more money causing more problems, especially if that money is used to buy at the top before a multi-year bear market. Why I Think MSTR Is A Strong Buy Now, the first and main reason I rate MSTR a Strong Buy is because I do not think a multi-year bear market in BTC is going to happen. I am very bullish on BTC, at least until early 2026 and with a base case price target of around $175,000 for the cycle top. I think the bottom of the following bear market could be around $50,000, which would put MSTR in almost zero existential danger. However, everyone needs to make their own estimates of this important risk factor. My second reason is that I believe Strategy will move to create a profitable business unit, which would nullify the concerns that preferred stock dividend payments require annual common stock dilution to service. I have long stated that perhaps the second-biggest asset of MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor is the brand name. MSTR is the most successful and high-profile crypto company ever. When we look at the titans in crypto, we have Binance, Coinbase, and Tether. Only Coinbase ( COIN ) is publicly traded, but its stock has never even broken-even from its IPO. MicroStrategy, now Strategy, is iconic for reasons like this chart below, which is now updated live on the strategy.com website . Returns Since MSTR Adopted BTC Strategy (Aug 2020) ( strategy.com ) When Saylor uses this impressive brand name to create crypto and Bitcoin-aligned products, I have little doubt that the reception will be quite positive and the returns quite good. Strategy is basically sitting on a gigantic reservoir of intangible assets (reputation, brand, credibility, attention, followership) which it has not yet monetized because it has been so focused on acquiring BTC and issuing various tranches of securities. Easy example. Let’s say Strategy creates an ETF product with capped BTC upside and downside. Something simple like a 50% IEF, 25% TLT, and 25% IBIT can do the trick. The company already raises billions of dollars at a time, so marketing a Bitcoin-related ETF done through a turnkey ETF provider will be a lot more straightforward than if someone brand new stepped into this space. Strategy already has all the relationships and credibility. Saylor has 4.2 million followers on Twitter , many of whom would likely invest in an ETF if he was behind it. Running such an ETF would be a fee business, meaning MSTR shareholders would not be exposed to the price risk BTC in this specific business unit. Strategy would get cash flows from AUM and there is a point where the AUM is big enough to pay off dividends. This is just one example. The point is that Strategy has yet to monetize its brand or its massive, unencumbered BTC holdings. Once it does, the dividends become a much smaller problem. Conclusion I continue to buy more MSTR and BTC. I think the future is bright, even though the risks may be marginally higher than they were before. It all depends on whether BTC will have an unprecedented bear market and on whether Strategy can develop cash flows. The execution of the capital raising plans has gone extremely well and it is evolving into the Bitcoin investment bank which I predicted months ago.",STRK|BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-20 13:53:52

One of these was Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank closed the door to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency purchases. Speaking to Bloomberg, the head of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), Martin Schlegel, said the bank has no plans to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Citing high volatility, instability and regulatory concerns, Schlegel stressed that the SNB's foreign exchange reserves should only support monetary policy. Schlegel said the SNB's foreign exchange reserves serve only the purpose of facilitating monetary policy: “We have no plans to buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies do not meet the criteria of being useful for the monetary policies of countries and preserving value. And as you know, there are big fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies, which does not give certainty about its value. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are fundamentally software and therefore prone to errors.” The SNB is facing an initiative that would force it to accept Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into its reserves, even though it has not agreed to do so. Switzerland would also be required to regulate the purchase of BTC and cryptocurrencies if crypto advocates manage to collect 100,000 signatures by June 2026. *This is not investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1742479202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,$7 Billion In Losses Locked In: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Largest Capitulation Of Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/7-billion-losses-bitcoin-short-term-holders-largest/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holders have recently participated in the largest loss-taking event of the current cycle. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Loss Has Hit High Levels Recently In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the situation of the Bitcoin short-term holders has changed following the market downturn. The “ short-term holders ” (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This cohort includes the new entrants into the market, who don’t tend to be too resolute. As such, it’s not uncommon to see the group participating in a panic selloff, whenever some kind of volatility emerges in the market. The recent price decline has been one such moment. First, here is a chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the Relative Unrealized Loss of the STHs has developed during this event: The “Relative Unrealized Loss” measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss that the STHs are holding onto. The ‘relative’ in the indicator’s name refers to the fact that this loss has been normalized according to the market cap. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH Relative Unrealized Loss has observed a significant increase recently and has reached the upper threshold for losses recorded in bull markets historically (the red line). Glassnode notes, though, “despite these elevated paper losses, the financial damage carried by new investors remains largely in line with the yen-carry-trade unwind on 5-Aug-2024.” As long as an investor keeps sitting on their loss, it remains unrealized, but once they decide to make a transaction involving the underwater tokens, the loss is said to be ‘realized.’ Given that a portion of the group has been pushed underwater in the latest crash, it would be expected that the fickle-minded members of it would have capitulated at some loss. Here is another chart, this time for the loss that the STHs have actually realized: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day sum of the Bitcoin STH Realized Loss has reached the $7 billion mark recently, which is the highest value witnessed in the current cycle so far. It’s also apparent from the chart, however, that while these losses are sizeable on their own, the same isn’t the case when stacked against the major capitulation events of the previous cycle. In the loss-taking event that followed the May 2021 selloff, the indicator’s value reached $19.8 billion. Similarly, it reached a high of $20.7 billion during the 2022 bear market. Both of these are clearly much larger in scale than the latest capitulation. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $85,000, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Realized Loss|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-20 14:00:02

But this isn’t just about expanding satellite internet. The deal only happened because Musk secured partnerships with Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal, the two most powerful men in India’s telecom industry. Reliance Jio and Airtel, the companies they control, will now play a direct role in distributing Starlink services across the country. Musk has been pushing for this for years, but things changed after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, D.C., last month. Musk emphasized the importance of global internet access, particularly in India, the world’s most populated country. After that meeting, the Indian government allowed SpaceX to move forward with telecom deals that had previously been stalled. This wasn’t just about internet access. Musk’s growing influence in Washington played a role, as India and the U.S. have been negotiating trade terms, but those talks have gone nowhere. President Donald Trump recently announced new reciprocal tariffs on India, starting April 2, further complicating relations between the two countries. However, the Starlink deal shows that while trade negotiations might be stuck, Musk’s business interests are moving forward. For Musk, the deal solves multiple problems at once. He gets access to a massive, mobile-first market without having to fight against local telecom giants. Instead, Jio and Airtel will handle the rollout, effectively making them partners rather than competitors. Ambani and Mittal, both known for their control over India’s telecom industry, now hold the key to how Starlink expands in the country. India’s telecom giants already had satellite plans There’s a catch. Jio and Airtel weren’t exactly waiting for Starlink to arrive. Reliance Jio already had a joint venture with SES, a satellite operator based in Luxembourg, to bring satellite internet to India. Airtel has a partnership with Eutelsat OneWeb, another satellite broadband provider. Now that Starlink is involved, what happens to those plans? That hasn’t been made clear yet. The advantage of Starlink is its ability to provide high-speed internet to rural and remote areas where traditional telecom infrastructure is weak. Neil Shah from Counterpoint Research explained that the partnership allows Jio and Airtel to reach areas where their networks don’t currently exist. Instead of building expensive new towers, they can sell Starlink’s satellite-based service to local customers. “Starlink should provide a great boost … particularly in rural and remote areas of India, where traditional telecom networks don’t do especially well,” said Pravin Krishna, a professor of international economics at Johns Hopkins University. But the deal also raises concerns. Musk has always been vocal about his long-term plans for satellite communication. If Starlink proves successful in India, will Jio and Airtel continue to push their own satellite projects? Or will they focus on making Starlink the dominant player in the market? The partnerships might work for now, but long-term competition is still a possibility. Regulatory hurdles and pricing problems Even with partnerships in place, Starlink isn’t officially in yet. The company still needs to obtain a communications license from the Indian government. The approval process is ongoing, but Starlink has yet to clear the final regulatory hurdles. If the government delays or imposes additional requirements, Jio and Airtel may have to reconsider their level of commitment to the project. Pricing is another problem. Starlink currently costs $110 per month in the U.S. That’s far more expensive than Jio’s cheapest WiFi package, which costs less than that in an entire year. If Starlink wants to be widely adopted in India, prices will need to drop significantly. “While there is an opportunity to connect a lot of people to the internet, pricing will challenge Starlink’s ability to scale,” said Shah. That’s where government incentives and local subsidies could come into play. If the Indian government supports broadband expansion, lower-income areas might receive financial assistance to make the service more affordable. Musk’s new billionaire allies could also step in to help shape the business model. There’s also the issue of technical limitations. Starlink’s satellite network requires a clear line-of-sight, meaning weather conditions and dense urban environments could cause disruptions. Analysts at Citi believe Starlink will be better suited for rural areas rather than high-density cities, where existing telecom networks already dominate. “We reckon satellite networks would be more suited for servicing remote rural areas where there are coverage gaps rather than high-density urban areas where satellites may not be able to match terrestrial networks in terms of capacity and coverage,” Citi analysts wrote. Investors are paying attention, and Amazon is making moves India’s venture capital market is exploding. Total investments in Indian startups reached $13.7 billion in 2024, a 40% increase from the previous year, according to Bain & Company. The number of deals rose 45% to 1,270, compared to 880 in 2023. The consumer tech sector attracted the most investment, while industries like banking and retail also saw rapid growth. Amazon is also making a big shift in India. The e-commerce giant is reportedly in talks with JPMorgan and Indian investment banks to list its Indian unit. If the listing happens, Amazon will be able to hold inventory in India, instead of just acting as a marketplace for sellers and buyers. This would allow the company to expand its operations and compete more directly with local Indian e-commerce businesses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a recent revelation, the central bank chief Martin Schlegel rejected the idea of Bitcoin reserve, citing market volatility and security threats. Notably, Switzerland’s rejection of a crypto reserve comes amidst US President Donald Trump’s increasing support for the crypto establishment. Let’s unveil the Swiss National Bank’s unique stance on digital assets as global economies vie to establish a crypto reserve. Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserve Plans In a surprising development, the Swiss National Bank Chief Martin Schlegel turned down the notion of a Bitcoin reserve . He cited the cryptocurrency’s volatile nature, security concerns, and regulatory uncertainty as the key reasons for dismissing the proposal. Schlegel stated, “We do not have plans to buy crypto assets.” Further, the Swiss National Bank chief posited that the central bank’s foreign-exchange reserves are solely dedicated to supporting monetary goals. He added that cryptocurrencies do not meet the necessary criteria to serve this purpose. The central bank chief also raised concerns over the cryptocurrencies’ liquidity. Another issue that Schlegel pointed out was their “software-based” nature which makes them vulnerable to technological glitches and errors. He further added, For example, it’s the preservation of value. And as you know, crypto currencies have large fluctuations in value, so this is not a given. Will Switzerland Adopt a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? In December 2024, the Swiss Federal Chancellery launched a proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve after a failed attempt in October 2021. Triggered by Donald Trump’s Bitcoin reserve proposal, the Swiss Federal Chancellery’s proposal gained much attention. Reportedly, the campaigners have already started collecting 100,000 signatures, paving the way for a nationwide referendum on embracing Bitcoin. A successful signature drive would obligate the Swiss National Bank to reevaluate its skeptcals stance on cryptocurrencies. This comes following Pakistan’s renewed approach to cryptocurrencies . Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed that the country it establishing a comprehensive legal framework for cryptocurrencies to foster growth and adoption. Crypto Reserve To Become a Global Vision Countries across the world are vying to embrace crypto reserves. Especially driven by Donald Trump’s crypto policies and his Bitcoin reserve plans, countries like Russia, Brazil, and Poland are analyzing the potential of a Bitcoin reserve. Recently, North Korea has flipped Bhutan and El Salvador in Bitcoin accumulation, becoming the fourth-largest BTC holder. This has sparked speculations of North Korea embracing a Bitcoin reserve .

This marks a pivotal moment in furthering the ZK Stack’s transition to decentralized proof generation. In January 2025 , Lagrange successfully integrated a decentralized version of ZKsync’s ZK Stack prover, demonstrating that proof generation no longer needs to rely on centralized single-entity solutions. This new partnership cements that progress, enabling ZKsync to process more of its proving demand on a decentralized network, something never before achieved at this scale. “Every rollup will be a ZK rollup, and that’s the future of Layer 2 scaling,” said Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, Co-Founder & CEO of Lagrange. “ZK rollups offer unmatched scalability, security, and cost efficiency, making them the inevitable choice for next-generation decentralized applications. With this partnership, ZKsync is enabled to lead the charge, and the Elastic Network will operate at an unprecedented scale without compromising on decentralization.” Lagrange has spent the last year establishing that decentralized proving networks can outperform centralized alternatives. The Lagrange Prover Network (LPN) has already reduced costs, increased throughput, and eliminated reliance on single points of centralized failure. Now, with Matter Labs committing to LPN for up to 75% of its outsourced proofs, the industry has a clear path forward toward a fully decentralized ZK rollup ecosystem. For ZKsync users, this translates into lower gas fees and faster transactions. For businesses, this translates to greater confidence in the performance and liveness of L2s on the Elastic Network. “This collaboration further increases the ability of ZKsync’s Elastic Network to scale, and gives ZKsync builders more options for customization,” said Anthony Rose, CTO of Matter Labs, a contributor to ZKsync. “Decentralized proving increases the resilience of the network, relative to a centralized model, and expands the total available hardware that can be used to generate proofs – which is important as network activity increases. By integrating with Lagrange’s infrastructure, we’re also expanding the flexibility and control available to builders, reinforcing ZK Chains as the most powerful and adaptable scaling solution for the future of web3.” The ZKsync ecosystem boasts nearly 25 ZK stack chains, 300 applications, and 1.3M onchain transactions in the last month alone (source: DappRadar). Lagrange has proven it can operate at a massive scale, unlocking the next phase of ZK rollup evolution. Rollup-as-a-service platforms, including Caldera and AltLaye r, are also benefiting firsthand from Lagrange by relying exclusively on the Lagrange Prover Network for their ecosystems’ proof generation. Key Takeaways: Decentralization – The majority of proof generation for a major rollup will happen entirely via a decentralized network. Lower Costs – Decentralized proving significantly reduces operational expenses, lowering users’ gas fees. Liveness & Security – LPN’s network of independent provers ensures continuous uptime, resilience, and higher security than centralized alternatives. Revenue & Growth – By capturing more of ZKsync’s proving demand, Lagrange unlocks new revenue generation and network expansion opportunities.

Coinbase also requested that traditional securities be allowed to be tokenized. Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, said: After four wasted years in which Congress, the administration and regulators appeared intent on causing confusion, everyone understood the urgency to provide clarity in these markets. What we always want from the institution is the opportunity to be heard and for all stakeholders to participate in the deliberative process on how to regulate these markets and provide clarity to market participants.” Coinbase recently emphasized that with the SEC changing its stance on cryptocurrencies under the Trump administration, clear rules are now needed to support market growth and stability. *This is not investment advice.

This marks a pivotal moment in furthering the ZK Stack’s transition to decentralized proof generation. In January 2025 , Lagrange successfully integrated a decentralized version of ZKsync’s ZK Stack prover, demonstrating that proof generation no longer needs to rely on centralized single-entity solutions. This new partnership cements that progress, enabling ZKsync to process more of its proving demand on a decentralized network, something never before achieved at this scale. “Every rollup will be a ZK rollup, and that’s the future of Layer 2 scaling,” said Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, Co-Founder & CEO of Lagrange. “ZK rollups offer unmatched scalability, security, and cost efficiency, making them the inevitable choice for next-generation decentralized applications. With this partnership, ZKsync is enabled to lead the charge, and the Elastic Network will operate at an unprecedented scale without compromising on decentralization.” Lagrange has spent the last year establishing that decentralized proving networks can outperform centralized alternatives. The Lagrange Prover Network (LPN) has already reduced costs, increased throughput, and eliminated reliance on single points of centralized failure. Now, with Matter Labs committing to LPN for up to 75% of its outsourced proofs, the industry has a clear path forward toward a fully decentralized ZK rollup ecosystem. For ZKsync users, this translates into lower gas fees and faster transactions. For businesses, this translates to greater confidence in the performance and liveness of L2s on the Elastic Network. “This collaboration further increases the ability of ZKsync’s Elastic Network to scale, and gives ZKsync builders more options for customization,” said Anthony Rose, CTO of Matter Labs, a contributor to ZKsync. “Decentralized proving increases the resilience of the network, relative to a centralized model, and expands the total available hardware that can be used to generate proofs – which is important as network activity increases. By integrating with Lagrange’s infrastructure, we’re also expanding the flexibility and control available to builders, reinforcing ZK Chains as the most powerful and adaptable scaling solution for the future of web3.” The ZKsync ecosystem boasts nearly 25 ZK stack chains, 300 applications, and 1.3M onchain transactions in the last month alone (source: DappRadar). Lagrange has proven it can operate at a massive scale, unlocking the next phase of ZK rollup evolution. Rollup-as-a-service platforms, including Caldera and AltLaye r, are also benefiting firsthand from Lagrange by relying exclusively on the Lagrange Prover Network for their ecosystems’ proof generation. Key Takeaways: Decentralization – The majority of proof generation for a major rollup will happen entirely via a decentralized network. Lower Costs – Decentralized proving significantly reduces operational expenses, lowering users’ gas fees. Liveness & Security – LPN’s network of independent provers ensures continuous uptime, resilience, and higher security than centralized alternatives. Revenue & Growth – By capturing more of ZKsync’s proving demand, Lagrange unlocks new revenue generation and network expansion opportunities.

While Ethereum remains a leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract innovation, its pace feels sluggish for investors seeking serious gains. Enter BinoFi, a revolutionary hybrid exchange platform that’s generating buzz for not just rethinking crypto trading but delivering real results. What Makes BinoFi Different? BinoFi combines the strengths of centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into one seamless platform. Instead of having to choose between speed and security, traders on BinoFi get both. It pools liquidity from both CEXs and DEXs to reduce trade slippage and execute orders quickly. Even better, BinoFi supports cross-chain trading without the need for bridges or wrapped tokens, making trading across blockchains faster, easier, and safer. And security? BinoFi takes it to the next level with its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets, giving users complete non-custodial control without the hassle of seed phrases. This ensures their assets are protected while simplifying transactions with gasless options. Add in AI-powered tools for market analytics and automated trading, and you’ve got a platform ready to cater to traders of every skill level. $BINO Presale Taking Off What’s turning heads most is the success of BinoFi’s presale. Over 20 million $BINO tokens have already been sold, proving market confidence is soaring. Early buyers snapped up $BINO at $0.02, anticipating a launch price of $0.30. That’s a potential 15x return on investment (ROI) for the wisest early adopters. Predictions suggest $BINO could trend even higher once the platform’s groundbreaking features go live and adoption gains speed. Why BinoFi is an Investor’s Dream Strong presale performance, innovative technology, and plans to bridge CEX speed with DEX security put BinoFi at the center of crypto’s next big wave. With Ethereum stalling and major investors hungry for the next disruptor, $ BINO offers serious upside. Early buyers are already eyeing ROI growth well beyond 15x, as BinoFi’s features could attract both institutional players and retail traders alike. For anyone who has felt left out by Ethereum’s inefficiencies or disappointed by its slow gains, BinoFi’s hybrid exchange delivers solutions and opportunities. With the crypto world always chasing what’s next, BinoFi isn’t just keeping up—it’s setting the pace. The Bottom Line Ethereum may dominate the crypto conversation, but its 1.5% rise shows it won’t deliver overnight miracles. BinoFi, on the other hand, is rewriting rules. With cutting-edge functionality and a community eager to back its $BINO token, this hybrid platform could be one of 2025’s breakout stars. For investors looking to seize a high-growth opportunity, the time to act is now while $BINO is still in its early stages.

By 6:20 AM, the market had tanked without warning. Then, just as fast, it reversed course and turned green. There were no major headlines to explain the sudden selloff, leaving traders scrambling for answers. These flash crashes are not just limited to stocks. They’ve been hitting crypto, too. On February 25, $300 billion was wiped from the market in 24 hours with no clear trigger. Earlier in the month, Ethereum lost 37% in 60 hours, even though trade war concerns had already been priced in. Hedge funds dump stocks while retail buys the dip One of the few major headlines overnight came from Switzerland, where the Swiss National Bank cut interest rates to their lowest level since September 2022. But this move was widely expected, so it doesn’t explain the sudden collapse in S&P 500 futures. Investor sentiment is at rock bottom. AAII data shows 58.1% of investors are bearish, marking the fourth consecutive week above 55%. At the start of the year, bearish sentiment was below 30%, but now it’s acting like we’re in a major market meltdown. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is only 7% off its all-time high. Hedge funds have abandoned tech stocks. They dumped shares at the fastest pace since January 2021, just weeks after buying them at the fastest pace since the 2022 bear market. Now, they’ve rotated out of U.S. stocks at the fastest pace in history. They’re running toward gold and silver, which have been on a non-stop rally. Retail investors, however, are all in. They don’t see this drop as the start of a crash. They’re pouring money into equities. Retail inflows into Nasdaq 100 stocks just hit 0.1% of market cap, the highest level in a year. JPMorgan’s retail sentiment score hit 4 points, even higher than the meme stock mania peak in 2021. Crypto is seeing the same battle. Ethereum shorts jumped 40% in February and 500% since November, making Wall Street more bearish on Ethereum than ever. But retail investors keep buying, creating a market full of “air pockets” where price movements are violent and unpredictable. Market rebounds after economic data calms recession fears Despite the morning’s chaos, the S&P 500 is currently in the green. The index has surged by 0.5% at press time, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. Tech stocks led the recovery, with Meta jumping 4% and Amazon adding 1%. The Dow Jones rose 217 points. The sudden rebound came after strong economic data. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes in February rose 4.2% from January when analysts expected a 3% drop. Jobless claims barely moved, and layoffs remain historically low. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the economy on Wednesday, saying it remains “strong overall” and that the Fed is in a “good place” to react to any signs of weakness. Powell also said the impact of tariffs on inflation will likely be short-lived. The Fed held interest rates in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% but raised its inflation outlook and lowered its economic growth projection. Despite this, traders don’t expect the Fed to make any major moves soon. Stocks bounced back after the Fed’s announcement. The Dow gained 0.9%, while the S&P 500 rose just over 1%. The Nasdaq surged 1.4%, but it’s still down 11% for the month, officially in a correction. The S&P 500 briefly slipped into correction territory last week, and it remains 7% below its record high. Over the last month, it has fallen nearly 7%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

South Korean multinational electronics tycoon LG is winding down its LG Art Lab platform, a marketplace for non-fungible tokens launched to bring digital art to its premium screens. In a Thursday announcement on its official website, the company said it made the “difficult decision to close the platform” as the NFT space “continues to evolve.” Launched in 2022, Art Lab will officially shut down on June 17. To help users transition, LG outlined two ways for collectors and artists to transfer their assets. “LG Art Lab Team will automatically transfer the assets that are currently in LG Art Lab Marketplace for re-sell to collectors own wallets by April 30,” the company said, adding that users can manually move their artworks or withdraw them from the marketplace. “While this chapter is coming to an end, our passion for digital art and innovation remains strong, and we look forward to seeing how the NFT space continues to grow and evolve.” Art Lab You might also like: Marina Abramović partners with TAEX for new gamified NFT collection Seeking new opportunities While the company didn’t provide specifics on why it was shutting down LG Art Lab, it still hinted at shifting priorities, saying “it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities.” We are live on Ethereum!⛓️ Discover, collect, and display digital masterpieces right from your LG Smart TV First up: @Amadon His work now available on LG Art Lab — LG Art Lab (@LGArtLab) August 20, 2024 Initially available only on the Hedera network, LG Art Lab later migrated to Ethereum, though it remains unclear how much that transition impacted adoption.

In 2023, the company teamed up with metaverse firms Oorbit and Pixelynx to integrate virtual experiences directly into its smart TVs. Oorbit’s technology was described as “the thread that binds virtual worlds together,” allowing LG’s smart TV users to access AI-generated multiplayer games and virtual concerts through cloud streaming.

Despite its impressive infrastructure, its price and ecosystem growth have been underwhelming through the early months of 2025. This gradual recovery has left investors questioning whether Avalanche can regain its edge or if it’s time to explore other, more promising opportunities. BinoFi is a hybrid platform that’s been making waves for all the right reasons. Avalanche's Recovery Fails to Inspire Confidence Throughout the last year, Avalanche has faced a tough market. While it remains a top contender in blockchain technology, its price action tells another story. Investor patience has been tested with slow upward movement and a lack of major ecosystem milestones. The once-vibrant developer activity on the Avalanche network has seen a noticeable lull. Analysts attribute this slowdown to stiff competition and a rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Mark Elliott, a blockchain analyst, explains, “Avalanche’s sluggish price recovery mirrors the ecosystem’s stalled momentum. While it has strong technology, it’s being eclipsed by platforms driving concrete innovation.” Investors, especially those seeking dynamic growth and consistent returns, are starting to look elsewhere. Projects like BinoFi , which combine fast-paced innovation with real-world application, are quickly capturing attention. BinoFi Builds Unstoppable Momentum BinoFi isn’t just another player in the crypto space. It’s a hybrid CEX/DEX trading platform that uniquely blends the strengths of centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). By addressing common industry pain points like liquidity fragmentation and security vulnerabilities, BinoFi is carving a path that sets it apart from its competition. The platform’s Hybrid Liquidity Aggregation ensures traders get the best prices and deepest liquidity across multiple systems without the need for bridges. Meanwhile, Cross-Chain Interoperability allows seamless asset transfers across different blockchain networks, simplifying a historically complex process. BinoFi also prioritizes user security with MPC wallet technology, which offers non-custodial asset protection without compromising usability. This feature is a game-changer for security-conscious investors in 2025’s increasingly regulated ecosystem. The $BINO Token as a Market Outperformer BinoFi’s unique features are matched by the explosive performance of its native token, $BINO. Having already shown remarkable growth since its presale , $BINO has attracted both retail and institutional investors. Analysts predict further upward momentum as the platform continues to execute its roadmap. BinoFi’s 2025 milestones include advanced AI-powered trading tools and expanding partnerships with major blockchain ecosystems. These developments are not just enhancing functionality but are cementing BinoFi’s reputation as a fully realized trading solution. “$BINO’s growth is rooted in fundamentals,” states Leo Carter, a financial analyst. “Unlike speculative coins, its value is tied to an expanding, high-performing platform. That’s why it’s a standout investment opportunity this year.” The Next Big Thing in Crypto Avalanche may still hold promise, but its slow recovery is a stark contrast to the undeniable momentum of BinoFi. With its hybrid model , futuristic features, and community-driven growth, BinoFi is rapidly positioning itself as the next big thing in the crypto universe. For investors, the choice seems increasingly clear. While Avalanche works to reclaim its audience, BinoFi is already redefining how the market operates. If you’re looking for the future of crypto trading, BinoFi is where you want to be. The platform’s incredible early successes suggest this is just the beginning of its rise to dominance. Now is the perfect time to be part of this revolution. With BinoFi setting a new standard in cryptocurrency trading, early adopters stand to benefit the most.

Arctic Pablo Is the Top Crypto Coin with Massive Potential Now,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-binance-coin-wave-arctic-pablo-is-the-top-crypto-coin-with-massive-potential-now/,"Regret is painful—just ask those who ignored Binance Coin (BNB) when it launched at just $0.10. They watched in disbelief as it soared past $600, turning small-time believers into millionaires. The sad truth? When most people realized BNB’s potential, the best entry point was long gone. But here’s the good news: history is repeating itself, and another undervalued crypto gem is emerging—this time, it’s Arctic Pablo Coin ( APC). This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a high-utility, deflationary token with an adventure-packed presale journey that has already raised over $1.93 million. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Opportunity Enter Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a new meme-inspired cryptocurrency that blends storytelling with investment potential. APC introduces investors to an adventurous narrative, following the exploits of Arctic Pablo as he traverses icy realms, uncovering treasures symbolized by APC tokens. This unique approach engages the community and positions APC as a top crypto coin with massive potential. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is uniquely structured around “locations,” each representing a phase in Pablo’s journey. Currently, APC has reached Nippy Nook, the 15th location, with tokens priced at $0.000079. To date, the presale has raised over $1.94 million, reflecting growing investor interest. The launch price is set at $0.008, offering early investors a potential return on investment (ROI) of over 10,027.85% from the current location to the listing price. For instance, an investment of $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 12,656,860 APC tokens, which could be valued at $101,254.88 upon launch. This structure not only gamifies the investment process but also creates a sense of urgency and excitement as investors “travel” alongside Pablo, capitalizing on low entry points in each new realm. APC employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance scarcity and value by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Tokens left after the presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment. These burn transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and boosting investor confidence. Investors can participate in APC’s staking program, offering a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). By staking their tokens, investors support the network and enjoy substantial rewards, enhancing the coin’s appeal as a top crypto coin with massive potential. The Rise of Binance Coin: A Missed Opportunity Binance Coin (BNB) launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2017, pricing tokens at a mere $0.10 each. The ICO raised approximately $15 million, distributing 100 million BNB tokens to the public. Initially, BNB was primarily used to pay for trading fees on the Binance exchange, offering users discounts and utility within the platform. As Binance expanded its services, BNB’s use cases grew, encompassing transaction fees on Binance Chain, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and more. This utility and Binance’s rapid growth propelled BNB’s value exponentially. By late 2021, BNB reached an all-time high of over $600, marking a staggering increase from its ICO price. Investors recognizing BNB’s potential early on reaped substantial returns, turning modest investments into significant wealth. However, many missed this wave due to skepticism or lack of awareness, leading to reflections on missed opportunities in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Seizing the Arctic Opportunity Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a unique investment opportunity reminiscent of Binance Coin’s early days. Its engaging narrative, innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanisms, and attractive staking rewards position APC as a top crypto coin with massive potential. Investors recognizing and acting on this opportunity now stand to capitalize on low entry points, potentially reaping substantial returns as Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds. Don’t let this chance slip away. Join Arctic Pablo on his epic adventure and invest in the APC presale today to be part of a community where myth meets reality, and every coin promises prosperity. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now.

But it’s only in the past few months that the crypto market has witnessed the rise of AI agent tokens. And considering the likes of Virtuals Protocol ($Virtual) to MIND of Pepe ($MIND), it seems that AI agent tokens are here to stay. According to CoinGecko’s latest Annual Crypto Industry Report , the collective market capitalization of AI agent tokens exploded by 322% in 2024. This sector began the year at $4.8B and grew to $15.4B in Q4/24. It’s not entirely surprising that AI agent tokens surged in popularity following the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Although strictly speaking, ChatGPT isn’t an AI agent. Instead, it’s a large language model, and it needs human input to perform. AI agents, on the other hand, are next-level AI creatures. They’re goal-orientated, interactive, adaptable, and – importantly – autonomous. Meaning they require little to no human input to do their job. Genesis of the AI Agent Token It would be remiss of us when delving into the history of AI agent tokens, not to mention Terminal of Truths (now Truth Terminal ) and the massive impact it had on the meme coin Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). Truth Terminal is an AI agent with a social media presence on X. Its steady stream of viral content often includes memes, sarcasm, random philosophical insights, and other elements of internet culture. Truth Terminal caught the attention of venture capitalist Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, who made a $50K donation to the AI agent in $BTC. News of this went viral. And when Truth Terminal started promoting Goatseus Maximus shortly thereafter, $GOAT’s market cap skyrocketed. In October – the month this meme coin was launched – 1 $GOAT cost around $0.059978. In mid-November, after Truth Terminal mentioned $GOAT, its price peaked at $1.21. Following $GOAT’s success came Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUALS) – which CEO and co-founder Jansen Teng describes as the first ‘agentic’ network nation. It’s a decentralized blockchain platform that enables $VIRTUALS holders to create their own AI agents on Base. Once that agent is worth $503K, it receives a liquidity pool and an autonomous X account. $LUNA ($9.41M market cap) and $VADER ($8.06M market cap) are among the 17K AI agent tokens launched on Virtuals. That’s the power of an AI agent. It can influence trends, markets, and opinions. And when an AI agent is tokenized, it leads to a whole new world of possibilities. And whether in terms of utility, rewards and incentives, governance, or collaboration, AI agent tokens could well prove to be key drivers of the AI economy. But what role does MIND of Pepe play in all this? Is MIND of Pepe the Next AI Agent Heavyweight? With the upsurge of AI agent tokens entering the market, it can be difficult to differentiate the good from the, well, not-so-good. But that’s where MIND of Pepe ($MIND) steps up to the plate. This is the first Pepe-themed meme coin set to be a fully autonomous AI agent. By the way, we say ‘set’ because $MIND is currently on presale. But judging by its roadmap and tokenomics – not to mention the success of its presale so far – $MIND has the potential to be one of 2025’s best new meme coins . Like Truth Terminal, MIND of Pepe will take to social media, setting up its own autonomous X and Telegram accounts. There, $MIND will share its opinions as it evolves and engage with influencers. And as its social media presence grows, it’ll shape discussions and drive trends. Here’s where $MIND holders stand to gain significantly. Through gated access, they’ll be privy to the market insights and other alpha data that MIND of Pepe gathers, giving them the upper hand with unique strategic opportunities. This self-sovereign AI agent will also interact with dApps and create new cryptocurrency coins . $MIND holders will have exclusive early-bird access to those before they go public. $MIND will continue to self-evolve, learn, and become more powerful with every day that passes, as the best AI agents are known to do. And as it uses AI technology to evolve, $MIND’s potential is limitless. $MIND Off to a Great Start We believe that MIND of Pepe is currently one of the best presales of the year so far. Its presale has already raised $7.4M+, and 1 $MIND currently costs $0.0035518. And staking your $MIND while the presale is still on could see you earning 301% returns. Being a presale, however, the price increases in stages. So if you want to get your hands on this high-potential AI agent token, now’s the time. Our guide to buying $MIND will explain everything you need to know. Remember to also DYOR, though. We’re crypto gurus, not financial advisers. Be sure to visit the official MIND of Pepe website and read the $MIND whitepaper before making any decision.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|LUNA,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-20 15:45:10

While Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value remains unshaken, its reputation for delivering dazzling returns has taken a back seat in recent months. With the global economy adapting to inflationary pressures and shifting central bank policies, Bitcoin, much like traditional markets, is navigating uncertain waters. This restrained trajectory, however, sets the stage for emerging projects like BinoFi , which have taken the crypto world by storm with ambitious innovations and exponential growth during their early phases of deployment. BinoFi’s Game-Changing Hybrid Model Amid Bitcoin’s measured climb, BinoFi has emerged as a project stealing the spotlight. Positioned as the next-generation hybrid crypto exchange, BinoFi addresses long-standing inefficiencies in both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While CEXs offer speed and liquidity, users often sacrifice control over their funds. Alternatively, DEXs bring decentralization but face challenges like fragmented liquidity, high slippage, and slower execution times. BinoFi propels the conversation forward with a model that combines the best of both worlds, presenting a platform that prioritizes security, efficiency, and scalability. At the heart of BinoFi’s innovation is its hybrid liquidity aggregation , designed to deliver optimal trading conditions by leveraging both centralized and decentralized sources of liquidity. Cross-chain interoperability further positions BinoFi as a leader in multi-chain asset trading. Unlike traditional models that depend on wrapped tokens or third-party bridges, BinoFi allows for direct swaps across blockchains. This functionality drastically enhances the trading experience, presenting a solution fit for today’s increasingly interconnected blockchain landscape. Security remains central to BinoFi’s design. Its non-custodial Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets redefine asset protection, eliminating the need for private keys while ensuring user-friendly recovery options and the ability to engage in gasless transactions. Adding to the platform’s appeal are its AI-driven tools, which offer advanced strategies, real-time market analytics, and sentiment-based insights, empowering both novice and seasoned traders to make informed decisions. BinoFi’s Presale Success Lights Up the Market While Bitcoin’s modest growth reflects the lingering caution in broader markets, BinoFi has captured bullish sentiment, particularly evident in its successful presale. With over 20 million $BINO tokens sold during the first days, BinoFi’s launch has not only surpassed expectations but underscored the market’s enthusiasm for its hybrid exchange model. The fact that $BINO started at a presale price of $0.02 and is slated to list at $0.30 highlights the confidence of early backers in its growth potential. This rapid pace of presale contributions also points to a market ripe for innovation. Traders and investors are increasingly looking beyond established cryptocurrencies to identify projects that present real-world solutions and scalability. BinoFi’s hybrid approach, combined with its user-centric features such as cross-chain trading and AI automation, has resonated with a growing audience of crypto enthusiasts eager to diversify their portfolios with cutting-edge offerings. Why BinoFi is Expected To Be A Success BinoFi’s combination of innovation and early market adoption places it in a unique position to become a leading force in the evolution of cryptocurrency exchanges. Its ability to address inefficiencies in both CEX and DEX models demonstrates an acute understanding of the needs of modern traders. The strong performance of the $BINO presale underscores the appetite for its hybrid solution, which melds the convenience of centralized systems with the security and autonomy of decentralized platforms. While Bitcoin will continue to thrive as the digital gold of the crypto world, projects like BinoFi showcase how the broader market continues to diversify and expand. BinoFi is not simply chasing trends; it is setting them with a bold vision toward a seamless and scalable future for crypto trading. The crypto market may have its share of volatility and debate, but one thing is becoming increasingly clear: pioneers like BinoFi are lighting the way for the next era of digital asset trading. With its presale success serving as a key indicator of confidence, BinoFi’s trajectory is one to watch closely in the years to come.

That's a problem, according Edan Yago, a Bitcoin veteran of over a decade and core contributor to smart contract operating system BitcoinOS (BOS). ""Forking a blockchain, especially one with $2 trillion worth of value on it, is like open-heart surgery,"" Yago told CoinDesk in an interview ""Hard forks are obviously much more problematic, but I think introducing any kind of fork is fraught."" A fork is a change to a blockchain's code that necessitates a divergence at a certain point onto a separate path. Forks can be ""soft,"" meaning older versions can still interact with the new one, or ""hard"", which render older versions incompatible and require all users to upgrade their software. ZK proofs are a cryptographic method of proving the validity of statements while maintaining privacy through not revealing any information about it. The functionality is not available in Bitcoin's software, but could be made so through proposed implementations like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. Yago said developers should be able to find ways of enabling them on Bitcoin without any kind of fork. ""The burden of proof is on developers to demonstrate that there is no other way of accomplishing this through clever engineering,"" he said. This is what BOS hopes to achieve through the BitSNARK, a Bitcoin rollup protocol that is part of the family of computing paradigms being developed to scale the original blockchain. These emerged following the introduction of BitVM by Robin Linus in October 2023 , which set out a framework for how Ethereum-like smart contracts could be enabled on Bitcoin. BitcoinOS has now open-sourced what Yago describes as a ""fully production-ready"" BitSNARK protocol, meaning developers now have access to ZK verification on Bitcoin and can connect it to other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. BitSNARK allows developers to take large, complex programs and prove the results of the computations in only 300 bytes that can be verified in standard Bitcoin transactions. That could pave the way for BTCFi, a term used for DeFi on Bitcoin, through enabling cross-chain bridges, decentralized exchanges and bitcoin (BTC)-backed stablecoins. While there are numerous projects looking to introduce decentralized finance on Bitcoin, they rely on using OP_CAT or OP_CTV codes, which require a fork in the blockchain's software.

During his speech at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in New York City, Trump also noted that simple and plain language rules are required to provide clear guidance to ventures and institutions on how to embrace digital assets. Donald Trump Urges Congress To Pass Stablecoin Legislation Speaking at the crypto summit, Donald Trump said the government should now work on legislation that would provide reasonable regulation of stablecoins. “With the correct legislations in place, institutions, both giant and small, will be free to invest their resources, develop, and participate in one of the most promising technological transformations in humanity,” he said. Subsequently, his call fell within a wider plan to make America the world’s premier destination for digital currencies and blockchain-based assets. The event happened on the 20th of March and its quite an important one as it is the first time a sitting U.S. president is speaking at a conference about digital assets.

Wild Predictions After Ripple’s SEC Win,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-set-to-explode-wild-predictions-after-ripples-sec-win/,"TL;DR The latest news on the Ripple v. SEC front pushed the asset to as high as $2.60 before settling at $2.48, fueling excitement across the XRP community. Some analysts foresee a breakout to $5+ for the price of the company’s native token, while others warn of a potential correction due to past “sell the news” patterns. Time for a Parabolic Surge? Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse took center stage on March 19, announcing that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its appeal against the company. The huge victory for the crypto firm triggered real euphoria across the XRP Army, while the price of the native token soared from $2.30 to $2.60 in a matter of minutes. In the following hours, though, the valuation retraced to the current $2.50 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Somewhat expected , the breaking news and the subsequent price resurgence have caused pro-XRP analysts to envision further gains in the near future . The one using the X moniker Dark Defender claimed that Ripple’s win has cleared the skies for a rally to a new all-time high of over $5. CRYPTOWZRD also gave their two cents, describing March 19 as “a significant day” due to the SEC’s decision to terminate the legal battle with Ripple. The analyst now expects to see “a strong bullish move” from the XRP/BTC trading pair. “A breakout will help XRP become strongly bullish in a very short period of time and get an impulsive spike upside. $2.80 is the next resistance target here, although BTC will still play a significant role tomorrow. My focus will remain on the lower time frame chart to get the next scalp opportunity,” they added. How About a Potential Correction? XRP’s price has indeed soared after Garlinghouse’s announcement, but its surge was not as impressive as many would have expected. After all, the valuation exploded by much more substantial percentages in the past when the developments in the lawsuit were seemingly less favorable for Ripple. This might be so because the element of surprise was missing. Over the past several weeks, well-known legal experts and market observers have suggested that the case’s official end might be incoming. Earlier this month, former White House official Anthony Scaramucci even placed the lawsuit among those that the SEC had already dropped. XRP is also not immune to the “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Its price experienced a bull run in the few months after the US presidential elections in November last year and peaked at almost $3.40 in mid-January (just ahead of Trump’s inauguration as America’s 47th President). Since then, it has been on a downtrend, waiting for major catalysts to push its price up . We have yet to see whether the pump observed after the latest Ripple v. SEC development will be followed by a further bullish momentum or if the “sell the news” effect will apply again. Additionally, the popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the social buzz surrounding XRP has been going through the roof since the dropped appeal. While that might sound like good news, such high volumes can sometimes have the opposite effect on the price. That said, Martinez asked whether now is a “great time to be a contrarian?” The post XRP Price Set to Explode?

The competition turned fierce as U.S. President Donald Trump signed the executive order for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Interestingly, amid the competition, Gold’s performance relative to BTC can hint at where the Bitcoin price is headed next, especially as the digital asset meets significant recovery today. Gold vs. Bitcoin: Where’s Bitcoin Price Headed? The Gold vs. Bitcoin USD chart reveals that gold has been in a strong and continuous downtrend ever since January 2023 when compared to Bitcoin (GOLD/BTC). At the same time, the trendline reveals that BTC is outperforming gold at the same interval. Although gold is achieving new highs in the traditional market and Bitcoin is trading near $86k, the comparative analysis puts the latter in dominance. Interestingly, in this two-year period, the GOLD/BTC ratio has tested its 200-day EMA four times and is approaching the same for the 5th time. It could become a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin price action toward a low or a rally. Will Bitcoin Price Finally Rally With the 5th 200 EMA Target? The GOLD vs. Bitcoin USD analysis reveals that every time gold soared against the other and touched the 200-day EMA, it resulted in a surge for BTC. As the current scenarios present the charts near the same pivot for the 5th time, Bitcoin can form a strong uptrend. However, it is important to note that the last four times have not been entirely favorable for the digital asset, but the exhaustion at the 200-day EMA may push the token to the verge of a rally. More importantly, the RSI divergence in the Gold is another bullish signal for the token. A separate SPDR Gold Shared (GLD) chart reveals that there’s a notable bearish RSI divergence. This is an indication of the weakening bullish momentum and a potential reversal. As a result, it indicates the possibility of a BTC price rally if the gold’s momentum slows down. Bottom Line Gold’s performance against the BTC token is a significant indicator of what’s coming next for the token. The current performance and Bitcoin price predictions build a bullish scenario for the token as it is preparing for the potential rally due to the exhaustion at the 200-day EMA. With the historical patterns of Gold vs. Bitcoin backing this top cryptocurrency’s surge, there’s a probability of higher returns. However, investors must take unpredictability and volatility into consideration.

Topping the list is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been leading with for a highly successful presale, surpassing $4.1 million after entering Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02 per token. Analysts note that with structured tokenomics in place, they are expecting a 200% increase to $0.06 at launch and up to $3.50 post-listing. At the same time, while SHIB and DOGE receive mixed predictions, SHIB hopes for $0.000081 while exchange reserves dwindle, and DOGE suffers volatility as active addresses rise 400%. Strategic investments in these tokens, particularly MUTM, offer an opportunity for unprecedented exponential returns for the discerning investor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a rapid ascent to Phase 3 of its presale, with the token being just $0.02 and 6,200+ holders already achieved. The current phase approaches its conclusion ahead of Phase 4, which will see a 25% increase in prices to $0.025. The tokenomics of MUTM peg the exchange debut at $0.06, meaning early buyers will enjoy a 200% return on launch. After launch, the projections ramp up: analysts reach $3.50, meaning a $500 investment turns into $87,500. Even more than speculation, MUTM’s utility is well founded by the decentralized lending model and mtTokens, which are interest-earning assets pegged to deposits. As its Certik audit soon to be announced on the social channels would serve to further the teams credibility. Phase 3 is filling up very quickly and the longer one waits the greater the risk of missing the entry price at its lowest levels before we have higher prices to pay. Shiba Inu (SHIB) prepares for upward fight as supply squeeze looms Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows signs of recovery as exchange reserves fall to 93.573 trillion tokens, a new all-time low indicating lowered sell pressure. Hodlings on exchanges such as Binance now only account for 15.88% of its supply, while long-term holder addresses have ballooned to 1.09 million. From mid-March 2025, SHIB price has bounced 10%, eyeing $0.000081, up 500% from current levels. But then again, its dependence on meme-driven hype is two different worlds apart from MUTM’s utility-based ecosystem. SHIB’s supply-side dynamics may point towards stability, but its growth remains littered with volatility and momentum will be required to break resistance sat $0.00001380 Rejuvenation Of DOGE As Activity Soars Data from Dogecoin (DOGE) show an influx of over 400% in active addresses which are approaching 395,000 as traders seek a possible rally. Analysts see the potential for DOGE to reach $6 if it can maintain above the $0.14750 support level. Skepticism remains that DOGE is in bubble territory. Technical charts show a falling wedge, and breakout targets from $0.46 to $0.65 — quite the gulf between those and new $6 predictions. Contrary to the revenue-driven buy pressure of MUTM, DOGE’s path is heavily reliant on social sentiment, leaving investors vulnerable to volatile fluctuations. Its Stochastic RSI lends it bullish momentum, though the token’s lack of any inherent utility weakens long-term conviction. Millionaire Returns Come from the Right Allocation With strong presale traction, audit-ready infrastructure, and calculated return on investment (ROI) pathways, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outshines its peers. He said: “$500 today could get you $1.5 million (€1.4 million) by 2026 if MUTM comes in at $3.50, far surpassing the performances of SHIB or DOGE. While meme coins may taunt transient rallies, it is MUTM’s lending ecosystem paired with buy-and-distribute mechanics generating sustainable demand. Phase 3 is only OPEN in a $0.02 price WINDOW and ends soon. There’s a clear market that will reward action now with a pre-emptive position in advance of eyeing exchange listings and audits. The clock is ticking: take action before Phase 4 drives up entry costs.

This performance is likely because Pi coin is still in a price discovery phase after its mainnet launch in February. This article explains how a potential PI ETF would boost its price and how high it may get. Pi Network Price Would Benefit From an ETF Approval The Pi Network price has numerous potential catalysts that may push its price much higher in the longer term. One of these catalysts is a Pi coin burn , which will help to ease the ongoing fears about dilution as billions of tokens are expected to be unlocked in the next few years. The other potential catalyst for the Pi coin price will be exchange listings by companies like Binance , Kraken, Upbit, and Coinbase. Those listings would fuel its surge by making it more available to millions of potential buyers. Another far-fetched idea that may benefit the Pi price surge is a spot Pi Network ETF approval in the United States. This is a far-fetched concept since no company has applied for a spot Pi to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A Pi ETF makes sense for three main reasons. First, Pi is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the industry. CoinMarketCap data shows that Pi has a market cap of over $7.9 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $117 billion. This makes it bigger and more liquid than other coins that have received ETF applications, like Litecoin and Polkadot. The other reason the SEC may approve a PI ETF is that it is a Made in USA coin, which is an important aspect during the Trump administration. Finally, unlike coins like Polkadot and Sui, Pi Network is a proof of work coin, meaning that the SEC does not view it as a security. Pi Coin Price Technical Analysis A combination of a Pi coin ETF approval, ecosystem growth, exchange listings, and token burn would be highly bullish. Some analysis point to a Pi coin surge to $100 in the long term. Such a move would push its market cap to over $680 billion and the fully diluted valuation to $10 trillion. The four-hour chart shows that the Pi Network price has dropped to $1.1600, down sharply from the all-time high of $3. On the positive side, it has formed a falling wedge pattern whose two trendlines are about to converge. A bullish breakout typically happens when the two lines near their crossover. Pi Network price chart Therefore, the short-term Pi coin price forecast is bullish, which is a contrarian view. Such a move would see it jump to $3, up by 155% from the current level. A break above that level would see it jump to the value of Pi at $3.14, followed by $5. A drop below $0.80 will invalidate the bullish view.

He revealed the price level that XRP needs to stay above to avoid further downside pressure and rally to the upside. XRP Needs To Stay Above $2.66 To Avoid Corrective Move In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that if XRP fails to close above the $2.65 to $2.70 range, it won’t negate the wave 4 move and will likely lead XRP down to the 5th wave. His accompanying chart showed that the altcoin could drop to as low as $1.7 on this corrective move, breaking the crucial $2 support level in the process. The analyst had previously highlighted this $2.65 as being critical for a bullish breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Bounce Back Above $3 If Bulls Can Hold This Level Egrag Crypto alluded to the fact that the US SEC was finally dropping its long-running lawsuit against Ripple, which is typically bullish for XRP. The analyst admitted that it was a significant win for long-term adoption and utility, reinforcing the belief in the altcoin’s use. However, he added that the focus has to be on the numbers and charts in the short term. In line with this, he remarked that a close above $2.66 would be a good sign, followed by another close above $2.97 as a second bullish confirmation. He asserted that the ultimate confirmation for a bullish trend would be a close above $3.40, which is XRP’s current all-time high (ATH). A close above $3.40 would lead to the next target between $5 and $8. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that XRP needs to break above $3.40 to confirm a new trend. Until then, she remarked that market participants will have to wait for signs of confirmation, which may not be obvious until wave 3 in the market cycle. Before now, the analyst affirmed that the market is on the edge of a breakout, and this week could be a defining moment, which already looks to be the case with the Ripple SEC lawsuit. A Rally To $5 Already In Play Crypto analyst Dark Defender suggested that an XRP rally to $5 was already underway after the SEC decided to drop the Ripple lawsuit. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could witness a breakout to the $5 target. The altcoin will first rally to around $4.4 on wave 3, then correct to $3.7 on wave 4 before the rally to $5.6 on wave 5. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor Meanwhile, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto raised the possibility of XRP dropping below $2 and reaching $1.7 before any parabolic move to the upside begins. He predicts that the altcoin will rally to double digits regardless of how the price action plays out in the short term. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.45, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Standing in a conference hall in Singapore, watching a developer try eight different ways to move assets between chains for a demo. Nothing worked. The faces in the conference hall got redder by the minute while venture capitalists checked their phones. That's when it hit me - we'd built blockchain cities with no roads between them. Cross-chain communication isn't a footnote in the blockchain story—it's the whole ballgame now. Without it, we're stuck with digital islands where assets and data get trapped, users get frustrated, and the whole promise of Web3 falls apart. The most popular approach right now is to connect the public chains like Ethereum with bridges or wrapped tokens, which struck me as particularly thoughtful to begin with— but might not be ideal for institutional adoption where compliance is a must have and complete free flow of data poses threat to user privacy & security. What's this cross-chain stuff anyway? Cross-chain communication is exactly what it sounds like: different blockchain networks talking to each other, sharing data, and moving assets back and forth. But lord, the devil's in the details. These networks weren't built to communicate. Each has its own: Consensus mechanisms (how they agree on stuff) Data structures (how they organize information) Programming languages (how developers tell them what to do) Security models (how they protect themselves) It's like trying to get people speaking 50 different languages to have a complex conversation without translators. The main approaches I've seen work (sorta) include: Atomic swaps - Peer-to-peer exchanges using cryptographic tricks to ensure neither party can cheat Bridges - Protocols that lock assets on Chain A and mint equivalent tokens on Chain B Interoperability protocols - Standardized messaging systems between compatible chains Why should anyone care about this? The pain of blockchain borders is real Last summer, I read about a gaming company building on multiple chains. Their team of 12 developers spent 8 of them just maintaining separate versions of essentially the same application across 3 chains. A colossal waste of talent. For regular folks using blockchain, it's even worse. My cousin tried getting into DeFi last year and gave up after two weeks. ""I need four different wallets and I've paid more in bridge fees than I've made in returns,"" he texted me. Cross-chain solutions could've saved my cousin massive headaches. Build once, deploy everywhere. Use one wallet for everything. Simple ideas, devilishly hard to execute. Money hates barriers The fragmentation of money across chains creates wild inefficiencies. During market swings, I watched the same stablecoin trade at $0.95 on one chain and $1.03 on another FOR HOURS. That 8% gap represents pure friction that shouldn't exist. When liquidity gets trapped, everyone loses: Traders face worse prices Protocols attract less capital Users pay higher fees Cross-chain communication creates what some call ""unified liquidity pools"" - where capital flows freely to where it's most needed. The coolest stuff happens between chains Modern blockchain projects don't live on just one chain. They're like blockchain chameleons, using different chains for different functions such as: Ethereum for governance and security Polygon for daily user interactions Chainlink for real-world data A privacy chain for sensitive claims processing Without cross-chain communication, this kind of ""best of all worlds"" approach is impossible. You're stuck making painful tradeoffs instead of cherry-picking the best features from each chain. This ain't theoretical - it's happening now Cosmos has their Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) connecting over 50 chains now. Their ""Internet of Blockchains"" vision is actually coming together, though mostly within their own ecosystem. Polkadot took a different path with their relay chain and parachain model. Their shared security approach solves some problems but creates others. I've spent hours debating their tradeoffs with their developers over beers. Chainlink's CCIP focuses specifically on secure message passing between chains. Their oracle network gives them unique advantages here, though their approach is more centralized than some purists would like. KALP 's implementation caught my eye because it specifically addresses regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. During a private demo, I watched them move a tokenized real estate asset from an EU-regulated subnet to Ethereum while maintaining its compliance attributes on their testnet. For institutional adoption, this kind of ""compliance-aware"" bridging is crucial. The stuff that keeps me up at night Despite progress, massive challenges remain: Bridges are security nightmares Cross-chain bridges have been hacked so many times it's almost comical. Over $2 billion stolen in 18 months! The Ronin bridge hack was $620 million. Why are they so vulnerable? Because bridges often create centralized chokepoints. When you concentrate on value and control, you create targets. I've had heated arguments with security researchers about whether truly secure cross-chain communication is even possible. Some believe it's an unsolvable problem - that bridges will always be vulnerable by design. Others think zero-knowledge proofs will eventually save us. Everyone's doing their own thing The lack of standardization is maddening. Every project implements their own approach to cross-chain communication, creating a mess of incompatible protocols. Where's this all going? Despite challenges, I see promising trends: Layer-2 solutions will increasingly integrate with cross-chain protocols, combining scalability with interoperability. This could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of moving between chains. AI-powered routing might eventually determine the optimal path for transactions across chains, automatically selecting the most efficient routes based on cost, speed, and security. Regulators are waking up to cross-chain issues. MiCA in Europe already includes provisions about cross-chain asset transfers. Tying it all together Cross-chain communication isn't just some technical problem for blockchain nerds to solve. It's the key that unlocks everything else. Without it, we're stuck with a fragmented landscape that can't deliver on blockchain's core promise. The most exciting projects in this space recognize that no single chain will rule them all. Instead, we're heading toward an interconnected ecosystem where specialized chains handle specific use cases while maintaining seamless communication with the broader network. The future isn't chain-specific; it's cross-chain by design. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This unexpected development has caught the attention of many in the market, raising questions about the potential of this token and why it is predicted to make a big jump. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project brings together the world of sports and crypto and has drawn interest from investors across both sectors. Unlike most meme coins, XYZVerse positions itself as a leader with its clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently awarded the Best NEW Meme Project, showing its appeal to the world. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale, $XYZ recorded a commendable growth. Since the launch of the token, it has grown from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage of presale predicted to push the price to $0.005. The final presale will target the $0.02 price mark which will be boosted by listings on centralized and decentralized exchanges. At a projected listing price of $0.10 on exchanges, it means that early investors can earn rewards of up to 1,000x their investments. However, this will rely on the project securing the needed market capitalization. So far, the project has raised more than $10 million, with the presale targeting a milestone of around $15 million. The increased progress has shown that there is strong demand and interest from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In the XYZVerse community, the participants are in charge of its activities. Active contributors are not just participants, as the project provides rewards in the form of airdropped XYZ tokens for their hard work. It is a game where the most dedicated and passionate players earn big rewards. The Road to Victory With its solid tokenomics and other activities including, periodic token burns, CEX and DEX listings, and a solid tokenomics, $XYZ is ready for a championship run. With every play, the token has the needed space to strengthen its price while impressing a community of investors who believed in the project as the start of something good. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Pi Network (PI) In the last six months, Pi Network (PI) has shed about 96.3% of its price. In the last month, the price dropped by 99%, with the price posting another 18% drop in the past week. The token is currently trading between $1.21 and $1.70, showing signals of a bearish run. Despite the price drop, the token has shown signs that its price is about to stabilize. The token’s Relative Strength Index is around 44, showing that it is moving closer to the oversold territory. The token also has a MACD level of -0.01906 which indicates being overwhelmed by the bears. However, its 10-day simple moving average of $1.115 and its 100-day average of $1.34 shows that it is presently around its short-term averages. PI needs to overcome its current resistance level at $2 before it can make an upward movement. If that were to happen, the token would post a 17% gain from its current price. If the token sustains the momentum, it could face another resistance at $2.50, which would be a 47% increase. On the downside, its nearest support is around $1.01, with a fall below the price pushing the token toward the second resistance at $0.5. Traders are following these trends to predict the next move of the token. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) has registered a commendable price rise over the last few days. In the past week, the price of the token climbed 37%, reaching between $2.56 and $3.93. Despite the price rise, the token has dropped 4% in the last month and 36% in the past six months. The trend suggests that the token could continue to drop in the long term despite investors seeing short-term gains. According to its technical indicators, the token is showing mixed signals. Its RSI is presently around 61, moving close to the overbought region but still with enough space for growth. The token’s 10-day moving average is $3.58 while its 100-day moving average is around $3.42. The shorter average being over the longer one shows that the bull could be in play soon. The MACD level is presently at 0.0216, which shows that there could be an upward move. The Stochastic is at 44.91, which means that the token is not in the overbought and oversold region. A future price move might see the token test the resistance level at $4.42, which is 12% above its current price. If the token holds onto its upward moves, it could reach the next resistance level at $5.70, giving investors some gains. However, if the price falls, the next support is around $1.86, a 29% drop below its current price. These levels are important in its price moves and investors would be watching out to determine how to move.

Following Donald Trump’s election victory and the founding of the Elon Musk -led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Dogecoin prices surged from $0.15197 just a day before the election on November 5, 2024, to a high of $0.4665 on December 9, 2024. Since then, price action has been overwhelmingly negative. The savvy traders who got in early, quite reasonably, took their profits. Trading volume collapsed back to pre-election levels. Financial markets became overwhelmed with uncertainty following President Trump’s tariff policies — in the ensuing risk asset selloff, Bitcoin ( BTC ) suffered a steep correction, and the wider cryptocurrency market including DOGE followed. By press time on March 20, the meme coin was changing hands at a price of $0.17304, having marked a 30.99% decline on the monthly chart. This has brought Dogecoin’s year-to-date (YTD) losses up to 45.18%. Thus far, it has severely underperformed both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin, which have seen losses of 2.82% and 7.75% since the start of the year. DOGE price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold Since the initial post-election upswing, which increased the number of Dogecoin millionaires by 40% , the humorous asset has failed to move to the upside in a meaningful, consistent manner. DOGE’s association with Musk, an increasingly controversial figure, also isn’t doing it any favors . In stark contrast with the recent bearish atmosphere, a renowned technical analyst believes that a significant upswing in Dogecoin prices could take place soon. Will Dogecoin price break out of this crucial range? DOGE appears to be in an ascending triangle chart pattern , per crypto researcher Ali Martinez, who shared his findings in a March 20 X post . #Dogecoin $DOGE will break out! A close outside $0.16-$0.18 could trigger a 16% price move. pic.twitter.com/feuCLVlFZN — Ali (@ali_charts) March 20, 2025 Accordingly, if the pattern is legitimate, a close outside of the $0.16 – $0.18 range could trigger a roughly 16% price move, equal to the length of the triangle’s “base”. Here’s why traders shouldn’t get too excited, however. Ascending triangles are bullish continuation patterns — in simple terms, they usually signal that a prevailing uptrend will continue. Elon Musk’s favorite crypto is not in an uptrend — and while triangle patterns can, on occasion, indicate a trend reversal, there is nothing that would suggest that to be the case this time around. In addition, a closer look at the price chart above reveals that DOGE’s trading volume has been on a steady decline since mid-March — further weakening the prospects of a breakout to either side. Finally, readers should remember that Martinez is only positing a thesis. What the analyst has outlined is one possibility — but there are no guarantees that things will play out as predicted. Back in February, the researcher predicted that Dogecoin price could reach levels as high as $4 — only for the meme coin to fall beneath crucial support levels and continue on its downward trajectory. Unfortunately for DOGE bulls, the signal appears to be far too weak to warrant a long position. That will have to wait for a more material change in the asset’s prospects — like the (albeit recently delayed) approval of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ).

The Walrus protocol is a blockchain-based data storage platform currently in testnet . Per details in a announcement , the funding from a private token sale will help Walrus Foundation to scale the data storage network on Sui ( SUI ). “This investment is a significant milestone to redefine decentralized storage. By leveraging Sui’s unique architecture, we’re making storing data programmable, interactive, and secure,” Rebecca Simmonds, managing executive of Walrus Foundation, said in a statement. Walrus plans to capitalize on the rising demand for programmable storage across the market, which it can now pursue following this capital injection, Simmonds added. The Sui-based platform, developed by Mysten Labs, is gaining traction as developers and projects tap into its solution for on-chain and off-chain data management. Any application can leverage Walrus to publish, read, and program data files, using Move-based smart contracts. Combining storage, availability, and decentralized computing means users have access to a solution that vastly improves on what legacy storage solutions offer.

Sequoia Capital, Ribbit, Benchmark, Draper Associates, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Libertus Capital, CoinFund, SkyBridge, Hypersphere and Karatage participated in the investment by purchasing Toncoin ( TON ), the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network. TON Foundation described the token purchases as strategic partnerships that will help expand the TON ecosystem, though no further details were provided. TON blockchain is a decentralized network that supports the development of Mini Apps for the Telegram ecosystem. Although TON was initially developed by Telegram’s founders, it now operates as an independent chain. As of January, Toncoin is Telegram’s only accepted crypto for app services. TON blockchain has seen significant growth over the past year, with native accounts rising from 4 million to 41 million. TON Foundation claims that the Toncoin cryptocurrency has more than 121 million unique holders. According to the announcement, TON Foundation seeks to onboard 30% of active Telegram users to the blockchain in the next three years. By March, Telegram had 1 billion monthly active users, doubling in just under three years.

Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ) rose to $0.00006545, up by 20% from its lowest level this month and 40% higher than its lowest point in 2025. The main catalyst for the coin was that the community members voted down a controversial proposal to create a sub-DAO. According to the team, LUNC would have had four sub-DAOs, each with its own mandate. One DAO would oversee Terra Classic’s security and chain stability, while the second would be responsible for communication and marketing. Another DAO would be for documentation, while the last one would oversee mediation. Each of these sub-DAOs would operate for a six-month voluntary term. You might also like: LUNC price could surge 300% as burn rate soars, but there’s a catch The final tally showed that most members voted in favor of the proposal. However, 38% of the voters rejected the proposal. The proposal was ultimately rejected through a veto since the “no with veto” crossed the 33.4% threshold. https://twitter.com/MrDiamondhandz1/status/1902620483796787248 The campaign to reject the proposal was led by an anonymous X user and LUNC validator known as Mr. DiamondHandz, who argued that creating the sub-DAO would open the floodgates for a power grab from the community. He claimed that sub-DAO leaders could potentially place their friends in key committee positions. The LUNC community is now voting on a major move that would change the classification of TerraUSD ( USTC ) from a stablecoin to a meme coin . This proposal would recognize the reality that the coin no longer trades as a stablecoin and that the odds of regaining its peg are limited. LUNC price analysis LUNC chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Terra Luna Classic price bottomed at $0.00005650 this month. This was notable since it was the lowest level in February this year and in July and August last year. It has formed a giant quadruple-bottom with a neckline at $0.0001792. LUNC has also formed a bullish divergence pattern, which happens when an oscillator trends upwards while the price is falling. The awesome oscillator has moved upwards and is about to cross the zero line. Also, the percentage price oscillator, a unique type of MACD, has continued rising. Therefore, a combination of a bullish divergence and a quadruple-bottom pattern points to more upside. A drop below the support at $0.000056 would invalidate the bullish view.

Financial authorities in the Russian Federation are considering whether to admit more participants to the trials. Russia’s Ministry of Finance ( Minfin ) expects the Moscow Exchange ( MOEX ) to be a major participant in a cryptocurrency trading experiment, Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov unveiled on the sidelines of the Crypto Summit 2025 forum, held in the Russian capital this week. Russia to utilize existing exchange infrastructure for crypto trading trials Speaking to reporters covering the industry event, Chebeskov said that the main proposal during the preparations for the trials was to employ the existing exchange infrastructure in Russia to trade cryptocurrencies. “We have large exchanges, the Moscow Exchange, first of all, which, as I said, could handle this functionality without problems. It’s the same trading, just a different instrument,” he elaborated, quoted by the official Tass news agency. Facilitating crypto trading operations would not be a difficult task for any exchange platform in the Russian Federation, the deputy minister is convinced. “Therefore, we are considering them, I would say, first of all as participants,” he added. Finance ministry mulls adding more participants to crypto exchange experiment The Minfin official further noted that the question of whether to expand the trials to engage multiple participants or even establish new entities for that purpose remains a difficult one “because here we need to evaluate the pros and cons.” “On the one hand, this is also a kind of competition and an opportunity to see how different participants will do. On the other, this is a dilution of liquidity, more administration,” he pondered and emphasized: “This is still an experiment, not a full-fledged regulation. For now, we say that this is an experiment.” While Russia has been interested in employing digital assets for international settlements, with reports claiming it’s already using cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions in trade, financial authorities in Moscow have remained wary of permitting their free circulation inside the country. Russia moves forward with plans to use crypto in foreign trade Earlier in March, Chebeskov’s colleague, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Yakovlev, told the Russian business news portal RBC that the Minfin is considering the launching of “organized trading” of digital currencies in the country within the framework of the recently established “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The ELR was introduced with a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in August in order to legalize the “use of cryptocurrencies in foreign economic activity.” The new legislation also allows for the exchange trading of such assets under the strict control of the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). Yakovlev stressed that only “highly qualified” investors would have access to such trading. “Not necessarily banks; this is more about professional participants,” the official added, stressing that the ministry is focused on preventing risks for the financial system, monetary policy and security of Russia. Later this month, the CBR confirmed this new category of market participants, announcing that citizens will be able to obtain the status of “highly qualified investors” only if they have invested more than 100 million rubles (almost $1.2 million) in securities and deposits or if their annual income exceeded 50 million rubles in the past year.

These factors have put markets under strain, with some analysts predicting that the bull run is over and a bear market may be on the horizon. In a recent Cointelegraph interview, Kevin O’Leary, also known as “Mr. Wonderful,” shared his thoughts on the current state of the market and what could be ahead. Despite the turbulence, O’Leary remains optimistic about the future of Bitcoin ( BTC ). He explains that while the market is under pressure, he still expects Bitcoin to end the year higher as a couple of key factors come into play. A key issue discussed in the interview is the need for regulatory clarity, especially surrounding stablecoins. O’Leary is particularly focused on the GENIUS Act, which he believes will be passed imminently by the US Congress. “We have been waiting for almost seven years for this legislation. I have a feeling it’s going to make it, and when that happens, it’s a game changer,” O’Leary said. The passage of the GENIUS Act, which aims to provide regulatory clarity around stablecoins, should boost the adoption of dollar-backed stablecoins. This move is expected to bring much-needed stability and legitimacy to the crypto market, helping to mitigate some of the ongoing risks.

Mutuum Finance has raised $4.1 million since its presale launch with 6,200 holders. Phase 3, where tokens are valued at $0.02 each, creating high expectations for the next phase. With a 25% increase when Phase 4 launches at $0.025, early participants can expect a healthy return as the project’s tokenomics notes a $0.06 listing price — a tripled investment. After being fully launched, however, the price is now expected to start rallying to $3.50, setting the stage for MUTM to be a target for allocations into new crypto projects. Presale Gathers Pace Pretty Quickly Mutuum Finance has shown top tier traction with its analytical profit-sharing model and deflationary tokenomics as Phase 3 of its presale closes in on capacity. At its price of $0.02, it presents one of the last opportunities for early birds ahead of the next incremental price step, with early investors already eyeing a 200% (or more) gain at launch. While speculative or intrinsic assets may be at the mercy of volatility, the value proposition of MUTM ensures that demand for the token scales directly with utility, aligning token demand with use cases and instituting recurring buy pressure via revenue redistribution. This methodical approach has appealed to ADA whales in search of projects with utility underpinned by measurable growth catalysts. Tokenomics Power Forward Aggression Mutuum Finance’s framework guarantees that growth is by design, with mtTokens accruing value for users whenever an asset is deposited into the protocol, and a buy-and-distribute system allowing platform fees to be directed out of the protocol before being converted for token repurchases. The repurchased tokens are then distributed back to stakers, decreasing sell-offs whilst rewarding long-term holders. At a listing target of $0.06, Phase 3 participants would realize a 3x return overnight, while Post Launch projections of $3.50 place their upside 17,400% higher than its present price. This kind of projection comes from Mutuum’s hybrid lending system that takes every single aspect of decentralized pools and mixes them with the flexibility of peer-to-peer negotiations — meeting the needs of all investors without the need for speculative hype. Reliability of Audit Progress Signals The team at Mutuum Finance is currently completing a smart contract audit with CertiK, a step that should further bolster investor confidence. Results are still pending, but the initiative highlights a commitment to security at a time when scrutiny over regulation is ramping up across decentralized finance. Once audit is completed, publication would probably create more visibility and thus deeper institutional interest. As the presale marches on, the opportunities become limited. Now, the door’s closing on the chance of locking in MUTM at $0.02 forever before Phase 4 ramps up the price and hype. Amidst turbulent conditions within the crypto space for investors, justifying TVL is a challenge. Still, Mutuum Finance’s combo of transparency, utility and growth potential is a rare intersection of stability and high-yield opportunity. Time Is Critical As Cardano travails highlight the dangers of overextending in sinking ecosystems, Mutuum Finance is stepping up as a solid alternative. Not just a token, but a new entry point to portfolio performance greater than 5X post-launch forecast at $3.50, with presale action to boot — enter MUTM. Moving the funds into Mutuum Finance thus stands as a shift for ADA whales away from hype-driven assets and toward platforms with identifiable demand drivers. With this groundbreaking contract pending CertiK’s verdict, the project’s credibility is swelling—because Phase 3 will be one of the last safe bets to cash in before thresholds are changed.

As much as Dogecoin, or Doge, is well-known to investors, this buyer has found four reasons for buying all copies of Rexas Finance (RXS) token, which is in the presale phase at $0.20 presently. Thus, it is with a current proposed name of $ 0.25 and expected further sharp price increase, RXS is considered a highly potentially lucrative stock. Dogecoin’s Price Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty The market value of Dogecoin bounces between $0.212 today and other price points. During the last week, DOGE lost 6.46%, while in one month it declined by 29.90%. The steady price decline worries professional investors about DOGE's capacity to grow in the future. Dogecoin's market indicators show contrasting signals about its expected growth path. Both 50-day and 200-day moving averages stand close to today's trading price, with the 200-day level acting as strong resistance. The market will recover up to $0.25 if DOGE maintains enough strength to stay above $0.20. The Relative Strength Index indicates that digital currency DOGE moves towards deficient buying levels with its value near 35. DOGE may see temporary market gains from traders looking to buy during this period. The MACD indicator has failed to support an upward signal, so there is still a risk of prices dropping lower. Dogecoin's unlimited amount of coins creates problems for people who want to invest for the long term. The supply of 144 billion DOGE combined with unlimited production makes new tokens push down market prices. Even though many people own dogecoin, researchers continue searching for digital assets with scarce supply and useful real-life benefits. Rexas Finance (RXS) Gains Attention with Real-World Use Case Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out because it connects blockchain technology and traditional finance through its new asset-backed digital currency. Unlike popular meme coins,Rexas Finance uses blockchain to enable investors to buy and sell valid real-world investments. The Dogecoin millionaire lists four main reasons to put resources into Rexas Finance. Its practical usefulness marks it apart from other simple internet joke coins. The Rexas Finance platform enables investors to buy small parts of expensive company holdings through its asset tokenization system. The second reason is that security tests through CertiK audits make up the second main benefit. Rexas Finance received full security approval through a CertiK audit confirming the project's robust safety measures. When users invest, they can be confident about the platform because the audit shows it is secure and its smart contracts work properly. The third reason is that Rexas Finance has gained substantial market support. The project's presale reached $46.8 million while issuing 454.1 million tokens against its total 500 million token supply. More than 90% of the presale tokens sold out with an investment volume of $46.6 million, which demonstrates investors' strong trust before the formal release. ⭐️ Milestone Alert! ⭐️Rexas Finance has successfully raised $46.6 Million! 🚀Thank you for your support! 👍Buy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvAL8G pic.twitter.com/iFyNplMB97 — Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) February 22, 2025 The fourth reason for investing focuses on how much the project can expand. During its presale period, Rexas Finance trades for $0.20, while investors anticipate a launch price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Research shows the token could grow from $0.20 to $10 or $17 during future bull markets to produce gains from 5000% to 8400%. The project distributes 1 billion RXS tokens in these stages: 50% for presale, 10% each for liquidity and Treasury funding, followed by 20% reserved for staking pools. The predetermined distribution approach helps support stable token values while promoting investor retention.

42054500,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141797,1742491825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting News: Binance Unveils Six New Perpetual Contracts for Crypto Traders,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-new-perpetual-contracts-2/,"Get ready for a thrilling expansion in the crypto trading arena! Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped some exciting news that’s sure to pique the interest of traders everywhere. They’re bolstering their offerings with the addition of six brand-new USDⓈ-margined perpetual contracts, opening up fresh opportunities for you to navigate the dynamic world of digital assets. What’s the Buzz About Perpetual Contracts? Before we dive into the specifics of Binance’s latest listings, let’s quickly recap what perpetual contracts are and why they’re such a popular tool in the crypto trading landscape. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual contracts, as the name suggests, have no expiration. This means you can hold your positions indefinitely, allowing for more flexible trading strategies. Think of them as similar to spot trading but with leverage. USDⓈ-margined contracts, in particular, are settled in stablecoins like USDT, providing a more stable collateral option compared to coin-margined contracts. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key advantages: No Expiration Dates: Trade without the pressure of contract expiry, allowing for longer-term strategies. Leverage Opportunities: Amplify your trading positions with leverage, potentially increasing profits (and risks). USDⓈ-Margined Stability: Use stablecoins like USDT as margin, reducing exposure to the volatility of the underlying crypto asset used for margin. Hedging Capabilities: Utilize perpetual contracts to hedge against price fluctuations in the spot market. For traders seeking to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market movements, perpetual contracts offer a versatile and powerful instrument. Binance’s New Crypto Listing : Expanding Your Trading Horizons Now, let’s get to the heart of the announcement. Binance is adding not one, but six new USDⓈ-margined perpetual contracts to its already extensive platform. This expansion is a significant move, providing traders with a wider array of assets to diversify their portfolios and explore new trading opportunities. The new contracts being listed are: TUT/USDT BID/USDT BROCCOLI714/USDT BROCCOLIF3B/USDT SIREN/USDT BANANAS31/USDT These listings are rolling out progressively between March 20th and 22nd, so keep an eye on the Binance Futures platform for their availability. Each of these new crypto listing pairs will support leverage of up to 25x. This means you can control positions worth up to 25 times your margin, amplifying both potential gains and losses. USDT Margined Contracts: A Deep Dive into Stability The choice of USDⓈ-margined contracts is noteworthy. Why are USDT margined perpetual contracts gaining traction? The answer lies in the stability they offer. By using USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, as margin, traders can mitigate some of the volatility risks associated with using the underlying cryptocurrency as collateral. This can be particularly appealing in the often-turbulent crypto markets. Consider these benefits of USDT-margined contracts: Feature Benefit Stable Margin Asset (USDT) Reduces margin volatility compared to coin-margined contracts. Simplified Profit Calculation Profits and losses are calculated and settled in USDT, making it easier to understand and manage. Accessibility USDT is a widely accepted and readily available stablecoin within the crypto ecosystem. For traders who prefer a more predictable and less volatile margin asset, USDT-margined perpetual contracts present a compelling option. Unlocking Opportunities in Binance ‘s Ecosystem Binance ‘s continuous expansion of its perpetual contract offerings underscores its commitment to providing a comprehensive and versatile trading platform. By adding these six new contracts, Binance is empowering traders with more tools to navigate diverse market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities. But what does this mean for you, the trader? It means: Increased Choice: More assets to trade, allowing for greater portfolio diversification and strategy implementation. Potential for Higher Returns: Leverage up to 25x can amplify profitable trades (remembering the amplified risk too!). Access to Emerging Tokens: The inclusion of TUT, BID, BROCCOLI, SIREN, and BANANAS31 signals Binance’s willingness to list a wider range of projects, potentially giving early access to trading opportunities in these tokens. Enhanced Platform Utility: More trading options within the trusted and robust Binance ecosystem. Navigating the Waters of Crypto Trading with Leverage While the allure of leverage in crypto trading is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach it with caution and a sound risk management strategy. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses, meaning while your potential profits can be amplified, so can your potential losses. Especially in the volatile cryptocurrency market, understanding and managing risk is paramount. Here are some key considerations for trading perpetual contracts with leverage: Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Understand Leverage: Thoroughly grasp how leverage works and its impact on your positions. Start with lower leverage until you are comfortable. Market Volatility: Be acutely aware of the high volatility inherent in crypto markets. Price swings can be rapid and significant. Continuous Learning: Stay informed about market trends, trading strategies, and risk management techniques. Binance provides resources and educational materials to help users understand perpetual contracts and responsible trading practices. Utilizing these resources is highly recommended, especially for those new to leveraged trading. In Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Binance Traders Binance’s announcement of these six new USDⓈ-margined perpetual contracts is undoubtedly exciting news for the crypto community. It expands trading options, introduces new assets to the platform, and reinforces Binance’s position as a leading innovator in the crypto exchange space. For traders, this means more opportunities to explore, strategize, and potentially profit from the dynamic crypto markets. Remember to trade responsibly, manage your risk wisely, and always stay informed about the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading.

Meme coins have faced significant selling pressure and uncertainty, struggling to gain momentum as the broader crypto market remains volatile. Bulls must reclaim crucial resistance levels to confirm a recovery and prevent further downside. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Face A Big Test – Metrics Show $2.40 As The Most Critical Resistance Level Despite the market downturn, there are signs that DOGE may be on the verge of a breakout. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights on X, revealing that Dogecoin is forming a bullish pattern that could break out at any moment, leading to a massive rally. According to Runefelt, the pattern resembles a classic accumulation setup, hinting at a potential surge in price if key resistance levels are breached. With market sentiment shifting and on-chain data showing renewed interest in DOGE, traders are closely watching for signs of a breakout. If Dogecoin manages to reclaim higher price levels, it could signal the start of a strong uptrend for the meme coin. However, failure to hold its current support zone may result in further downside. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether DOGE bulls can take control and push prices higher. Dogecoin Falling Wedge Signals a Potential Breakout Dogecoin has experienced a sharp decline, now trading 70% below its December high. The selling pressure continues as meme coins remain some of the hardest-hit assets in the crypto market. Speculation and fear have driven prices lower, and DOGE bulls have a long road ahead if they want to reclaim higher levels. Bitcoin’s downtrend since late January has added to the bearish sentiment, leading investors to believe that the bull cycle may be coming to an end. If this is true, meme coins like DOGE will likely face the most volatility and selling pressure in the coming months. However, not all analysts are convinced that Dogecoin’s downtrend will persist. Runefelt’s insights reveal a technical analysis that suggests DOGE is forming a falling wedge pattern—a historically bullish setup. According to Runefelt, once DOGE breaks out of this formation, it could experience a significant rally. His price target for the breakout sits at $0.434, representing a massive upside from current levels. If Dogecoin manages to hold key support and break above resistance, a recovery rally could follow. However, if selling pressure continues and DOGE fails to reclaim higher levels, further declines may be inevitable. The next few weeks will be critical in determining the meme coin’s direction.

Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.17 after days of sideways trading, struggling to break above the $0.18 resistance level. The meme coin has been caught in a tight consolidation range as bulls attempt to regain control, but broader market uncertainty continues to weigh on price action. To confirm a recovery, DOGE must push above the $0.20 mark, which serves as a key psychological and technical resistance. Reclaiming this level could trigger a breakout toward higher supply zones, potentially fueling a rally toward $0.25 and beyond. However, for this to happen, Dogecoin needs a surge in buying momentum and increased market confidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Retesting A 5-Year Long Trendline – Massive Rally Incoming? On the downside, if DOGE fails to reclaim $0.20 in the coming days, selling pressure could increase, leading to a decline below $0.15. A drop below this level would indicate further weakness, potentially sending DOGE to retest lower supports around $0.12. Bulls must step in soon to prevent a deeper correction.

Through it all, Ether.fi, the market leader, has stayed steady, helping users generate yield through liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that can be staked across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Now, Ether.fi is looking to expand with plans to become a neobank for crypto companies and users. Ether.fi's dominance Ether.fi, which is based in the Cayman Islands, benefited from being one of the first movers in the liquid restaking space, starting up a lucrative points farm which saw early users receive points that could eventually be transferred into a token airdrop. In a 10 week period at the start of 2024, staked ETH grew from 45,000 ETH to 808,000 ETH. Now, there is 2.58 million staked ETH on Ether.fi while the next competitor, Renzo, has around 380,000 ETH. In dollar terms, Ether.fi has around $5 billion worth of TVL. This number has slumped from December's high of $9.4 billion but only due to the dwindling price of ETH, as opposed to any significant outflows. Ether.fi engages closely with its users in an effort to keep them onboard. ""We know probably half the TVL,"" Silagadze added. ""As in, we know who they are and we talk to them and have ongoing conversations."" Renzo in contrast has seen more than 60% ETH withdrawn from the platform since last July, with TVL sliding from 1 million ETH to 378,000 ETH, according to DefiLlama . From restaking protocol to Neobank For Silvagadze, the restaking product is a means to onboard users and capital, while the company's main ambition is to become a neobank to rival the likes of Revolut. ""Staking for us was really just a way of building TVL and getting a user base,"" Silagadze told CoinDesk. ""The ultimate goal is to create an integrated product suite that allows users to fully off ramp from their traditional banking institutions and operate on a crypto native platform."" Ether.fi rolled out a ""Cash"" Visa card on the Scroll network in September and Silagadze believes this will become the company's main revenue driver. Neobank has become quite the buzzword in crypto of late. Lending platform Nexo rebranded last year as a neobank and there was also the stealth launch of Dakota , a crypto app that will provide banking services to crypto depositors. EOS, which launched as a much-heralded smart contract platform in 2017, has also shifted focus to Web3 banking . For Ether.fi, the plan is to incorporate three products into one soon-to-be released mobile app. The app will comprise three integrated products: Ether.fi stake, which is the staking protocol; Ether.fi liquid, which is an automated DeFi strategy manager that generates the best available yield through the use of AI; and the Ether.fi cash wallet and credit card. Staking firms looking to serve the U.S. market have been put off by an absence of a clear regulatory framework. But Ether.fi hopes the crypto-friendly Trump administration will smooth the way for it to offer services to U.S. citizens after it secures respective licenses. ""We are actually going to be turning on the U.S. for our staking product and the cash product relatively soon. We actually just got a legal opinion that we're cool to do that,"" Silvagadze said. Ether.fi is also applying for licenses to operate in the European Union and the Cayman Islands, where its team operates. Ethereum's sentiment problem Ethereum was the darling of the 2017 bull market and subsequent ICO boom and was the dominant smart contract chain as DeFi and NFTs animated the 2020-22 boom. This cycle, however, the Ethereum network has been criticized for a drawn-out roadmap as the market centers on memecoins and faster blockchains like Solana. Ether is currently trading at around $1,965, having lost 40% of its value over the past 12-months. Solana, meanwhile, is trading at $131 having lost just 25% of its value in the same period. ""Some of that [negative sentiment] is clearly engineered by competing ecosystems. The Solana folks are out there every single day talking to investors and allocators and media and just spreading bulls**t about ether,"" Silagadze said. ""If you actually dissect those arguments, they're incoherent. But those memes are floating around, and that has an effect.""",Finance|Ethereum|Restaking|Ether.Fi|Yield Farming,EN,0,0,ETH|AIRDROP|MARKET|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-20 17:37:57

The trader, who reportedly made around $20 million in profits, has now been linked to illegal activities that include phishing and online gambling scams. According to ZachXBT, the trader managed highly leveraged positions on platforms like Hyperliquid and GMX between January and March 2025. The whale first attracted attention after two particularly well-timed trades: He made a profit of $10 million by opening a large ETH and BTC long position with 50X leverage just before US President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency reserve announcement. He opened a BTC short position with 40X leverage, resulting in a profit of $9 million. Further blockchain analysis revealed that the trader using the wallet address 0xf3F4 had connections to several cryptocurrency services, including Roobet, Binance, Gamdom, ChangeNOW, Shuffle, Alphapo, BC Game, and Metawin. ZachXBT spotted a message signed by 0xf3F4 for account X, @qwatio, in which the trader claimed to have made $20 million from GMX and Hyperliquid. However, the account showed signs of being recently purchased and had been inactive for years before suddenly reviving. Further analysis linked this wallet to phishing activity, specifically a withdrawal fee recipient on the phishing site in January 2025. The 0x7ab address was flagged as the first Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) address used by 0xf3F4, and transaction histories showed it received funds linked to phishing schemes. Related News: JUST IN: Tron Founder Justin Sun Said ""Big News is Coming"", Finally Reveals What It Is Today Tracing financial sources, ZachXBT discovered that 0x7ab was linked to multiple illegal withdrawals centered around Solana. An inside source for the casino scam confirmed that the funds came from an input validation exploit, further raising concerns about illicit activity tied to the whale’s trading profits. A Telegram search pointed to the trader’s posts in GMX-related groups, further solidifying connections between on-chain activity and the identified individual. Specifically, a payment from 0xe4d3 was traced to a UK-based recipient, revealing a phone number registered to an individual named William Parker. Public records show that William Parker, formerly known as Alistair Packover (William Peckover), has a history of fraudulent activities in the United Kingdom dating back to the early 2010s. Parker was arrested in 2023 for stealing approximately $1 million from two casinos and was later convicted in Finland. Parker apparently used these illegally obtained funds for highly leveraged trades. *This is not investment advice.

Michael Kong Unveils Sonic’s Launch and Beyond TL;DR Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared (decentralized) sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of 180M daily transactions at sub-second finality, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely… pic.twitter.com/AFEYxddC09 — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) March 25, 2024 Fantom fully rebranded as Sonic on January 16, 2025, to reposition itself within the market. As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.5346 Market Cap $1.53B Trading Volume $182.7M Circulating Supply 3.17B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.5558 24-h Low $0.5064 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 22.14% 50-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 49.42 Green Days 13/30 (43%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Sonic is consolidating with resistance around $0.6979 and support near $0.3662 The MACD on the 4-hour chart is turning bullish while the RSI remains neutral A breakout above $0.55 could push prices higher but failure to hold above $0.50 may lead to a retest of lower support levels Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart Sonic/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on March 20, Sonic (SONIC) is experiencing a recovery attempt after a recent downtrend. The price is testing the middle Bollinger Band near $0.5320, with resistance at $0.6979 and support at $0.3662. The RSI at 41.93 suggests neutral momentum, with room for upward movement if buying pressure increases. A break above the $0.5320 resistance level could trigger a bullish continuation, but failure to hold current levels may result in another retracement. Overall, the market remains uncertain, and traders should monitor whether the price sustains above the mid-Bollinger Band for further directional confirmation. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart S/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (SONIC) shows signs of consolidation near the middle Bollinger Band at $0.5089, with resistance at $0.5498 and support at $0.4679. The MACD histogram is in positive territory, indicating mild bullish momentum, while the Balance of Power at 0.31 suggests buying interest. If the price maintains above $0.5089, a push towards the upper Bollinger Band near $0.55 is possible. However, if it fails to hold, a drop to $0.4679 could occur. A decisive breakout above $0.55 could trigger further gains, while rejection may lead to sideways movement or a correction.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Sonic (SONIC) is in a consolidation phase with mixed signals. The 1-day chart shows resistance at $0.6979 and support at $0.3662, while the 4-hour chart suggests a short-term support level near $0.4679. The MACD on the 4-hour chart remains slightly bullish, indicating potential upward momentum, while the RSI on both timeframes hovers near neutral, suggesting indecisiveness. A break above $0.55 could push Sonic toward the $0.60-$0.65 range, but failure to sustain could lead to a retest of $0.4679. Overall, caution is advised as volatility remains high. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.92 price by 2025 and $6.21 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $5 by 2029, with price predictions suggesting a high of $5.39. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic can approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $10. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast that prices could reach between $8.51 and $9.32, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev. FTM) Sonic announced recently that Pendle is now live on Sonic.

This is not a new statement. The US companies, including his are suffering the same fate. This is simply going to deaf ears. Accenture is one of 10 consulting companies that the Trump administration is going after as part of Musk’s DOGE crackdown on wasteful spending. Today, the company said that new work for the US government slowed sharply after President Donald Trump’s administration took office. It accounted for about 8% of its $16.7bn in global revenue in the quarter ended February 28. Accenture chief executive Julie Sweet during an analyst call, said, “The new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue.” A federal filing from last week said that an Accenture contract that could have brought in up to $5 million in extra work by 2027 had been terminated for convenience. As of now, $10 million has been spent on this contract since 2021. It was the tenth Accenture contract or subcontract that the Trump government ended. Accenture proves its value to GSA The 10 highest-paid government consulting companies will earn $65 billion in fees between 2025 and beyond. The General Services Administration told departments and agencies that they had to prove the value of their consulting contracts with the other 10 companies or get rid of them. Julie Sweet has her answer. She said, “We see major opportunities over time for us to help consolidate, modernize, and reinvent the federal government to drive a whole new level of efficiency.” Accenture had also said it was ending its DEI programs. However, she warned, “While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government’s priorities evolve and these assessments unfold.” Some experts thought the company would lower its earnings forecast for the whole year. It didn’t happen. Instead, it said that the new business trends were very recent. Meanwhile, it looks like Accenture shares will open at their lowest level since July of last year. This was because they dropped more than 5% in pre-market trading today. Consulting firms on the brink of losing millions from the government The 10 consulting firms are Deloitte Consulting LLP, Accenture Federal Services LLC, General Dynamics IT, Booz Allen, Hamilton, Leidos, Guidehouse, Hill Mission Technologies Corp., Science Applications International Corp., CGI Federal, and IBM. Booz Allen Hamilton may be the only consulting firm that stands to lose as much. The company gets 98% of its business from the US government, and its contracts include everything from web services for national parks to hacking tools for the defense industry. In a recent interview, Booz Allen Hamilton’s CEO, Horacio Rozanski, said that the company works more like a tech company than a consulting firm. However, he may have said this to separate the company from the bad reputation that consultancies have. Revenues for Booz Allen Hamilton were $2.92 billion, which is 13.5% more than the same time last year. This print was 1.7% better than what experts were expecting. For the most part, it was a good quarter for the company. Source: Yahoo Finance Unfortunately, since Trump took office in January, Booz Allen Hamilton’s stock has dropped by about 30%. However, it has risen slightly since the beginning of March. Other consulting firms have long been criticized for sending government agencies huge bills. They have now tried to fix the problems Deloitte caused when it told its workers to remove pronouns from their email signatures. These actions were likely meant to please the Trump administration. McKinsey, on the other hand, has been mostly banned from getting contracts from the US federal government. This was after having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in court settlements for their work for Purdue Pharma promoting highly addictive opioid drugs. Congressmen also asked a lot of questions about the company’s work with the Chinese government. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Gabriela Battiato, lawyer and Legal Coordinator of NGO Bitcoin Argentina, led an in-depth discussion on Bitcoin’s philosophy, evolution, and the ongoing global regulatory debates surrounding its adoption. “This is a key step toward legislative recognition of the crypto ecosystem. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are already part of the economic reality, and it is essential that strategic decision-makers have clear and accurate information,” said Ricardo Mihura, President of NGO Bitcoin Argentina. The conference was spearheaded by Senator Antonio José Rodas, with the participation of Senator Mariana Juri of Mendoza, and showcased growing bipartisan interest in understanding and integrating Bitcoin within Argentina’s legal framework. Their discussion on Bitcoin focused on the transformative potential of it and its increasing role in global finance. “This event sets a precedent and reinforces our goal of bringing knowledge about Bitcoin and blockchain to all sectors of society. We will continue promoting these spaces because we believe that only through dialogue and education can we build appropriate regulations and foster the development of the sector,” said Jimena Vallone, Executive Director of NGO Bitcoin Argentina.

The ETF is the latest in a slew of filings for new US investment products tied to spot cryptocurrencies, including altcoins and memecoins. According to the filing , the ETF is intended to hold spot PENGU as well as various Pudgy Penguins NFTs. It would be the first US ETF to hold NFTs if approved. Additionally, “[t]he Trust will also hold other digital assets, such as SOL and ETH, that are necessary or incidental to the purchase, sale and transfer of the Trust’s PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs,” the filing said. Launched in December , PUDGY has a roughly $438-million market capitalization as of March 20, according to CoinGecko. On March 18, Canary filed to list the first US ETF holding Sui ( SUI ), the native token of the Sui layer-1 blockchain network. Pudgy Penguins is among the most popular NFT brands. Source: Cointelegraph Related: Canary Capital proposes first Sui ETF in US SEC filing Policy reversal The US Securities and Exchange Commission has acknowledged dozens of filings for new crypto investment products since US President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. They include filings for proposed ETFs for native L1 tokens such as Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ), as well as for memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Official Trump (TRUMP). Some industry analysts are skeptical that ETFs holding non-core cryptocurrencies will see a meaningful uptake among traditional investors. “Pengu ETF announced. Price barely goes up. New ETFs for crypto assets have become an irrelevant joke,” crypto researcher Alex Krüger said in a March 20 post on the X platform. “Most crypto ETFs will fail to attract AUM and cost issuers money.” Since starting his second presidential term, Trump has reversed the US government’s stance on digital assets, promising to make America “the world’s crypto capital.” Under his predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, US regulatory agencies brought upward of 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms. On March 20, asset manager Volatility Shares launched two Solana futures ETFs , the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT). They use financial derivatives to track SOL’s performance with one- and two-time leverage, respectively. Spot SOL ETFs are still awaiting regulatory approval.

One of them is the asset’s hot supply, which refers to the amount of BTC that is available for trading. According to a tweet from the on-chain intelligence platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s Hot Supply, a metric that tracks BTC aged ≤1 week, has recorded a 50% decline in three months. This plunge has caused coins aged a week or less to contract from 5.9% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply to 2.8%. #Bitcoin ‘s Hot Supply metric, which tracks coins aged ≤1 week, has contracted from 5.9% to 2.8% of circulating supply – a 50%+ decline over the past 3 months. This signals a sharp reduction in liquid $BTC available for trade: https://t.co/VVw6YXRDHS pic.twitter.com/dfmTOyg5yr — glassnode (@glassnode) March 20, 2025 Bitcoin’s Hot Supply Has Dropped A decline in Bitcoin’s hot supply could be a bullish or bearish sign. In a bullish scenario, fewer BTC being actively traded or moved could mean many things, including increased holding behavior, market stability, or potential supply shock. In the case of increasing holding behavior, investors could be opting to hold onto their assets rather than engage in short-term trading, especially with the crypto market currently in an unfavorable condition. When investors opt to hold more, it often reflects bullish sentiment because they are anticipating future price rallies. A decline in hot supply often contributes to reduced volatility because the market tends to witness fewer sudden price swings as fewer bitcoins are traded. This leads to a more stable market, giving room for price recoveries and possibly rallies in the medium term. In addition, as the number of BTC in active circulation decreases, the available supply of the original cryptocurrency for trading reduces. Under stable or high-demand conditions, the low hot supply can trigger a supply shock, often applying positive pressure on Bitcoin’s price. It is worth noting that demand needs to be high for a supply shock to happen; unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Bullish or Bearish? Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin market is seeing weaker demand than three to four months ago. This is seen in the number of BTC flowing into exchanges. Bitcoin inflows have fallen 54% from 58,600 BTC per day to 26,900 BTC. The market analytics firm said this plunge in exchange inflow also aligns with declining investor sentiment and capital flows. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen some of their highest daily outflows in recent weeks, reflecting a huge lack of demand. However, these ETFs have recorded three days of inflows this week, indicating that demand may be recovering. So, the plunge in Bitcoin’s hot supply may turn out to be a bullish signal after all.

The entrepreneur noted that the proceedings lasted more than four years. ”Reflecting today on what happened, it looks pretty clear to me that the case was doomed from the start. In many ways, this was the first major shot in the war against cryptocurrencies,” he said. In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, accusing the company of selling $1.3 billion worth of unregistered XRP securities, with Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen also named as defendants. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that programmatic sales and other distributions of the Ripple token did not constitute an offer and sale of investment contracts. However, according to the ruling, the marketing of the coins to large players violated securities laws. The court dismissed the SEC's interlocutory appeal, finding that it lacked sufficient evidence and that its consideration would not ”materially advance the ultimate dismissal of the case.” Subsequently, the Commission dismissed the suit against Garlinghouse and Larsen. The parties entered into a settlement agreement that precluded further charges on the former grounds. In August 2024, Judge Torres issued a final judgment in the case, fining Ripple $125 million. The regulator originally claimed $2 billion. In October, the SEC contested the verdict. The agency took steps to reconsider the court's earlier decisions in terms of misapplying the law. The Commission proposed to revisit offerings and sales of XRP on digital asset platforms, Garlinghouse's and Larsen's involvement, and distributions of the token ”in exchange for consideration other than cash.” ”Ripple proved to be the first company with the resources, determination and grit to fight the regulator's overreach, and today that journey is finally coming to an end. This is a victory and a long overdue capitulation by the SEC,” Garlinghouse emphasized. He thanked industry participants for Ripple's support during the proceedings with the regulator. The entrepreneur made a special mention of the role of the company's general counsel Stuart Alderoti; The latter has already stated that the firm will consider how ”best to file a cross-appeal” with the SEC. Quotes of XRP on the background of the news rose by ~15%. The price of the token rose to levels near $2.6. The Crypto Community's Reaction to Ripple's Victory Over the SEC The struggle with Ripple before his departure was unleashed by the former head of the Commission Jay Clayton. Many expected that the regulator would give up pressure on the project amid the change of SEC chairman, but it didn't happen. Under the leadership of the new chief commissioner, Gary Gensler, the Ripple team faced a wave of complaints. Crypto-loyal Commissioner Mark Wedd was appointed acting chairman of the Commission under Trump. It was under his administration that the SEC capitulated in the case against Ripple. Crypto community reaction Crypto investors rushed to congratulate the Ripple team with the long-awaited victory. Among them, the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Government Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chris Giancarlo extended his congratulations to the developers of Ripple. The team was also congratulated by Coinbase crypto exchange founder Brian Armstrong, former U.S. presidential communications aide Anthony Scaramucci, and many other crypto businessmen and prominent political figures. Many members of the cryptocommunity are confident that XRP will rise in value on the back of the news. The growth of the Ripple cryptocurrency, according to optimists, will also help the launch of ETFs based on the coin. Different predictions are heard online. While some wait XRP at $20, others are sure that the cryptocurrency will soon be worth tens of hundreds of dollars. Can XRP Upgrade ATH? XRP buyers are in complete control The DMI chart for XRP shows a notable shift, with the ADX (Average Directional Index) rising to 20.4 from 15.64 following the news that the SEC has withdrawn its lawsuit against Ripple. This rise indicates a strengthening market trend. Additionally, the +DI rose from 18.3 to 39, while the -DI fell from 19.63 to 12.97, indicating a clear bullish divergence. The surge in buying activity (+DI) and weakening bearish signal (-DI) confirm that XRP is looking to maintain and develop an uptrend. If this trend continues, we can expect further gains in the near term thanks to the strengthening bullish momentum. The Number of Active Ripple XRP Addresses Reaches New Records Activity in the XRP network has increased significantly: over the past 7 days, the number of active addresses has reached a record 1.19 million. For comparison: on February 27, the figure was only 237,000, which means almost fivefold growth. The growth in the number of active addresses is a signal that the XRP blockchain is attracting more participants, including retail traders and institutional investors. Such dynamics may also portend an inflow of new capital into the cryptocurrency. While this doesn't guarantee an immediate price increase, online activity could support the XRP price and reduce downside risks, especially when combined with other positive technical or fundamental factors. XRP Outlook: Whether A Rise to $3 is Possible At the time of writing this analysis, XRP traded at $2.41. The growth of the token over the last day amounted to 8.3%. The EMA lines are now pointing to the possible formation of a new ”golden cross” in the near future. On the other hand, if the XRP price fails to stay above the current range, a new downtrend may start. In this case, the support level at $2.37 will be key. A break below this level could increase downsides risks for XRP: then the price would retest $2.21 and possibly $1.90.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-20 17:44:46

If you ask Morpho, Pyth Network and Re7 Labs, the answer is: no one. That’s exactly what happened in early March when “jameis” — a user of an Re7 vault on Morpho — found their cbETH-backed loan liquidated due to a price feed delay between Pyth’s cbETH/USD and ETH/USD feeds. While ETH’s price kept updating, cbETH’s remained frozen for nearly an hour. The result? A price ratio distortion that triggered liquidations, even though the cbETH/ETH ratio never actually diverged in reality. The blame game begins Faced with a $33,000 loss, jameis turned to the Morpho governance forum — where they go by “chicitybulls” — and Morpho’s Discord to demand answers. But instead of a resolution, they found themself caught in a circle of decentralized responsibility-dodging: To paraphrase: Morpho’s stance: We’re oracle-agnostic . Vault curators (Re7) choose their own oracles. We just provide the infrastructure. Pyth’s stance: Our prices were accurate. We’re permissionless. Someone (Re7, or even the user) should have run an extra scheduler to update the feed. Re7 Labs’ stance: Yeah, there was a timing mismatch…but that’s just how push-based oracles work. We’ll improve our setup next time. No one has claimed direct responsibility. No one has offered compensation. The devil is in the details. This wasn’t an exploit or price manipulation, but rather an architectural failure: Pyth’s push-based model meant price updates weren’t automatically synchronized. Re7 Labs did not run an independent scheduler to ensure updates stayed in sync. Morpho, despite offering the vault listings, does not enforce reliability standards for oracle updates — leaving it up to the curator. The liquidation bot saw the distorted price, deemed the position underwater and executed the liquidation. That was it — game over for the user’s 14 ETH. $30,000 is a small sum in the grand scheme of DeFi, a minor tragedy that won’t make the Rekt leaderboard . But the incident reflects a problem with much bigger ramifications: What happens when decentralized responsibility means no accountability? We all know the adage code is law , but what is a yield farming minnow to do here? Decentralization is often sold as a fix for TradFi’s opacity and unfairness, but this case highlights its own set of flaws. In TradFi, if a brokerage incorrectly liquidates your position due to faulty data, you have legal recourse. In DeFi? You sometimes get forum replies about permissionless infrastructure. It seems clear that Re7 Labs could have implemented safeguards, such as a timestamp verification to prevent liquidations based on stale data. Pyth could also improve its scheduling guarantees instead of shifting the burden onto integrators. Morpho still can blacklist curators via its frontend, so it has a regulatory hand at which vaults get listed on its platform (or which curators get the boot). Instead, all parties claim it’s not their problem. Re7 didn’t return a request for comment. A Morpho spokesperson said in practice that “unless [curators] are deliberately trying to scam, vaults are displayed on Morpho’s frontend,” calling the platform “completely unopinionated and [a] neutral infrastructure.” Marc Tillement, director of Pyth Data Association, told Blockworks “if the vault manager (or the protocol, in some cases) had run its own scheduler or an extra scheduler to trigger price updates themselves, this issue could have been avoided.” Meanwhile, the user — who evidently did nothing unusual or unduly risky — is hung out to dry. If DeFi is to scale beyond a niche of power user whales, risk curation has to come with some responsibility attached when users suffer unintended losses. Without accountability mechanisms — be it insurance, fund recovery processes or stricter oracle integration standards — events like this will keep happening. For now, one thing is clear: “Jameis” lost 14 ETH, and none of the parties cares enough to make it right. Get the news in your inbox.

The Eurozone just hit a speed bump, and it’s sending ripples through the forex market. The Euro is currently experiencing a noticeable dip, and the culprit? Recent remarks from the European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde regarding potential growth reduction. For those of you tracking the pulse of global finance, this is more than just a blip on the radar – it’s a significant tremor that could have far-reaching consequences. Let’s dive deep into what’s happening and what it means for you. Decoding the ECB’s Growth Reduction Forecast: What’s the Fuss About? So, what exactly did the ECB President say that caused this stir? In recent statements, Christine Lagarde hinted at a possible downward revision of the Eurozone’s growth forecasts. This isn’t just economic jargon; it translates to a potentially slower pace of economic expansion in the region. Why is this significant? Investor Sentiment: Financial markets thrive on optimism and growth prospects. When a major central bank like the ECB signals a potential slowdown, it can dampen investor sentiment. This often leads to investors becoming more risk-averse, and in the forex market, this can translate to selling off currencies perceived as being tied to weaker growth prospects – in this case, the Euro. Economic Outlook: Growth reduction isn’t just a number; it reflects real-world economic conditions. It could mean businesses scaling back investments, slower job creation, and potentially reduced consumer spending. These are all factors that can weigh down a currency’s value. Interest Rate Expectations: Central bank forecasts about growth heavily influence expectations about future interest rate policies. Slower growth might lead to expectations that the ECB will be less aggressive in raising interest rates, or even consider cutting them down the line to stimulate the economy. Lower interest rate expectations generally make a currency less attractive to investors seeking yield, contributing to its depreciation. In essence, the ECB’s cautious outlook on growth has acted as a **powerful** signal to the market, prompting a reassessment of the Euro’s strength. The Domino Effect: How Growth Reduction Triggers a Euro Dip in the Forex Market Now, let’s connect the dots between growth reduction forecasts and the immediate dip in the Euro in the forex market . The forex market is a complex ecosystem where currencies are constantly traded based on a multitude of factors, and expectations play a massive role. Here’s how the ECB’s remarks triggered the Euro’s recent slide: 1. Immediate Market Reaction: News of potential growth reduction is digested by sophisticated algorithms and human traders in milliseconds. The initial reaction is often instinctive – sell the currency associated with weaker growth. This is precisely what we witnessed with the Euro. 2. Flight to Safety: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often seek refuge in perceived ‘safe-haven’ currencies or assets. A weaker Eurozone growth outlook might lead some investors to shift funds to currencies like the US Dollar or the Swiss Franc, further exacerbating the Euro’s decline. 3. Speculative Positioning: Forex markets are also driven by speculation. Traders attempt to anticipate future currency movements and position themselves to profit. ECB’s comments might have encouraged speculative bets against the Euro, adding downward pressure. 4. Algorithmic Trading: A significant portion of forex trading is now automated. Algorithms are programmed to react to specific keywords and economic indicators. Mentions of “growth reduction” or “economic slowdown” from a central bank are likely to trigger automated sell orders for the related currency. 5. Reduced Demand for Euro Assets: A weaker growth outlook can diminish the attractiveness of Eurozone assets, such as stocks and bonds. Foreign investors might reduce their exposure to these assets, leading to less demand for the Euro to purchase them. Think of it like this: imagine a company announcing lower than expected earnings. Investors would likely sell off the company’s stock, causing its price to drop. Similarly, when the ECB hints at weaker Eurozone growth, the ‘price’ of the Euro in the forex market tends to fall. Interest Rates in the Spotlight: The Link to Euro’s Trajectory The dance between interest rates and currency values is a fundamental aspect of forex trading. Central bank interest rate decisions are crucial determinants of currency strength. How does the ECB’s growth outlook tie into interest rates and the Euro’s recent dip? Current ECB Stance: The ECB, like many other central banks, has been in a tightening cycle, raising interest rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates generally attract foreign investment, boosting demand for a currency. Growth Concerns and Rate Hike Expectations: However, if the ECB is concerned about growth reduction, it might become less inclined to aggressively raise interest rates further. Or, in a more extreme scenario, if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly, the ECB might even consider pausing rate hikes or eventually cutting rates. Impact on Euro’s Appeal: If the market anticipates a less hawkish (less interest-rate-hiking) ECB, the Euro becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors. Investors might prefer currencies from countries with central banks expected to maintain or increase interest rates more aggressively. This reduced appeal can contribute to the Euro’s depreciation. Future Rate Path Uncertainty: The ECB’s growth concerns introduce uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. This uncertainty itself can weigh on the Euro. Forex markets dislike ambiguity, and when the future direction of interest rates becomes less clear, it can lead to volatility and potentially downward pressure on the currency. Essentially, the market is now trying to gauge how the ECB will balance its fight against inflation with the emerging risks to economic growth. The more the market believes that growth concerns will limit the ECB’s ability to raise interest rates, the more pressure the Euro is likely to face. Navigating the Forex Market Turbulence: Key Considerations The current situation in the forex market surrounding the Euro and ECB remarks presents both challenges and opportunities. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just keeping an eye on economic developments, here are some key considerations: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ECB communications, economic data releases from the Eurozone, and global economic trends. Market sentiment can shift rapidly based on new information. Risk Management is Crucial: Volatility in the forex market can increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Diversification: Avoid over-exposure to any single currency. Diversifying your portfolio across different currencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment indicators and news flow. Market psychology can play a significant role in short-term currency movements. Consider Professional Advice: If you’re unsure about navigating the complexities of the forex market, consider seeking guidance from a qualified financial advisor. Remember, forex markets are dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Understanding the underlying drivers, such as central bank policies and economic growth prospects, is essential for making informed decisions. The Broader Economic Landscape: Eurozone Growth and Global Implications The potential growth reduction in the Eurozone isn’t just a regional issue; it has implications for the broader global economy. The Eurozone is a major economic bloc, and its performance can influence global trade, investment flows, and overall economic sentiment. Global Trade Impact: A slowdown in the Eurozone economy could reduce demand for imports from other countries, potentially impacting global trade flows. Countries that rely heavily on exports to the Eurozone might feel the pinch. Investor Confidence: Economic weakness in a major region like the Eurozone can dent global investor confidence. This can lead to increased risk aversion and potentially affect other markets, including emerging economies. Currency Cross-Rates: The Euro’s movements in the forex market influence other currency pairs. For instance, a weaker Euro against the US Dollar can have ripple effects on other currency crosses, impacting trading strategies and global currency dynamics. Policy Responses: The ECB’s actions in response to growth concerns will be closely watched by other central banks globally. Their policy decisions can have a cascading effect on global monetary policy and financial markets. In an interconnected global economy, developments in the Eurozone, especially concerning growth, resonate far beyond its borders. Monitoring these trends is crucial for understanding the broader economic landscape. The Future of the Euro: Navigating Uncertainty The Euro’s recent dip following the ECB President’s remarks underscores the inherent uncertainty in the forex market and the global economic outlook. What does the future hold for the Euro? Dependence on Economic Data: The Euro’s trajectory in the coming weeks and months will heavily depend on incoming economic data from the Eurozone. Key indicators like inflation, GDP growth, employment figures, and business sentiment will provide crucial clues about the actual extent of the growth slowdown and the ECB’s likely response. ECB Policy Communication: The ECB’s future policy statements and press conferences will be closely scrutinized by the market. Clarity and consistency in communication are essential for managing market expectations and reducing volatility. Global Economic Factors: External factors, such as the global energy crisis, geopolitical tensions, and the pace of growth in other major economies, will also play a significant role in shaping the Euro’s outlook. Potential for Rebound: It’s important to remember that currency markets are cyclical. If economic data from the Eurozone turns out to be more resilient than currently feared, or if the ECB manages to effectively address growth concerns, the Euro could potentially rebound. In conclusion, the Euro’s recent dip serves as a reminder of the constant flux in the forex market and the sensitivity of currencies to economic news and central bank signals. Staying informed, managing risk, and understanding the broader economic context are key to navigating these turbulent times.

Ethereum ( ETH ) peaked at $4,105 in December and was trading at $1,970 on March 20. This 52% crash makes it one of the worst-performing blue-chip coins in the market. Ether has crashed as concerns about its future remain. Just this week, Standard Chartered analysts downgraded their estimate by 60% from $10,000 to $4,000, citing the rising competition from layer-1 and layer-2 networks that have affected its revenue growth. Layer-2 networks on Ethereum, like Coinbase’s Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, have drawn more users to their ecosystems because of their lower fees. For example, DeFi Llama’s data shows that DEX Ethereum protocols handled over $9.8 billion in volume in the last seven days. Arbitrum handled $2.87 billion, while Base had $2.8 billion. In the past, this volume would have been handled on Ethereum’s mainnet network. Ethereum is also seeing intensified competition from layer-1 networks like Solana ( SOL ) and BNB Chain. BNB Smart Chain’s DEX protocols handled DEX volume worth over $13 billion in the last seven days. Ethereum is also not expected to be a major beneficiary of emerging technologies like Real World Asset tokenization because of its higher fees and slower speed. Instead, developers may opt to use other scalable and cheaper networks like Mantra ( OM ) and BNB Chain.

The chart below from Santiment shows that Ethereum had 461,000 active addresses on Wednesday, down from 717,000 earlier this year. Another notable data point is Ethereum’s realized cap HODL wave, which is shown in blue. It has crashed to the lowest point since August last year, a sign that long-term holders have started to sell. The 365-day mean dollar invested age or MDIA, which calculates the duration that each coin has stayed in an address and all the money used to buy it, has dropped to its September lows. Ethereum daily active addresses, MDIA, and realized cap | Source: Santiment Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ETH price has been in a strong downward trend over the past few months. This drop started after it formed a triple-top pattern at $4,000, with the neckline at $2,120. Ether then formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed each other. This cross often leads to more downside momentum. Also, popular oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and Percentage Price Oscillator have dropped. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the psychological point at $1,500, which is about 25% below the current level.

Well, prominent crypto analyst PlanB has dropped a truth bomb that might just recalibrate your expectations. Buckle up, because according to PlanB, the real Bitcoin bull market? It hasn’t even started yet! Has the Bitcoin Bull Market Truly Eluded Us? PlanB Thinks So PlanB, the pseudonymous analyst famed for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a perspective that’s causing ripples across the crypto community. His core message is stark: what we’ve seen so far isn’t the main event. He points to a key indicator – the divergence between arithmetic and geometric means – as evidence that the true, explosive phase of the Bitcoin bull market is still on the horizon. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, or even just the curious observer? Let’s break down PlanB’s intriguing analysis and explore what it could signify for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Decoding PlanB’s Divergence Theory: Arithmetic vs. Geometric Means To understand PlanB’s perspective, we need to delve into the statistical concepts he highlights: arithmetic and geometric means. Don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds! Arithmetic Mean: This is your everyday average. You sum up a set of numbers and divide by the count of those numbers. Think of it as a simple, linear average. Geometric Mean: This mean is particularly useful when dealing with percentages, growth rates, or ratios over time. Instead of summing, you multiply the numbers and then take the nth root (where n is the count of numbers). It provides a more accurate representation of average growth over time, especially when dealing with compounding effects. PlanB’s argument hinges on the idea that in a genuine bull market, both the arithmetic and geometric means of Bitcoin’s price should converge or move in closer alignment. The current divergence, according to him, suggests that while we’ve seen price appreciation, it hasn’t been the kind of sustained, explosive growth characteristic of a full-blown Bitcoin bull market . No Bull Market Yet? No Bear Market Then! Here’s another intriguing layer to PlanB’s analysis: “Without a bull market, a bear market cannot follow.” This statement might sound counterintuitive at first glance. Typically, bull markets are followed by bear markets – it’s the cyclical nature of markets, right? PlanB’s point is that if we haven’t experienced the *true* euphoric, parabolic bull run, then the subsequent correction or downturn won’t be a traditional “bear market” in the same vein as those following previous cycle peaks. It suggests that any price retracement from the current levels might be more of a consolidation phase before the *actual* Bitcoin bull market ignites. Understanding the Stock-to-Flow Model and PlanB’s Track Record Why should we pay attention to PlanB’s pronouncements? His credibility largely stems from the stock-to-flow (S2F) model. Let’s briefly understand what this model is and why it has garnered attention in the crypto space: Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model: This model, popularized by PlanB, applies a concept traditionally used for commodities like gold and silver to Bitcoin. It essentially measures the scarcity of an asset by dividing the “stock” (existing supply) by the “flow” (newly mined supply). The higher the ratio, the scarcer the asset is considered to be, and theoretically, the more valuable it should become over time. S2F and Bitcoin: PlanB argued that Bitcoin’s increasing scarcity, driven by its halving events (which reduce the flow of new Bitcoin), makes it a prime candidate for the stock-to-flow model. His model predicted significant Bitcoin price appreciation over time, and in previous cycles, it has shown a degree of accuracy. Track Record: While no model is perfect, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, PlanB’s S2F model has been closely watched by many crypto investors due to its past predictive power. This is why his current analysis carries weight within the community. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Strategy? Actionable Insights So, if PlanB is suggesting the main Bitcoin bull market is yet to come, what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Manage Expectations: Don’t get carried away by the current market optimism and assume we’re already at the peak. PlanB’s analysis suggests there could be more significant upside potential ahead. Long-Term Perspective: This reinforces the importance of a long-term investment horizon in crypto. If the major bull run is still pending, then patience could be key. Further Research: Don’t rely solely on one analyst’s opinion. Do your own due diligence. Explore different crypto analysis models, indicators, and expert opinions to form a well-rounded view. Portfolio Strategy: Consider how this information fits into your overall portfolio strategy. Are you positioned to capitalize on a potential future bull market? Are you prepared for potential volatility in the interim? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on metrics like arithmetic and geometric mean divergence, as well as other indicators that PlanB and other analysts might highlight in the future. Continuous learning is crucial in the fast-paced crypto world. Challenges and Counterarguments It’s essential to approach any market analysis, including PlanB’s, with a critical eye. Here are some potential challenges and counterarguments to consider: Model Limitations: The stock-to-flow model, while influential, is not without its critics. Some argue that it oversimplifies market dynamics and doesn’t account for unforeseen events or shifts in market sentiment. Black Swan Events: Unpredictable “black swan” events (like major regulatory changes or global economic shocks) can significantly impact crypto markets and potentially invalidate any model’s predictions. Divergence Interpretation: The interpretation of arithmetic and geometric mean divergence is subjective. Other analysts might interpret the data differently or prioritize other indicators. Market Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving. What held true in past cycles may not necessarily apply in the same way to future cycles. New factors and dynamics could come into play. The Allure of Price Prediction and Crypto Analysis The crypto space is inherently intertwined with price prediction and crypto analysis . The allure of significant returns and the volatility of the market drive intense interest in understanding where prices might be headed. Analysts like PlanB play a crucial role in providing frameworks and models to navigate this complex landscape. However, it’s vital to remember that: No Guarantees: No analyst, model, or prediction can guarantee future price movements in the crypto market. Risk Management: Always prioritize risk management in your crypto investments. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Informed Decisions: Use analysis and predictions as tools to inform your decisions, not as definitive guides. Combine different perspectives and conduct your own thorough research. Conclusion: Prepare for a Potentially Explosive Future Bitcoin Bull Market PlanB’s assertion that the Bitcoin bull market hasn’t truly begun is a powerful statement that challenges conventional market perceptions. By highlighting the divergence of arithmetic and geometric means, he presents a compelling argument for why the most exciting phase of this cycle might still be ahead of us. Whether his prediction proves accurate or not, it serves as a valuable reminder to manage expectations, stay informed, and maintain a long-term perspective in the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The potential for a truly explosive Bitcoin bull market is still on the table, and that’s a thrilling prospect for the crypto community.

The specific price for a new asset is not disclosed, but the Foundation will tap some of the Tier 1 funds in crypto space. The TON Foundation, an entity for developing projects on the TON blockchain, has expanded with new sources of financing. The Foundation announced a $400M token-based financing round backed by some of the biggest funds in the industry. The investors will buy additional TON in order to support the ecosystem. TON Foundation will draw funding from Sequoia Capital, Ribbit, Benchmark, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Draper Associates, and others. The TON Foundation itself works as a Tier 3 fund, with curated investments and programs for TON-based startups and projects. TON Foundation aims to onboard more Telegram users to Web3 apps The Telegram app is the main growth factor for the potential adoption of the TON Chain. The chat app already carries over 1B monthly active users, of which several million have tried crypto-related groups. The $400M in fresh capital will target precisely those users, with another drive to achieve mainstream crypto adoption. The TON Chain already offers several tools for combining the app with on-chain interaction, including the TON token and Stars, as well as turning the app’s stickers into NFT. ‘The TON ecosystem has huge potential energy and a significant distribution advantage, especially in gaming, stablecoin payments, and remittances, ’ said Alex Felix, Co-Founder and CIO at CoinFund. ‘ As exemplified through our investment in StonFi, CoinFund continues to be bullish on the growth of the TON ecosystem as a whole and the opportunities ahead for the Foundation. ’ The TON Foundation also aims to drive the adoption of the TON Chain as part of the Telegram ecosystem. The Foundation is now driving the TON Chain’s expansion to the US market while striving to make the ecosystem more widely accepted. TON has become the exclusive Telegram asset, removing some wallet complexity and the usage of multiple coins and tokens. TON still aims to be among the top chains, tapping the Telegram user base. Currently, TON remains a relatively niche token, limited to specific usages in Telegram groups. The TON Foundation aims to increase that number of interactions. By 2028, the Foundation aims to onboard up to 30% of Telegram users to Web3 and the TON Chain. There will be four main use cases to draw in mainstream users. The TON Foundation will work toward expanding stickers, gifts and other native digital assets on Telegram. Telegram mini-games, multiplayer features and other Web3 games with blockchain-backed assets can also continue to grow on Telegram. DeFi projects will also be integrated with the app, offering savings and secure yield generation. The Foundation will also support the creation of real-world payment utility through stablecoin transactions, remittances, and general financial services. The TON chain already has $160M in value locked, with another $908.4M in stablecoins, either bridged or native. Until now, the TON Foundation limited itself to seed rounds, mostly tied to general Web3 features on the TON Chain. The Foundation supported the Ston.Fi DEX, Hot Protocol, and the Fanton Fantasy game. Other TON-based projects have completed their own forms of fundraising while only receiving occasional support from grants. The TON ecosystem was highly active during the Web3 boom, and the native TON token managed to keep its price above $5 for months. However, the bearish market affected TON, along with other games and apps in the ecosystem. After the period of airdrop farming ended, most of the apps and groups lost users. TON also slid to a lower price range and moved away from the top 10 coins and tokens. TON traded at $3.77, ranked 13th based on market capitalization. TON may come under price pressure as more unlocks are expected in 2025. Currently, around 58M TON are unlocked, but by the end of the year, a total of over 166M TON will enter the market. The project will also add new owners after the $400M token purchase. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.83. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $4.60 and an average forecast price of $4.43. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon?

It has lost 3.34% of its value in 24 hours. EOS coin price faces resistance at $0.616. On March 20, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed a decreasing trend in the market. Its value dropped to $0.570 following the bearish strike. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 3.34% from its previous close. Despite the strong upswing in the past week, the market trends remained relatively bearish. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a bearish market trend for the currency. EOS/USD value has depreciated to $0.570 in the last 24 hours. The increasing volatility levels suggest a higher chance of reversal in the coming hours. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the market volatility. This distance is currently widening, leading to increasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to a $0.616 high. Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support band, has moved to $0.442. EOS/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is hovering within the neutral region. The indicator’s value receded to 53.20 during the day. This confirms a bearish victory for the day, as the coin value fell. The selling activities have been growing high, resulting in an unstable market. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin confirmed a downward trend for the cryptocurrency. Coin value has deteriorated to $0.5703 over the last four hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify an intensifying bearish swing. The Bollinger bands are narrowing down, leading to a decline in volatility.

EOS price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends. Cryptocurrency value has dropped down to $0.5703 in the past 24 hours. If observed from an overall view, the currency has lost up to 3.34% of value. Technical indicators give out a neutral verdict of the market scenario. However, the price charts continue to present a bearish trend for the day. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 97% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1.06. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent with bearish pressure. The coin decreased to $0.5703 in the past 24 hours. EOS will descent further if further resistance from the sellers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach the $2 level by the middle of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2032. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $4.60 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 76th ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $4.60 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinion on EOS EOS Network stands at the ninth spot for DEX Volume Growth of blockchains in the last 30 days.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS is trading near $0.638.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-20 18:01:00

In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Hougan says that the buying opportunity in crypto is now one of the best ever as the regulatory landscape has dramatically shifted under US President Donald Trump. “I think the market is underpricing the change in Washington. That’s actually surprised me. I know that Bitcoin ripped from $70,000 to $100,000, but I think the change is much greater than that. I look at what’s happening, not just in Bitcoin, but in DeFi (decentralized finance), even in alt layer-1s, and I think the market is just underestimating the change. The reason for that is, I think, unless you worked in crypto over the last four years, you can’t imagine how challenging it was… You look at what’s happened at the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) recently, pulling back on the Coinbase lawsuit, pulling back on the Uniswap lawsuit, I think just the rebound for that is 2x to 3x more than what we’ve seen in the market so far. So I guess I’ve been surprised that people haven’t sort of felt and intuited that difference, but now I recognize it’s because they didn’t know how bad we had it, and so therefore how open the market is now.” Hougan says the crypto markets are exhibiting strong fundamentals and he predicts companies and sovereign wealth funds will increasingly buy Bitcoin ( BTC ). “I think it’s a great long-term buying opportunity. I saw a tweet yesterday from Avichal [Garg] from Electric Capital that said, ‘Opportunity is fundamentals, minus perception,’ and the opportunity has never been greater in crypto if you use that math… Every time you see another company say it’s putting Bitcoin on its balance sheet that’s going to be another sort of pebble in the pond that lifts the tide. So there’s going to be a lot of this sort of slow turn. I think if we do see more sovereigns come out, I think maybe that could be the spark or catalyst, but I think it’s more of a slow bull market.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s hashrate climbed 3.8% in February to 810 EH/s, showing a slowdown in mining competition growth. However, the hashprice (the revenue that miners earn per unit of computing power) slipped to $45/PH/s, wiping out gains from the U.S. election-driven price surge. At this level, inefficient miners are feeling the strain. Transaction fees made up just 1.3% of total block rewards in February, marking their lowest share since the last bear market bottom in 2022. March is trending even lower, at 1.12% so far. These factors — alongside increased competition from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers — are putting extra pressure on mining operations who rely on hosting agreements and asset-light strategies. MARA remains the industry leader with 44 EH/s after a 6% hashrate increase, while CleanSpark grew 12% to 39 EH/s. Meanwhile, total bitcoin holdings among miners surpassed 100,000 BTC for the first time, despite some firms like HIVE Digital and Cipher Mining selling their production to fund expansion. Mining stocks took a hit, with the combined market capitalization of 15 major firms dropping from $36 billion in January to $22 billion in March. Cipher, Canaan, Hut 8, HIVE, and Bitdeer all saw losses exceeding 40%. With network growth slowing and energy costs rising, miners may need a Bitcoin price rally to avoid further financial strain.

While Bitcoin took years for returns, Lightchain AI raises $17.9m in presale, offering faster growth and opportunity. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s beginnings: Gradual rise to wealth Lightchain AI: The gateway to crypto growth Why investors are buzzing about Lightchain AI’s potential for big gains When Bitcoin (BTC) first launched, early investors waited years to see substantial returns as the cryptocurrency gradually gained global recognition. Today, the crypto market moves at a much faster pace, with game-changing projects like Lightchain AI offering opportunities for quicker growth. With an impressive $17.9 million raised during its presale and tokens priced at just $0.007, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a game-changer in the blockchain space, drawing the attention of investors eager for accelerated returns and innovation. You might also like: What sets Lightchain AI apart from Trump and Melania memecoins Bitcoin’s beginnings: Gradual rise to wealth Bitcoin, a digital currency, was unleashed on the world in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Its initial front-line troops were the techies and free thinkers who saw the potential of virtual money that was completely independent of any government or financial institution. For the most part, those who risked their hard-earned money to buy Bitcoin in its’ early years took a leap of faith that they would come out as the ultimate winners ultimately. The fact that these were kinds of investments that traditional fund managers would have never been interested in did not stop the so-called technology geeks from placing their bet on the game-changing currency. The print press was rarely heard of in those days, so almost everyone had no idea what blockchain technology was. What is more, there were only a few places that could exchange the currency. By the way, a major part of the Android Bitcoin Wallets is the “Watch-only” feature, which allows people to generate a new address that will not be saved on the phone storage and to view their balance and transactions. Then the creation of the new address becomes an essential element on a phone. This will ensure privacy and security. The popularity of Bitcoin began to flourish as more and more businesses started to accept it as a mode of payment and the advent of exchanges. Through the sharp increases and slowdowns over the past few years, Bitcoin has managed to become a big financial market. Lightchain AI: The gateway to crypto growth Lightchain AI is changing the crypto space by combining advanced blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Its AI-driven ecosystem processes complex computations in real-time, making it a powerful tool for industries like logistics, healthcare, and finance. This unique feature has already captured the attention of institutional investors and crypto whales. A standout achievement for Lightchain AI is its impressive presale, which has raised $17.9 million. With multi-chain compatibility and a focus on scalability, the platform integrates seamlessly with existing networks, paving the way for widespread adoption. For investors, Lightchain AI represents a game-changing opportunity with significant growth potential. Why investors are buzzing about Lightchain AI’s potential for big gains Lightchain AI isn’t just another blockchain — it’s a game-changer from day one. Unlike Bitcoin’s early days of limited use, Lightchain AI enters the market ready to make an impact with real-world applications. Its developer-friendly ecosystem fuels unique features, offering powerful tools and resources to create decentralized apps (dApps). This sparks a thriving community of creators, driving rapid growth and adoption. But that’s not all; Lightchain AI’s sustainable tokenomics model strikes the perfect balance between rewarding its ecosystem and preserving long-term value. For investors, this means the chance to ride a wave of exponential growth, as Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge solutions meet the rising demand for scalable, AI-powered blockchain technology.

On-chain data shows that Lazarus Group moved $3.76 million worth of Bitcoin to several unknown addresses, bringing their total to 13,441 BTC, which is worth about $1.15 billion. Lazarus Group Laundering Scheme is Becoming Alarming On March 20, Lazarus Group made a significant transaction by sending 12.929 BTC (about $1.12 million) to an unknown wallet. They also targeted four other wallets, each receiving a different amount. Two unknown wallets received 0.308 BTC each, one received 14.849 BTC, and the last received 15.684 BTC. Lazarus moved 44.07 BTC to five different wallet addresses within three hours. This transaction undoubtedly shows that the Lazarus group is still laundering stolen cryptocurrency. Ben Zhou, Bybit’s CEO, commented on the situation, saying that the hackers might be using Bitcoin mixers to hide the origin of the funds. Meanwhile, the notorious Lazarus Group has been behind some of the biggest cyber attacks recently. This group often targets cryptocurrency exchanges , financial institutions, and government organizations. It holds a lot of Bitcoin and uses advanced methods to hide its actions and avoid detection. New Lazarus Malware Targets Developers and Wallets In addition to laundering stolen funds, the Lazarus Group launched a new malware campaign. Researchers discovered six malicious packages to infiltrate developer environments, steal credentials, extract crypto data, and install backdoors. The group’s latest attack method exploits the Node Package Manager (NPM) ecosystem, which JavaScript developers widely use. Hackers deceive developers into unknowingly downloading infected dependencies by employing typosquatting techniques–creating package names that closely resemble legitimate libraries. These malicious packages contained a new strain of malware, “BeaverTail.” The malware attempts to attract sensitive files from Google Chrome, Brave, and Firefox browsers while compromising macOS keychain data. Lazarus Group Remains a Threat It is worth noting that the Lazarus Group allegedly uses the stolen money to help North Korea’s weapons programs. The group has taken millions from significant crypto exchanges. In late June 2024, Alex Lab linked a $4M crypto hack to the notorious hacking group . In 2020, they attacked KuCoin and stole around $275 million. Similarly, the bad actors hacked the Ronin Network in 2022 and withdrew over $625 million worth of crypto assets. That same year, they stole nearly $100 million from Harmony’s Horizon Bridge. Authorities and blockchain firms are working hard to close these gaps.

Microsoft, BlackRock, xAI, and MGX together with Nvidia leader Jensen Huang form a partnership. The joint venture between collaborating companies suggests that AI crypto token growth will be accelerated which indicates a potential 10X expansion. Top 3 AI Crypto Tokens Deliver 10X Amid Major Partnerships with Microsoft and xAI Nvidia announced significant domestic chip-producing expansion plans by collaborating with xAI, Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX. Through the next four years the company will dedicate hundreds of billions of dollars to create semiconductor production facilities in domestic locations. The initiative will decrease dependence on Asian manufacturing facilities to meet U.S. policy changes and worldwide tensions. Amid this, let’s uncover these top Ai Crypto coins for a 10X return, including; NEAR, TAO, And Render as the crypto market surges. Source- Tweet NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR Protocol maintains its value at $2.71 as the Proof-of-Stake Layer-1 blockchain runs decentralized applications. The cryptocurrency market has pushed the coin value up by 2% in the previous day. Several expert analysts predict NEAR Protocol will break past the $5 mark once a critical trigger occurs. NEAR Protocol ranks among the best artificial intelligence cryptocurrency tokens as a promising choice for investors seeking opportunities in the market. Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor (TAO) operates as an open-source protocol for decentralized blockchain-based machine learning networks which experienced a 10% market price growth throughout the last week. The recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision has caused hurdles for TAO yet the token seems to develop an ascending trend. The current price of TAO stands at $255 but its trading volume exceeds $96.91M and shows a 30.43% growth within 24 hours. The current price aims to reach the $220 support level. The AI crypto coin TAO represents one of the top digital assets that shows outstanding development prospects. Render (RENDER) The current price for Render, AI altcoin coins to buy , stands at $3.236 on March 20, 2025, and indicates positive market movement. The cryptocurrency currently reveals a minor 0.92% depreciation over the previous day, although market analysts indicate a positive prediction. The price analysis indicates the asset evaluates its position against important support and resistance marks. Support breaks at $3.26 forms the main support point while resistance occurs at $3.50. Above $3.50 breakout would push the asset toward the $4.00 target providing a potential 23% profit from current pricing. The present analysis of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator reveals a bullish momentum since the MACD line (blue) surpasses the signal line (orange).

42055969,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141908,1742494203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase’s Bold Move: Demanding Crystal Clear Crypto Regulations from the SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-crypto-regulations/,"In a significant move that could reshape the future of digital finance, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is actively pressing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish much-needed clarity in the realm of crypto regulations . This push comes at a crucial time, aligning with ongoing efforts within the U.S. Congress to bring structure and definition to the burgeoning digital asset space, as reported by The Block. Why is Coinbase Pushing for Crypto Regulations Now? The core of Coinbase’s appeal lies in the urgent need to define the SEC’s jurisdiction over digital assets . The current ambiguity is hindering market growth and creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Coinbase believes that clear, well-defined rules are not just beneficial but essential for fostering a stable and thriving crypto ecosystem. Their recommendations to the SEC are strategically aimed at addressing these pain points and paving the way for responsible innovation. Here’s a breakdown of Coinbase’s key recommendations to the SEC: Distinguishing Digital Commodities from Securities: Coinbase emphasizes the critical need to differentiate between digital commodities and securities. This distinction is paramount because it dictates which regulatory framework applies to each type of digital asset. Clear definitions will prevent overregulation and encourage innovation in areas that do not inherently pose securities risks. Deferring to U.S. Congress on Regulatory Ambiguities: Recognizing the complexity of the digital asset landscape, Coinbase advocates for the SEC to defer to the U.S. Congress on areas where regulatory authority is unclear. This collaborative approach ensures that regulatory frameworks are developed with broad stakeholder input and are adaptable to the rapidly evolving nature of crypto. Recognizing Secondary Market Transactions of Digital Commodities: A key point in Coinbase’s recommendation is the assertion that secondary market transactions of digital commodities should not be classified as securities transactions. This distinction is vital for exchanges and trading platforms, as it would streamline operations and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on routine trading activities. Allowing Tokenization of Traditional Securities: Looking towards the future, Coinbase is advocating for the SEC to embrace the tokenization of traditional securities. Tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets on a blockchain, holds immense potential to increase market efficiency, liquidity, and accessibility. By allowing this, the SEC can position the U.S. at the forefront of financial innovation. The Shifting Sands of Regulatory Clarity: What Changed Under the Trump Administration? Coinbase’s proactive stance is partly influenced by the perceived shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto under the Trump administration. While the specifics of this shift may be debated, the underlying message from Coinbase is consistent: regardless of administrative changes, the need for regulatory clarity remains constant and critical. They are urging the SEC to move beyond reactive enforcement and towards proactive rule-making that provides businesses with a clear roadmap for compliance and innovation. Why Does Regulatory Clarity Matter for Market Growth and Stability? The absence of clear crypto regulations casts a long shadow over the digital asset market, creating several challenges: Stifled Innovation: Uncertainty breeds hesitation. Without clear rules, businesses are less likely to invest heavily in crypto-related ventures, fearing potential regulatory pitfalls down the line. This stifles innovation and prevents the industry from reaching its full potential. Investor Uncertainty: Both retail and institutional investors are wary of navigating a regulatory gray area. Clear rules would provide a framework for investor protection, increasing confidence and attracting more capital into the market. Market Instability: Regulatory ambiguity can contribute to market volatility. When the rules are unclear, market participants operate with less predictability, potentially leading to erratic price swings and instability. Hindered Institutional Adoption: Large institutional investors, who could inject significant capital into the crypto market, often require regulatory certainty before committing substantial resources. Clear rules are a prerequisite for broader institutional adoption. What Are the Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulations? The benefits of establishing definitive crypto regulations are far-reaching and could positively impact various stakeholders: Benefit Description Increased Market Stability Clear rules reduce uncertainty, leading to more predictable market behavior and reduced volatility. Boosted Investor Confidence Defined regulations provide a safety net for investors, encouraging greater participation and investment. Accelerated Innovation Clarity empowers businesses to innovate within a defined framework, fostering growth and new applications. Attraction of Institutional Capital Regulatory certainty is crucial for attracting large institutional investors, unlocking significant capital inflows. Enhanced Consumer Protection Clear rules can incorporate measures to protect consumers from fraud and illicit activities within the crypto space. Coinbase’s Actionable Insights: A Roadmap for the SEC? Coinbase’s recommendations are not just complaints; they are actionable insights that offer a potential roadmap for the SEC to move forward. By focusing on distinguishing asset types, deferring to Congress where needed, and embracing innovation like tokenization , the SEC can create a regulatory environment that is both robust and conducive to growth. The ball is now in the SEC’s court to respond proactively and engage in constructive dialogue with industry leaders like Coinbase. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Regulations Coinbase’s assertive push for regulatory clarity from the SEC marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. The exchange’s recommendations are timely, pragmatic, and address the core challenges hindering the sector’s progress. Whether the SEC will heed this call and usher in an era of well-defined crypto rules remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: the industry is united in its demand for clarity, and this unified voice is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. The future trajectory of the digital asset market in the U.S. may well depend on the SEC’s response to this critical juncture.

Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, Mitchnick highlighted regulatory hurdles as a key factor limiting ETH ETF adoption. Since their launch in July 2024, Ethereum ETFs have struggled to gain traction compared to the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs. Mitchnick attributed this disparity to a common misconception about their success. However, he acknowledged that the inability of ETH ETFs to generate staking returns is a critical limitation holding them back. “There’s clearly a next level of potential development for Ethereum ETFs,” Mitchnick said. “The ETF has turned out to be a really compelling vehicle for holding Bitcoin for many different types of investors. There’s no question that it’s less perfect today for ETH without staking. Staking returns are a meaningful part of how you can generate ROI in this space, and not all ETH ETFs had staking when they launched.” Related News: Identity of Whale Who Leveraged 50x Leverage to Profit $20 Million in the Last Few Days Revealed Staking allows investors to earn passive returns by locking their cryptocurrency holdings on the network for a set period of time. However, regulatory complexities make integrating staking into ETFs a challenge. “This is not a particularly easy problem,” Mitchnick said. “This is not as simple as a new administration greenlighting something and then boom, we’re all good, we’re on the record. There are a lot of very complex challenges that need to be solved, but if this can be solved, it would be a step change upwards in terms of what we see activity around these products.” Despite the current challenges, Mitchnick remains optimistic about Ethereum's long-term potential. *This is not investment advice.

The Pump.fun team unveiled the new DEX platform on March 20, 2025, noting in a post on X that PumpSwap will now support all launchpad coins that “complete their bonding curve.” PumpSwap, built on Solana ( SOL ), is a decentralized exchange protocol that will operate similarly to Raydium v4 and Uniswap v2, through its constant product automated market maker model. The launch of the new DEX platform allows users to create liquidity pools. Users can also add to existing pools as well as trade all PumpSwap tokens. “Why did we build this? From day 1, our goal was to create the most frictionless environment for trading coins. Migrations were a major point of friction – they slow a coin’s momentum and introduce needless complexity for new users,” Pump.fun wrote on X. The launch of PumpSwap introduces instant migrations, which the protocol says will be free, with the previous fee of six SOL for migration now removed. Seamless functionality also reduces complexity for new users. Initially, PumpSwap plans to levy a fee of 0.25% per trade, with most of it, 0.20%, going to liquidity providers. The other 0.05% will go to the protocol. Fee distribution will change once creator revenue sharing goes live. As well as memecoins, PumpSwap will offer access to several partner platform tokens, including Pudgy Penguins, Aptos and Tron, Jupiter, Sei and LayerZero. The DEX will also support Coinbase’s wrapped token cbBTC, Ethena Labs’s stablecoin USDe and Frax Finance’s frxUSD and FXS. Tron DAO posted on X: “TRON’s involvement in this initiative further strengthens its commitment to cross-chain innovation and the expansion of decentralized finance access. As PumpSwap grows, it aims to become a key liquidity hub, supporting on and off-ramps across multiple blockchains and driving broader adoption of Web3 technologies.” PumpSwap’s rollout comes just a day after Raydium ( RAY ) launched its own proprietary memecoin factory LaunchLab. The Pump.fun clone will offer the same token creation and launch features.
