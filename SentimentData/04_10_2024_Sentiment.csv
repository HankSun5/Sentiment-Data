Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-crypto-losing-steam-bitcoin-and-ethereum-addresses-shrink-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is presently experiencing a substantial decline, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a substantial decrease in active addresses. This trend, which has persisted throughout 2024, has triggered apprehension regarding the future of these prominent cryptocurrencies. The implications for market dynamics could be profound as investor enthusiasm diminishes. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number Declining Active Addresses According to the latest stats from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin‚Äôs active addresses have contracted by about 1.17 million to 855,000, whereas Ethereum has reduced by about 382,000 to 312,000. This equates to a 27% drawdown for Bitcoin and an 18% decline for Ethereum year-to-date. The absence of new investors entering the market appears to be the primary cause of this decline. This is essential for maintaining favorable momentum, as existing participants dominate trading activity in the absence of new capital inflows. Since early 2024, active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses have been declining ‚ÄúFor the bulls to dominate the market, the influx of new investors is a crucial condition. 1. Bitcoin 1.17M -> 855K 2. Ethereum 382K -> 312K‚Äù ‚Äì By @burak_kesmeci Full post üëáhttps://t.co/gZftQidnxa pic.twitter.com/q5cdpv7x6t ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 1, 2024 The anticipated excitement surrounding the approval of spot ETFs has not translated into increased activity on the blockchain. Still, the current user base carries a lot of investors who would have expected such developments. The continued quantitative tightening of the Federal Reserve continues to strip liquidity from the market, adding more pressure to the situation. Market Sentiment And Future Prospects There are, however indications that a potential rebound is near in the face of these challenges. For example, funding rate on Ethereum has remained positive for the past week, meaning there is growing interest among investors in long positions. This implies that whereas plunges in the price of Ethereum have been ongoing, a good majority of the market remains optimistic regarding its performance going forward. BTC and ETH addresses decline: BTC drops to 855K, ETH to 312K in 2024 Since the start of 2024, the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses has continued to drop. Bitcoin addresses fell from 1.17 million to 855,000, while Ethereum addresses declined from 382,000 to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) October 1, 2024 It‚Äôs quite interesting that large Ethereum holders have been accumulating their assets, rather than selling them off. These large holders reduced their outflows from 311,950 to 139,390, suggesting they have confidence in the long-term prospects of the altcoin. Investors that do this kind of action usually expect the prices to recover soon. Furthermore, Bitcoin‚Äôs Exchange Flow Multiple has experienced a substantial decline. This metric contrasts with short-term inflows and outflows with those over a lengthier period, indicating that current trading activity is significantly lower than historical averages. A low Exchange Flow Multiple typically suggests that investors are holding their assets in anticipation of future price increases rather than actively trading them.

The analyst, which has been so big on a looming altseason since the beginning of the year, has revealed a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and even Ethereum (king of altcoins) in the short term. Known for his sometimes controversial and often contrarian predictions, Capo returned just as the market experienced a notable correction in October, sharing his bearish outlook for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. His latest prediction is that Ethereum could plummet as low as $1,800 before seeing any substantial recovery. ETH‚Äôs Predicted Decline Ethereum has already dropped by 10% in the past seven days and is currently trading around around $2,330, but according to Capo, this decline could worsen. He predicted that ETH might fall further into the $1,800 to $2,000 range, which is a possible 23% dip from its current price, before eventually rebounding. However, he believes an altcoin season will still materialize. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Quick update: There‚Äôs a possibility of one last shakeout, with $BTC testing the $48k-50k zone and $ETH $1.8k-2k, before the real altseason begins. If that happens, I‚Äôll be adding more to my altcoin bags. https://t.co/sx6u8wPNrK ‚Äî il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) October 2, 2024 Capo‚Äôs track record of analysis since the beginning of the year shows a consistent belief in the upcoming dominance of altcoins. Throughout 2024, he has repeatedly emphasized the potential for altcoins, particularly Ethereum, to outperform Bitcoin as profits generated from BTC flow into smaller assets. However, the altcoin season has yet to materialize, and Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto investment scene. Time To Go Long On Ethereum? It‚Äôs worth noting that Crypto Capo‚Äôs predictions often have a certain lore attached to them. There is a running joke among some investors that whenever Capo makes a prediction, the market tends to do the opposite. This goes as far back as his prediction of Bitcoin falling to $12,000 last year, but the crypto eventually broke past resistance levels. Now, with Capo predicting the possibility of continued decline for Ethereum and Bitcoin amid October‚Äôs bullish market sentiment (often dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù), it raises the question from many investors if his bearish call is far-fetched. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price Only time will tell if the market plays out according to Capo‚Äôs analysis. However, given the current inflow of investments and the crypto market, which has mostly rallied in October, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Ethereum rebounds rather than experiences the significant drop Capo is forecasting. Naturally, many savvy whales and traders have seen the current decline as an opportunity to ‚Äúgo long‚Äù and accumulate more Ethereum in expectation of the resumption of inflows. This sentiment is reflected through the US Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed $14.45 million in inflows yesterday despite the price correction. Interestingly, it is important to note that Capo‚Äôs analysis is only talking about a possible case and remains bullish for Ethereum in the long term.

Many expected the bullish trend to continue, but Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Concerns are mounting as some market observers predict a deeper decline, possibly falling to yearly lows around $2,150 if the current support level fails to hold. This has reignited fear and uncertainty across the market as Ethereum‚Äôs price sends mixed signals. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The recent decline has shaken confidence, and market participants anxiously await a clear direction. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum‚Äôs next move and whether it can reclaim support levels to resume an upward trajectory. The coming days are expected to be crucial for Ethereum‚Äôs price action, with investors bracing for heightened volatility in response to these shifting market conditions. Ethereum Testing Crucial Support Line Ethereum is now trading at a critical juncture that could define its direction in the coming week. Price action over the next few days is expected to be pivotal for Ethereum and the entire altcoin market. Analysts closely monitor whether ETH can maintain its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Failing to hold above key support levels could signal a broader market decline. Analysts and investors eagerly await an Ethereum recovery as it hovers above a crucial support line that could be the launchpad for a rally to new highs. One top analyst, Carl Runefelt, recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the current trendline supporting ETH price. In his technical analysis, Runefelt warns that the price could drop significantly if Ethereum fails to hold this trendline. If the price breaches this support, he identifies $2,150 as the next potential target. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum A fall to these levels would likely shake out many investors expecting a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. If ETH loses this key support, it may lead to uncertainty and heightened volatility. This fall would keep market participants on edge while waiting for the next move. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,350 after failing to establish a higher high above $2,820. This recent price action has disappointed bulls, as ETH has lost crucial support levels, including the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,542 and the simple moving average (MA) at $2,466. These indicators are key in determining short-term trends, and their loss as support has raised concerns about further downside risk. For the bulls to regain momentum, ETH must break above the 4-hour 200 EMA and the 4-hour MA and successfully hold these levels as support. Reclaiming these indicators would signal renewed strength and pave the way for another attempt to increase prices. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop ‚Äì On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand However, a deeper correction is likely if Ethereum fails to recover these levels. Key support around $2,100 becomes the next target, with the potential for even lower prices. Investors are closely monitoring these levels, as the coming days will be critical in determining whether ETH can recover or continue its downtrend.

In September, Binance‚Äôs share of trading volume in the roughly $2 trillion digital asset market fell to 36.6%, down sharply from 42.7% at the start of the year and the lowest level in four years, according to data from CCData. Binance Spot And Derivatives Trading Hits Four-Year Lows The drop in market share is particularly pronounced in both the spot and derivatives trading arenas. Binance‚Äôs 27% share of the spot market represents its lowest level since January 2021, while its derivatives trading share stands at 40.7%, also the lowest in four years. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Maintains $7.50 XRP Target Despite SEC Appeal Against Ripple Per the report, this decline can be attributed to the legal saga that the exchange has been experiencing globally since last year, but particularly in the US, which has not only had a notable impact on the exchange‚Äôs financial metrics, but has also led to changes in its leadership. The company has been under increased scrutiny globally, following a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) last year over serious charges, including sanctions violations, which resulted in a hefty $4 billion fine. The fallout from these regulatory actions included the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who served four months in prison as part of the proceedings. However, the former CEO was released by US authorities last Friday after serving his sentence. In an effort to rebuild trust and navigate the regulatory landscape, Binance appointed Richard Teng, a former regulator, as its new CEO. Teng has been actively engaged with regulators investigating Binance in various jurisdictions, while also appointing a new board of directors and the intentions of establishing a new headquarter. Centralized Crypto Exchanges Face 17% Volume Drop The report further highlights that the broader market for centralized crypto exchanges is also facing challenges, with combined spot and derivatives trading volumes dropping 17% in September. However, this decline is typical for the month, which is often seasonally weak, but it has resulted in the lowest monthly trading activity since June. Notably, Binance has seen the most severe market-share decline among top exchanges, as competitors such as Bybit, Bitget, and Crypto.com have begun to capture a larger share of the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally Jacob Joseph, a senior research analyst at CCData, noted that this trend may indicate a growing confidence among crypto participants in alternative platforms that ‚Äúoffer similar user experiences,‚Äù including low trading fees, minimal slippage, and high market liquidity. Despite the challenges, Binance recently achieved a significant milestone, becoming the first centralized crypto exchange to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, according to CCData. At the time of writing, the exchange‚Äôs native token, BNB, currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency on the market, is trading at $545, up just 1% in the last 24 hours amid the broader market decline.

So far, Dogecoin has been on a downward trajectory, losing a significant portion of its gains from its recent rally. Over the past week, DOGE has dropped by 10.8%. The decline has continued into the past 24 hours, with the asset shedding 4.2% of its value, currently trading at around $0.1019. This price drop has directly impacted DOGE‚Äôs market capitalization, falling from over $17 billion last Thursday to around $14.9 billion today. Alongside this, the 24-hour trading volume for DOGE has also seen a noticeable decrease, from $1.4 billion last Thursday to just above $1 billion. While many in the crypto community are panicking concerning this bloodbath, analysts have continued to share their outlook and remain optimistic.

The price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,400 and $2,420 resistance levels to start a decent increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone and extended losses below the $2,400 level. ETH traded below the $2,350 support to move further in a bearish zone like Bitcoin. The price even spiked below the $2,320 support level. A low was formed near $2,311 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,350 level. The price is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,400 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the trend line resistance might send the price toward the $2,480 resistance. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. An upside break above the $2,480 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,550 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,650 level or $2,665. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,350 level. The first major support sits near the $2,300 zone. A clear move below the $2,300 support might push the price toward $2,220.

The nearly 2% drop in the crypto scene is due to the contraction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins. At present, the total market cap is down to $2.17 trillion. It could post even more losses should bears press on, reversing the gains of September. Ethereum Under Pressure, Will $2,350 Offer Support? In the last week alone, CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum is down 10%, pushing losses below $2,400, a former support, now resistance. While it could appear that the sharp dump of the better part of this week is discouraging participation, some traders are accumulating at around spot rates. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price IntoTheBlock data on October 3 shows that 1.89 million Ethereum addresses bought 52 million ETH at around the $2,311 and $2,383 range. That a large amount of buyers choose to buy, on average, at $2,350 means this is a support level that traders should closely watch. Considering the number of ETH accumulated, sellers would need to exert more effort to break below this level, forcing the coin towards $2,100 and August lows. Comparing traders‚Äô action and the September range, the $2,350 level falls at around 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels. What‚Äôs Next For ETH? Technically, crypto prices, including ETH, tend to find support around this Fibonacci retracement zone. Accordingly, how prices react between the $2,100 and $2,350 zone will likely shape the medium to long-term trend. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number A refreshing bounce around this emerging support and Fibonacci retracement zone would be a massive boost. In this case, ETH could rally, even above $2,800, as bulls target $3,500. Conversely, any sharp dump below August and September lows may easily trigger panic selling. Out of this, ETH can slump below $2,100 and $2,000 and may fall to as low as $1,800, confirming losses of early August. Considering the state of price action, sellers have the upper hand. Over the past few trading sessions, centralized exchanges have had massive outflows. Earlier today, The Data Nerd revealed that Wintermute, a crypto market maker, moved 14,221 ETH to Binance, indicating that they might sell.

Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-solo-staking-made-easier-vitalik-buterin-supports-lower-entry-requirements/,"Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocates reducing the ETH solo staking requirement to lower the entry barrier and promote greater network decentralization. Buterin Sees 32 ETH Requirement As A Barrier Responding to Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano on X regarding solo staking, Buterin expressed concern that the current 32 ETH requirement presents a bigger obstacle than bandwidth limitations. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For those unfamiliar, solo staking on Ethereum requires an individual validator to stake at least 32 ETH ‚Äì approximately $75,200 at the current market price of $2,352. Solo staking allows crypto investors to earn passive income while directly contributing to the security of the Ethereum network. Buterin views this high entry threshold as a barrier that prevents smaller ETH holders from participating. He suggested temporarily increasing bandwidth requirements to reduce the minimum staking deposit to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin elaborated: It‚Äôs net-good for both staking accessibility and scale. Then once we figure out peerdas, bandwidth reqs go back down, and once we figure out orbit SSF, the deposit minimum can drop to 1 ETH. It‚Äôs important to note that ETH holders can still stake with as little as 1 ETH by using third-party staking services, centralized platforms, or staking pools. However, these options don‚Äôt offer the same level of control over one‚Äôs ETH as solo staking, where the node operator retains full custody of their holdings. During the Ethereum Singapore 2024 event in September, Buterin emphasized the significance of solo stakers in bolstering Ethereum‚Äôs security and decentralization to tackle potential 51% attacks. At the event, Buterin said that even a small increase in the proportion of solo stakers on the Ethereum network could work as an ‚Äúextra layer of defense‚Äù for both security and privacy. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Continue To Thrive While the 32 ETH barrier may discourage small-scale ETH enthusiasts from solo staking, they can still benefit from the growing popularity of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which have made transactions more affordable. For instance, in June 2024, layer-2 scaling platform Optimism announced the launch of open-source and permissionless fault proofs, enabling users to verify off-chain transactions‚Äô validity securely. Similarly, in August 2024, asset manager Franklin Templeton approved another layer-2 solution when it launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Arbitrum network. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Similarly, crypto exchange Coinbase‚Äôs Ethereum layer-2 rollup Base has witnessed rapid adoption as its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at slightly over $2.12 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. As layer-2 solutions continue to succeed, their positive impact may extend to the Ethereum network. Crypto analysts, such as CryptoBullet, predict that ETH could rally in Q4 2024. ETH is trading at $2,352 at press time, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

SOL price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $140 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $145 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading near $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above the $132 support zone. Solana Price Revisits $132 Solana price started a fresh decline from the $162 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL declined below the $155 and $150 support levels. It even declined below $142. However, the bulls were active above the $132 support. A low was formed at $133.17 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $135 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1482 swing high to the $133 low. There was also a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140 level. The next major resistance is near the $142 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1482 swing high to the $133 low. The main resistance could be $148. A successful close above the $148 and $150 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $155. Any more gains might send the price toward the $162 level. More Downsides in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $140 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $135 level. The first major support is near the $132 level. A break below the $132 level might send the price toward the $120 zone. If there is a close below the $120 support, the price could decline toward the $112 support in the near term.
