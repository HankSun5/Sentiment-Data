Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-crypto-losing-steam-bitcoin-and-ethereum-addresses-shrink-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is presently experiencing a substantial decline, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a substantial decrease in active addresses. This trend, which has persisted throughout 2024, has triggered apprehension regarding the future of these prominent cryptocurrencies. The implications for market dynamics could be profound as investor enthusiasm diminishes. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number Declining Active Addresses According to the latest stats from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin‚Äôs active addresses have contracted by about 1.17 million to 855,000, whereas Ethereum has reduced by about 382,000 to 312,000. This equates to a 27% drawdown for Bitcoin and an 18% decline for Ethereum year-to-date. The absence of new investors entering the market appears to be the primary cause of this decline. This is essential for maintaining favorable momentum, as existing participants dominate trading activity in the absence of new capital inflows. Since early 2024, active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses have been declining ‚ÄúFor the bulls to dominate the market, the influx of new investors is a crucial condition. 1. Bitcoin 1.17M -> 855K 2. Ethereum 382K -> 312K‚Äù ‚Äì By @burak_kesmeci Full post üëáhttps://t.co/gZftQidnxa pic.twitter.com/q5cdpv7x6t ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 1, 2024 The anticipated excitement surrounding the approval of spot ETFs has not translated into increased activity on the blockchain. Still, the current user base carries a lot of investors who would have expected such developments. The continued quantitative tightening of the Federal Reserve continues to strip liquidity from the market, adding more pressure to the situation. Market Sentiment And Future Prospects There are, however indications that a potential rebound is near in the face of these challenges. For example, funding rate on Ethereum has remained positive for the past week, meaning there is growing interest among investors in long positions. This implies that whereas plunges in the price of Ethereum have been ongoing, a good majority of the market remains optimistic regarding its performance going forward. BTC and ETH addresses decline: BTC drops to 855K, ETH to 312K in 2024 Since the start of 2024, the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses has continued to drop. Bitcoin addresses fell from 1.17 million to 855,000, while Ethereum addresses declined from 382,000 to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) October 1, 2024 It‚Äôs quite interesting that large Ethereum holders have been accumulating their assets, rather than selling them off. These large holders reduced their outflows from 311,950 to 139,390, suggesting they have confidence in the long-term prospects of the altcoin. Investors that do this kind of action usually expect the prices to recover soon. Furthermore, Bitcoin‚Äôs Exchange Flow Multiple has experienced a substantial decline. This metric contrasts with short-term inflows and outflows with those over a lengthier period, indicating that current trading activity is significantly lower than historical averages. A low Exchange Flow Multiple typically suggests that investors are holding their assets in anticipation of future price increases rather than actively trading them.

The analyst, which has been so big on a looming altseason since the beginning of the year, has revealed a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and even Ethereum (king of altcoins) in the short term. Known for his sometimes controversial and often contrarian predictions, Capo returned just as the market experienced a notable correction in October, sharing his bearish outlook for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. His latest prediction is that Ethereum could plummet as low as $1,800 before seeing any substantial recovery. ETH‚Äôs Predicted Decline Ethereum has already dropped by 10% in the past seven days and is currently trading around around $2,330, but according to Capo, this decline could worsen. He predicted that ETH might fall further into the $1,800 to $2,000 range, which is a possible 23% dip from its current price, before eventually rebounding. However, he believes an altcoin season will still materialize. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Quick update: There‚Äôs a possibility of one last shakeout, with $BTC testing the $48k-50k zone and $ETH $1.8k-2k, before the real altseason begins. If that happens, I‚Äôll be adding more to my altcoin bags. https://t.co/sx6u8wPNrK ‚Äî il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) October 2, 2024 Capo‚Äôs track record of analysis since the beginning of the year shows a consistent belief in the upcoming dominance of altcoins. Throughout 2024, he has repeatedly emphasized the potential for altcoins, particularly Ethereum, to outperform Bitcoin as profits generated from BTC flow into smaller assets. However, the altcoin season has yet to materialize, and Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto investment scene. Time To Go Long On Ethereum? It‚Äôs worth noting that Crypto Capo‚Äôs predictions often have a certain lore attached to them. There is a running joke among some investors that whenever Capo makes a prediction, the market tends to do the opposite. This goes as far back as his prediction of Bitcoin falling to $12,000 last year, but the crypto eventually broke past resistance levels. Now, with Capo predicting the possibility of continued decline for Ethereum and Bitcoin amid October‚Äôs bullish market sentiment (often dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù), it raises the question from many investors if his bearish call is far-fetched. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price Only time will tell if the market plays out according to Capo‚Äôs analysis. However, given the current inflow of investments and the crypto market, which has mostly rallied in October, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Ethereum rebounds rather than experiences the significant drop Capo is forecasting. Naturally, many savvy whales and traders have seen the current decline as an opportunity to ‚Äúgo long‚Äù and accumulate more Ethereum in expectation of the resumption of inflows. This sentiment is reflected through the US Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed $14.45 million in inflows yesterday despite the price correction. Interestingly, it is important to note that Capo‚Äôs analysis is only talking about a possible case and remains bullish for Ethereum in the long term.

Many expected the bullish trend to continue, but Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Concerns are mounting as some market observers predict a deeper decline, possibly falling to yearly lows around $2,150 if the current support level fails to hold. This has reignited fear and uncertainty across the market as Ethereum‚Äôs price sends mixed signals. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The recent decline has shaken confidence, and market participants anxiously await a clear direction. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum‚Äôs next move and whether it can reclaim support levels to resume an upward trajectory. The coming days are expected to be crucial for Ethereum‚Äôs price action, with investors bracing for heightened volatility in response to these shifting market conditions. Ethereum Testing Crucial Support Line Ethereum is now trading at a critical juncture that could define its direction in the coming week. Price action over the next few days is expected to be pivotal for Ethereum and the entire altcoin market. Analysts closely monitor whether ETH can maintain its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Failing to hold above key support levels could signal a broader market decline. Analysts and investors eagerly await an Ethereum recovery as it hovers above a crucial support line that could be the launchpad for a rally to new highs. One top analyst, Carl Runefelt, recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the current trendline supporting ETH price. In his technical analysis, Runefelt warns that the price could drop significantly if Ethereum fails to hold this trendline. If the price breaches this support, he identifies $2,150 as the next potential target. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum A fall to these levels would likely shake out many investors expecting a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. If ETH loses this key support, it may lead to uncertainty and heightened volatility. This fall would keep market participants on edge while waiting for the next move. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,350 after failing to establish a higher high above $2,820. This recent price action has disappointed bulls, as ETH has lost crucial support levels, including the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,542 and the simple moving average (MA) at $2,466. These indicators are key in determining short-term trends, and their loss as support has raised concerns about further downside risk. For the bulls to regain momentum, ETH must break above the 4-hour 200 EMA and the 4-hour MA and successfully hold these levels as support. Reclaiming these indicators would signal renewed strength and pave the way for another attempt to increase prices. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop ‚Äì On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand However, a deeper correction is likely if Ethereum fails to recover these levels. Key support around $2,100 becomes the next target, with the potential for even lower prices. Investors are closely monitoring these levels, as the coming days will be critical in determining whether ETH can recover or continue its downtrend.

In September, Binance‚Äôs share of trading volume in the roughly $2 trillion digital asset market fell to 36.6%, down sharply from 42.7% at the start of the year and the lowest level in four years, according to data from CCData. Binance Spot And Derivatives Trading Hits Four-Year Lows The drop in market share is particularly pronounced in both the spot and derivatives trading arenas. Binance‚Äôs 27% share of the spot market represents its lowest level since January 2021, while its derivatives trading share stands at 40.7%, also the lowest in four years. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Maintains $7.50 XRP Target Despite SEC Appeal Against Ripple Per the report, this decline can be attributed to the legal saga that the exchange has been experiencing globally since last year, but particularly in the US, which has not only had a notable impact on the exchange‚Äôs financial metrics, but has also led to changes in its leadership. The company has been under increased scrutiny globally, following a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) last year over serious charges, including sanctions violations, which resulted in a hefty $4 billion fine. The fallout from these regulatory actions included the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who served four months in prison as part of the proceedings. However, the former CEO was released by US authorities last Friday after serving his sentence. In an effort to rebuild trust and navigate the regulatory landscape, Binance appointed Richard Teng, a former regulator, as its new CEO. Teng has been actively engaged with regulators investigating Binance in various jurisdictions, while also appointing a new board of directors and the intentions of establishing a new headquarter. Centralized Crypto Exchanges Face 17% Volume Drop The report further highlights that the broader market for centralized crypto exchanges is also facing challenges, with combined spot and derivatives trading volumes dropping 17% in September. However, this decline is typical for the month, which is often seasonally weak, but it has resulted in the lowest monthly trading activity since June. Notably, Binance has seen the most severe market-share decline among top exchanges, as competitors such as Bybit, Bitget, and Crypto.com have begun to capture a larger share of the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Solana-Based BONK Is In Prime Position For Legendary Rally Jacob Joseph, a senior research analyst at CCData, noted that this trend may indicate a growing confidence among crypto participants in alternative platforms that ‚Äúoffer similar user experiences,‚Äù including low trading fees, minimal slippage, and high market liquidity. Despite the challenges, Binance recently achieved a significant milestone, becoming the first centralized crypto exchange to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, according to CCData. At the time of writing, the exchange‚Äôs native token, BNB, currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency on the market, is trading at $545, up just 1% in the last 24 hours amid the broader market decline.

So far, Dogecoin has been on a downward trajectory, losing a significant portion of its gains from its recent rally. Over the past week, DOGE has dropped by 10.8%. The decline has continued into the past 24 hours, with the asset shedding 4.2% of its value, currently trading at around $0.1019. This price drop has directly impacted DOGE‚Äôs market capitalization, falling from over $17 billion last Thursday to around $14.9 billion today. Alongside this, the 24-hour trading volume for DOGE has also seen a noticeable decrease, from $1.4 billion last Thursday to just above $1 billion. While many in the crypto community are panicking concerning this bloodbath, analysts have continued to share their outlook and remain optimistic.

The price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,400 and $2,420 resistance levels to start a decent increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone and extended losses below the $2,400 level. ETH traded below the $2,350 support to move further in a bearish zone like Bitcoin. The price even spiked below the $2,320 support level. A low was formed near $2,311 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,350 level. The price is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,400 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the trend line resistance might send the price toward the $2,480 resistance. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. An upside break above the $2,480 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,550 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,650 level or $2,665. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,350 level. The first major support sits near the $2,300 zone. A clear move below the $2,300 support might push the price toward $2,220.

The nearly 2% drop in the crypto scene is due to the contraction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins. At present, the total market cap is down to $2.17 trillion. It could post even more losses should bears press on, reversing the gains of September. Ethereum Under Pressure, Will $2,350 Offer Support? In the last week alone, CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum is down 10%, pushing losses below $2,400, a former support, now resistance. While it could appear that the sharp dump of the better part of this week is discouraging participation, some traders are accumulating at around spot rates. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price IntoTheBlock data on October 3 shows that 1.89 million Ethereum addresses bought 52 million ETH at around the $2,311 and $2,383 range. That a large amount of buyers choose to buy, on average, at $2,350 means this is a support level that traders should closely watch. Considering the number of ETH accumulated, sellers would need to exert more effort to break below this level, forcing the coin towards $2,100 and August lows. Comparing traders‚Äô action and the September range, the $2,350 level falls at around 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels. What‚Äôs Next For ETH? Technically, crypto prices, including ETH, tend to find support around this Fibonacci retracement zone. Accordingly, how prices react between the $2,100 and $2,350 zone will likely shape the medium to long-term trend. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number A refreshing bounce around this emerging support and Fibonacci retracement zone would be a massive boost. In this case, ETH could rally, even above $2,800, as bulls target $3,500. Conversely, any sharp dump below August and September lows may easily trigger panic selling. Out of this, ETH can slump below $2,100 and $2,000 and may fall to as low as $1,800, confirming losses of early August. Considering the state of price action, sellers have the upper hand. Over the past few trading sessions, centralized exchanges have had massive outflows. Earlier today, The Data Nerd revealed that Wintermute, a crypto market maker, moved 14,221 ETH to Binance, indicating that they might sell.

Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-solo-staking-made-easier-vitalik-buterin-supports-lower-entry-requirements/,"Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocates reducing the ETH solo staking requirement to lower the entry barrier and promote greater network decentralization. Buterin Sees 32 ETH Requirement As A Barrier Responding to Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano on X regarding solo staking, Buterin expressed concern that the current 32 ETH requirement presents a bigger obstacle than bandwidth limitations. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For those unfamiliar, solo staking on Ethereum requires an individual validator to stake at least 32 ETH ‚Äì approximately $75,200 at the current market price of $2,352. Solo staking allows crypto investors to earn passive income while directly contributing to the security of the Ethereum network. Buterin views this high entry threshold as a barrier that prevents smaller ETH holders from participating. He suggested temporarily increasing bandwidth requirements to reduce the minimum staking deposit to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin elaborated: It‚Äôs net-good for both staking accessibility and scale. Then once we figure out peerdas, bandwidth reqs go back down, and once we figure out orbit SSF, the deposit minimum can drop to 1 ETH. It‚Äôs important to note that ETH holders can still stake with as little as 1 ETH by using third-party staking services, centralized platforms, or staking pools. However, these options don‚Äôt offer the same level of control over one‚Äôs ETH as solo staking, where the node operator retains full custody of their holdings. During the Ethereum Singapore 2024 event in September, Buterin emphasized the significance of solo stakers in bolstering Ethereum‚Äôs security and decentralization to tackle potential 51% attacks. At the event, Buterin said that even a small increase in the proportion of solo stakers on the Ethereum network could work as an ‚Äúextra layer of defense‚Äù for both security and privacy. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Continue To Thrive While the 32 ETH barrier may discourage small-scale ETH enthusiasts from solo staking, they can still benefit from the growing popularity of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which have made transactions more affordable. For instance, in June 2024, layer-2 scaling platform Optimism announced the launch of open-source and permissionless fault proofs, enabling users to verify off-chain transactions‚Äô validity securely. Similarly, in August 2024, asset manager Franklin Templeton approved another layer-2 solution when it launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Arbitrum network. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Similarly, crypto exchange Coinbase‚Äôs Ethereum layer-2 rollup Base has witnessed rapid adoption as its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at slightly over $2.12 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. As layer-2 solutions continue to succeed, their positive impact may extend to the Ethereum network. Crypto analysts, such as CryptoBullet, predict that ETH could rally in Q4 2024. ETH is trading at $2,352 at press time, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

SOL price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $140 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $145 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading near $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above the $132 support zone. Solana Price Revisits $132 Solana price started a fresh decline from the $162 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL declined below the $155 and $150 support levels. It even declined below $142. However, the bulls were active above the $132 support. A low was formed at $133.17 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $135 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1482 swing high to the $133 low. There was also a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $142 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140 level. The next major resistance is near the $142 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1482 swing high to the $133 low. The main resistance could be $148. A successful close above the $148 and $150 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $155. Any more gains might send the price toward the $162 level. More Downsides in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $140 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $135 level. The first major support is near the $132 level. A break below the $132 level might send the price toward the $120 zone. If there is a close below the $120 support, the price could decline toward the $112 support in the near term.

Bitcoin Miner Exchange Inflow Has Been Declining Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, miners have gradually been reducing their exchange inflows recently. ‚ÄúExchange inflows‚Äù here naturally refer to transactions heading to wallets attached to centralized exchanges from self-custodial addresses. In the context of the current topic, the exchange inflows made by miner-related wallets specifically are of interest. Generally, the main reason why miners transfer to these platforms is for selling, so large exchange inflows from them can be a sign that these chain validators are participating in a selloff. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crossover That Led To 90% & 180% Rallies Could Soon Form Again Miners have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills, so selling from them is a regular occurrence, as without it, they can‚Äôt keep their operations going. This regular selling is usually of a scale readily absorbed by the market, so there may be no visible negative effect on the asset‚Äôs price. Large and sustained exchange inflows, though, can be something to note, as they may imply unusual selling pressure from this group. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin miner exchange inflows over the history of the cryptocurrency: As the above graph shows, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin miner exchange inflows had plunged to pretty low in the first few months of the year but then underwent a sharp reversal. The reason for this increase could be that the fourth Halving occurred in April. Halvings are periodic events about every four years that permanently cut the BTC block subsidy in half. In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the coin issuance on the network (colored in blue). From this metric, the effect of the Halving is apparent, as miners can suddenly only mint about half as many coins after each of these events as before them. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike Miners make their income through two main sources, the transaction fees and the block subsidy, but most of the contribution generally comes from the latter. Thus, the miners depend on the block subsidy to make their income. After the latest Halving, the miners naturally came under immense pressure because their revenue took a drastic hit. The exchange inflow trend would suggest that these chain validators had decided to sell off their reserves in response to this income squeeze. The high inflows from the Bitcoin miners had continued for a while, but the 30-day MA of their exchange inflow has recently reversed, a potential sign that this cohort is finally pulling back on their selling. If this starts a sustained trend, then the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price might benefit from it. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced much of its recent recovery during the last few days, as its price is now down to $60,300.

According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, the NVT Golden Cross‚Äîa key metric used to determine market valuation relative to transaction volume‚Äîhas reached a major level. Related Reading: Is This Bitcoin‚Äôs Last Big Drop? Expert Points To Key Indicator Local Top Spotted, What Next? The CryptoQuant analyst revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs NVT Golden Cross has recently reached the 2.9 level, suggesting that the market cap, or price, of Bitcoin, may be outpacing its transaction volume. Particularly, Darkfost explained that a value above 2.2 indicates the possibility of reversing the mean, suggesting that the current valuation could be overextended. On the other hand, a value below -1.6 would indicate that the market is potentially undervalued. For context, the NVT Golden Cross compares the market cap of Bitcoin to the volume of transactions on its network, providing a measure of whether Bitcoin is being traded at a fair value.¬†The signals become stronger when the metric moves deeper into its upper or lower zones. At a current value of 2.9, the indication is that Bitcoin may face short-term price resistance, possibly pointing to a local top at around $65,800, Darkforst revealed. The analyst adds that such levels can gauge potential long and short positions, especially when viewed alongside global chart trends and broader market behaviour. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Major Correction? While the NVT Golden Cross presents a perspective of potential market overvaluation, another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnchain, offers additional insights by analyzing Bitcoin‚Äôs movement between exchanges. The recent data shows a significant outflow of Bitcoin from centralized exchanges. This trend of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges is seen across all three key moving averages: 30-day, 50-day, and 100-day. The analyst revealed that such an outflow hasn‚Äôt been observed at this scale since November 2022. Notably, a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges can be interpreted in multiple ways. Firstly, it often suggests that investors move their assets to more secure storage, such as cold wallets, to hold rather than trade. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here‚Äôs What This Key Indicator Suggests This behavior can signal confidence in the asset, as holders may expect its value to increase over time. With fewer BTC available on exchanges for immediate sale, the potential for downward price pressure may decrease, which could set the stage for a bullish momentum in the longer term. However, it can also indicate that traders prepare to exit their positions, anticipating a correction if they foresee market instability or overvaluation.

The token is leading the market after becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bonk ‚ÄòIn Prime Position For Turbo Green Week‚Äô As Price Recovers Key Level Aptos To Expand Its Presence In Asia On Thursday, Aptos Labs, the developer of the Aptos network, announced it had agreed to acquire the Japanese Blockchain developer HashPallete, the company behind Japan‚Äôs Palette Chain and a subsidiary of HashPort Inc. The agreement aims to become a ‚Äúgame changer for Japan and the Aptos ecosystem‚Äù as the integration with the Japanese blockchain is set to strengthen its presence in the Asian market: Japan has long been a hub of technological innovation, and it‚Äôs no different when it comes to blockchain. The country‚Äôs unique blend of advanced tech and widespread blockchain adoption makes it a model for Web3 initiatives globally. Today, we‚Äôre making one of our boldest strategic moves into this market with our agreement to acquire HashPalette Inc. As part of the acquisition, HashPort Inc. will migrate the Pallete Chain and its subsidiary‚Äôs applications to the Aptos Network. The Japanese chain will also have access to the Aptos ecosystem‚Äôs security, scalability, and developer tools. The migration is expected to be completed by early 2025, in time for the EXPO2025 DIGITAL WALLET. Moreover, Aptos Labs partnered with HashPort to support local developers, NFT creators, and enterprises by ‚Äúcontinuing to build blockchain solutions (‚Ä¶) using Aptos Network‚Äôs infrastructure.‚Äù APT Leads The Crypto Market Following the announcement, APT‚Äôs price saw a daily 11% surge, jumping to the $8.66 resistance level before retracing to the $8.51 mark. This performance crowned the token as the leading crypto amid the market retrace. APT is among the few cryptocurrencies recording green numbers in most timeframes among the top 100 tokens by market cap. The altcoin registers a 7.5% and a 41% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market volume soared 41.7%, reaching a $769.6 million trading volume in the last 24 hours. The token‚Äôs performance was highlighted by several crypto analysts, who considered that APT has the ‚Äúmost interesting chart‚Äù at the moment. According to Yuriy from BikoTrading, the cryptocurrency looks strong as the rising trading volume and the price performance ‚Äúsigns for continued growth.‚Äù The trader noted that APT‚Äôs price held above the key resistance zone amid the market retrace, which sent the token above Q3‚Äôs range highs. Similarly, crypto trader Osbrah stated that APT has been ‚Äúsecretly climbing its way to the most interesting alts charts.‚Äù He pointed out that, after October 1‚Äôs market sweep, the token had a ‚Äúclean bullish retest‚Äù above the $8 mark. To the trader, the next big resistance is at the $9 mark, which could send APT‚Äôs price to the $7.95 support zone if it fails to reclaim it. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that the altcoin‚Äôs performance could be close to a breakout. Related Reading: Analysts Unfazed By Bitcoin (BTC) Drop, But Should We Fear October 5? Per the post, SUI and APT moved in a ‚Äúcatch-up trade‚Äù path for the past year, moving closely together until SUI decoupled in early 2024. This led to a 44-day lagging period for APT before it followed SUI‚Äôs movements. After that, APT rose 98% to its yearly high of $18.8 in mid-March. Now, APT has seen a 32-day lagging period after SUI decoupled again in September, showing ‚Äúincredible amounts of strength.‚Äù Based on this, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could follow SUI‚Äôs trajectory and kickstart a massive rally in the next two weeks if history repeats.

The company is expected to provide an update on its plans next month, which will include options for users to switch their stablecoins issued by appropriately authorized issuers, the company said through an emailed statement. ""Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to restrict the provision of services to EEA users in connection with stablecoins that do not meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024,"" the firm said. The move could be a potential blow to tokens like Tether Holdings Ltd.‚Äôs USDT, the report added. Europe has established tailored regulations for the crypto space, referred to as the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules. Under so-called MiCa rules, crypto exchanges in the European Union may be compelled to remove stablecoins issued by firms like Tether that do not possess the required licenses. Robinhood ( HOOD ) was also reportedly weighing a launch of its own stablecoin, a move that may position the company to take some market share from Tether's USDT ( USDT-USD ), which represents over two-thirds of the stablecoin universe. The news comes, as¬†countries worldwide have been seeking to better define their stance on crypto. Japan's Financial Services Agency is poised to commence a review of its rules for the cryptocurrency sector over the coming months. COIN did not immediately respond to a request for comments.

34304821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646228,1728050449,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They‚Äôll Ever Return,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/rip-altcoin-seasons-crypto-analyst/,"In an analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) delves into the question that‚Äôs been looming over the crypto community in recents months: ‚ÄúWill we never have a proper altcoin season again?‚Äù As Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance (BTC.D) continues to surge and altcoins struggle to keep pace, Astronomer provides a data-driven perspective challenging the prevailing narratives that suggest the era of altcoin seasons may be over. Astronomer begins by acknowledging the difficulties faced by altcoin holders in the current market environment. ‚ÄúAlts are still at low prices and BTC.D is raging up, and yes, ETH (and altcoin) holders are having a tough time,‚Äù he notes. He observes a growing sentiment of disbelief among investors that Bitcoin dominance could decline again, casting doubt on the potential for another altcoin season. ‚ÄúYou hear things like ‚ÄòBTC ETF changed everything,‚Äô ‚ÄòBoomers will not buy altcoins which is why they won‚Äôt go up,‚Äô ‚ÄòBTC is at ATH and alts have done nothing.‚Äô Which are all things that are easy to say and grasp because they fit the current chart perfectly,‚Äù Astronomer explains. However, he cautions against accepting these narratives at face value. ‚ÄúThey give you a sense of comfort and a reason to not hold any alts, which is typically rough during accumulation stages, especially if the BTC chart ‚Äòlooks‚Äô a lot better,‚Äù he adds. Related Reading: Crypto Market‚Äôs ‚ÄúShallow Sell-Off‚Äù Indicative Of Strong Bid For Risk Assets: Trading Firm To provide clarity, Astronomer offers his own definition of an altcoin season: ‚ÄúA true altcoin season is one where liquidity from the most dominant asset (BTC) flows to the other assets (ETH and altcoins). As a consequence, BTC.D drops and nearly all altcoins go up.‚Äù The Case For An Impending Altcoin Season Astronomer lays out a series of facts to support his argument that an altcoin season is still on the horizon: #1 Historical Precedence ‚ÄúFirst fact: we had the big altcoin season every single cycle (4-year rotation) like clockwork,‚Äù he asserts. This pattern is not only evident in historical charts but also in the collective memory of those active during previous cycles. Astronomer cautions against adopting a ‚Äúthis time is different‚Äù mindset, which inherently positions investors at a disadvantage. ‚ÄúHistory rhymes/repeats,‚Äù he reminds readers. #2 Bitcoin Dominance Chart Aligns With 4-Year Cycle ‚ÄúThe BTC.D chart is on track with its 4-year cycle,‚Äù Astronomer notes. He previously predicted that a top in Bitcoin dominance would occur around months 34 to 38 of the cycle. ‚ÄúWe are now month 33 in the 4-year cycle, which means the tides are about to shift in just a few months,‚Äù he points out. Believing that Bitcoin dominance will continue to rise unchecked is essentially betting against established cyclical patterns, according to the analyst. #3 The Grand Crypto Rotation ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòfirst Grand Altcoin rotation‚Äô generally happens once per cycle: around Q4 in year 3 of the cycle and is again playing out like clockwork so far,‚Äù Astronomer states. He explains that in previous cycles, certain altcoins (a minority) perform strongly early on, driven by specific narratives, while the majority experience significant gains later, fueled by liquidity flowing from Bitcoin. He cites the 2018‚Äì2022 cycle as a prime example. ‚ÄúIn this cycle, in the first 3 years, LINK is a great example as it was one of the strongest top 100 altcoins and has put in a 100x, while ETH (and all the other BTC liquidity-driven altcoins) have put in a measly 3x,‚Äù he explains. In the last year of that cycle, the dynamics shifted: ‚ÄúETH has put in a 10x, and LINK has only gained another 3x or so.‚Äù Related Reading: Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‚ÄòMake As Much Money As Possible‚Äô #4 Overrated Impact Of Bitcoin ETF Addressing the notion that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF has fundamentally altered market dynamics, Astronomer is skeptical. ‚ÄúThe BTC ETF narrative to cancel alt season is way overrated,‚Äù he argues. He points out that since their launch, ETF total flows have accumulated up to $40 billion, while Bitcoin‚Äôs centralized exchange (CEX) volumes average $20 billion daily. ‚ÄúETF flows are negligible, which is why you never heard me talk about them as I like to filter noise,‚Äù he asserts. #5 Favorable Monetary Policy Looms Astronomer also highlights macroeconomic factors that could benefit altcoins. ‚ÄúInterest rates are on the decline, the US money supply is increasing drastically (where now also China is following suit). The only thing we are waiting for is QE, which is typically a natural consequence of M2 increasing (with a delay),‚Äù he explains. Historically, such monetary conditions have been conducive to altcoin appreciation. ‚ÄúThe monetary policy shifting in our favor typically also means altcoins do well,‚Äù he notes. #6 Bitcoin‚Äôs All-Time High Is An Arbitrary Indicator He challenges the idea that Bitcoin reaching an all-time high (ATH) without a concurrent altcoin season signals a permanent decoupling. ‚ÄúBTC being at ATH is an arbitrary gauge to when alt season begins and the fact that it reached ATH but altcoin season hasn‚Äôt begun yet is, in my opinion, not valid to call it canceled,‚Äù Astronomer argues. He emphasizes that time and cyclical patterns are more significant factors than price milestones. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $61,129.

This recent dip has left analysts and investors on edge, awaiting confirmation of the next price direction. Just last week, sentiment was strongly bullish, but the current market atmosphere is filled with fear and uncertainty. One notable analyst, Carl Runefelt, has shared a chart highlighting the risk of Solana losing its key support level, which could lead to further downside. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The entire crypto market is grappling with high volatility, amplifying uncertainty. This has led to growing fear among investors, many concerned about the potential for deeper corrections. While Solana showed strong momentum recently, the present market conditions have dampened optimism, leaving traders anxious for a clear signal that could reignite confidence. As Solana continues to hover near this critical support level, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether it can regain its bullish momentum or if further declines are on the horizon. Solana Testing Crucial Demand Levels Solana is at a critical juncture, as its price action has shifted from bullish to bearish in just a few days. Bulls are now proceeding with caution, especially below the $140 mark, which represents a key structural level. The $137 support level is crucial, as it could be Solana‚Äôs last defense against a further drop. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the precarious situation Solana finds itself in. According to Runefelt, Solana could see a sharp drop to $128 if this support level breaks, extending the current consolidation phase. In addition to the risk of a breakdown, Runefelt also pointed to key resistance levels that bulls need to target if Solana is to regain its upward momentum. The most important levels to watch are the $150 and $160 supply zones. A break above these zones would be necessary to confirm a reversal into a bullish trend. Until then, the price action remains uncertain, and investors are closely monitoring these critical support and resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks The current market volatility and the threat of further declines are causing hesitation among traders. Solana‚Äôs ability to hold its support or break through resistance will determine its next move. SOL Technical Analysis: Prices To Watch Solana (SOL) is trading at $139 after a correction from local highs that haven‚Äôt been broken since July. The price faces significant resistance as it struggles to reclaim the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $139.9, a critical strength indicator. For bulls to regain momentum, holding above this level is essential. Additionally, the price must reclaim the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $144.3 to confirm a bullish reversal and signal a potential recovery. However, the market may see further downside pressure if Solana fails to surpass these crucial technical levels. A deeper correction could lower the price to $120, a key demand zone that could serve as a new level of support. This would extend the current consolidation phase and put more downward pressure on Solana‚Äôs price.
