Bitcoin And Ethereum Addresses Shrink In 2024,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-crypto-losing-steam-bitcoin-and-ethereum-addresses-shrink-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is presently experiencing a substantial decline, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a substantial decrease in active addresses. This trend, which has persisted throughout 2024, has triggered apprehension regarding the future of these prominent cryptocurrencies. The implications for market dynamics could be profound as investor enthusiasm diminishes. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number Declining Active Addresses According to the latest stats from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin‚Äôs active addresses have contracted by about 1.17 million to 855,000, whereas Ethereum has reduced by about 382,000 to 312,000. This equates to a 27% drawdown for Bitcoin and an 18% decline for Ethereum year-to-date. The absence of new investors entering the market appears to be the primary cause of this decline. This is essential for maintaining favorable momentum, as existing participants dominate trading activity in the absence of new capital inflows. Since early 2024, active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses have been declining ‚ÄúFor the bulls to dominate the market, the influx of new investors is a crucial condition. 1. Bitcoin 1.17M -> 855K 2.

Still, the current user base carries a lot of investors who would have expected such developments. The continued quantitative tightening of the Federal Reserve continues to strip liquidity from the market, adding more pressure to the situation. Market Sentiment And Future Prospects There are, however indications that a potential rebound is near in the face of these challenges. For example, funding rate on Ethereum has remained positive for the past week, meaning there is growing interest among investors in long positions. This implies that whereas plunges in the price of Ethereum have been ongoing, a good majority of the market remains optimistic regarding its performance going forward. BTC and ETH addresses decline: BTC drops to 855K, ETH to 312K in 2024 Since the start of 2024, the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses has continued to drop. Bitcoin addresses fell from 1.17 million to 855,000, while Ethereum addresses declined from 382,000 to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) October 1, 2024 It‚Äôs quite interesting that large Ethereum holders have been accumulating their assets, rather than selling them off. These large holders reduced their outflows from 311,950 to 139,390, suggesting they have confidence in the long-term prospects of the altcoin. Investors that do this kind of action usually expect the prices to recover soon. Furthermore, Bitcoin‚Äôs Exchange Flow Multiple has experienced a substantial decline. This metric contrasts with short-term inflows and outflows with those over a lengthier period, indicating that current trading activity is significantly lower than historical averages. A low Exchange Flow Multiple typically suggests that investors are holding their assets in anticipation of future price increases rather than actively trading them.

The analyst, which has been so big on a looming altseason since the beginning of the year, has revealed a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and even Ethereum (king of altcoins) in the short term. Known for his sometimes controversial and often contrarian predictions, Capo returned just as the market experienced a notable correction in October, sharing his bearish outlook for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. His latest prediction is that Ethereum could plummet as low as $1,800 before seeing any substantial recovery. ETH‚Äôs Predicted Decline Ethereum has already dropped by 10% in the past seven days and is currently trading around around $2,330, but according to Capo, this decline could worsen. He predicted that ETH might fall further into the $1,800 to $2,000 range, which is a possible 23% dip from its current price, before eventually rebounding. However, he believes an altcoin season will still materialize. Related Reading: Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon Quick update: There‚Äôs a possibility of one last shakeout, with $BTC testing the $48k-50k zone and $ETH $1.8k-2k, before the real altseason begins. If that happens, I‚Äôll be adding more to my altcoin bags. https://t.co/sx6u8wPNrK ‚Äî il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) October 2, 2024 Capo‚Äôs track record of analysis since the beginning of the year shows a consistent belief in the upcoming dominance of altcoins. Throughout 2024, he has repeatedly emphasized the potential for altcoins, particularly Ethereum, to outperform Bitcoin as profits generated from BTC flow into smaller assets. However, the altcoin season has yet to materialize, and Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto investment scene. Time To Go Long On Ethereum? It‚Äôs worth noting that Crypto Capo‚Äôs predictions often have a certain lore attached to them. There is a running joke among some investors that whenever Capo makes a prediction, the market tends to do the opposite. This goes as far back as his prediction of Bitcoin falling to $12,000 last year, but the crypto eventually broke past resistance levels. Now, with Capo predicting the possibility of continued decline for Ethereum and Bitcoin amid October‚Äôs bullish market sentiment (often dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù), it raises the question from many investors if his bearish call is far-fetched. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price Only time will tell if the market plays out according to Capo‚Äôs analysis. However, given the current inflow of investments and the crypto market, which has mostly rallied in October, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Ethereum rebounds rather than experiences the significant drop Capo is forecasting. Naturally, many savvy whales and traders have seen the current decline as an opportunity to ‚Äúgo long‚Äù and accumulate more Ethereum in expectation of the resumption of inflows. This sentiment is reflected through the US Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed $14.45 million in inflows yesterday despite the price correction. Interestingly, it is important to note that Capo‚Äôs analysis is only talking about a possible case and remains bullish for Ethereum in the long term.

Many expected the bullish trend to continue, but Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Concerns are mounting as some market observers predict a deeper decline, possibly falling to yearly lows around $2,150 if the current support level fails to hold. This has reignited fear and uncertainty across the market as Ethereum‚Äôs price sends mixed signals. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The recent decline has shaken confidence, and market participants anxiously await a clear direction. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum‚Äôs next move and whether it can reclaim support levels to resume an upward trajectory. The coming days are expected to be crucial for Ethereum‚Äôs price action, with investors bracing for heightened volatility in response to these shifting market conditions. Ethereum Testing Crucial Support Line Ethereum is now trading at a critical juncture that could define its direction in the coming week. Price action over the next few days is expected to be pivotal for Ethereum and the entire altcoin market. Analysts closely monitor whether ETH can maintain its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Failing to hold above key support levels could signal a broader market decline. Analysts and investors eagerly await an Ethereum recovery as it hovers above a crucial support line that could be the launchpad for a rally to new highs. One top analyst, Carl Runefelt, recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the current trendline supporting ETH price. In his technical analysis, Runefelt warns that the price could drop significantly if Ethereum fails to hold this trendline. If the price breaches this support, he identifies $2,150 as the next potential target. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum A fall to these levels would likely shake out many investors expecting a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. If ETH loses this key support, it may lead to uncertainty and heightened volatility. This fall would keep market participants on edge while waiting for the next move. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,350 after failing to establish a higher high above $2,820. This recent price action has disappointed bulls, as ETH has lost crucial support levels, including the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,542 and the simple moving average (MA) at $2,466. These indicators are key in determining short-term trends, and their loss as support has raised concerns about further downside risk. For the bulls to regain momentum, ETH must break above the 4-hour 200 EMA and the 4-hour MA and successfully hold these levels as support. Reclaiming these indicators would signal renewed strength and pave the way for another attempt to increase prices. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop ‚Äì On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand However, a deeper correction is likely if Ethereum fails to recover these levels. Key support around $2,100 becomes the next target, with the potential for even lower prices. Investors are closely monitoring these levels, as the coming days will be critical in determining whether ETH can recover or continue its downtrend.
