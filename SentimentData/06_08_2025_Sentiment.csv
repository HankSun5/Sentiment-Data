This alignment establishes a robust technical foundation, indicating a potential breakout as buyers step in at this critical level. Key Support Level Near Aligning With VWAP Average In a post on X, CryptoPulse drew attention to SUI’s recent price action, noting that the token has pulled back into what is described as a “sweet spot” for potential buying opportunities. The price recently touched the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and is currently sitting directly on a critical structural support level around $3.50. Related Reading: SUI MACD Signals Massive Rally Ahead — 400% Price Surge Possible This zone has been a key area of interest for the analyst, who has been patiently waiting for SUI to reach this level before stepping in. The convergence of the VWAP and structural support creates a favorable setup that often precedes strong upward moves. Fundamentally, SUI is also gaining increasing recognition and traction within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The project’s growing presence, combined with solid chart structure, reinforces the possibility of substantial upside potential over the coming weeks and months. Currently, the analyst is actively averaging into their position, setting an initial target at $5. However, they remain optimistic that this setup can extend much further if momentum continues to build and key technical levels are broken. With both technical and fundamental factors converging, CryptoPulse views SUI as a project worth watching closely for possible significant gains ahead. SUI Chart Shows Promise, But Setup Needs Confirmation Sharing additional insights in a separate post, AlgoCats highlighted that SUI is currently showing a very promising chart setup. The analyst noted that while the structure looks favorable, they are waiting for a more defined formation to develop, which would offer a clearer signal for a long position before considering an entry point. Their target is a key resistance zone that has seen multiple wicks and a previous fake breakout, marking it as a critical level where price action could accelerate.

However, AlgoCats emphasized that patience is key, and they intend to wait for confirmation before making any move. Until that confirmation arrives, the focus remains on observing how SUI behaves around current levels. AlgoCats is prepared to act, but only when the chart provides a clean and confident signal for entry. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $3.54, demonstrating a nearly 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased significantly by more than 33% in the past day.

From presales that give you hands-on access before launch, to established names delivering consistent performance, the current market offers a mix of innovation and reliability. Whether it’s a coin redefining the presale experience, a blockchain built for speed and scalability, a community-powered token blending culture with finance, or an ecosystem mainstay that never loses relevance, each has its own story. Here’s a closer look at four standout picks making waves in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Where You Don’t Just Buy, You Feel the Trade BlockDAG is redefining what a presale can be. With its Dashboard V4, users aren’t left waiting to find out how it all works. Instead, they can log in right now and experience a fully interactive BDAG Exchange simulator. From watching the BDAG/USD price fluctuate in real time, to clicking “Buy” and seeing wallet balances update, the feeling is immediate. It’s no longer abstract. The simulation includes full BUY/SELL panels, live order books, price charts, and a market feed. This isn’t a teaser; it’s a hands-on demo that turns crypto from concept to contact. And the numbers? They match the energy. BlockDAG has already raised $363 million, sold over 24.7 billion BDAG, and is currently in batch 29 at $0.0276. That’s a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Right now, a limited window is open to buy in at $0.0016, allowing new users to secure significantly more upside. Among the top crypto coins 2025 has introduced, BlockDAG is the only one giving its users something they can feel now , not months down the line. 2. Avax: Smart Contracts with Speed and Scale Avax has carved out its position through a combination of speed, scalability, and multi-chain functionality. What users love most is how the platform balances advanced features with a relatively user-friendly experience. Transactions are confirmed in seconds, which gives it a real-world responsiveness that many platforms still struggle to match. Its ongoing development into subnets allows customized chains to run under the Avalanche umbrella, creating a network of networks. This adds utility for developers, but also gives investors confidence that the tech can scale. As we move through 2025, Avax continues to attract attention not just for performance, but for its approach to interoperability and speed. It’s earned its place on the list of top crypto coins 2025 by offering a blend of tech and usability that’s rare to find at scale. 3. Pengu: Where Culture Meets Coin Pengu isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement. Inspired by online culture and driven by a strong community, it has grown fast by doing what most coins can’t: staying lighthearted while building serious momentum. What sets Pengu apart is how emotionally connected its holders feel. The memes, the inside jokes, the vibe, it’s all part of the value. But it’s not just fluff. Pengu has rolled out staking, community rewards, and unique NFT integrations that make it feel like more than a meme coin. The roadmap includes utility-focused tools and cross-chain expansion, showing it’s aiming beyond just virality. In a market where people want both identity and opportunity, Pengu has become one of the top crypto coins 2025 by making crypto feel personal again. It’s a reminder that sometimes, fun and finance don’t have to be separate. 4. BNB: Consistency in a Volatile Market BNB has long been a staple in the portfolios of serious crypto holders. Tied to one of the largest ecosystems in the industry, it powers transactions, fuels smart contracts, and unlocks utility across a wide range of products. Even as trends shift and new coins make noise, BNB continues to show resilience. It’s used, held, and traded at volume, making it a practical choice for both experienced traders and those just entering the space. What’s powerful about BNB is its staying power. It’s not built on hype cycles or single-use cases. It’s functional, familiar, and constantly updated. For those looking for a grounded asset in their search for the top crypto coins 2025, BNB remains one of the most reliable options. Final Thoughts In 2025, the top crypto coins 2025 are defined by more than market cap or short-term gains, they’re shaped by the experience and value they deliver. BlockDAG stands out for giving users real trading interaction before launch. Avax offers a technical foundation of speed and interoperability. Pengu proves that community and culture can fuel serious growth. And BNB remains a pillar of stability in a fast-changing market. Whether you’re seeking innovation, engagement, or consistency, these coins represent strong candidates for long-term consideration. As the year unfolds, each will continue to play a unique role in shaping the crypto landscape.

With a U.S. national trust bank charter and RLUSD stablecoin integration on the horizon, institutional momentum around XRP and Litecoin is growing. These updates are sending price predictions higher for both coins. Yet it’s not just legacy assets in the spotlight—MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines, with analysts projecting a 22,400% ROI this quarter as it emerges as a new high-upside contender for investors seeking the next breakout. Ripple Bank Move Gains Traction Ripple’s bank strategy is now gaining serious momentum. With its OCC charter application for the Ripple National Trust Bank, a Federal Reserve master account pursuit, and a full suite of custodial partnerships, Ripple is placing itself at the center of institutional banking and XRP growth. The RLUSD stablecoin rollout is also primed to boost real-world payments and bank adoption of Ripple XRP. Analyst XRP price prediction calls remain positive, despite short-term pullbacks. The average forecast for August sits near $3.14, with a bullish scenario of $3.36. Fibonacci extension analysis targets $5.50 for 2025, while longer-term projections suggest a range between $4.50 and $9.00—assuming more regulatory clarity and continued institutional adoption. Ripple OCC charter news and Ripple bank partnership news are driving renewed market optimism and could set the stage for a major XRP price rally. Litecoin Price Bullish Prediction Litecoin is riding a fresh wave of optimism in the wake of Ripple news today. The current Litecoin price prediction 2025 averages $137, with a projected peak at $146.80. Institutional banking trends and the 80% odds of a Litecoin ETF approval are fueling a strong narrative for a Litecoin price boost. Analysts are watching closely for a Litecoin price rally after Ripple news, as the two coins often see correlated moves during periods of positive market sentiment. Ripple’s impact on Litecoin price is being felt through both direct institutional flows and broader altcoin performance after big ecosystem updates. For those looking at utility-focused crypto coins and cross-chain payment solutions, both XRP and Litecoin are high on the watchlist for the rest of 2025. Ripple’s Bank Strategy Sparks MAGACOIN FINANCE Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top story among traders scanning for Q3’s biggest opportunities. As Ripple’s bank strategy shakes up institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its combination of community-driven momentum and aggressive growth. Wallet growth, social chatter, and presale hype all point to explosive interest, with some analysts now calling for a staggering 22,400% ROI this quarter. This project’s appeal comes from its unique blend of real-world narrative, transparent governance, and volatility-friendly trading conditions. With the market focused on Ripple banking partnerships 2025 and the effect of bank adoption on XRP price, traders are looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for an early entry before mainstream attention hits. In a market hungry for utility-focused crypto coins and new narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is staking its claim as the next major contender for altcoin leadership in 2025. Next Moves: What to Watch as Bank News Lifts Crypto Institutional adoption and bank partnerships are reshaping the outlook for XRP and Litecoin, while Ripple ecosystem updates keep both coins near the top of analyst forecasts. Ripple’s ongoing bank strategy is boosting institutional confidence, translating to bullish calls for both price and adoption across the board. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 22,400% ROI projection, is stepping into the spotlight as the bold new pick for investors wanting high upside in a shifting market.

The company released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on Tuesday, offering two fully downloadable, customizable large language models that don’t require a license fee or API gate. Both models are text-only and are being shared under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning anyone can download the model weights from platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face. They also work on LM Studio and Ollama, and can run on everything from laptops to cloud servers. OpenAI said the models are optimized to function across a range of hardware, including consumer devices and chips from Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras, and Groq. OpenAI trained models to block malicious fine-tuning OpenAI said it delayed releasing the models to complete safety evaluations. During pre-training, the company filtered out sensitive material, specifically chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear data. It also tested scenarios where bad actors might try to fine-tune the models for malicious tasks. The company reported that none of those experiments led to models reaching its internal “high capability” threshold, a classification outlined in its Preparedness Framework, which it uses to assess harm potential. Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, told reporters, “It’s been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there.” gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!) (and a smaller one that runs on a phone). super proud of the team; big triumph of technology. — Sam Altman (@sama) August 5, 2025 He added that the company also included three external expert groups to audit and comment on the fine-tuning of safety tests. These models aren’t open-source in the traditional sense. OpenAI is only providing the model weights, not the full training code or datasets. But they are still open enough to allow users to test, fine-tune, and deploy them however they see fit. The company framed this as a middle ground between full transparency and maintaining some control. Amazon, Microsoft, and Anthropic expand AI marketplace The models will also be available through cloud platforms. Amazon , Microsoft , and Baseten are offering gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b directly to customers. This is the first time Amazon Web Services (AWS) will host OpenAI models, and they will be accessible through both Bedrock and Sagemaker. Amazon said these models will help customers build AI agents capable of advanced reasoning and step-by-step thinking. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, has positioned AWS as a marketplace where companies can pick from multiple AI providers, not just Amazon’s in-house tools. In addition to OpenAI, Amazon has also partnered with Anthropic, putting $8 billion into the AI startup. That deal lets AWS clients access Anthropic’s Claude models. On Tuesday, Anthropic said it would release a new Claude model, which it claims is better at coding, research, and data analysis than its previous versions. The release puts OpenAI in the same lane as other companies offering open-weight models, like Meta, Mistral AI (which is backed by Microsoft), and DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that previously gained attention for building an AI model with human-like reasoning. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, “OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they’re advancing innovation in open-source software.” Nvidia partnered with OpenAI to make sure the models perform well across its hardware. So did AMD, Cerebras, and Groq, giving users more flexibility when choosing where to run the models. Both gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b support chain-of-thought processing, tool usage, and tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Users can run them locally or in the cloud without needing to call an API or rely on a paid plan. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, fueled by media attention and the asset’s performance.

Often, Bitcoin’s strong performance acts as a catalyst for the entire cryptocurrency market , pulling altcoins along with it.

This significant move for BTC $114,000 underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its position at the forefront of the digital economy.

In after-hours trading, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell about 4%, as the forecast failed to meet some investor expectations, according to Reuters . Year to date, AMD shares have jumped over 40%, far outpacing a roughly 12% gain in the benchmark chip index, as investors wager on its role in the AI boom. Companies such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI rely on AMD’s advanced processors to run AI tasks. Cloud providers are increasing their spending plans to build out data-centre capacity for AI workloads. Meta recently lifted the low end of its annual capital spending range by $2 billion—to between $66 billion and $72 billion. Likewise, Microsoft projected a record $30 billion in capital outlays for the first quarter of its fiscal year to keep pace with surging AI demand. No China sales yet as licenses are still pending For the third quarter, AMD anticipates about $8.7 billion in revenue, give or take $300 million. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had an average forecast of $8.30 billion. That outlook excludes any sales from shipments of its MI308 AI chip to China, since export licenses are still under review by the U.S. government. In April, Washington imposed curbs requiring a licence to send advanced AI processors to China. The Commerce Department is now assessing AMD’s applications, and the company said it will resume those exports once approval is granted. In mid-July, the administration quietly reversed the prohibition on specially tailored, “China-compliant” chips. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Nvidia filed applications to resume H20 GPU sales , and AMD plans to seek licences for its MI308 accelerators, but approvals are still pending Over the past ten years, under CEO Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD has transformed into a major technology supplier across computing, capitalizing on Intel’s missteps to turn its own fortunes around. As a result, AMD’s market capitalization now exceeds Intel’s by about $200 billion. But Nvidia’s growth is far ahead of both companies as its dominance in AI accelerators has made it the world’s most valuable company. AMD remains the second‐largest producer of graphics chips, the foundation for data‐center AI accelerators, and its CPUs go head‐to‐head with Intel in both PC and server markets. AMD moves more manufacturing to the U.S. In May, Su described China as a “large opportunity” for semiconductors and AI, even amid tightening export rules and shifting tariff plans. “There should be a balance between export controls for national security as well as ensuring that we get the widest possible adoption of our technology,” Su told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “That’s a good thing for U.S. jobs in the U.S. economy.” She added that U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and widespread adoption “is the primary objective and a really great position for us to be in.” Su said there is a “balance to be played between” restricting chip exports and providing access to them. Meanwhile, CNBC reported Super Micro Computer Inc. shares fell 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the server maker reported disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued cautious guidance for the coming quarter. In the period ended June 30, revenue rose 7.5% year-over-year. The company projects adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.52 per share on $6 billion to $7 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated $0.59 per share on $6.6 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2026, Super Micro forecasts at least $33 billion in revenue, topping the $29.94 billion consensus. After a surge in demand during 2023 for Nvidia-equipped data-center servers used in artificial intelligence, growth has since moderated. The company dodged a Nasdaq delisting after delays in its financial filings and the departure of its auditor. As of Tuesday’s close, shares had climbed about 88% this year, while the S&P 500 gained 7%.

Now, the U.S. is turning up the scrutiny on Chinese AI startups and the people helping them on American soil. Following the arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting advanced Nvidia AI chips to China, a group of U.S. lawmakers and federal agencies has increased their scrutiny of Chinese AI activity. Separately, a group of Republican senators is also pressing the Commerce Department to evaluate the potential data security risks posed by open-source Chinese AI models like DeepSeek. U.S. senators call for an investigation into Chinese AI models On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, both 28, for allegedly violating export controls by shipping tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H100 processors, to China without the required government licenses. The chips are subject to strict export controls due to their strategic value in the development of AI technologies with potential military applications. The pair faces up to 20 years in prison under the Export Control Reform Act. According to prosecutors, Geng and Yang operated ALX Solutions Inc., a company based in El Monte, California, which they founded in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department began imposing tighter licensing requirements on AI chip exports. Investigators seized mobile phones and discovered communications that show the pair were fully aware that the company was used as a front to bypass export restrictions, routing shipments through Malaysia to disguise their final destination in China. The Justice Department noted that Yang had overstayed her visa, while Geng is a legal permanent U.S. resident. A federal judge in Los Angeles released Geng on a $250,000 bond, while a detention hearing for Yang is scheduled for August 12. No pleas have been entered in the case yet. The FBI and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security are leading the investigation . Senators target DeepSeek Seven Republican U.S. senators are urging the Commerce Department to probe DeepSeek , a Chinese open-source AI firm, for potential data security and export control violations. In a letter sent Tuesday , the senators, Todd Young, John Cornyn, John Curtis, Bill Cassidy, Marsha Blackburn, and Jon Husted, led by Sen. Ted Budd, called on the Commerce Department to assess whether Chinese AI models may be collecting data from American users and funneling it to the Chinese government or military. The letter raises several key concerns, like whether DeepSeek’s software could be transmitting U.S. personal or enterprise data back to Chinese servers, whether it has gained unauthorized access to export-controlled semiconductors, and whether it has violated terms of use for U.S.-based models to improve its own systems. The senators also referenced concerns that DeepSeek may have misappropriated U.S. AI technology, reiterating a previous statement made in January by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who vowed to impose restrictions if such violations were confirmed. U.S. officials remain skeptical of DeepSeek’s claims that its AI reasoning models were on par with, or superior to, leading U.S. models at a fraction of the cost. They still believe that the company’s success came from skimming off U.S. technologies. The Commerce Department has yet to comment on the senators’ letter or the latest criminal charges.

In a new YouTube video, Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers that if the S&P 500 (SPX) breaks out past a key resistance level, it may trigger FOMO (fear of missing out), driving Bitcoin and stocks even higher as people with cash on the sidelines rush in. “If the S&P is able to break out of this zone, break past the logarithmic resistance that spans back from the peak of 2007 – and 2009 being that low – I think we could go on a pretty significant run to the upside. And I could even say it’s severe for the bears or anyone sitting on the sideline with too much cash… Institutions, retail, no matter who it is… if they have too much still sitting on the sidelines, I think that’s where the FOMO would really kick in if we’re able to break out of this high that’s just been put in at around 6,400 points on the S&P 500.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Pizzino also shares a weekly chart showing Bitcoin’s historical price correlation with the S&P 500, suggesting the flagship crypto asset will likely print new all-time highs if the SPX logarithmic resistance level is breached. “If that occurs, Bitcoin’s price … would probably follow suit into that period.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube As of Monday’s close, the SPX is trading for 6,329. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $115,026 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours.

Traders are now targeting newer tokens with higher upside as XRP and DOGE lose momentum in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names starting to trend as funds rotate. The wider crypto market has seen a steady shake-up in recent weeks. The ETF-driven excitement of XRP is fading with declining odds as investors shift to other tokens. Meanwhile, DOGE has struggled to gain major fresh developments despite having a strong social media presence. Although altcoin rotation is nothing new, the pace of movement this time has surprised analysts. Investors are now more focused on narrative, token utility, and community strength. These shifts have helped spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE among a short list of coins that are set to explode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Steam as Traders Eye Gains XRP and DOGE funds are flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE as momentum grows around its presale. Interest in the coin is rising fast and early buyers are expecting up to 27x returns on initial investment. Traders say the timing is right—XRP hype is cooling, and DOGE lacks a clear path to new highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh narrative that ties political energy with meme coin appeal. Its capped supply model and strong branding makes it stand out in the presale market. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself to attract both crypto natives and new investors unlike other tokens that launch without structure. The project blends cultural relevance with smart economics. Its presale is already drawing in whales and retail holders. Wallet data shows presence of large flows from existing large-cap tokens into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The flow could mirror early SHIB cycles when capital moved quickly into high-upside opportunities. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to sell out ahead of schedule. Meme Coins Lose Momentum as Traders Search for the Next Big Run DOGE and SHIB kicked off the last meme cycle in late 2024. However, the coins are now trading sideways with low volatility. Even major news fails to bring meaningful movement. The lack of driving factors is pushing retail and mid-level traders to seek out smaller tokens with bigger potential. Newer tokens have the advantage of surprise. They attract early momentum with less overhead and fresh excitement. This has made the space competitive but also wide open for the right token at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be fitting that profile well. It combines cultural timing, simple access, and a strong hook—elements that made earlier meme tokens break out in past cycles. Final Thoughts Crypto is fast and unforgiving for investors who invest late. Crypto investors who catch trends early often see the biggest rewards. Right now, the trend is clear: large holders are trimming positions in older tokens and moving into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is receiving growing attention as this shift continues. If the presale closes as expected and demand holds, the coin may lead the next breakout wave in the crypto market.

Based in Daegu, Shin was found guilty of manipulating trading data and misleading customers. He is already serving a seven-year sentence for misappropriating ₩10 billion (about $7.5 million) in deposits, and now faces more jail time over a smaller but still serious scheme. Inflated Trading Volume And Misleading Announcements According to the Daegu District Court, Shin used false trading figures to pump up the crypto market price of Bitsonic Coin (BSC). He lured customers with fake announcements and boosted “KRW points” through sham buybacks. Those points then funded actual purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum from platform users. Once Shin converted the crypto into cash, he poured money into unrelated firms. The court found that this cycle netted him roughly ₩160 million ($115,000) in ill-gotten gains. Investigators noted that Shin also gave investors a lock-up period guarantee. In reality, neither the investments nor the promised interest could be returned. When victims pressed for their funds, they discovered the promise was hollow. Earlier Price Manipulation Conviction In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, known only by the surname Bae, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison for a separate fraud involving price manipulation. Reports said that this earlier verdict stemmed from a Seoul District Court finding that both executives deceptively profited by inflating trade volumes. At that time, Shin settled with the two biggest victims, which the judge said helped merit a lighter sentence. The February ruling emphasized that neither Shin nor Bae had prior convictions for similar crimes. Judge Seong Gi-jun noted that their lack of a criminal record and Shin’s partial restitution with major victims weighed in favor of a “lenient” approach under South Korean law. Yet the sizable sums involved—₩10 billion in deposits and the recent ₩160 million—underscore the scale of trust these executives betrayed. Questions Over Exchange Oversight According to Digital Asset reports , professionals indicate that the crypto exchange Bitsonic situation points to loopholes in real-time observation of exchange operations. Swollen volumes and unverified lock-up assurances are likely to go undetected without more robust on-chain analytics. Customer trust suffers every time a high-profile exchange scandal erupts. Some traders are already demanding mandatory proof-of-reserves audits and transparent order books to help deter such abuses.

49608228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799285,1754438454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49608228.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holds Steady At $115,000, But Realized Price Data Warns Of Fragility",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-115000-realized-price-data-warns/,"Following another rejection from the $120,000 region on July 21, Bitcoin (BTC) is now holding steady around the $115,000 level. However, realized price data suggests that BTC’s surface-level calm may be nearing its end. Old Bitcoin Whales Stop Realizing Gains According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin whale behavior indicates that the asset may be walking a tightrope. While “old whales” have stopped realizing profits, newer whales remain slightly in the green – though only marginally. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Market Flashes Warning: IBIT Outflows Paired With Drop In Tron USDT Transfers Here, old whales refer to large BTC holders who have held the digital asset for more than a year. New whales – including institutional players – are those who entered the market within the past year. Kripto Mevsimi notes that the current balance between old capital and newly invested capital may not hold much longer. A decisive break in either direction could push BTC into a new price range. The chart below illustrates the rising realized cap of old whales from 2022 to 2024, confirming that this cohort steadily realized profits during that period. Notably, this quiet distribution phase coincided with mid-cycle market conditions. However, since early 2025, the realized cap for old whales has flattened – signalling a pause in profit-taking. Their average cost basis of $39,400 puts them well in profit, suggesting they are likely waiting for higher prices before re-entering the market. In contrast, the average cost basis for newer whales is approximately $105,300 – a level that now serves as their psychological breakeven. As long as BTC remains above this threshold, these newer investors are unlikely to sell in large numbers. That said, a drop below this critical level could trigger risk-off behavior among new whales. Kripto Mevsimi suggests that such a move could escalate current conditions from moderate profit-taking to panic selling, potentially triggering a wave of leverage unwinds. Keep An Eye On Realized Price It’s worth noting that recent activity has been minimal across both BTC investor cohorts – old whales and new whales alike. As the CryptoQuant analyst puts it: Old whales are idle. New whales are exposed. Neither is pressing the market – yet. But once the range breaks, the reaction could be sharp. In short, Bitcoin holders should closely monitor realized price levels. If BTC maintains a price above $105,000, newer capital is likely to remain stable. However, a drop below that could weaken the floor and invite downside pressure.

That said, a few warning signs point to potential short-term weakness. For instance, BTC deposits to Binance have been rising steadily after months of decline, indicating that selling pressure may increase in the near future. At press time, BTC trades at $113,500, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

With speculation mounting that the SEC may withdraw its appeal, investors are recalibrating their expectations—some now targeting 20x returns , with prices potentially climbing past $40 if institutional inflows ignite post-ETF approval. On-chain data shows consistent whale accumulation despite short-term pullbacks like the recent –6.5% dip on August 2, reinforcing the view that smart money is preparing for a decisive breakout. The prospect of a U.S.-listed XRP spot ETF has reenergized the community, and analysts argue that legal clarity could finally unlock the long-stalled upside. At the same time, many retail traders are hunting for newer opportunities with similar potential but fewer regulatory hurdles – sparking fresh interest in high-traction presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional cues align with ETF optimism Multiple market analysts agree that XRP’s trajectory hinges on one factor: regulation. A spot ETF would require the SEC to cease its legal pursuit, a move that would not only enable relisting on U.S. exchanges but also pave the way for institutional exposure via regulated channels. If this scenario unfolds, capital could pour in similarly to what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF approvals. Reports indicate that whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP are already repositioning in anticipation, a strong sign of conviction. Still, some investors see faster ROI potential outside legacy altcoins, especially as timing and entry costs become crucial considerations in a maturing bull cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A presale play attracting serious attention Amid the growing buzz surrounding XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as one of the most trustworthy early-stage crypto plays on the market today. Its smart contracts recently passed multiple security audits , reinforcing its reputation as a safe and credible investment vehicle. With community growth accelerating and early-stages allocations rapidly disappearing , the project has also topped several crypto media watchlists in recent days. Compared to legacy assets like XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean-slate narrative, free from legal entanglements but packed with breakout potential . For risk-tolerant investors, it represents a calculated entry point into what some analysts call “t he next big story in crypto ”. Risk appetite shifts as breakout bets intensify XRP remains a compelling hold for long-term investors betting on regulation-driven rallies. But as the broader market recovers and sentiment tilts bullish , traders are expanding their exposure to include high-momentum, low-barrier presales with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this thesis perfectly – pairing real community growth with strategic development and audit-backed trust signals . Its rising profile across crypto Twitter and Telegram groups suggests that investor buzz is peaking at just the right moment. Conclusion: From legal win to breakout bets XRP’s legal clarity could catalyze a 20x surge , but for those looking to enter earlier, faster-growing narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s ongoing presale may offer a sharper edge. With trust confirmed via recent audits and rising demand threatening to close allocations, it’s one of the few altcoin stories keeping pace with XRP’s bullish momentum.

On-chain data analytics firm, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), disclosed this in an X post. According to Sentora , the stablecoin volume for July was over $1.5 trillion, surpassing previous highs, including May 2025, when it was $1.39 trillion, and April, when it was $1.44 trillion. Based on the chart, the new high continues a positive trend in on-chain stablecoin settlement since the start of 2025. While the volume was just $950 billion at the start of the year, it has been over $1.2 trillion in every other month of the year, apart from January and February. Stablecoins monthly on-chain volume (Source: Sentora) Interestingly, August has already recorded almost $200 billion in on-chain volume across the first five days and is now on track to finish above $1.2 trillion by the end of the month. Meanwhile, experts have attributed the surge in on-chain volume for stablecoins to increased DeFi activity. According to Defillama, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours to reach $137.33 billion. This is mostly due to Ethereum performance, with the network performance and ETH resurgence driving renewed interest in DeFi activity. Sentora data also backs this up with the data analytics firm noting that DeFi has reached a three-year high of $179 billion this week, thanks to inflows into liquid staking protocols and ETH ascent towards $4,000. USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin transactions The new milestone reflects stablecoins’ growing adoption and increasing use for on-chain transactions. With the US finally passing the GENIUS Act stablecoin law, the fiat-pegged tokens have seen their role in the financial system cemented. Interestingly, Circle USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin volume throughout 2025, accounting for between 48% to 40% of all DeFi transactions involving stablecoins. In comparison, Tether USDT usually accounts for around 27% – 20% of the total volume each, while MakerDAO DAI also records between 33% and 17% depending on the months. This highlights USDC dominance on-chain, especially in recent years, with USDT and DAI now taking the backseat, although they had commanded more volume at different times. Still, these three stablecoins account for over 90% of the on-chain monthly stablecoin volume, with only Ethena USDe coming close at around 3%. Meanwhile, USDT usage for on-chain transactions is growing again. The stablecoin has seen sizable growth on DeFi protocols this year, with the amount of USDT supplied on Aave increasing by 123% year to date and now close to $7.5 billion. Stablecoin supply inches close to $370 billion While USDC might dominate on-chain transactions, it is USDT that remains the biggest stablecoin by supply. With a market cap of $164.70 billion, the stablecoin, which has seen its supply increase by 3.28% in the past month, now has 61.41% dominance. By comparison, USDC supply is only $63.85 billion. With a similar growth trajectory over the past month, it looks unlikely to match the USDT level in supply at this rate. Meanwhile, Ethena USDe, Sky Dollar USDS, and Dai have $9.517 billion, $4.87 billion, and $4.33 billion. USDe has been one of the best-performing stablecoins in the past month, with 79.47% growth, a performance only bested by Falcon USD (USDf), which has seen a 102% increase in that period, going from $552 million to $1.09 billion. Overall, the stablecoin market cap has reached $268.20 billion after adding $13.2 billion in the past month. At the current market cap, stablecoin supply has already doubled in the past year, and it looks set for more growth, especially as clarity continues to develop. In a sign of regulatory clarity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued guidance allowing some fully backed redeemable USD stablecoins to be classified as cash equivalents. This is expected to provide some clarity in the meantime before the broader regulations arrive. Get seen where it counts.

The meme coin market is no longer a joke – it’s an evolving space where strategic early access often leads to life-changing profits. With new ecosystems rising and retail investor interest soaring, meme coins have transformed into serious contenders in the digital asset class. From secret staking pools to deflationary tokenomics, today’s meme coins are offering more than laughs – they’re delivering utility, hype, and substantial upside potential. Among the best-positioned tokens of 2025 is MoonBull ($MOBU), whose Whitelist is live now. Alongside promising projects like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF), MoonBull is emerging as a clear standout for investors seeking the next 100x opportunity. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) The MoonBull Whitelist is officially open – and it’s already being hailed as one of the most thrilling early access opportunities in the meme coin universe. What sets this apart is its razor-sharp exclusivity. Joining the whitelist gives you a front-row seat to the $MOBU revolution, packed with perks designed to reward early believers. Here’s what whitelist members get access to: Bonus Token Allocations : More $MOBU for the same investment, giving early birds a major edge. Hidden Staking Rewards : Passive income boosters not available to the general public. Early Roadmap Access : Get insider updates before they hit the streets. And here’s the kicker: this is strictly first-come, first-served. The faster you act, the more you stand to gain. All it takes is a simple email submission to lock in your whitelist spot. As launch inches closer, whitelisted users will be the first to receive exclusive notifications about the exact presale date – well before the public even sniffs it. This isn’t theoretical potential. It’s a real-world shot at being part of the next crypto breakout, and it’s unfolding now. Reference Past Whitelist Wins: A Proven Formula for Early Success In early 2024, Layer 2 meme coins like $TOSHI on Base offered early investors exclusive airdrops that were never made available to the general public. Similarly, $WEN – launched via Solana’s memecoin incubator – rewarded whitelist holders with 10x gains in under a month. Whitelisted wallets for $WEN also received free NFTs and pre-market access to its companion dApp. MoonBull ($MOBU) builds on these proven success models with an evolved approach specifically tailored to the meme coin generation of 2025. Its whitelist isn’t just an early bird ticket – it’s a launchpad for maximized gain. Those on the hunt for the best new coin launch in 2025 will find Moon Bull leading the charge with Ethereum-based security, real staking mechanics, and reward systems inspired by the biggest meme coin wins of the last bull cycle. 2. Test ($TST) Test ($TST) is a controlled experiment turned market phenomenon. Originally designed as a limited-release meme project, Test now leads in transparency, dev commitment, and organic virality. With no pre-mines and a locked liquidity strategy, it avoids many common pitfalls associated with rug pulls. It recently introduced a liquidity farming initiative allowing users to earn native rewards simply by holding the coin and participating in the community’s governance decisions. The buzz surrounding Test accelerated after several analysts began tracking its wallet activity and saw consistent accumulation across long-term holders. Smart money seems to be betting heavily on Test’s scalability. Test made it to this list because it defied initial skepticism and evolved into a case study for what successful meme coin experimentation looks like. 3. Coq Inu ($COQ) Coq Inu ($COQ) is more than a humorous reference – it’s a cultural movement backed by real-world engagement. Designed for maximum virality, Coq Inu’s meme architecture is coupled with robust marketing mechanics, including influencer collaborations and viral trend hijacking. Built on Avalanche, it leverages fast finality and low gas fees, enabling frictionless transactions. Its growing NFT partnership wing recently announced a drop themed around early crypto memes, aimed at further increasing its community footprint. What distinguishes Coq Inu is its consistent volume and multi-language support that has fueled international adoption. Coq Inu earns its spot here by combining viral branding with real-world functionality, paving the way as a leading example of meme coin globalization. 4. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Cheems ($CHEEMS) has become synonymous with meme coin nostalgia. Initially a tribute to one of the most beloved doge memes, it has transitioned into a smart-contract-driven meme ecosystem that rewards staking and participation. What elevates Cheems from copycats is its novel burn-and-earn mechanism. Tokens are permanently burned in proportion to user staking milestones, helping reduce total supply while rewarding committed holders. Cheems is also launching a comic-themed P2E game featuring community-voted storyline arcs. This adds a gamified layer to its token utility. Cheems is included in this list for its ability to retain cultural relevance while integrating innovative token mechanics that appeal to long-term holders. 5. Sudeng ($HIPPO) Sudeng ($HIPPO) is a quiet disruptor. Operating on a low-noise, high-delivery framework, HIPPO has seen consistent wallet growth and strategic exchange listings. Unlike many coins that rely solely on hype, HIPPO focuses on value-added features like LP auto-refill mechanisms and AI-generated meme campaigns. It recently launched HIPPO DEX, a decentralized trading platform aimed at meme tokens and microcaps, offering zero-slippage swaps during peak market activity. HIPPO has gained popularity in Southeast Asian and Latin American markets thanks to its community-centric strategy. Sudeng belongs on this list because it’s quietly building an infrastructure that positions it for breakout growth in the next meme cycle. 6. Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) holds a foundational position in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Functioning as the governance token of ShibaSwap, it allows users to vote on platform proposals and yield farming configurations. Recent upgrades to the ShibaSwap interface, coupled with BONE’s integration into upcoming Shibarium Layer 2 updates, are expected to multiply its utility. Its listing on major exchanges further affirms growing institutional interest. BONE has also partnered with decentralized identity projects to create wallets that integrate meme culture and serious DeFi protocols. BONE is featured in this list because it successfully bridges meme popularity with serious governance roles in a top-tier ecosystem. 7. AI Companions ($AIC) AI Companions ($AIC) merges two of the most innovative verticals: AI and crypto. Designed as a meme coin with a mind, AIC allows holders to interact with decentralized AI bots that evolve based on community training data. With a roadmap that includes AI-driven staking pools, voice-enabled wallet interactions, and NFT-based personality upgrades, AIC offers more than just meme value – it delivers tech utility. AIC recently released a teaser of its AI Meme Engine that generates viral memes using blockchain oracle data, a tool already gaining traction across social platforms. AI Companions made this list because it is redefining what meme coins can do in a Web3-AI integrated future. 8. Comedian ($BAN) Comedian ($BAN) brings a laughter-first philosophy with serious crypto fundamentals. Known for its censorship-resistant joke NFTs, BAN has built a fully decentralized meme publishing protocol. Its DAO structure votes on weekly joke contests, rewarding participants in BAN tokens. Its P2E comedy dungeon game is scheduled to launch Q2 2025 and features token-powered performance slots and improv challenges judged by the community. BAN made this list due to its novel integration of decentralized content creation and meme tokenomics, offering a blend of fun and functionality. 9. SLERF ($SLERF) SLERF ($SLERF) might just be the meme coin wildcard of the year. With a stealth launch that attracted 20,000 holders in under 48 hours, SLERF relies on zero marketing and 100 percent organic traction. The dev team claims no central leadership, no VCs, and no paid influencers. Its gamified airdrop mechanism locks rewards behind puzzle challenges, driving community engagement. Upcoming plans include the release of an animated meme film funded entirely by the community treasury. SLERF is included in this list because it proved that meme virality and utility can coexist even in the absence of traditional promotional channels. Conclusion: Secure the Next Big Wave Before It Leaves the Shore Based on the latest research, the new coin launch in 2025 includes MoonBull. Alongside MoonBull ($MOBU), other standout meme coins like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF) are drawing serious attention for their blend of utility and community impact. MoonBull whitelist offers a low-entry path into high-potential projects. With limited whitelist spots and early access incentives, getting in early could be the smartest crypto move of the year. As more countries adopt Bitcoin reserves and regulation adapts to support innovation, these tokens could define a new era of community-driven value creation.

This week we interviewed Eric Dresdale, President and Co-Founder of Entrokey Labs. White Hat (WH): What was the genesis for Entrokey Labs? Eric Dresdale (ED): Entrokey began with a patented innovation from KNWN Technologies, using cosmic radiation to generate quantum-resistant digital identities. After key conversations between myself and my co-founder David Harding, we realized this breakthrough could be a perfect response to the rising threats from AI and quantum computing. We set to work to evolve it from space-based to hardware-based, and ultimately into a software-only solution powered by generative AI trained on natural entropic phenomena. WH: What is Entrokey’s competitive edge? ED: EntroKey is rebuilding the cryptographic foundation for the post-quantum era, fixing entropy at the source to secure the world’s most critical digital systems. In crypto, blockchain, and Web3, we ensure the integrity of key generation and synchronization, enabling resilient wallets, trustless protocols, and quantum-safe infrastructure without hardware dependence. Our lightweight, stateless random number and key generator safeguards everything digital — from individual privacy to global enterprise systems — enabling organizations to scale trust and security without friction. WH: Who would best benefit from Entrokey’s security protocol? ED: Entrokey is a dual-use technology, making it ideal for governments, defense, and national security agencies where cryptographic integrity is mission-critical. In parallel, we are targeting regulated industries such as cloud providers, financial services including crypto and stablecoins, healthcare, and aviation where trust, compliance, and AI and post-quantum resilience are essential. WH: Crypto trading platform WOO X was hacked recently, how could have Entrokey prevented this? ED: Phishing happens. But with Entrokey, access alone is not enough. Our keys are bound to high-quality entropy and the environment they were created in. So even if an attacker gets in, they cannot use or move anything. No static keys to steal, no way to spoof the system. That is how we contain damage before it starts WH: What advice do you have for everyday crypto users to protect themselves? ED: Use an MPC or hardware wallet — These eliminate single points of failure. No seed phrase, no static key to steal. Watch for phishing — Most hacks start with a fake link. Never connect your wallet unless you're 100 percent sure. Keep your funds off exchanges — Centralized platforms are honeypots. If you're not trading, withdraw and hold on a cold wallet.

One of the most popular tools for gauging this mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital indicator recently shifted, moving from “Greed” to a “Neutral” reading of 54 as of August 6. This change reflects a cooling of intense optimism and suggests a more balanced, yet cautious, crypto market sentiment among participants. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies whether investors are feeling overly greedy (potentially leading to a market correction) or excessively fearful (which might signal a buying opportunity). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, often selling assets in panic. 25-49: Fear – General apprehension and uncertainty prevail. 50-54: Neutral – The current zone, indicating a balanced outlook without strong emotional biases. 55-74: Greed – Enthusiasm is growing, and prices might be rising. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often a sign of market tops. Understanding this scale helps you interpret the current investor sentiment and consider how it might influence market movements. How Does the Index Measure Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture of the market’s mood. These factors collectively capture various aspects of market volatility and activity, giving us a holistic view. Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Assesses current market volume and momentum. Strong buying volume usually points to greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various social media platforms, looking at crypto-related discussions. Surveys (15%): Historically involved polls about market outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors move from altcoins to Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like “Bitcoin price manipulation.” Each of these elements contributes to the final score, offering a nuanced perspective on prevailing crypto market sentiment . What Does “Neutral” Sentiment Really Mean for Investors? The recent shift to a “Neutral” reading of 54 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of equilibrium. It means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed dominates the market. For investors, this balanced state can imply several things: Uncertainty: A neutral reading often reflects a wait-and-see approach, where investors are not rushing into major decisions. Consolidation: Prices might move sideways, consolidating recent gains or losses as the market digests new information. Opportunity for Analysis: This phase provides an excellent opportunity to conduct thorough research rather than acting on impulse. It’s a time to evaluate fundamentals and technical indicators without the noise of extreme emotions. While some might view “Neutral” as uneventful, it is a crucial period for strategic planning. It suggests the market is taking a breath, potentially preparing for its next significant move, influenced by upcoming news or broader economic factors. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively? It serves as a valuable sentiment tool, but it’s important not to rely on it in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Historically, extreme fear has often presented buying opportunities, while extreme greed has preceded market corrections. A neutral phase prompts careful consideration. Combine with Other Indicators: Always pair the index with technical analysis (e.g., support/resistance levels, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (e.g., project developments, adoption rates). Risk Management: A neutral reading doesn’t eliminate risk. Maintain a diversified portfolio and stick to your risk management strategy, especially given ongoing market volatility . Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates, as these can quickly shift investor sentiment from neutral to either extreme. The index is a powerful indicator of human emotion in the market. Use it to understand the crowd’s psychology, but always make decisions based on your own research and financial goals. The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 54, settling into the “Neutral” zone, signifies a momentary pause in the intense emotional swings of the crypto market. This balanced state provides a valuable opportunity for investors to assess their positions without the pressure of extreme panic or euphoria. While not a definitive trading signal, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment empowers you to make more rational, data-driven decisions. Always remember that successful investing combines sentiment analysis with thorough research and a disciplined approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. 2. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. 3. What does a “Neutral” reading on the index mean? A “Neutral” reading, like the current 54, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market. It suggests a period of balance, uncertainty, or consolidation. 4. Should I make investment decisions based solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the index is a sentiment tool and should not be used in isolation. Always combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and your own risk management strategy for informed decisions. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The original content states that the survey component is currently paused, though the specific reason for the pause is not detailed within the index’s public information.

The guidance declares that liquid staking activities do not constitute securities transactions. This means participants would not be required to register such activities with the SEC. This move could ease regulatory pressure on blockchain networks and DeFi platforms offering these services. However, Crenshaw believes this interpretation is dangerously misleading. Crenshaw said the Liquid Staking Statement builds one assumption on top of another, creating what she described as a shaky wall of facts disconnected from the realities of the industry. She added that the guidance provides little clarity, lacks a legal foundation, and merely reflects the SEC staff’s views—not the Commission’s official position. Crenshaw criticized the guidance for drawing “definitive declarations about how liquid staking works” without providing evidence or addressing the diversity of staking mechanisms across blockchain ecosystems. She warned that the guidance fails to offer meaningful direction for companies trying to stay compliant. SEC’s liquid staking guidance sparks division Earlier in the day, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a legal interpretation stating that liquid staking—a system that allows users to earn staking rewards while still being able to trade or move their staked tokens—is not a securities offering. This clarification means platforms offering liquid staking services may not have to register with the SEC under current securities laws, potentially opening the door for broader innovation and user adoption. The stance represents a continuation of the pro-innovation regulatory steps rolled out under the Trump-era Project Crypto, which promoted hands-off regulatory approaches in certain aspects of the crypto economy. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also made a statement after the release from the agency, claiming that liquid staking is similar to a popular practice of leaving goods with an agent who gives receipts in return . Peirce wrote that the Division’s statement makes it clear that, in its view, liquid staking activities tied to protocol staking do not constitute the offer and sale of securities. But Crenshaw was quick to distance the full Commission from this interpretation. Crenshaw stated that the guidance holds no binding authority and does not represent the consensus of the Commission, either presently or in the future. She argued that the legal conclusions within the document rest entirely on narrow, hypothetical assumptions. If a liquid staking product differs significantly from the outlined assumptions, the exemption likely wouldn’t apply. Commissioner urges caution among liquid stakers Crenshaw’s warning was stark: don’t rely on this guidance as a free pass. She noted that any entity whose liquid staking program differs in any way from the long list of assumptions in the Liquid Staking Statement should take caution, emphasizing “caveat liquid staker”—a Latin phrase meaning “let the liquid staker beware.” She emphasized that entities operating in the liquid staking space are still at risk of enforcement, especially as the SEC continues its broader crackdown on crypto-related securities violations. Crenshaw has long voiced concerns that certain crypto products and platforms are sidestepping investor protections. Her comments mirror a broader fissure at the Commission on how to approach fast-changing digital money systems. Some staffers and commissioners argue that the existing regime only needs to be tinkered with to suit itself to crypto; Crenshaw is advocating a stricter, more data-informed approach. She argued that the rule cannot create regulatory certainty on unsupported assumptions. Some in the crypto world voiced a sense of hopefulness, however guarded. Perhaps most encouraging from a regulatory perspective, those in liquid staking saw enough in this statement to help them innovate without immediately worrying about regulatory hammer fallout. Still, Crenshaw’s dissent raised red flags with legal experts, who said the dissent, read literally, means any departure from those assumptions in staff guidance could lead to an enforcement action.

A prominent investor, known as @qwatio, faces the imminent threat of a substantial Bitcoin liquidation . This isn’t just any trade; it’s a staggering $115 million BTC short position , putting immense pressure on the market and the trader. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s High-Stakes Bet What exactly is happening? According to observations shared by @EmberCN on X, this particular Hyperliquid whale has placed a colossal bet against Bitcoin’s price. Their short position, valued at an eye-watering $115 million, is dangerously close to its liquidation point. The critical price level where this massive position could be forcibly closed is $114,491. For those new to the space, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market movements. A “short position” is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. If the price rises instead, the trader incurs losses, and if it hits the liquidation price, their position is automatically closed to prevent further losses, often leading to significant capital loss for the trader. The Perilous Dance of a $115M BTC Short Position The situation became even more dramatic earlier today. To avoid the dreaded Bitcoin liquidation of their massive BTC short position , the investor made a desperate move. They reportedly closed an Ethereum (ETH) short position at a loss. This action was a strategic, albeit costly, attempt to increase the margin for their Bitcoin bet, giving it more breathing room against the rising price. This maneuver highlights the extreme crypto trading risk inherent in highly leveraged positions. Traders often use leverage to amplify potential returns, but it also magnifies potential losses, making liquidation a constant threat if the market moves against their bet. The sheer scale of this particular position makes its potential liquidation a point of intense focus for market observers. What Does Imminent Bitcoin Liquidation Mean for the Market? When a large position like this faces Bitcoin liquidation , it can have ripple effects. The automated selling that occurs during liquidation can add selling pressure to the market, potentially causing further price drops, especially in illiquid conditions. While the overall market might absorb a $115 million liquidation, it still represents a significant event that traders and analysts closely monitor. The ability to track such events is largely due to the transparency offered by on-chain data . Analysts like @EmberCN can observe large movements and positions on decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, providing crucial insights into market sentiment and potential volatility. This transparency, while beneficial for market analysis, also puts a spotlight on individual traders’ high-stakes endeavors. Lessons from High-Leverage Crypto Trading Risk This unfolding scenario offers valuable lessons for all participants in the crypto market, especially those considering leveraged trading. The immense pressure on the Hyperliquid whale underscores the critical importance of risk management. Even experienced traders can find themselves in precarious positions if they misjudge market movements or overextend their leverage. Understand Liquidation Levels: Always know the exact price at which your position will be liquidated. Manage Your Margin: Proactively add margin or reduce position size before it becomes a desperate last-minute scramble. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged bet. Monitor On-Chain Data: While not a crystal ball, it provides valuable insights into large market movements and potential risks. The Power of On-Chain Data in Crypto Monitoring The role of on-chain data cannot be overstated in today’s transparent blockchain ecosystem. It allows for a level of market insight previously unavailable in traditional finance. By analyzing public ledger information, researchers and traders can identify significant positions, track whale movements, and anticipate potential market volatility. This real-time data empowers market participants to make more informed decisions, mitigating some of the inherent crypto trading risk . The dramatic plight of the Hyperliquid whale and their $115 million BTC short position serves as a potent reminder of the volatile and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. While the outcome remains uncertain, the situation vividly illustrates the power of market forces and the ever-present threat of Bitcoin liquidation for those who venture into leveraged positions without robust risk management. It’s a testament to the fact that even the largest players can find themselves on the brink. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a short position in cryptocurrency trading? A short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like Bitcoin) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later and return it, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the trader incurs losses. 2. What does it mean for a crypto position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a required maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial margin. 3. Who are @qwatio and @EmberCN? @qwatio is the pseudonymous trader holding the large Bitcoin short position on Hyperliquid. @EmberCN is an on-chain data analyst who brought attention to this specific high-risk trade, highlighting significant market activity. 4. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. It operates on a blockchain, offering high performance and transparency for its users. 5. How can crypto traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, setting stop-loss orders, and actively monitoring their positions to add margin or reduce exposure if the market moves against them.

According to analysts, the approval may follow the milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, investors are actively looking for other coins that may deliver massive returns before XRP gets to traditional finance. Five crypto presales already stand out due to their unique roadmaps and presale features. Investors are already accumulating the coins at a fast speed in the presale, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the forefront. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Leading with 33x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved to become the leading crypto presale before the anticipated approval of the XRP ETF. Its path is compared to the early years of Ripple in terms of ecosystem and community. Based on the Binance Smart Chain, MAGACOIN will offer staking benefits, meme potential, and a governance solution that attracts DeFi users and retail traders. The aggressive roadmap and the viral traction being made on social channels is what helps make MAGACOIN stand out. According to experts, the token has the potential for a 33x rise before the XRP ETFsurges, particularly as political meme tokens once again start to trend. The presale is currently active, and it is one of the remaining few ground-floor opportunities before the broader market catalysts step in. 2. Ozak AI – AI Meets Decentralized Analytics Ozak AI is blending artificial intelligence with decentralized analytics to revolutionize how businesses use data. The platform operates without intermediaries and offers real-time insights for sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. Its machine learning capabilities combined with blockchain security create a flexible and scalable ecosystem. Ozak AI is currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.005 per token. Over 40 million tokens have already been sold out of 200 million. 3. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – Meme Power with Real Momentum Little Pepe is one of the fastest-growing meme coins to pay attention to in 2025. The Ethereum-based project sold out Stage 8 of its presale two months earlier, raising $13.775 million. Its low token price and clear roadmap are attracting investors to rush in. Stage 9 will raise the price to $0.0018, and the present phase is a crucial entry point for investors. 4. BlockDAG – The Biggest Presale in Seven Years BlockDAG is rewriting the rules with over $361 million raised and 2.5 million users mining via its X1 app. The project is entering its final phase with only days left before its global launch on August 11. The confirmed listing price is 30 times higher than the current rate. Investors are swarming in for features like a 10 BTC auction pool and a no-vesting token release. 5. Maxi Doge – High-Yield Meme Coin Action Maxi Doge has already raised more than $315,000 in several days. The memecoin is gaining traction because of the staking rewards of more than 1,400% APY and viral branding. It provides a Web3-facilitated buying procedure and does not make any exclusive allocations but keeps all things clear and community-based. A new price increase is looming. After the presale, early investors will be able to stake or hold their tokens. Conclusion The launch of the XRP ETF has kindled new enthusiasm in the crypto industry. Retail investors are also in search of high-potential investments as institutions appear in the market. MAGACOIN is one of the most prominent presale tokens with an ambitious story. As these five coins become more popular, the opportunity to buy early could resemble the trajectory of XRP.

Investors are increasingly optimistic ahead of the SEC’s expected status report on August 15, which may finally end Ripple’s multi-year lawsuit. This outcome could unlock a flood of institutional adoption and pave the way for XRP spot ETF approvals. With whale wallets scooping up over $60 million in the token recently, market sentiment is turning decisively bullish. Whale Activity and ETF Buzz Signal Institutional Confidence XRP isn’t rallying alone as Institutional capital has flowed heavily into Ethereum and XRP over the past few weeks, according to CoinShares. XRP-related investment products saw $31.26 million in inflows, while whale trackers confirmed large transactions, including a single 20 million transfer from Upbit worth over $60 million. Additionally, anticipation is mounting over potential XRP ETF approvals. The SEC has set an October 17 deadline to rule on several XRP spot ETFs, and a recent policy shift enabling in-kind redemptions has eliminated key logistical barriers. If approved, these ETFs could dramatically reduce the token’s circulating supply and fuel further price appreciation. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

Its recent integration of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain opens the door for DeFi developers to launch dApps on the XRP Ledger using XRP for fees. Moreover, the XRPL now hosts one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury bill products, signaling its growing role in asset tokenization. Related Reading: Crash Incoming?

The cryptocurrency world constantly shifts, and understanding its dynamics is key to navigating its opportunities. Currently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 42. This figure, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), signals a clear shift: we are in a Bitcoin Season . What does this mean for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Let’s dive in. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market . As reported by CoinMarketCap, the index recently registered 42, a slight dip from the previous day. This specific number is crucial because it indicates that Bitcoin is currently outperforming the majority of altcoins. Index Range: The index scores from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, this phase begins when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 42 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season , highlighting a period where the leading cryptocurrency dominates market gains. Why Are We Seeing a Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors contribute to the current Bitcoin Season , influencing altcoin performance . Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, especially during periods of uncertainty or when institutional interest grows. Investors might gravitate towards Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” asset within the volatile crypto space. Key drivers often include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic shifts can push investors towards less speculative assets, and within crypto, Bitcoin often fills this role. Halving Narratives: Anticipation around Bitcoin’s halving events can drive significant pre-halving rallies, drawing capital away from altcoins. Spot ETF Approvals: Recent developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, have channeled substantial institutional capital directly into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and dominance. This increased focus on Bitcoin naturally impacts the Altcoin Season Index , pushing it lower as altcoins struggle to keep pace. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed investment decisions. During a Bitcoin Season , it is common for altcoins to either consolidate or see declines against Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but their gains may be less pronounced or even negative compared to Bitcoin’s. Consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Portfolio: Assess your exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. You might consider rebalancing if your portfolio is heavily skewed towards underperforming altcoins. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, projects with robust technology, strong communities, and clear use cases may still perform well in the long term. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those bullish on specific altcoins, DCA can be an effective strategy to accumulate assets at potentially lower prices. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a valuable tool to gauge shifts in market sentiment and identify potential turning points. When Might Altcoin Performance Rebound? The question on many investors’ minds is: when will the pendulum swing back, and when can we expect a strong Altcoin Season ? Historically, after periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This typically happens once Bitcoin’s rally cools down or consolidates at new highs. Watch for these signs: Bitcoin Price Stability: A period of consolidation for Bitcoin after a significant rally can free up capital for altcoin speculation. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Track Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A clear downtrend here often precedes an altcoin surge. Increased Volume in Altcoins: A significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins can signal renewed interest. The Altcoin Season Index will be your go-to metric, showing a sustained move above 75 as altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 42 clearly indicates we are in a Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to the broader altcoin market. While challenging for some altcoin holders, it presents opportunities for strategic rebalancing and focusing on long-term potential. Staying informed about crypto market trends and understanding the dynamics of altcoin performance are crucial for navigating these cycles effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, often tracked by CoinMarketCap, that measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin are performing better over a 90-day period. It indicates whether the market is in an “Altcoin Season” or a “Bitcoin Season.” Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season is determined when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index typically falls below 75 during this period. Q3: Should I sell all my altcoins during a Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While altcoins may underperform Bitcoin during a Bitcoin Season, selling all holdings might lead to missing out on future rallies. It’s often recommended to re-evaluate your portfolio, consider dollar-cost averaging, and focus on projects with strong fundamentals for long-term potential. Q4: What are the key indicators that an Altcoin Season might be approaching? Key indicators include Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, a declining Bitcoin dominance chart, and a significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index moving above 75 would confirm its arrival. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index include all cryptocurrencies? No, the Altcoin Season Index typically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to focus purely on the performance of native altcoins against Bitcoin within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Top-tier users enjoy perks like account managers and custom deals, but Stake’s withdrawal process can slow down, especially with large amounts. Also, the climb through levels may not appeal to users who prefer instant perks right from the start. For those who value structure and don’t mind the wait, Stake is still a strong choice, even if it lacks Spartans’ fluid experience. Roobet: Community-Centered with Personalized Bonuses Roobet earns a place among the best crypto gambling platforms by focusing on community and frequent player perks. It’s a favorite for regular users thanks to cashback, birthday rewards, and offers tailored to personal activity. VIP members also get exclusive gifts and merchandise. That said, Roobet’s payout system still involves reviews for larger sums, making it less suitable for those who want instant crypto access. Its VIP setup adds value but focuses more on engagement and experience rather than offering the raw advantages that big-stakes players seek. BetMGM: Familiar Comforts, Less Crypto Focus BetMGM appeals to those who prefer the feel of a traditional casino. Its VIP club features hotel perks, events access, and personal support for high-tier members. This appeals to users who enjoy combining real-world luxury with online betting. But when measured against the best crypto gambling platforms, BetMGM falls short on crypto compatibility. Its focus is still tied to fiat systems, with limited support for fast crypto withdrawals. That makes it less efficient for users who want frictionless rewards and quick access to their winnings. 1xBet: Massive Markets With Tiered VIP System 1xBet offers an extensive range of betting options, from global sports to niche markets, and pairs this with a multi-level VIP club. Users get cashback and rewards based on points. It’s a good fit for those who like variety and structured bonuses. Still, it doesn’t fully stand with top-tier crypto-native platforms. While crypto options exist, payouts may be slower, and bonuses often come with tight playthrough terms. It serves global high-volume players well, but lacks the speed and direct perks that define the best crypto gambling platforms. Final Thoughts The best crypto gambling platforms in 2025 go beyond loyalty tiers. Serious players want fast service, flexible benefits, and bonuses that reflect their activity. Spartans leads with its crypto-first model, instant payouts, and real-time perks. While Stake.com and Roobet bring organized loyalty systems, and BetMGM and 1xBet offer traditional VIP comfort, Spartans provides a full-service experience shaped around the needs of modern high-stakes users. Those who expect top treatment and quick access to their rewards will find Spartans to be the standout name among the best crypto gambling platforms .

49610545,548510,1754442023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49610545.jpeg,Coinbase Plans $2 Billion Private Convertible Note Offering Following Q2 Results,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-plans-2b-private-convertible-offering/,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private convertible note offering following a weaker-than-expected second-quarter performance. The move comes as COIN shares recorded a 15% decline on August 4, reflecting market reactions to the company’s reported drop in revenue and increased operational costs. Details of the Convertible Note Offering According to the announcement, the proposed fundraising will be conducted through a private placement targeting qualified institutional buyers. The offering will consist of two tranches of senior unsecured notes, each worth $1 billion, set to mature in 2029 and 2032 respectively. Coinbase stated that the proceeds would be allocated toward capped call transactions to limit dilution risks, with the remaining funds earmarked for general corporate purposes , including working capital, acquisitions, and potential debt repurchases. The $2 billion offering is structured as two separate note issues, one due October 1, 2029, and the other due October 1, 2032. Both instruments are convertible into cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of the two, at Coinbase’s discretion. The company also provided an option for initial buyers to purchase up to an additional $300 million in notes across both series, depending on investor demand at the time of pricing. Convertible notes are often used by companies seeking to access liquidity while managing potential shareholder dilution. Coinbase plans to enter into capped call transactions on each tranche, which can offset future conversion costs if its stock trades above a predetermined level. These hedging activities may involve trading Coinbase’s shares or related derivatives during and after the pricing period. The final interest rates and conversion terms will be determined upon completion of the offering. At the time of writing, COIN shares is down over 3%, dropping to $307 levels. Market Context and Investor Reactions Coinbase’s fundraising initiative follows a broader trend among cryptocurrency firms turning to convertible debt as a financing tool amid volatile market conditions. Other companies in the sector, including Marathon Digital (MARA), have recently issued similar instruments to promote balance sheet flexibility. Analyst sentiment on Coinbase remains mixed following its Q2 earnings release. While research firm Benchmark maintained a “Buy” rating, citing long-term growth opportunities, other analysts, including Mizuho, highlighted pressure on revenue streams such as USDC-related interest income from issuer partner Circle. Mizuho’s note suggested that shrinking margins from Circle’s reserves could affect Coinbase’s subscription and services revenue mix in upcoming quarters. The planned $2 billion raise is seen as part of Coinbase’s strategy to secure capital ahead of potential market shifts while maintaining options for managing existing debt obligations, such as the company’s outstanding 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2031 convertible and senior notes.

The Ethena chart setup is flashing a pattern that could lead to a move toward $1.33, a repeat of a rally traders still remember. Toncoin is feeling the pressure, dropping 3.63 % and moving closer to its $2.93 support level. Both are holding at important price zones, waiting for the next push. The wider market may be uncertain, but one project is moving in the opposite direction. Cold Wallet ($CWT) presale has already pulled in over $5.7M and sold more than 643.72 million coins in just 16 stages. The buys are not random, they are large, focused, and coming in before the next stage price increase. While others hold back, Cold Wallet (CWT) is being actively picked up by whales, pushing it into the spotlight among the best cryptos right now. Ethena Chart Hints At 89% Move Momentum builds in Ethena via a familiar pattern. Technicals echo a past breakout event. In 2024 ENA formed a falling wedge and double‑bottom structure. That led to an 89 % rally. Today’s dip mirrors that cycle. Current price action shows retest of the 200‑day moving average. Resistance lies near $0.70. A clean breakout above this level may push price toward $1.33. If it matches last year’s playbook, the move could be repeatable. Current chart setup remains bullish provided the neckline clears. Toncoin lurks Near $2.93 Support Toncoin sentiment is turning cautious. A 3.63 % daily drop pushed price down to $3.26. At the same time, trading volume jumped by almost 50 %, signaling rising sell‑side pressure. RSI trends toward oversold territory. The critical support at $2.93 is under test. If that level breaks, the price could fall toward $2.50. Some expect a rebound back to $3.43. Macro concerns weigh on market mood. Regulatory uncertainty linked to Telegram integration adds to the unease. Despite over 1,000 dApps supported and strong network speed, the sentiment remains divided. Dilution risk and competitive pressure further cloud the outlook. Bulls remain hopeful of rebound but overall market tone stays cautious. Cold Wallet Presale Attracts Whales With $5.7M Funding Cold Wallet presale has already raised over $5.7M at the current price of $0.00924 in Stage 16. More than 643.72 million coins are sold out of a 150‑stage schedule. Strong whale interest is driving early stage buys in a structured pattern. At the $0.00924 presale stage, large wallets are stacking coins before price moves upward. These purchases are deliberate and high‑value rather than spread‑out small buys. Such activity confirms serious confidence in Cold Wallet as one of the best crypto assets right now. Whale transactions have increased chatter across crypto channels. Big wallets entering at this stage signal rising trust. Over 643.72 million coins are already taken and more than $5.7M is raised. Only 134 stages remain before presale ends. Early holders paying $0.00924 could see a return near 3700 % if the token lists at $0.3517. That potential ROI makes every large wallet move significant. This profit projection stands at about 3,700 % from the entry price of $0.00924 to the launch price of $0.3517. Utility underlies the demand. Cold Wallet presale grants access to platform perks, early feature entry, and higher staking rewards. Participants at this stage secure more than just a coin, they gain privileged access running alongside the system. Whale behaviour reflects early strategic positioning, not speculation only. Wallets are backing Cold Wallet while price remains favorable. This presale shows that Cold Wallet is a platform with rising demand. With $5.7M raised, 643.72M coins sold, and strong whale uptake, it stands out amid broader market uncertainty. The momentum built by early stage participation paints a clear picture: Cold Wallet could deliver hefty gains for those joining now. Conclusion Looking at recent market moves, the gap between these updates is clear. Ethena’s chart hints at another possible rally, repeating a setup that previously took price near $1.33. Toncoin’s path looks tougher, with selling pressure building and sentiment split as it tests its $2.93 support. Cold Wallet tells a very different story. With over $5.7M raised, more than 643.72 million coins sold, and a projected 3,700 % ROI for those buying now at $0.00924, whale activity is building fast during the early stages. This surge in high‑value buys suggests Cold Wallet has become the preferred choice in the current market. Waiting too long could mean missing the most favorable entry point before the next price shift.

49610649,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=173604,1754442041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49610649.jpeg,Whale Shorts XRP & SOL Before Crash—DOGE Profits Revealed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whale-shorts-xrp-sol-before-crash-doge-profits-revealed/,"XRP and Solana just experienced a sharp shake-up, triggered by a wave of high-leverage short positions from crypto whales. With tens of millions poured into bearish bets, both tokens were pushed into volatile territory, leaving traders scrambling. But while the pressure mounted across much of the altcoin landscape, Dogecoin quietly posted another win—defying gravity with solid support and new gains. And beneath the surface of this volatility, another altcoin has started generating real buzz: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early investors are paying close attention to its momentum, as it rides market chaos with surprising resilience. XRP Faces Aggressive Whale Shorts XRP became the target of large short positions in early August, with at least one major whale placing a $3.33 million bet against it using 20x leverage around the $2.93 level. Cumulatively, shorts across XRP and Solana topped $17 million—applying strong sell-side pressure that briefly knocked XRP below $3. Despite the dip, not all shorts ended profitably. XRP quickly rebounded, triggering liquidations for over-leveraged traders. Still, sentiment remains conflicted. Some analysts forecast further declines toward $2.76, while others point to whale accumulation as a sign of long-term confidence. As Ripple pushes ahead with its Trust Bank initiative, XRP walks a fine line between bullish structural changes and looming short-term resistance. Solana Slips Amid Heavy Dumps Solana didn’t fare much better. One whale reportedly sold $17 million in SOL, aligning with a sharp 12% price decline over the past week. Technical charts now reflect a “rounding top” pattern—commonly seen before extended downtrends. If SOL fails to maintain its current support, analysts suggest a possible slide toward $120. Still, other large players continue to buy the dip, with some institutional wallets slowly building positions. This split sentiment underscores the broader theme: whales are using volatility to play both sides, long and short. Dogecoin Proves Surprisingly Resilient While other altcoins wobbled, Dogecoin showed strength. DOGE briefly climbed past $0.20 before consolidating just below it around $0.198. Strong volume spikes accompanied breakout attempts through $0.194 and $0.198—signals that traders haven’t lost interest. For August 2025, DOGE’s forecast range sits between $0.192 and $0.259, with upside potential toward $0.30 if momentum holds. Meme coin sentiment remains one of crypto’s most unpredictable forces—and Dogecoin appears to still be riding the wave. New Money Eyes Emerging Altcoin Contender As Whales are Shorting XRP and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture 24,800% ROI Before the Market Rebounds. That’s the claim making the rounds among crypto analysts tracking capital rotation into early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has recently seen a surge in whale-led inflows, even as larger-cap altcoins face heavy downside. This mirrors the kind of early activity seen in SHIBA and DOGE before their meteoric rises.With a capped token supply, a strong community, and a developer-backed roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a credible contender for the next big altcoin breakout. Investors who missed DOGE’s rise are watching closely – and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Volatility Rewards the Prepared Whether it’s XRP’s short-fueled swings, Solana’s uncertain footing, or Dogecoin’s steady grind upward, one thing is clear—whales are moving the market. For traders and investors watching from the sidelines, this volatility isn’t just noise—it’s opportunity. And with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining ground with every cycle shift, early positioning could unlock outsized rewards before the next bull leg begins.

Cardano is holding its bullish setup, managing to stay above key supports despite recent pressure. Ethereum is seeing a spike in open interest, signaling more leveraged trading and speculation around its next move. Both have signs worth tracking, but neither offers hands-on interaction before a launch. BlockDAG (BDAG) is different. It opens up a live trading environment now, giving buyers full access to BUY and SELL features, live BDAG/USD pricing, and instant wallet updates. This makes BlockDAG a standout choice for anyone weighing what crypto to invest in, as it delivers an active experience long before exchange listings. Cardano Bullish Setup Holds Firm Above Support Cardano continues to show strength despite a recent pullback, keeping its position inside a broader upward channel. Its price is holding above the 50-day EMA, a zone that has repeatedly attracted buyers. Sellers briefly pushed the price lower, but steady accumulation around the mid-range kept it from sliding further. Momentum indicators like RSI show that ADA is cooling off but not losing strength, leaving space for a possible rebound. The MACD also remains above its signal line, although the gap is narrowing, hinting that momentum could build again soon. Trading volumes show no major selling spikes, suggesting that this is a pause rather than a reversal. If ADA maintains its current range and reclaims near-term resistance, another upward push could follow. Ethereum Market View Shows High Activity and Rising Leverage Ethereum’s futures market is experiencing record open interest, now above $50 billion. This surge signals a strong rise in speculative and institutional activity. Over the past month, open interest has climbed 64%, showing that traders are heavily engaging in leveraged positions and expecting price movement soon. ETH has reclaimed a key zone between $3,150 and $3,300, turning it into both support and resistance for the current structure. This buildup in derivatives shows confidence, but it also raises risk, as high leverage often leads to sharp moves when sentiment flips. Historically, ETH performs well under these conditions, making this a period to watch closely for breakout potential. From Presale to Live Exchange Simulation: BlockDAG Changes the Game Most presales follow the same script: raise money, promise tools, and keep people waiting. BlockDAG breaks that pattern with its live, interactive trading dashboard. Through its latest version, users can experience a true simulation of exchange trading before the project even goes public. Inside this dashboard, buyers see real-time BDAG/USD price charts, a functioning order book, and instant wallet balance updates after every simulated trade. It’s not just a demo; it feels close to real market action. This changes how early participants view presales, turning a once passive process into active involvement. BlockDAG has already proven strong market traction, raising $362.5 million and selling over 24.7 billion coins. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, marking a 2,660% ROI from the very first batch. But the most exciting part is the special GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer: until August 11, BDAG can be purchased for just $0.0016, a massive discount that could see up to 3,025% returns once it lists at $0.05. This is not just about a low price; it’s a chance to engage with a working product ahead of time, while securing an early position before wider public access pushes prices higher. For anyone deciding what crypto to invest in, BlockDAG stands out by delivering both real utility now and one of the strongest potential ROIs in the market. In a Nutshell Cardano’s solid chart structure and Ethereum’s high market activity offer good reasons to watch both assets. But they still rely only on market speculation. BlockDAG delivers something far more tangible. With a live dashboard that includes real-time price feeds, working BUY and SELL options, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG is already functioning like a full-fledged exchange before its official launch. For those looking at what crypto to invest in right now, BlockDAG offers rare early-stage access, strong numbers, and one of the biggest potential ROIs in the market.

Recently, the Base network outage caused a temporary halt, sparking discussions across the crypto community. This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the intricate technicalities that underpin our decentralized future. What Caused the Coinbase Base Network Outage? On a recent Tuesday, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, experienced an unexpected 33-minute halt in its block production. This disruption wasn’t due to a malicious attack but rather a critical internal system failure. The active sequencer, a vital component responsible for ordering transactions, began to lag. An automated internal system, designed to maintain stability, promptly initiated a switch to a backup sequencer. However, this crucial transition failed. The primary reason for this failure was an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup system. Consequently, the network found itself unable to process new transactions or produce new blocks, leading to the brief but significant outage. This incident highlighted the delicate balance required for continuous operation within a complex Layer-2 blockchain environment. Understanding Layer-2 Blockchain Challenges and Network Stability What exactly is a Layer-2 network like Coinbase Base network , and why are sequencers so important? A Layer-2 blockchain is built on top of a main blockchain (like Ethereum) to increase its transaction throughput and reduce costs. It processes transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. Sequencers play a pivotal role in these networks. They are responsible for: Ordering Transactions: Ensuring transactions are processed in the correct sequence. Batching: Grouping multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch for efficient settlement on the main chain. Submitting Data: Posting the batched transaction data back to the Layer-1 blockchain. When a sequencer fails, as happened with Base, the entire process grinds to a halt. This directly impacts network stability and user experience, demonstrating the need for robust redundancy and flawless backup systems. Even a short outage can undermine trust and disrupt ongoing operations for users and decentralized applications alike. Lessons from the Base Network Outage: Ensuring Resilience The recent Base network outage provides valuable lessons for the broader blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the absolute necessity of rigorous testing and meticulous setup for all critical infrastructure components, especially backup systems. Relying on automated failovers is good, but only if those failovers are perfectly configured and ready to take over without a hitch. For users, such incidents emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying technology of the networks they use. While brief, this halt meant transactions could not be processed, potentially delaying operations for businesses and individuals on the network. For developers and network operators, the takeaway is clear: Comprehensive Testing: Continuously test backup systems under various conditions. Complete Configurations: Ensure backup sequencers and other critical components have identical and complete sequencer configuration to the active ones. Redundancy Beyond Basics: Explore multi-sequencer setups or decentralized sequencer models to minimize single points of failure and enhance overall network stability . This incident, though quickly resolved, serves as a powerful reminder that even leading platforms must remain vigilant in their pursuit of uninterrupted service. What Does This Mean for the Future of Base? While the 33-minute halt was inconvenient, it’s important to view it in context. The quick identification and resolution of the issue by the Base team demonstrate their operational capabilities. Incidents like these, while challenging, often lead to stronger, more resilient systems as lessons are learned and improvements are implemented. The commitment to enhancing network stability remains paramount for the continued growth and adoption of the Coinbase Base network . This event will undoubtedly prompt a thorough review of their backup protocols and configuration management, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable Layer-2 solution. The goal for all decentralized networks is to achieve near-perfect uptime, and every incident, big or small, contributes to refining that pursuit. The Base network outage , though brief, highlighted a critical vulnerability in its backup systems. A simple configuration error on a backup sequencer brought the entire network to a standstill for 33 minutes. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of meticulous planning, thorough testing, and robust redundancy in the complex world of Layer-2 blockchains. As the ecosystem matures, ensuring unwavering network stability will be key to fostering wider adoption and trust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer-2 blockchain developed by Coinbase, built on top of Ethereum to provide faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions. Q2: What caused the recent Base network outage? A2: The outage was caused by an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup sequencer. When the active sequencer lagged, the automated switch to the backup failed, halting block production.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The maturing digital assets market that has sophisticated market making, capital markets, and decentralized finance, is still lacking one key market infrastructure to compete with traditional finance: an institutional-grade credit agency. Architect aims to change this by launching crypto's first institutional-grade credit ratings service, similar to traditional finance's Moody's – because most TradFi ratings agencies just won't touch crypto. Sure, Moody's has dipped its toes into digital assets , but a full-blown credit agency that operates only in crypto is still missing. This is partly because crypto does not have a trusted intermediary to objectively assess creditworthiness, according to Ruben Amenyogbo, Architect's Managing Partner. The industry's anonymous actors, unconventional data, and opaque risk profiles make traditional underwriters nervous, leaving potential lenders reluctant to provide debt financing, Amenyogbo said. Then there is the ongoing surge of publicly traded companies, including miners and crypto treasury firms. They are all attempting to provide equity investors with exposure to crypto via stocks. But that market is now saturated and overvalued. “Crypto equity is extremely overvalued. Way too much money has been raised chasing equity opportunities in crypto,” said Amenyogbo. This combination of a lack of credit agencies and an exhausted equity market creates the perfect storm for a new opportunity in Web3. “There's a huge opportunity in credit, but no one's provided the missing market structure needed to assess risk properly,"" he said. This is where Architect comes in with plans to utilize its proprietary blockchain-based data to systematically evaluate credit risk and unlock new pools of institutional capital. Amenyogbo believes that the crypto market has now matured enough to support institutional-grade credit analysis. “With equity, you look forward, you assess future growth,” Amenyogbo said. “With credit, you must look backwards and ask, ‘Have these people reliably performed?’ Crypto was too young and unproven for that until recently, but now there’s enough history for meaningful credit analysis.” So who benefits from such service? Bitcoin miners and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) primarily, according to the Architect. In theory, with access to fiat credit, miners could reduce forced selling, allowing them to stake more assets, generate greater on-chain activity, and shift from reactive outflows to productive economic contribution, a “double knock-on effect” that turns liquidity pressure into real value creation. ""If I want to speculate on bitcoin, I would buy bitcoin. But as a credit lender, I can underwrite a bitcoin miner and make a bet on that mining operation and its cashflows outcompeting the market,” he said. Meanwhile, Architect sees Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) as a particularly attractive and underfunded niche for credit, with Amenyogbo explaining that DePIN provides real economic outputs rather than merely betting on digital asset price appreciation. In the end, Architect’s ultimate ambition isn’t just to lend, it’s to rebuild crypto’s capital stack from the ground up. By positioning itself as the first credible risk assessor for decentralized infrastructure and applying TradFi-grade underwriting standards, the firm hopes to unlock a new wave of institutional capital. “Raising a $100 million fund is cool, but it’s just a drop in the ocean,” Amenyogbo said. “What we’re really doing is laying the groundwork for crypto credit to scale the way traditional debt does, bundled, rated, insured, and syndicated into the largest pools of capital in the world.” Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading above $114K. ""Until BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume, the path of least resistance could remain sideways to down. Opportunistic traders may continue to find short-term setups in memecoins and alt-beta, but the broader picture hasn’t flipped,"" market maker Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk. ETH: ETH is trading at $3500, down 2.8% as ETF outflows ramp up. Gold: Gold prices dipped during the U.S. trading day, as a stronger U.S. dollar and falling oil prices weighed on sentiment, while silver saw modest gains and mixed global economic signals, including robust Chinese services data and growing Fed rate cut odds, added complexity to market direction. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday after Wall Street losses, as investors digested weak U.S. economic data and new technology tariff remarks from President Trump, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipping 0.12%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 fell 0.49% Tuesday as weak economic data and fresh Trump tariff remarks fueled concern, though analysts expect the bull market to continue despite near-term volatility.

Meanwhile, emerging meme coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention as it aims for the $5 mark. The project is worth $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The 7th phase will appreciate by 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are expecting a 71.43% return when the token is launched at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $14 million in funding and has received over 14,800 investors. As crypto markets pulse with ETF-driven momentum, Mutuum’s unique infrastructure positions it at the intersection of capital efficiency and trustless innovation, setting a compelling tone for what could be a pivotal quarter. Cardano (ADA) Nears $1 as ETF Optimism Builds Cardano is currently trading around $0.72 supported by a strong technical setup following a breakout above the $0.64 resistance zone. Institutional inflows and rising ETF approval odds, now estimated between 79% and 84%, are boosting sentiment and fueling a rally that analysts expect could target $1.00, with stretch objectives ranging from $1.30 to $1.80+ in 2025. While resistance near $0.77–$0.74 remains crucial, maintaining support above $0.70 could sustain bullish momentum toward key levels. In parallel, some attention is also shifting toward emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance as investors explore next-gen utility narratives. Investors Eye 71% Gains in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale stage 6 due to a presale stage 5 sell-out. Phase 6 investors will enjoy a 71.43% return on investment at token launch. More than $14 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is an increase of 14.23% over Stage 6. Mutuum Finance Boosts Protocol Security with Bug Bounty Supported by CertiK Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with security and transparency partner CertiK. Users will be rewarded 50,000 USDT in value for reporting probable bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four severity classes; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Mass MUTM Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway in which individuals who take part in the contest will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, with each token being worth $10,000. Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending revolution in a product that offers the maximum level of asset control to customers. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform developed by combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to the P2C lending pool comes through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing sentiment of the market, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of lending. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, creating room for direct lending, which is appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Cardano may be on track to reclaim $1, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself for much larger gains. Currently priced at $0.035 in phase 6, early investors could lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06, with longer-term upside potentially reaching $5. Backed by a $14M+ raise, 14,800+ investors, a CertiK-audited bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, MUTM is quickly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi plays of 2025.

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Cipher Mining made headlines with its latest operational update. The company announced its July performance, revealing a strategic approach to managing its digital assets. What Does Cipher Mining’s Latest Report Reveal? In an announcement made on August 5th via GlobeNewswire, Cipher Mining confirmed its operational results for July. The company reported a significant Bitcoin mining output while also detailing its sales activity for the month. This balance between mining new coins and selling existing ones offers valuable insights into their financial strategy. Bitcoin Mined: Cipher Mining successfully mined 214 BTC during July. This demonstrates their continued efficiency and operational capacity in the demanding Bitcoin mining sector. Bitcoin Sold: The company strategically sold 52 BTC in July. This decision helps cover operational expenses, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market conditions. Total BTC Holdings: Despite the sales, Cipher Mining’s total Bitcoin holdings grew to an impressive 1,219 BTC. This indicates a net accumulation strategy, strengthening their overall position in the cryptocurrency market . Why Do Bitcoin Miners Engage in BTC Sales? For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Cipher Mining, selling a portion of their mined Bitcoin is a common and necessary practice. It is not always a sign of distress; rather, it’s often a calculated move essential for sustainable growth. Miners face substantial operational costs that require regular capital injections. Consider these key reasons: Covering Operational Costs: Running a large mining facility demands significant electricity, maintenance, and infrastructure investments. Selling BTC provides the fiat currency needed to cover these ongoing expenses. Liquidity Management: Maintaining a healthy cash flow is crucial for any business. Strategic sales ensure Cipher Mining has sufficient liquidity to adapt to market changes or pursue new opportunities. Market Optimization: Miners may sell BTC when they perceive favorable market prices, allowing them to maximize revenue from their production. This proactive approach is part of a robust digital asset strategy . Analyzing Cipher Mining’s Growing BTC Holdings The fact that Cipher Mining’s total BTC holdings reached 1,219 BTC, even after selling 52 BTC, highlights a key aspect of their business model: accumulation. Many large miners aim to grow their Bitcoin reserves, viewing them as long-term assets. This strategy allows them to benefit from potential future appreciation of Bitcoin’s value. Their growing holdings reflect: Confidence in Bitcoin: Holding a significant amount of BTC signals the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and value proposition. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial Bitcoin reserve enhances the company’s balance sheet, potentially making it more attractive to investors and lenders. Strategic Flexibility: Larger holdings offer more flexibility for future financial maneuvers, whether it’s further sales, collateralization, or other forms of digital asset strategy . What Does This Mean for the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The activities of major miners like Cipher Mining have a ripple effect on the broader cryptocurrency market . When miners sell, it adds supply to the market; when they hold, it reduces potential selling pressure. Their operational updates provide valuable indicators of industry health and sentiment. This report suggests that despite some sales, Cipher Mining remains focused on growth and accumulation. This generally positive sentiment from a significant industry player can contribute to overall market confidence. Investors often watch miner activity closely for clues about market direction and underlying supply dynamics. Cipher Mining’s July report offers a clear picture of a well-managed Bitcoin mining operation. Their strategic decision to sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin while simultaneously increasing their overall BTC holdings showcases a balanced and forward-thinking digital asset strategy . This approach allows them to cover operational costs while continuing to build their long-term asset base in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market . It’s a testament to the complex but often rewarding dance between generating revenue and accumulating valuable digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Cipher Mining? Cipher Mining is a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in Bitcoin mining operations. They utilize advanced infrastructure to mine new Bitcoin, contributing to the network’s security and earning rewards. Q2: Why did Cipher Mining sell 52 BTC in July?

49612432,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780050,1754444451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49612432.jpeg,New Zealand jobless rate hits 5-year high as economic slowdown deepens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-zealand-jobless-rate-hits-5-year-high/,"New Zealand’s job market loses steam, with unemployment rising to a 15-year high of 5.2% in Q2. That is the strongest reading since the first full quarter of recovery following COVID in Q3 2020. In the second quarter , the jobless rate was 5.2%, slightly higher than 5.1% during the first three months of the year. Although the increase was below market expectations (economists predicted 5.3%), it further fuels worry about a wider economic slowdown. Employment also shrank by 0.1% during the quarter, matching analyst expectations. The drop may seem modest, but in context, it marks the latest sign that economic momentum is fading. Abhijit Surya, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the Reserve Bank was unlikely to take comfort in the slight rise in the unemployment rate, noting that a closer look at the data revealed significant slack in the labour market. The weakening labour market is emerging alongside sluggish consumer spending, contracting manufacturing and services sectors, and a languishing housing market — all of which point to a slowing economy. Participation drops as workers step back As previously pointed out, more people were jobless, and fewer people were even looking for work. The labour force participation rate — the working-age population either with a job or actively seeking employment — declined to 70.5%, down from Q1’s 70.7%. That marked the lowest level since early 2021. However, the hit has been even harder on mid-teenagers and young workers when we dig deeper into the data. Whether it was an artificial boom in the few months when workers were hard to come by during the post-pandemic hiring spike, many went into the labour market. Nonetheless, when the economy takes a hit and employers engage in less than whiplash hiring activity, these groups are often the first out of the door. Teenagers, in particular, were leaving the job market, many opting to return to school or study rather than being classed as jobless, said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac in Auckland. Year-on-year, total employment fell by 0.9%, confirming that the slowdown is not just a seasonal blip, but part of a broader cooling in the economy. Workers see slower wage growth amid rising costs Adding to the unease is a continued slowdown in wage growth. According to today’s report, annual wage inflation slowed for the ninth consecutive quarter. Ordinary time wages for non-government workers rose just 2.2% compared to a year earlier — down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. That signals a diminishing bargaining power for workers, even as the cost of living remains high for many households. Despite the year-on-year slowdown, quarterly wage growth grew slightly, rising 0.6%, above economists’ expectations of 0.5%. Meanwhile, average ordinary time hourly earnings for non-government workers jumped 1.9% from the previous quarter — the strongest quarterly rise since Q3 2020. Although the rise in pay growth looked encouraging, some analysts dismissed it as potentially short-lived or a function of different types of workers making up a larger share of employment rather than broad wage inflation. Businesses may be dishing out higher wages to keep on skilled workers while pulling back elsewhere in terms of headcount. That said, real wage growth underperforms for many employees, while inflation remains elevated and still tightens household budgets. The labour market data has added weight to expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will soon resume cutting interest rates. The RBNZ had forecast a 5.2% unemployment rate in May, but it also predicted employment growth of 0.2%, a clearly missed target. With inflation showing signs of easing and economic growth stalling, pressure is mounting on the central bank to support the economy. Most analysts now expect the RBNZ to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3% at its next meeting on August 20, especially after pausing in July.

49612842,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799170,1754445604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49612842.jpeg,Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory—Top Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-stuck-macro-purgatory-q4-or-bust/,"In his August 5 “Macro Monday” livestream, crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz delivered a review of the market’s late-summer state, arguing that while Bitcoin’s price action has gone quiet, the broader cycle remains intact. “We’re in this pocket of seasonal weakness for August and September that we typically see most years,” he explained, pointing to seasonality charts showing that historically, Bitcoin underperforms in this time window. “It’s a high likelihood that August and September is a giant nothing burger,” he added. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? At day 978 of the current cycle, the question many investors are asking, Olszewicz noted, is simple but existential: is the cycle already over? Will it end this year? Or is there more upside ahead? His answer leaned cautiously optimistic. “I’m in the ‘probably not over yet, could continue’ camp,” he said. “But we will have to see what happens in Q4. Ultimately, that’s going to determine it.” From a technical standpoint, the analyst sees no reason to declare the top is in. “Technicals still look fine. Price still looks okay. We had a pullback. All that is fine,” he said, emphasizing that Bitcoin has not yet exhibited the typical parabolic advance associated with major tops. Nor have other macro or on-chain metrics shown signs of terminal overheating. “We don’t have other metrics screaming from the rooftop saying it’s time yet.” Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ However, the short-term setup is underwhelming. After a cup-and-handle breakout that briefly pushed price toward the $122,000–$123,000 region, momentum faded. Olszewicz doubts such levels can be reclaimed soon: “In the next two weeks we’ll know if we can start to creep back towards $120,000, which is asking a lot admittedly for August.” The wildcard, he said, is ETF flows. “Do we see ETF flows for any reason? Then do we see treasury companies continuing to buy? Those are the marginal buyers right now.” He suggested that ETF buyers could return due to a combination of underweight positioning, opportunistic dip-buying, and monthly rebalancing dynamics. Still, he remains neutral overall. “Just a general softening of any bullishness we may have had,” he said. “Now it’d be a different story if this is October and we’re seeing this. That’s not normal.” A further reason for caution is the collapse in futures basis across major assets. “Premium is all the way down to under 7% on BTC. It’s under 8% on ETH. And I think SOL is a little more illiquid, but even SOL is way down—15% from 35%,” he noted. That contraction in futures premiums, typically a sign of speculative demand drying up, reflects a broader risk-off mood. “Not a lot of bullish sentiment, not a lot of craziness,” Olszewicz observed. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Losing Steam? Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support On-chain risk metrics confirm the trend. “There’s a decline here in risk appetite,” he said, referring to metrics like unrealized profit versus MVRV. He added that if Bitcoin were to enter a parabolic advance, “you will see this metric shoot up… But what’s it going to take?” Q4 Or Bust He floated a few possibilities: rate cuts, weakening Fed independence, or perhaps just seasonal strength and macro chaos in Q4. But for now, he advised traders to “take it easy on the 50X leverage,” especially those who’ve already made significant gains this cycle. “Do I need to put risk back on? Do I need to be as risky as I was earlier?” he asked rhetorically. “Or does it make more sense to be less risky here?” From a macroeconomic perspective, the picture is mixed. Inflation data from Trueflation remains low—currently at 1.65%—but Olszewicz warned that new post–August 1 tariffs may raise prices in the months ahead. “We are adding inflationary pressures with tariffs, no doubt about it,” he said, though the effect will take time to appear in the data. Meanwhile, core PCE is headed in the wrong direction, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is printing 2.1% growth for Q3—hardly recessionary, but not robust either. Labor market data continues to cloud the outlook. “If we account for a non-collapsing labor force participation, we could be as high as 4.9% on the actual unemployment rate,” Olszewicz warned. “And we’re continuing to see a degradation in job availability for manufacturing,” particularly in “Heartland Rust Belt types of jobs.” Liquidity dynamics are also in flux. He drew attention to the draining of the Fed’s reverse repo facility—once a $2 trillion reservoir of sidelined capital—which has supported risk assets through 2023 and 2024. “As this gets drained closer to completion, there’s a potential likelihood for liquidity hiccups and a liquidity intervention by the Fed,” he said. Importantly, this has kept overall US liquidity flat, offsetting quantitative tightening. “Despite QT, the drain of the reverse repo has offset QT, and US liquidity by this metric has been basically flat since 2022.” What changed the game, Olszewicz said, was not liquidity per se, but the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. “That has really been, in my opinion, a big difference maker,” he explained. “We got ETF approvals here, ETF started trading here, and the rest is history as far as flows are concerned.” In conclusion, Olszewicz emphasized that while the broader risk appetite has declined and price action remains dull, there is no evidence yet that the Bitcoin cycle has topped. “The cycle’s probably not over,” he said. “It’s just sleeping—and Q4 will ultimately determine whether it wakes up.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,041.

At the same time, the company has scaled back its exposure to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), signaling a shift in portfolio allocation strategy. Galaxy Digital Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Cuts Back On Ethereum According to the Q2 2025 report, Galaxy Digital posted a net income of $30.7 million for the quarter, reflecting strong financial performance across its core business segments. A key milestone during the quarter was the company’s official listing on Nasdaq under the ticker GLXY, which took place on March 16. Galaxy’s net digital asset holdings now stand at approximately $1.2 billion at current market prices – a 40% increase compared to Q1 2025. The jump in portfolio value was largely driven by the sharp rise in Bitcoin’s price over the past three months. To recap, BTC was trading near $70,500 on March 31. By June 30, it had surged to $108,700, marking a gain of more than 50% in just one quarter. The table below shows that as of June 30, the firm held 17,102 BTC, up from 12,830 BTC at the end of Q1. However, this accumulation came alongside a reduction in the company’s ETH and XRP positions, suggesting a cautious or rebalanced approach toward altcoins. Specifically, Galaxy’s ETH holdings declined from 155,026 ETH on March 31 to 90,521 ETH by the end of June. Other digital assets in the firm’s portfolio include Solana (SOL), Hype (HYP), SUI, and stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC. In addition to changes in crypto holdings, the firm also reported a strong increase in assets under management (AUM), which rose to $8.9 billion – up 27% quarter-over-quarter. Assets under stake also climbed to $3.1 billion, representing a 34% increase. The company anticipates continued strength into Q3, stating: July marked the strongest monthly financial performance for our Digital Assets operating business in the firm’s history, with record results in Global Markets and steady progress in Asset Management & Infrastructure Solutions. Will Galaxy Digital Adjust Its Crypto Strategy? While Galaxy Digital increased its BTC holdings and reduced ETH exposure in Q2, recent developments suggest the firm may adjust its portfolio strategy based on capital rotation and shifting market trends. Last week, a Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallet linked to Galaxy Digital initiated a massive sale of 22,700 BTC. The sell-off weighed on the market, bringing Bitcoin’s net realized profit down to $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently stated that Ethereum is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term, citing ETH’s expanding ecosystem and accelerating innovation. At press time, BTC trades at $113,230, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum|Galaxy Digital|solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 02:00:34

This bold prediction is backed by a range of technical models, Fibonacci cycles, and bullish macro trends. As the crypto market digests this news, XRP and ETH analysts are weighing the impact on altcoins, signaling the potential for a major price rally across the sector. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a high-profile altcoin, with analysts calling for even bigger gains and 31x upside before the next cycle peak. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Analysts Are Targeting $175K Bitcoin price news today is dominated by forecasts of $175,000 by September 2025. EGRAG Crypto, known for accurate technical calls, cites the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and 21-week EMA patterns—pointing to historical cycle peaks right at the $175K level. His timeline lines up with other prominent crypto analyst predictions, who reference a clear BTC and ETH price correlation when forecasting tops. Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell, who nailed earlier cycles, also backs the $175K BTC price target, using network inflows and historical trends. Robert Kiyosaki’s call for Bitcoin to reach $175,000–$350,000 in 2025 rounds out a strong consensus that the next phase of institutional adoption could send BTC much higher. The question on everyone’s mind: will Bitcoin hit $175,000, and how will altcoins react if it does? XRP and ETH Analysts React to Bitcoin’s Breakout Target The Bitcoin 2025 price prediction is pushing analysts to revisit their XRP price reaction and ETH analyst reaction calls. Many expect XRP and ETH to track Bitcoin higher, with XRP analyst predictions after Bitcoin surge pointing to potential rallies if BTC breaks out. XRP price prediction 2025 ranges from $5 to $8 if Bitcoin’s momentum continues, but volatility remains. The impact of Bitcoin price on altcoins is also showing up in ETH price prediction 2025 models, with most analysts calling for a new ETH high if BTC holds its gains. Ethereum price forecast after Bitcoin rally is bullish, driven by network upgrades and ETF inflows. Ripple news today and Ethereum market outlook both reflect a bullish sentiment as crypto market sentiment 2025 shifts into risk-on mode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Expect Bigger Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating serious hype among traders looking for high-upside altcoin price movement after Bitcoin surge headlines. With Bitcoin’s forecast now at $175K, some MAGACOIN analysts are projecting up to 31x gains for early holders, making it one of the top stories in crypto analyst predictions for Q3 and Q4. Why is MAGACOIN FINANCE getting so much attention? The project’s explosive community growth, active governance, and strong narrative are all driving rapid wallet expansion and increasing daily volume. As the rest of the market focuses on BTC and ETH short-term moves, investors searching for the next big opportunity are positioning ahead of what could be a new cycle leader. The current crypto market sentiment 2025 favors high-upside altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its ability to move independently, drawing both meme coin capital and strategic traders. With a 31x upside still on the table, this emerging project is on every radar. Wrapping Up The Bitcoin forecast raised to $175K has set a bullish tone for the rest of the market.

However, the bears were active near the $115,500 resistance and the price struggled to continue higher.

Consequently, the firm now possesses 480,031 ETH. The total ETH stack is now valued at $1.65 billion. Simultaneously, a specific ETH-based altcoin project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing significant investor attention during its ongoing presale. SharpLink’s strategic Ethereum bet SharpLink Gaming is actively mirroring successful Bitcoin treasury strategies. The company is firmly committed to Ethereum instead. This latest purchase, averaging $3,530 per token, involved using USDC over two days. Moreover, SharpLink appointed Joseph Chalom, formerly of BlackRock’s digital assets division, as Co-CEO in late July. This leadership move signals deep expertise guiding its crypto investment strategy. Consequently, SharpLink has positioned itself among the largest corporate holders of Ethereum globally. Overall, corporate ETH holdings now exceed 2.74 million tokens, worth $9.71 billion, indicating strong institutional crypto investment interest. Despite SharpLink’s stock (SBET) rising 35% monthly and 112% year-to-date, some analysts caution about its premium valuation. They suggest direct ETH exposure or crypto ETF products might offer clearer value propositions for investors monitoring crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum continues accelerating impressively. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out rapidly. Investors have already contributed over $14,100,000 since the presale began. Furthermore, participants have snapped up more than 665 million MUTM tokens. Total MUTM holders now stand at 14,800. The current price per token in this phase is $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase, or 3.5 times, the opening phase price of $0.01. The opportunity to acquire tokens at this level is diminishing quickly. Phase 7 will commence shortly, introducing a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Purchasing now, therefore, guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment. Future crypto predictions suggest significantly higher potential gains post-launch. Some analysts forecast targets reaching $1.50 or beyond based on platform adoption. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. CertiK awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an outstanding security score of 95.00. This result confirms a solid security posture for the platform. Importantly, auditors found zero vulnerabilities within the examined smart contract code. Furthermore, no security incidents have occurred during the past 90 days. To enhance security further, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK again. They launched an official Bug Bounty Program. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is available for ethical hackers. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: Critical findings: Highest rewards Major, minor, and low findings: Proportionate rewards This proactive approach incentivizes thorough scrutiny and strengthens the protocol continuously. Major giveaway fuels community excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is celebrating its presale progress enthusiastically. The team announced its largest giveaway ever. Participants stand to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of tokens.

This system incentivizes holding and strengthens long-term commitment among major supporters. Final thoughts SharpLink’s massive Ethereum acquisition underscores a strong institutional belief in ETH’s value. Concurrently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a timely presale opportunity within this growing altcoin segment. With its current price at $0.035 in Phase 6, the guaranteed 71% ROI at launch and strong post-launch crypto predictions present a compelling case.

His team is expected to issue an executive order within days. According to a report from The Independent, the order will push regulators to dig into possible breaches of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust rules, and consumer protection laws. It could hit banks with hefty fines, consent decrees, or other penalties. Background Of Banking And Crypto Clash Industry voices say crypto firms have long felt frozen out by big banks. They point to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” under the Biden years, which they claim led to sudden account closures without clear reasons. BREAKING: Trump to prepare executive order that punishes banks that discriminate against conservatives, according to Wall Street Journal report. — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) August 5, 2025 In 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said JPMorgan Chase warned it would shut accounts tied to main crypto income. In November the following year, Elon Musk said as many as 30 tech entrepreneurs lost bank access under that policy. Banks have since pushed back. They say decisions were about anti-money laundering rules. They add that managing reputational risk lets them guard against fraud and legal trouble. Trump To End Banks’ ‘Reputational Risk’ Shield According to The Wall Street Journal , the order will tell federal bank overseers to look for violations of key laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act bans discrimination in lending. Antitrust laws keep competition fair. Consumer protection statutes shield against unfair practices. If banks are found at fault, they face monetary penalties or binding consent orders. The move aims to stop banks from using compliance as an excuse for political bias. It could also strip away so-called reputational risk guidelines that critics blame for “debanking.” Penalties And Enforcement Based on a report by Reuters , the order could be in force as early as this week. It will empower regulators to impose fines or other disciplinary steps. It also asks the Small Business Administration to review banks that guarantee SBA loans. That means any lenders accused of cutting ties with certain customers may face fresh scrutiny. Calls for comment to the White House went unanswered, according to Reuters. The Politics Of Banking Cuts Trump has been outspoken about big banks. In January, he accused the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America of turning away conservative clients. The banks denied the claims. At the same time, Republican politicians and state officials have slammed “woke capitalism,” saying banks are cutting off gun makers, fossil fuel firms, and others that lean right. Those voices helped shape the executive order’s focus.

Analysts Split on What’s Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-gearing-up-for-a-major-move-analysts-split-on-whats-next/,"Ethereum’s price has experienced moderate declines over the past week, dropping around 5% after a period of notable gains in previous months. At the time of writing, ETH is trading near $3,633, fluctuating between the $3,500 and $3,700 range over the past day. This price movement follows a broader market cooling, with many traders engaging in profit-taking after Ethereum’s earlier upward trend. Recent on-chain and derivatives market data suggest that Ethereum may be heading into a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Battles Key Levels – Will Buyers Step Back In? Derivatives Market Data Signals Selling Pressure CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared an outlook indicating increased selling pressure and potential short-term weakness in the ETH futures market. The analyst highlighted that despite several attempts to breach the $4,000 resistance level, Ethereum has yet to break through, indicating possible market hesitancy at current levels. Darkfost emphasized that the behavior of the futures market has shifted notably over the past few weeks. According to data from Binance, Ethereum’s taker buy/sell ratio has dropped to 0.87, one of the lowest levels observed this year. A ratio below 1 typically indicates that sell orders are dominating over buy orders, suggesting that traders are either closing long positions or opening shorts. The analyst noted that this trend began around July 18 and has remained mostly negative since then, limiting upward momentum. Additionally, the seven-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMAs) have started to trend downward, which could be a sign of slowing market momentum. Binance continues to hold the largest share of ETH futures open interest among exchanges, making sentiment on this platform particularly influential. With sellers currently exerting more control, the data suggests a potential continuation of this consolidation phase until buying activity strengthens. Mixed Views on Ethereum’s Longer-Term Outlook While near-term market data points to a challenging period for Ethereum, some analysts maintain a positive longer-term outlook. A recent post by Titan of Crypto, a well-followed market commentator on X, projected a potential price target of $8,000. According to Titan of Crypto, Ethereum’s price structure is forming a large monthly triangle pattern that could eventually lead to a breakout, opening the way toward a significant rally.

The recent approval of the XRP ETF structure by the SEC has triggered fresh optimism among traders. XRP quickly gained momentum, with Ethereum following closely behind. Both are now being watched for breakout price action as ETF-driven demand picks up. Investors see this as a key turning point. The SEC’s greenlight on in-kind crypto ETF redemptions is fueling confidence that the altcoin market is finally entering a new phase of legitimacy. As a result, capital is rotating faster than ever, with early winners already starting to form. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the mix as part of this rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital as ETF Hype Reshapes the Market As XRP gains strength from ETF approval and ETH picks up bullish momentum, traders are expanding their search beyond the top ten. Many are now moving into emerging presale tokens that carry real upside. One name catching serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its presale underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing in traders who believe this cycle still has room for smaller tokens to explode. What stands out is how quickly funds are flowing in—not just from retail wallets but also from mid-sized holders moving capital out of XRP and Ethereum. The token’s appeal lies in more than just hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean token model, clear branding, and a cultural edge that taps into real-world sentiment. Its political theme resonates with a wide online community, giving it the viral spark that earlier meme tokens needed to catch fire. Based on current inflows and presale growth, some investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver gains of up to 37x. While no token is guaranteed to hit those heights, the early demand suggests it’s becoming one of the stronger contenders in this ETF-fueled rotation. XRP and ETH Set the Stage—But Newcomers Could Ride the Wave Higher XRP’s ETF support is helping rewrite the rules for altcoin legitimacy. Ethereum is positioned to benefit next, with many expecting a spillover effect as institutions embrace a wider range of assets. But while these giants lead the headlines, smart traders are already looking at the next layer down. The presale space is heating up again, and well-positioned tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are standing out. The key isn’t just hype—it’s timing. With ETF narratives dominating, tokens that align with broader trends have a better chance of rapid growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks that box with strong community roots and growing market visibility. Conclusion: The Window for Early Movers Is Open XRP and ETH are reigniting the altcoin cycle thanks to ETF approval momentum. As capital floods back into the market, traders are not only holding the old names—they’re rotating into new ones with greater upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a standout in that shift. Its presale is gaining speed as more investors recognize the potential for strong returns in a fast-changing market.

Investors witnessed a significant downturn today as the MYX token experienced a sharp 58% drop. This dramatic fall coincided directly with a scheduled token unlock, sparking immediate questions about market dynamics and investor behavior. What Triggered the Dramatic MYX Token Unlock Impact? On-chain analysis reveals that the considerable decline in the MYX token price was not random. It directly followed a pre-scheduled token unlock event. Token unlocks release previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply, which can increase selling pressure. In this case, a major investor, Hack VC, played a pivotal role. According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, Hack VC claimed a substantial amount of MYX tokens. Specifically, they received 1,279,890 MYX, valued at approximately $2.16 million at the time. This claim originated from an airdrop contract over a seven-hour period, setting the stage for the subsequent market reaction. Unpacking the Hack VC Sell-Off Following the token claim, Hack VC proceeded with a significant Hack VC sell-off . The firm executed two separate transactions to offload these newly acquired tokens onto the market. Such large-scale selling by a prominent investor can significantly influence a token’s price, especially if market liquidity is thin. Here’s a closer look at the impact of this specific event: Increased Supply: The release of 1.28 million MYX tokens from a locked state instantly increased the circulating supply. Investor Behavior: Hack VC’s decision to sell immediately after claiming suggests a strategy to realize profits or reduce exposure, contributing heavily to the downward pressure. Market Reaction: The sheer volume of the Hack VC sell-off overwhelmed buying demand, leading to the rapid price depreciation of the MYX token. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility After Token Unlocks The incident with MYX highlights a common pattern in the crypto space: the heightened crypto market volatility around token unlock events. When large tranches of tokens held by early investors or project teams become liquid, there’s an inherent risk of increased selling pressure. This can lead to sharp price corrections, even for otherwise promising projects. Understanding the token unlock impact is crucial for any crypto investor. These events are often publicly scheduled, allowing market participants to anticipate potential supply increases. However, the exact timing and scale of selling activity by specific entities, like the recent Hack VC sell-off , can be unpredictable and cause significant price swings. What Does This Mean for MYX Token Holders? For current holders of the MYX token , such a sharp decline can be concerning. It underscores the importance of thorough research into a project’s tokenomics, including its vesting schedules and unlock dates. While some projects mitigate the impact of unlocks with buybacks or strong development news, others may experience significant price discovery downwards. Investors should consider these points: Risk Assessment: Always evaluate the risks associated with token unlocks. Diversification: Avoid over-exposure to any single asset, especially those with significant upcoming unlocks. Long-Term View: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might present buying opportunities, but careful due diligence is paramount. The MYX token’s recent performance serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unforgiving nature of the digital asset market. In conclusion, the dramatic fall in MYX token price following its token unlock and the substantial Hack VC sell-off provides a valuable case study in the complexities of crypto market dynamics. It reinforces the critical need for investors to stay informed about tokenomics, vesting schedules, and the potential for increased crypto market volatility around such events. Understanding the immediate and long-term token unlock impact is key to navigating these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the MYX token price to drop so sharply? The MYX token price dropped significantly due to a large volume of tokens being unlocked and subsequently sold by a major investor, Hack VC, immediately after they claimed their tokens from an airdrop contract. What is a token unlock? A token unlock is a scheduled event where previously locked cryptocurrency tokens, often held by early investors, team members, or advisors, become available for trading. This can increase the circulating supply and potentially lead to selling pressure. Who is Hack VC and what was their role in the MYX token event? Hack VC is an investor in MYX Finance. They claimed 1,279,890 MYX tokens (worth approximately $2.16 million) from an airdrop contract and then sold them in two separate transactions, directly contributing to the MYX token price decline. Is it common for crypto prices to fall after a token unlock? Yes, it is relatively common for cryptocurrency prices to experience downward pressure or increased volatility after a token unlock, especially if large amounts of tokens are released and subsequently sold by major holders. How can investors prepare for potential token unlock impact? Investors can prepare by researching a project’s tokenomics, understanding its vesting schedule and unlock dates, and assessing the potential supply increase. Diversifying portfolios and practicing risk management are also crucial strategies. Did you find this analysis insightful?

One significant indicator of market health and sentiment is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process, often misunderstood, reveals massive shifts in trader positions and can signal impending volatility or corrections. Over the last 24 hours, we’ve witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering critical insights into current market trends. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what futures liquidation means. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. When a trader’s position, whether ‘long’ (betting on price increase) or ‘short’ (betting on price decrease), falls below a certain margin requirement, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This forced closure is called liquidation. It’s a mechanism to manage risk, but it can also amplify market moves, creating cascading effects. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have shown significant activity in the crypto perpetual futures market. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $107.83 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 68.95% of these were ‘long’ positions. This indicates that a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price increase faced forced closures, suggesting a recent downward price movement or a sudden dip caught many off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $56.59 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of ‘long’ positions at 82.67%. This strong bias towards long liquidations for BTC further emphasizes a prevailing bearish sentiment or sharp price corrections that impacted bullish traders. MYX: Interestingly, MYX recorded $15.60 million in liquidations, but here, ‘short’ positions accounted for 69.36%. This means traders who were betting on MYX’s price decrease were liquidated. This could point to a sudden upward price movement for MYX, contrasting with the general trend seen in ETH and BTC. These figures provide a snapshot of the intense pressure and rapid shifts occurring in the market. What Do These Liquidation Trends Tell Us About Crypto Market Analysis? Understanding these liquidation patterns is vital for accurate crypto market analysis . The high percentage of long liquidations for ETH and BTC suggests that these assets experienced notable price declines over the 24-hour period, catching many bullish traders by surprise. Such events often lead to increased selling pressure as liquidated positions add to the supply, potentially causing further price drops. Conversely, the significant short liquidation for MYX indicates an unexpected upward price surge, forcing bearish traders to close their positions. These contrasting movements highlight the diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of individual altcoins compared to market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders must always consider these underlying dynamics. Actionable Trading Insights from Recent Volatility What actionable trading insights can we glean from this data? Firstly, the prevalence of long liquidations for major assets like ETH and BTC underscores the importance of robust risk management. Over-leveraging in a volatile market can quickly lead to devastating losses. Secondly, the contrasting MYX data reminds us that not all assets move in lockstep. Diversification and specific research into individual altcoins are crucial. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. This data serves as a powerful reminder that while perpetual futures offer high leverage, they also come with amplified risks. Staying informed about these liquidation events can help traders anticipate potential price movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. The recent 24-hour market volatility , marked by significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation across ETH, BTC, and MYX, serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent risks and opportunities. These liquidations are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital shifts and illustrate the rapid changes in trader sentiment. By closely monitoring these metrics, market participants gain a deeper understanding of underlying pressures and can make more informed decisions. Always prioritize risk management and continuous learning in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, offering high leverage. 2. What causes a perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below the required margin level, leading the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses. This usually happens due to adverse price movements against the trader’s position. 3. What does a high percentage of “long” liquidations mean? A high percentage of “long” liquidations indicates that many traders who bet on a price increase (going long) were forced to close their positions, typically because the asset’s price decreased significantly. 4. How can traders use liquidation data? Traders can use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand areas of high leverage that might lead to further volatility or cascading liquidations. It highlights where significant capital is being lost or gained. 5. Is trading crypto perpetual futures risky? Yes, trading crypto perpetual futures is highly risky due to the leverage involved. While leverage can amplify gains, it can also significantly amplify losses, leading to rapid liquidations if the market moves against your position.

Toronto-based SOL Strategies recently made headlines with its July performance, reporting a significant surge in its digital asset portfolio. This news offers a fascinating glimpse into the operational success within the blockchain space, especially for those keen on crypto investments . What are SOL Strategies’ Impressive July Holdings? SOL Strategies , a prominent player in the Solana ecosystem, announced a remarkable month-over-month increase in its operations. According to a press release distributed via Newsfile, the company’s financial snapshot for July revealed substantial growth. This growth highlights the increasing interest and activity surrounding the Solana blockchain. Key figures from their July report include: 396,717 SOL held: This substantial amount of Solana’s native token represents a significant portion of their liquid assets. 26,440 JitoSOL held: JitoSOL is a liquid staking token on Solana, indicating SOL Strategies’ engagement with advanced DeFi strategies. 15% month-over-month increase in validator revenue: This impressive jump in earnings underscores their efficient and profitable staking operations. 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation: This figure demonstrates the trust placed in SOL Strategies by other SOL holders, who delegate their tokens to the company for staking purposes. These figures collectively paint a picture of a thriving entity within the Solana landscape, actively contributing to and benefiting from the network’s growth. The substantial SOL holdings reflect a strong commitment to the ecosystem. How Does Validator Revenue Boost Crypto Investments? The concept of validator revenue is central to understanding how companies like SOL Strategies generate income within proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana. Validators are crucial nodes that secure the network by verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. For this vital work, they earn rewards, often in the native cryptocurrency of the network. SOL Strategies’ reported 15% increase in validator revenue for July is a strong indicator of their operational efficiency and the health of the Solana network itself. Higher revenue suggests more successful block validation, potentially more delegated SOL, and overall robust network activity. For investors considering crypto investments , a company consistently growing its validator revenue demonstrates a stable and profitable business model in the volatile crypto market. Why Are SOL Holdings and Assets Under Delegation Significant? The reported SOL holdings of 396,717 SOL directly impact SOL Strategies’ influence and potential within the Solana ecosystem. Holding a large amount of the native token provides liquidity and flexibility for various operations, from staking to participating in governance. Furthermore, the 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation is equally, if not more, significant. Assets under delegation (AUD) represent the total amount of tokens that other Solana holders have entrusted to SOL Strategies’ validators. This delegation mechanism is fundamental to the security and decentralization of proof-of-stake networks. A large AUD figure means: Increased Network Security: More delegated SOL strengthens the network’s consensus mechanism. Enhanced Influence: Validators with more delegated SOL have a greater chance of being selected to validate blocks, leading to more rewards. Community Trust: A high AUD indicates strong trust from the Solana community in SOL Strategies’ reliability and performance. Therefore, these figures not only highlight SOL Strategies’ financial strength but also its crucial role in the broader Solana network’s health and development. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana and Crypto Investments? The continued growth of entities like SOL Strategies provides a positive outlook for the Solana blockchain. As more institutional players and specialized companies commit significant resources to validating and participating in the network, it reinforces Solana’s position as a robust and scalable platform. This stability and growth can attract further development, dApps, and users, creating a positive feedback loop. For individuals interested in crypto investments , observing the performance of professional validators like SOL Strategies can offer valuable insights. Their success indicates not just individual company strength but also the underlying potential of the Solana ecosystem as a whole. It underscores the viability of staking as a passive income strategy within the crypto space, provided it’s done through reputable and high-performing entities. In conclusion, SOL Strategies’ impressive July report, showcasing substantial SOL holdings and a significant boost in validator revenue , paints a compelling picture of growth and stability within the Solana ecosystem. Their commitment to the network, demonstrated through their vast assets under delegation, solidifies their position as a key player. This performance not only highlights their operational excellence but also serves as a positive indicator for the broader landscape of crypto investments , particularly for those eyeing the promising future of Solana.

China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) recently issued a stark alert, urging the public to exercise extreme caution. The warning highlights a concerning trend: foreign companies are reportedly attempting to collect sensitive iris information from users, dangling the enticing bait of crypto tokens . Why is China’s Ministry of State Security Issuing This Warning? On August 6, the MSS utilized its official WeChat channel to share this significant advisory. They did not name the specific overseas company involved, maintaining a focus on the broader threat. The core concern revolves around the surreptitious transfer of user biometric data, particularly iris scans, under the guise of distributing digital currencies. The MSS emphasized that such activities pose a direct threat. This isn’t just about individual privacy; it extends to the broader landscape of data security and even national security. When sensitive biometric identifiers like iris scans are compromised, the implications can be profound and far-reaching. Understanding the Threat: What is Iris Information and Why is it Valuable? Your iris is the colored part of your eye, containing a unique pattern that remains stable throughout your life. This makes it an incredibly reliable form of biometric identification, often considered more secure than fingerprints or facial recognition. Uniqueness: Each person’s iris pattern is distinct. Stability: Unlike fingerprints that can be altered, iris patterns remain constant. Irreversibility: Once compromised, you cannot change your iris pattern, unlike a password. Because of these characteristics, iris information is highly coveted by malicious actors. It can be used for identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, or even to create digital clones of individuals. The MSS’s warning underscores the severe risks associated with its unauthorized collection, especially when lured by incentives like crypto tokens . How Do Crypto Tokens Act as Bait for Personal Data? The allure of free or easily obtainable digital assets, such as crypto tokens , can be powerful. Many companies use token issuance, often through airdrops or sign-up bonuses, to attract new users and build their communities. However, this seemingly generous offer can sometimes hide a darker agenda. In this specific case, the MSS suggests that these foreign entities are using token distribution as a ‘bait’ to compel users to provide their biometric data. Users might be asked to scan their iris as part of a ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) process, or as a requirement to receive certain tokens or participate in a new project. Unwittingly, individuals might be trading their invaluable personal data for a speculative digital asset. This tactic highlights a growing concern in the cryptocurrency space: the intersection of digital finance and data security . As more innovative projects emerge, users must remain vigilant about the information they share, particularly highly sensitive biometric identifiers. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights The warning from China’s Ministry of State Security serves as a global reminder about the importance of safeguarding your personal data . Here are some actionable steps you can take: Be Skeptical of Freebies: If an offer of crypto tokens seems too good to be true, especially if it requires providing sensitive biometric data, it likely is. Read Terms and Conditions: Always thoroughly review the privacy policies and terms of service before signing up for any new platform or service, particularly those involving digital assets. Understand what data they collect and why. Verify Company Legitimacy: Research the company behind the token issuance. Look for a clear history, reputable founders, and transparent operations. A lack of transparency is a major red flag. Understand Data Risks: Recognize that biometric data, once compromised, cannot be easily changed. Treat your iris information and other unique identifiers with the utmost care. This vigilance is crucial not just for individuals but also for national security, as aggregated biometric data could be exploited for various nefarious purposes. The Broader Implications for Data Security and National Security The MSS’s warning underscores a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity: the escalating value of biometric data. For governments, the collection of such sensitive information by foreign entities raises profound national security concerns. It could potentially lead to: Espionage: Identifying and tracking individuals of interest. Cyberattacks: Using stolen identities to gain access to critical infrastructure. Surveillance: Building comprehensive databases of citizens. While the specific foreign company remains unnamed, the advisory from China’s Ministry of State Security clearly signals a heightened awareness and concern within the Chinese government regarding digital asset activities that could undermine national interests and compromise citizen safety. This incident serves as a stark reminder that the digital frontier, while offering immense opportunities, also harbors significant risks that demand constant vigilance and robust protective measures. Ultimately, this warning is a call to action for everyone engaging with digital currencies. Your personal data is a valuable asset, far more so than any speculative crypto tokens . Protecting your iris information and other biometric data is paramount in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

Analyst Explains How,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/binance-inflows-leading-altcoins-analyst/,"A quant has explained how altcoin inflows into cryptocurrency exchange Binance might act as a leading indicator for the market. Spikes In Binance Altcoin Inflows Tend To Precede Corrections In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend in the altcoin exchange inflows going to Binance. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Inflow Transaction Count,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of deposit transactions that investors are making to a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Buyers Aren’t Selling: $118,000+ Supply Remains Firm Below is a chart for the indicator that shows the trend in the altcoin deposits occurring on the various exchanges. As is visible in the graph, the altcoin Exchange Inflow Transaction Count peaked on all exchanges right before both the 2024 market tops, implying that deposit activity intensified on the platforms. Generally, investors transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so spikes in exchange inflows can lead into bearish price action. This appears to be what happened in these two instances. Interestingly, during the latest market drawdown that has occurred over the past few days, inflows on only one exchange have seen a spike: Binance. There have also been other instances in the past where this pattern developed. “Spikes in Binance inflows (represented by the purple area) frequently precede downward price movements or market corrections,” notes the analyst. The quant has also explained that Binance is not only the largest exchange in the sector in terms of trading volume, but also a hub for altcoin activity from both retail and institutional entities. As such, investor behavior on the platform can be quite relevant for the wider market. Speaking of alts, CryptoQuant has shared a few new indicators that can be used to track smart money. One of these is the Average Order Size, which differentiates between futures buy orders by their scale. The above chart shows the indicator’s data for Hyperliquid (HYPE). It would appear that whale-sized buy orders appeared when the altcoin was trading around $11 earlier in the year. Since then, its price has climbed to $39. Related Reading: Bitcoin Neutral Sentiment Didn’t Last Long: Investors Already Greedy Again Another indicator is the Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency. This one is the opposite: it points out periods of elevated activity from the small hands. From this graph, it’s apparent that overheated periods of retail interest coincided with price highs in Gala (GALA). ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, down more than 4% over the past week.

Dogecoin is climbing higher after bouncing strongly from a proven support zone, showing signs of renewed energy. Tron is also gathering attention as it trades above key levels and builds pressure near $0.50. Both show positive setups on the charts, but BlockDAG (BDAG) takes things to another level. Instead of waiting for an exchange listing, it offers a fully functional trading simulator now. Its live Dashboard V4 lets users interact with real-time BDAG/USD pricing, BUY and SELL panels, and instant wallet balance updates. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG delivers something rare: hands-on experience before public launch, making it one of the few presales that feels alive and active. Tron TRX Breakout Watch Nears as Bulls Target $0.50 Tron is pushing toward the $0.50 mark, drawing strong attention to a potential breakout move. With over 50% of all USDT currently moving through the Tron network, its role in handling stablecoins continues to strengthen, adding weight to its long-term value. Price action shows TRX holding above critical supports with steady trading volume supporting its climb. Technical signals are leaning bullish, and traders are adding Tron to their breakout watch lists as pressure builds. A clean close above $0.50 could mark the start of a stronger upward trend, supported by real network usage and growing confidence in its infrastructure. Dogecoin DOGE Rally Gains Strength as Key Level Holds Dogecoin is regaining bullish momentum after reclaiming a zone that has historically sparked major rallies. The bounce from around $0.22, combined with noticeable accumulation from larger holders, suggests building upward pressure. A possible golden cross is forming, with the 50-day moving average approaching a crossover above the 200-day—a classic sign of trend strength. If Dogecoin maintains this pace and secures $0.26 as firm support, analysts see potential for a run toward $0.46 or beyond. BlockDAG Turns Presale into a Full Trading Experience Before Launch Most early-stage projects only offer a promise: you buy early and wait. BlockDAG changes this approach completely by letting users experience a working trading environment long before exchange listings go live. Its Dashboard V4 is more than a preview; it simulates real market conditions with active tools. Inside the dashboard, users can open trades through functional BUY and SELL buttons, track live BDAG/USD charts, view an up-to-date order book, and see their wallets adjust instantly after each trade. This setup removes the usual guesswork of presales and replaces it with practical use. It allows participants to explore market trends, price shifts, and trade behavior firsthand, making the experience interactive instead of static. BlockDAG’s growth numbers highlight its strong traction. It has already raised $362.5 million, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% ROI from the first batch. But the real game-changer is the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, where, until August 11, buyers can access BDAG at only $0.0016. Based on the listing price of $0.05, this limited price could deliver 3,025% returns. What makes this opportunity stand out is not only the low entry point but also the ability to use a live trading setup before launch day. It builds trust and confidence, letting users practice and prepare ahead of time while securing their position before prices return to normal after August 11. For anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG sets a new standard, combining early access pricing with real-time utility that no other presale is offering. Which Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now? Tron’s chart structure is showing pressure toward a breakout, and Dogecoin is rebuilding its rally momentum. But both depend on future price confirmations to prove their setups. BlockDAG offers something different: it gives users full access to live trading tools today, before listings go live. With real-time price tracking, functional trade execution, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG delivers real utility now. For those choosing where to put their focus in this market, this early, hands-on experience sets BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to invest in now, combining active engagement with massive early access potential.

The current market trend is favoring choices that offer true use, actual utility, or potential growth. Instead of chasing trends, people are turning to assets showing long-term value. From cashback wallets changing fee structures to Layer 2s signaling a breakout, there’s real energy behind these names. This list of top-rated cryptos in 2025 includes projects addressing key pain points, like gas costs, privacy, and scaling, and shows why these assets are gaining attention in Q3. Cold Wallet, MNT, XMR, and NEAR each bring specific strengths, making it worth taking a closer look. Here’s why they’re considered top-rated cryptos in 2025. 1. Cold Wallet: Turning Every Fee Into a Reward Cold Wallet redefines how users interact with fees, changing typical charges into chances to earn. Gas fees, bridge costs, and swap charges are turned into cashback rewards through CWT, the core currency of the platform. Whether sending crypto, swapping, or bridging, users earn CWT. And the more CWT you keep in your wallet, the higher your cashback, starting at 10% and going up to 100%. No lock-ins or staking are needed, just hold and earn. This approach brings fairness to crypto use. The presale of CWT began at $0.00942 and follows a 150-stage pricing system where the price increases with each stage. Over $5.7 million has been raised so far, with more than 683 million coins sold. Currently in stage 16, Cold Wallet also gives referral bonuses: 10% for those who share and 5% for the ones they invite, all under a clear vesting plan. What really makes Cold Wallet stand out is not just rewards, but how it changes expectations. It’s built for real usage with zero gas overhead and a simple interface. In a space where most platforms take more than they give, Cold Wallet reverses the flow. That’s why it’s a top-rated crypto in 2025 for those who value practical use and fair returns. 2. MNT: Layer 2 Upgrade With Traction Mantle (MNT) isn’t just another token with price buzz; it’s showing progress with its UR beta utility layer, active until August 8. MNT aims to build a modular Ethereum Layer 2 that supports scalable apps and offers users relief from congestion and high costs. This cleaner setup is already pulling attention. Trading near $0.76 as of July 29, 2025, MNT recently dipped from its earlier high of $0.85. Still, technical indicators suggest a possible continued upward move, especially if it holds above the 200-day EMA. Analysts place year-end predictions between $0.79 and $1.38, based on development speed and adoption. With real structure, dependable tokenomics, and visible developer activity, MNT fits right into any list of top-rated cryptos in 2025. 3. XMR: A Consistent Name in Privacy-Focused Crypto Monero (XMR) continues to lead when it comes to privacy features. As of July 29, XMR is priced near $315 after reaching a recent high of $324. There were some concerns around mining power centralization with Qubic, but the quick release of version 0.18.4.1 “Fluorine Fermi” on July 25 helped address that and reaffirmed Monero’s commitment to decentralization. Outlooks for XMR remain positive. Conservative estimates predict an end-of-year target near $420, while some projections go as high as $670–$688 if the current pace continues. Monero stays relevant by focusing on privacy at a time when digital tracking is a rising concern. For those seeking real protection instead of just trend-driven DeFi plays, XMR still holds its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025. 4. NEAR: Technical Support and User Growth NEAR Protocol has kept steady performance across July with several price movements drawing attention. From July 24 to 25, NEAR jumped 6.9%, rising from $2.61 to $2.79, and has since corrected slightly to around $2.70. Despite the cooldown, trading signals still favor accumulation and a possible breakout. NEAR keeps building tools and attracting outside support, making it one of the few projects with both retail and institutional interest. Forecasts for August suggest a climb to $3.12–$3.27, and extended projections stretch toward $5.22 by 2026 if momentum continues. With new features rolling out and usage growing, NEAR earns its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025 for those chasing stable growth. Final Thoughts When evaluating top-rated cryptos in 2025, Cold Wallet stands out for turning routine fees into benefits and offering a smoother experience with fair rewards. MNT is proving itself through ongoing network upgrades and staying above key technical support levels. XMR remains unmatched for privacy, backed by strong community action and consistent price action. NEAR shows strength in both price structure and user adoption. Each of these picks has proven itself beyond short-term hype. They offer tools, functions, or structures that align with what today’s crypto user wants. If you’re mapping out your strategy, include these four in your watchlist of top-rated cryptos in 2025 . Not only are they making moves now, but their setups suggest they could still deliver much more ahead.

Solana, XRP Traders Rotate Into MAGACOIN FINANCE",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-to-5-solana-xrp-traders-rotate-into-magacoin-finance/,"As major altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP continue to consolidate near key technical levels, a shift is quietly happening beneath the surface. Traders and analysts alike are watching closely—but not just for a breakout in the usual names. Increasingly, smart money is rotating into lesser-known but high-conviction plays, including a decentralized political memecoin that’s quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With long-term optimism intact for the majors, short-term capital is flowing into projects offering sharper upside and stronger community traction—especially those with built-in cultural appeal and strategic momentum. Cardano’s $5 Ambition Gains Ground—but Momentum Is Slow Cardano has re-entered the spotlight after rebounding from recent lows, now gaining traction thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Its $71 million governance vote—backing enhancements like the Hydra scalability protocol and Acropolis node overhaul—signaled Cardano’s intent to accelerate decentralization. Developer activity is also ramping up, with the Midnight sidechain attracting serious attention ahead of the much-anticipated Glacier airdrop. Analysts say Cardano could test $0.81 resistance soon, and if it clears that threshold, a broader move toward the $5 zone may finally begin taking shape. XRP and Solana Still Bullish—But Risk Rotation Is Real XRP continues to show strength despite regulatory distractions. A brewing falling wedge pattern has technical traders on alert, with price targets pushing above $3.75 if breakout conditions are met. But Ripple’s ongoing licensing roadblocks and banking opposition have added uncertainty to the short-term outlook. Solana is showing clearer momentum. After recovering from a sharp dip, SOL now trades near resistance with analysts watching the $174 breakout level. Institutional interest remains strong, especially as Coinbase expands support for Solana-based DeFi and NFT tools. But even as XRP and SOL build solid bases, they’re starting to feel like slow burners. This has opened the door for capital to chase more agile plays—especially those with social buzz, ideological pull, and long-term infrastructure plans. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshine XRP This Quarter? While Cardano continues its slow march toward the $5 mark, and traders watch XRP and Solana build momentum without clear breakout signals, a new trend is emerging: capital rotation into high-upside altcoins with stronger cultural relevance and community-driven growth. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE—a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin—is gaining attention as the asset of choice for those seeking faster ROI. With sentiment cooling around slower-moving majors, MAGACOIN has become a focal point for traders projecting major upside potential in the next leg of the market cycle. Many early participants believe its unique positioning, combined with growing investor momentum, could support exponential returns—some projecting gains that rival or exceed 16,700%—as interest accelerates ahead of broader access and listings. Final Thoughts: W/hy Strategic Entry Matters Now The broader crypto market is once again showing signs of life—but the next leg of the bull cycle may reward agility over patience. While Cardano, XRP, and Solana remain foundational plays for long-term portfolios, early entrants into high-conviction narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for upside before the rest of the market catches on. The entry window remains open. But the conversation is clearly shifting—and investors looking for what’s next are already watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely.

In a post, the MSS described a case in which a foreign firm offered crypto token rewards to scan users' irises around the world. The company later transferred the biometric data abroad, raising concerns about both personal data privacy and national security. While the company wasn’t named, the description closely matches Worldcoin, the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which exchanges tokens for iris scans in a bid to build a global identity network. The project has already faced regulatory pushback in Germany, France , and Kenya , CoinDesk previously reported, where concerns have been raised over informed consent, data storage, and surveillance potential. Beijing's advisory goes further, citing other cases where stolen facial data has allegedly been used by foreign intelligence services to deepfake identities, allowing spies to infiltrate secure locations. Worldcoin's WLD token is trading for 93 cents, down 4%, according to CoinDesk market data .

The now-bankrupt FTX claims that the funds were “improperly transferred” by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to Bloomberg Law , CZ claimed that he’s a resident of the United Arab Emirates and that the FTX trust can’t claim it is within Delaware’s jurisdiction. “The complaint does not establish general jurisdiction because it does not allege that Mr. Zhao is ‘at home’ in Delaware,” Zhao said in a motion to dismiss filed on Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Further, he emphasized that the claims have minimal relevance to the US and that the regulations involved have no “extraterritorial application.” FTX Wants to Recoup $1.76B From Binance: Here’s Why In November 2024, FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance exchange and its founder CZ. FTX sought to recover $1.76 billion from Binance, claiming it was transferred as part of a fraudulent transaction. FTX has sued @binance and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance for $1.8B, alleging fraudulent dealings that damaged its stability. #FTX #Binance https://t.co/WaIpSYlx4v — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2024 The $1.76 billion transaction was a 2021 share purchase agreement that Binance made with FTX, which the latter claims was fraudulent due to its insolvency at the time. A Binance spokesperson said at the time that the exchange would defend itself against the “meritless” claims. This isn’t the first time Binance has filed a motion to dismiss FTX’s $1.76 billion clawback suit. A similar court paper submitted in May to a Delaware judge noted that the beleaguered company attempted to hold Binance accountable for FTX’s crash, and “shift the blame” away from Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX “Nonsensically Blame” CZ And Binance The Monday motion read that the FTX trust “nonsensically blame” CZ and Binance for Bankman-Fried’s “pervasive malfeasance”. “The claims are in any event legally unfounded, and many are outright incoherent,” it added. Further, Zhao said that the constructive fraud claims don’t meet legal requirements that permit “qualifying transactions” linked to a securities contract under federal law. CZ pled guilty to US anti-money laundering violations and served four months in prison . Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of several offences, including fraud and conspiracy.

The price is now trading below $2.980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3.060 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to continue higher above the $3.10 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the comments Tuesday during the firm’s second-quarter earnings call . “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said. “The question now is which of the existing companies become monsters.” Favorable US Rules Fuel Growth in Crypto Treasury Firms Crypto treasury companies have gained momentum in recent quarters, especially as US regulatory conditions have become more favorable. These firms raise capital in public markets and allocate a portion or all of their reserves into digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain-based tokens. A growing list of public companies has adopted this approach. That includes Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), GameStop, Trump Media & Technology Group, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital. Their holdings span Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Litecoin. Ethereum already has two major corporate treasury holders, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Novogratz expects both to keep expanding but warned that new entrants may “have a harder time getting oxygen” as the space becomes more saturated. Novogratz Sees Recurring Revenue From Treasury Partnerships Galaxy Digital manages crypto holdings for more than 20 treasury-focused firms. The company earns fees for overseeing these assets, which now total around $2b on its platform. Novogratz described it as “recurring income that will go on and on.” In May, Galaxy shifted its public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market. It now trades under the ticker symbol GLXY, marking a strategic move to deepen its US footprint. @galaxyhq has explored the tokenization of its $GLXY shares and reported a 43% drop in total assets to $6.3 billion in Q2. #GLXY #Tokenization https://t.co/2go2wQ7tLn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The company also disclosed in a SEC filing that it is exploring tokenization of its publicly traded shares . That initiative forms part of Galaxy’s broader effort to expand into blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Founded in 2018, Galaxy Digital offers a wide range of crypto-focused services, including asset management, trading, investment banking and infrastructure solutions. It targets institutional clients looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Novogratz suggested the market’s attention is turning away from the influx of new treasury players. Instead, focus is shifting to which existing firms will scale meaningfully in the next phase of the cycle.

What to Know Dogecoin fell 5% over the 24-hour session from August 4 at 21:00 to August 5 at 20:00, declining from $0.21 to $0.20. The token traded within a $0.013 range, with lows of $0.198 and highs of $0.211. A key liquidation event occurred during the 14:00 hour on August 5, with volumes reaching 877.9 million — nearly 4x the 24-hour average of 268.85 million — triggering a breakdown below $0.205. DOGE ended the session at $0.1985 after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, signaling continued institutional selling and confirming new downside momentum. The move comes amid broader crypto market weakness triggered by risk-off sentiment across global equities. News Background DOGE’s decline coincided with institutional outflows from crypto-linked ETFs totaling $223 million over the past week, per CoinShares data. Federal Reserve hawkishness and renewed geopolitical concerns — including retaliatory tariffs and commodity flow disruptions — have fueled risk aversion across both traditional and crypto markets. At the same time, the meme coin sector remains under pressure as retail enthusiasm fades and large holders continue to rotate into higher-beta altcoins or cash positions. DOGE had previously shown signs of accumulation last week, but failure to hold the $0.205 level invalidated the setup. Price Action Summary DOGE began the session strong, hitting $0.211 at 01:00, but reversed sharply through the day. The steepest decline occurred at 14:00, when price dropped from $0.205 to $0.199 amid 877.9 million in volume. By 19:51, another flush to $0.1975 occurred on 19.04 million volume — more than 70x the hourly average — before a shallow bounce to $0.1985 into the close. New resistance has formed near $0.205, with price unable to sustain any recovery above that level following the breakdown. The token currently trades near session lows and shows no confirmation of a reversal. Technical Analysis DOGE traded within a 6% range between $0.198 and $0.211 Volume spiked to 877.9 million at 14:00, nearly 4x above daily average Rejection at $0.205 triggered mid-session breakdown Support attempted at $0.198-$0.199, but volume on bounce remained weak Final hour saw 19.04M volume burst at $0.1975 level, creating local resistance at $0.1988 Momentum remains to the downside unless price reclaims $0.205 on convincing volume What Traders Are Watching Traders are closely watching whether DOGE can stabilize above $0.198 or face further downside toward $0.185. Failure to recover above $0.205 may extend liquidations. With volumes spiking on down moves and fading on recoveries, sellers remain in control unless macro risk sentiment improves or ETF outflows reverse.",Markets|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-06 04:24:23

The world of cryptocurrency investment is always buzzing, and recent data has certainly captured attention. On August 5, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable combined net outflow of $196.2 million. This marks the fourth consecutive trading day of such outflows, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment within the digital asset space. What Triggered These Significant Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the fourth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 5 paints a clear picture. Investors pulled a substantial amount from these popular investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Let’s look at the specifics of these significant movements: Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows, seeing $99.1 million exit its coffers. BlackRock’s IBIT followed, experiencing $77.4 million in outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed, with $19.7 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting the outflows were concentrated in a few key players. How Do These Outflows Impact the Crypto Market? These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows naturally raise questions about their broader implications for the crypto market . While a single day or even a few days of outflows don’t necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend, they do reflect immediate investor behavior and market sentiment. Such movements can contribute to short-term price volatility for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Understanding the reasons behind these shifts is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after periods of gains. Macroeconomic concerns: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, including digital asset holdings. Regulatory developments: Any news or speculation regarding cryptocurrency regulation can influence investor confidence. Market volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market itself can prompt some investors to seek safer havens. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Funds and ETF Performance? The recent figures provide a snapshot of current ETF performance for some of the largest digital asset funds . While the overall trend for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception has been positive, periods of outflows are a natural part of any investment cycle. They serve as a reminder that even established investment vehicles linked to cryptocurrencies are subject to market dynamics. For investors, it’s important to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. These outflows highlight the need for continued monitoring of: Institutional interest: Are large institutions still accumulating or are they pulling back? Retail participation: How are individual investors reacting to market movements? Underlying Bitcoin fundamentals: The strength of Bitcoin’s network and adoption remains a key factor. This data provides valuable insight into how capital is flowing in and out of the regulated crypto investment space. Looking Ahead: Navigating the Crypto Market The recent outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a significant event, but they are just one piece of the larger crypto market puzzle. For investors, the key is to remain informed and adopt a measured approach. While headlines about large outflows can seem daunting, they are often part of a healthy market’s ebb and flow. Consider these actionable insights: Stay informed: Continuously track data from reliable sources like Farside Investors. Diversify: Don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket. Long-term perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of digital assets rather than daily price swings. Risk assessment: Understand your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a timely reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. By understanding the underlying factors and maintaining a clear perspective, investors can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to buy, store, or secure the actual cryptocurrency. 2.

The specific causes can be complex, but common reasons for such Bitcoin ETF outflows include investor profit-taking, reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions, shifts in crypto market sentiment, or responses to regulatory news affecting digital asset funds . 3. How do these outflows affect the overall crypto market? While not solely indicative of the entire market’s health, significant outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. They also reflect investor confidence and can influence sentiment across the broader crypto market . 4. Is this a long-term trend for digital asset funds? It is too early to determine if this is a long-term trend. Outflows are a normal part of fund management and ETF performance . Investors should monitor subsequent trading days and broader market conditions to assess whether this represents a sustained shift or a temporary adjustment. 5.

The world of digital assets is always buzzing with activity, and recent developments in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs market have certainly captured attention. On August 5th, these investment vehicles witnessed a significant turnaround, recording a combined net inflow of $73.3 million. This positive shift follows two consecutive days of net outflows, sparking renewed optimism among investors and analysts tracking institutional crypto adoption. What Drove These Impressive Ethereum ETF Inflows? This notable surge in investment highlights a dynamic period for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs . Data from Farside Investors indicates a clear preference for certain funds, even as others experienced outflows. Understanding which ETFs attracted the most capital provides crucial insight into market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the key players and their performance on August 5th: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the charge by a significant margin, attracting a remarkable $88.8 million in new capital. Its strong performance suggests growing confidence in BlackRock’s offerings. VanEck’s ETHV: Adding to the positive momentum, VanEck’s ETF saw $5.2 million in inflows. This indicates broader interest beyond just the largest players. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: With $3.6 million in inflows, ARK 21Shares also contributed positively to the overall net figure. Grayscale’s Funds: In contrast, Grayscale’s mini ETH and ETHE experienced net outflows of $13.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. These outflows suggest some investors may be rebalancing their portfolios or moving to newer, potentially lower-fee products. The remaining ETH ETF products reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining their existing positions. Why Are These U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF Movements Significant for the Crypto Market? The return to net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it reflects evolving institutional crypto adoption and potential shifts in broader crypto market trends .

Market Stability: Increased institutional participation can contribute to greater market stability and liquidity. Future Growth: It sets a precedent for continued growth and further integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios. The fact that major players like BlackRock are seeing such strong interest in their Ethereum ETF inflows is a powerful indicator for the future of digital asset investing.

On-chain data now points to a possible ETH short squeeze if Ether climbs above $4,000, while $5.6 billion in BTC shorts could be liquidated if Bitcoin breaks out above $125,000. These aggressive trades are setting up a critical juncture for the entire market, raising new questions about XRP’s next move and opening the door for high-upside altcoins. As investors brace for crypto market volatility for ETH, BTC, XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new contender, attracting attention for its potential 39x gains in Q3. Massive Short Positions on ETH and BTC ETH and BTC short positions in 2025 are near peak levels. According to CoinGlass, nearly $331 million in short positions on ETH would be wiped out by an ETH short squeeze above $4,000. Most of these positions are stacked just below recent resistance—any breakout could force shorts to cover, fueling rapid price spikes. For Bitcoin, Bitget data shows more than $5.6 billion in short positions on BTC could face liquidation if Bitcoin moves past $125,000. This amount of exposure makes the current market a “ticking time bomb.” A breach of the $120K–$122K resistance could spark a massive BTC short squeeze, forcing shorts to exit and creating a swift upside move. Traders are closely watching what happens if BTC shorts get liquidated, knowing the ripple effects could hit altcoins across the board. Ripple XRP Faces Market Shockwaves Ripple’s XRP price has dropped below $3 in the last 24 hours, impacted by both Bitcoin’s moves and its own surge in futures activity. Binance reports XRP futures open interest at a record $3.9 billion, with 50.77% of positions now short. This heavy shorting leaves XRP vulnerable to rapid swings and makes the next direction hard to predict. If Bitcoin and Ethereum trigger a squeeze, the impact of BTC and ETH shorts on XRP could create outsized moves in XRP’s price. Market watchers are split—will XRP crash if Bitcoin drops, or could it rebound sharply if the shorts unwind? XRP market shockwaves are likely either way, as crypto market volatility (ETH, BTC, and XRP) is fueling wild swings across the sector. The best strategy for XRP during market crash conditions may be to watch resistance levels after a BTC dump and prepare for sharp reversals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is The Coin To Watch Now? MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum among investors seeking returns beyond major cap volatility. As short selling affects XRP and other blue chips, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new high-upside option for traders seeking Q3 growth. Whale accumulation, social buzz, and trading volume are all surging, with analysts tipping the project for up to 39x gains in the current quarter. Part of the appeal is its community-driven structure and resistance to the wild swings seen in ETH and BTC.

Crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital unstaked a massive 250,000 SOL, valued at an impressive $40.7 million, and promptly moved it to the Binance Exchange. This notable SOL Binance transfer occurred just hours ago, as reported by Lookonchain on X, citing precise data from Solscan. Such a considerable movement of assets from a major player like Galaxy Digital often sparks considerable discussion and speculation within the market. What Does This SOL Binance Transfer Signify? When a firm like Galaxy Digital executes a large SOL transaction of this magnitude, it typically indicates a strategic maneuver. Unstaking assets frees them from locking periods, making them liquid and available for various purposes. These purposes might include preparing for a sale, rebalancing portfolios, or even facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals that bypass immediate market impact. However, a direct deposit to an exchange like Binance often suggests an intention to increase liquidity on the platform, potentially for trading activities. This action by Galaxy Digital is not just a simple transfer; it is a clear signal of their active management of their Solana holdings. It underscores the dynamic nature of institutional participation in the crypto space, where large entities constantly adjust their positions based on market conditions and strategic objectives. Analyzing the Large SOL Transaction and Market Implications The immediate question following such a substantial large SOL transaction is its potential effect on Solana’s price. While a direct deposit to an exchange does not automatically mean a sell-off, it does increase the available supply on the exchange. If these SOL tokens were to be sold, it could create temporary selling pressure on the market. However, it is also possible that Galaxy Digital is using Binance for liquidity provision, derivatives trading, or other strategic financial operations that do not involve immediate liquidation. Observing the market’s reaction in the hours and days following this transfer will provide clearer insights. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring Solana’s price action and overall trading volume on Binance to gauge the true intent behind this significant deposit. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking Solana’s ecosystem. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity and Solana Market Impact This move by Galaxy Digital perfectly exemplifies typical crypto whale activity . Whales, or large holders of cryptocurrency, possess the power to influence market dynamics through their substantial transactions. Their actions are often seen as indicators of broader market sentiment or upcoming trends. When a whale unstakes and deposits assets to an exchange, it creates a ripple effect, prompting other market participants to analyze the potential reasons and consequences. The ultimate Solana market impact from this specific deposit will depend on subsequent actions. If a significant portion of the deposited SOL is sold, we might see downward price pressure. Conversely, if it is held or used for other purposes, the impact could be minimal or even positive, indicating institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term prospects. This event serves as a reminder of how crucial it is to monitor the on-chain movements of major players in the crypto world. What Should Investors Watch For? Price Action: Monitor SOL’s price performance on Binance and other major exchanges. Significant dips could suggest selling. Volume Changes: Look for unusually high trading volumes for SOL, which might accompany large buy or sell orders. Further Transfers: Keep an eye on Solscan for any additional large movements from Galaxy Digital or other institutional wallets. News & Announcements: Stay updated on any official statements from Galaxy Digital that might clarify their intentions. In conclusion, the recent Galaxy Digital SOL deposit of $40.7 million into Binance is a notable development in the Solana ecosystem. While the immediate implications remain speculative, this large SOL transaction highlights the ongoing crypto whale activity and its potential Solana market impact . It underscores the strategic maneuvers of institutional players like Galaxy Digital, reminding us of the importance of vigilance in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Staying informed about such significant transfers is key to navigating the volatile crypto markets effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Galaxy Digital’s role in this SOL transfer? Galaxy Digital is a prominent crypto financial services firm. Their role in this transfer was to unstake 250,000 SOL and deposit it into the Binance Exchange, indicating active management of their crypto assets. Why did Galaxy Digital deposit SOL into Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly stated, depositing to an exchange like Binance typically suggests increasing liquidity for potential trading, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. How does a large SOL transaction affect the Solana market? A large SOL transaction, especially a deposit to an exchange, can increase the available supply. If these tokens are sold, it could create temporary selling pressure. However, if held or used for other purposes, the market impact might be minimal or even positive. What is “crypto whale activity”? “Crypto whale activity” refers to the significant transactions made by individuals or entities holding a large amount of cryptocurrency. These movements are closely watched as they can influence market sentiment and price trends due to their sheer volume. Should investors be concerned about this SOL movement? Investors should remain informed but avoid immediate panic. Such movements are part of institutional asset management. It’s crucial to monitor subsequent market reactions, such as price action and trading volume, rather than assuming an immediate sell-off. Did you find this analysis helpful?

In 2025, these offers are not judged by big numbers alone, but by how fast players can access their winnings and how clear the rules are. Players now prefer sites that give bonuses they can actually use and cash out, without hidden terms. This article ranks the best crypto casino bonus offers this year, focusing on clear rules, payout time, and overall user experience. Spartans ranks highest for giving rewards that are easy to understand and quick to claim. Spartans: Top-Rated Bonus Offers for Fast Crypto Payouts Spartans is the best crypto casino for bonuses in 2025. It gives large welcome rewards, frequent deposit boosts, and quick crypto withdrawals in one easy setup. The biggest difference at Spartans is how simple everything is. First-time users get a 300% bonus on casino and sports betting with only a $5 minimum deposit. Bonus terms are shown clearly, including how wagering works, which games qualify, and any payout rules. There are no confusing limits or hidden rules in the small text. Players know what to expect and how to use each offer. Regular users also benefit from ongoing deposit bonuses. A 25% bonus is available every day on both casino and sports deposits. These offers are simple to activate, process quickly, and lead to real crypto earnings. Whether you play slots or place bets on sports, these bonuses are made to be used, not just advertised. With games that load quickly, many supported cryptos, and a smooth user layout, Spartans gives players a bonus setup that saves time and avoids confusion. Unlike most other sites, winnings from bonuses at Spartans are available for withdrawal right after meeting the rules. This makes Spartans the most trusted and useful crypto bonus program in 2025. Stake.com: Bigger Bonuses, Slower to Unlock Stake.com continues to be a top option for crypto players, and its reward system reflects its strong user base. New users get a matched deposit bonus, while current users can access regular challenges, VIP perks, and prize events. Still, the bonuses on Stake come with higher wagering terms than those on Spartans. Players often have to complete several steps before their rewards are fully released. This setup can reduce the appeal for users who want quick and simple benefits. While Stake stands out among the best crypto casino options, the path to withdrawing bonus winnings is not the fastest. Roobet: Bold Promotions with Some Limits Roobet promotes itself with big signup bonuses and themed offers connected to featured games and events. The site often runs active bonus programs, but how these bonuses work can be unclear. The playthrough rules are sometimes detailed, and bonuses may expire fast or be limited to certain games. Loyal players benefit from cashback and tournaments, but for first-time users, the real value may fall short of what the ads suggest. Roobet may appeal to experienced users who understand the terms, but for those new to crypto casinos, Spartans or Stake may offer a smoother experience among the best crypto casino platforms. BC.Game: Custom Bonus Options with Some Trade-Offs BC.Game provides a large range of promos aimed at crypto users, such as spin-based rewards, tiered bonuses, and offers linked to specific tokens. The site lets users choose how they want their rewards delivered, which adds flexibility. Still, many of the promotions are tied to the platform’s own token. This may not suit users who prefer using well-known cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Bonus withdrawal times also change based on what offer is used. For those who like to personalize their rewards, BC.Game offers variety. But it doesn’t provide the fast, direct bonus experience seen with Spartans, which sets the pace among the best crypto casino choices. Betano: Local Bonus Strength, Global Gaps Remain Betano offers strong bonus deals in selected regions, especially across Europe and Latin America. These include welcome rewards, no-risk bets, and reload offers designed for specific markets. While bonus amounts are solid in those areas, the platform does not offer full crypto support across all locations. Payout times are fair but not fast, with many withdrawals needing manual review. For users looking for faster service and crypto freedom, Betano may feel limited outside its core regions, especially when compared to the best crypto casino options. 888Casino: Well-Known Brand, Classic Bonus Style 888Casino is trusted by many and provides a safe playing space, but its bonus system sticks to a more standard setup. New members can get a matched deposit bonus, and there are rotating daily rewards and VIP benefits for long-term users. Though crypto payment choices are growing, bonus programs are still mainly set around fiat. This brings slower payouts, manual checks for bonus use, and limited ways to take out winnings from bonus rewards. While steady and trusted, 888Casino has not yet built the kind of crypto-first reward system seen on the best crypto casino platforms. Final Thoughts In 2025, bonus offers are judged by how simple and fast they are to use. Players now want rewards they can track, unlock, and withdraw without problems. Spartans stands out for clear terms, easy daily boosts, and fast crypto payouts. Other choices like Stake.com and Roobet still hold value, but include more rules and slower access. For users focused on the best crypto casino reward programs, Spartans offers the strongest and clearest path to real payouts.

Experts Weigh XRP vs Ethereum in Long-Term Outlook,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-100-by-2025-experts-weigh-xrp-vs-ethereum-in-long-term-outlook/,"The XRP community is excited once again, and for good reason. With a string of bullish developments unfolding and mainstream adoption growing, many traders are now asking the big question: Can XRP actually hit $100 in 2025? While it sounds far-fetched, one thing is clear—there’s serious momentum building behind this prediction. As the XRP buzz gets louder, some early traders are already pivoting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new DeFi token that investors are hoping to catch the next big breakout before it goes mainstream. What’s Driving the XRP Hype? XRP’s history has been anything but boring. After years of battling the SEC in court, Ripple’s fortunes appear to be shifting. A possible XRP ETF is now one of the hottest topics in the crypto space. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gives it the green light, it could open the floodgates for institutional money—just like what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The most explosive long-term catalyst lies in global bank adoption. XRP’s speed and low fees make it a strong candidate to replace the SWIFT system, which has remained largely unchanged for decades. If financial institutions begin using XRP to process cross-border transactions, trillions could flow through the network, putting enormous upward pressure on price. Ethereum’s Strong Rebound Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the altcoin space. ETH is trading around $3,600. From its June lows, ETH has surged 78%, now boasting a $427.09B market cap with $22.13B in daily volume. Technical indicators show bullish momentum. ETH is pushing past resistance at the current levels. A break above $3,700 could open the path toward $4,500-$7,000 in the coming months. MAGACOIN FINANCE Traders Target Gains While the spotlight shines on XRP and Ethereum, early traders are quietly flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap DeFi project with big ambitions. With its tokenomics designed for exponential growth, many believe it could deliver 20,300% gains—mirroring early-stage breakouts like Shiba Inu or Pepe. The token’s fundamentals include a strong focus on yield generation, decentralized tools, and integration with emerging altcoin ecosystems. As crypto markets rotate into higher-risk, high-reward assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next major breakout. Timing might be everything—and early birds are already circling. Final Thoughts So, can XRP hit $100 by 2025? The odds are steep, but the ingredients are there: institutional demand, real-world use cases, and growing legitimacy. Traders eyeing better returns are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that today’s low-cap DeFi projects might deliver XRP-like gains before the big players catch on.

Over the past week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has declined by nearly 4%, trading at $113,993 at the time of writing. This represents a drop of approximately 7.2% from the peak price of above $123,000 reached in July. The decline has sparked renewed discussion among analysts about the asset’s current price discovery phase and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto Bitcoin Price Discovery and the Potential for Q4 Gains CryptoQuant analyst Oinonen shared his latest assessment of Bitcoin’s market performance, noting that while the recent pullback appears significant, it primarily reflects technical market conditions. In his post on the QuickTake platform, he explained that a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, technical indicators turning bearish, and liquidation events has contributed to the decline. However, he described the ongoing situation as a “technical correction” within Bitcoin’s longer-term bullish structure. Despite the short-term weakness, analysts remain focused on Bitcoin’s price discovery process. This phase, according to Oinonen, is essential in establishing the asset’s fair market value as supply and demand interact in the market. Following the all-time high of $123,400 on July 14, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating, potentially setting the stage for further upward movement later in the year. “Bitcoin has historically performed well in the fourth quarter,” Oinonen noted, suggesting that a return to its previous peak and even a potential move toward $200,000 could be on the horizon if historical patterns hold. Additionally, the analyst pointed to Binance’s high stablecoin reserves as a factor that may influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. These reserves represent capital that could flow into Bitcoin and other digital assets if market sentiment improves. A positive shift in buying activity, combined with Bitcoin’s reflexive market behavior, could support further gains, although the extent to which this would benefit altcoins remains uncertain.

Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support Caution Over Negative Coinbase Premium Signals While some market participants anticipate a possible rebound later this year, other analysts are urging caution. Another CryptoQuant contributor, known as BQYoutube, highlighted a recent change in the Coinbase Premium Index, a metric comparing prices on Coinbase versus other exchanges. Since June 30, the premium has shifted to negative, indicating weaker buying pressure from US-based investors. “Historically, stronger Bitcoin rallies have coincided with a positive Coinbase Premium,” BQYouTube wrote, suggesting that traders may want to wait for signs of renewed spot demand before expecting a sustainable uptrend.

Tron Has Just Seen Its Largest Profit-Taking Wave In Months In a new thread on X, Glassnode has discussed about the profit-taking spree that has just occurred on the Tron network. Over the last 24 hours, the Realized Profit has hit $1.4 billion, which is the second largest amount for 2025 so far. The “Realized Profit” here naturally refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of gain that TRX investors are realizing through their transactions. It works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to check what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value was less than the latest spot price for any token, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a profit realization equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this profit involved in all transfers occurring on the blockchain during a given day. An indicator known as the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. From the above table, it’s visible that this metric’s value has remained low for TRX, suggesting no capitulation has accompanied the profit-taking. While the latest spike in the Realized Profit is massive, it hasn’t come in isolation. As the below chart shows, the metric’s value has been elevated for Tron in the past few days. Since Saturday, the network has been seeing nearly $1 billion in profit-taking every day. “This marks the most sustained wave of realized profit for TRON in months,” notes the analytics firm. Now, the main question is, who are the investors responsible for this profit realization wave? The below chart answers the question, breaking down the Realized Profit for the various holder groups. The cohorts displayed here have been divided based on coin age . For example, investors who have been holding since between 1 week and 1 month ago are put in the 1w-1m band. It would appear that the 3y-5y band, corresponding to addresses holding since at least three years and at most five years ago, have made up for the majority of the recent Realized Profit spike. “This suggests participants from the 2020–2021 cycle are exiting into strength – a notable shift in behavior that could influence short-term market dynamics,” says Glassnode. TRX Price While most of the cryptocurrency sector has taken a hit during the past week, Tron is relatively unscathed as its price is still trading around $0.33.",Altcoins|Glassnode|tron|Tron Profit-Taking|trx|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 05:00:50

Local outlet Global Times reported Wednesday that the ministry outlined the growing risks tied to biometric technologies. It said recent cases have shown foreign intelligence agencies illegally harvesting facial data from targeted individuals to carry out espionage activities inside China. The ministry did not identify specific firms, but the description of the scheme closely mirrors the model used by World, the crypto startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. China's Ministry of State Security has publicly warned that a foreign company is using the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a gimmick to scan and collect user iris information worldwide and transfer the data source, posing a threat to personal information security and even… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 6, 2025 Crypto Token Incentives Used to Collect Iris Data, China Ministry Says World, formerly known as Worldcoin , offers crypto tokens in exchange for users’ iris scans. The company claims the scans help verify a user’s unique identity and enable digital financial access, particularly in underserved markets. However, World was not explicitly named in the MSS advisory. Cryptonews has reached out to World for comment on the matter. The ministry described a case in which a foreign company allegedly used the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a pretext to scan and collect iris data from users around the world. This data was then transferred overseas, according to the statement, raising red flags for national and individual security. Officials Link Biometric Data Leaks to National Security Threats Biometric identification technologies, the ministry noted, have gained rapid traction in recent years. Used for their speed and accuracy, these systems collect and process facial features, fingerprints, irises and even body movements. While these tools offer convenience, the ministry warned that the risk of data leaks and misuse has also grown significantly. Officials cited cases in which foreign spies forged biometric information to gain access to classified materials or infiltrate sensitive workplaces. In another example, a fingerprint payment system linked to a corporate database was repeatedly breached due to lax cybersecurity, resulting in major data leaks. Further, the ministry said that iris patterns are especially sensitive. They are highly stable and nearly impossible to replicate, making them valuable for authentication in high-security environments. Their uniqueness, however, also makes them a prime target for malicious actors, the ministry said. China Warns Citizens to Scrutinize Biometric Data Practices The warning comes as biometric systems continue to expand across sectors ranging from finance to border control. In this context, the ministry urged the public to remain cautious when handing over biometric data, especially for services involving facial, fingerprint or iris recognition. Citizens, the statement said, have the right to ask data collectors to explain how personal information will be stored, processed and used. The ministry also advised individuals to review privacy policies carefully and to stay alert for signs of excessive data collection.

Recently, a major crypto market participant made a substantial move, hinting at a bullish outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency. This activity often precedes notable price shifts, catching the attention of investors worldwide and sparking discussions about future market direction. Such large-scale movements by institutional players are closely watched indicators. What Do Recent ETH Withdrawals Signify for the Market? According to precise data from The Data Nerd on X, crypto market maker Cumberland executed a massive ETH withdrawal . Specifically, they moved 36,918 ETH, valued at an impressive $132.86 million, from Coinbase Exchange just hours ago. This kind of large-scale withdrawal from an exchange often indicates an intent to hold or use the assets for other purposes, rather than immediately selling them on the open market. This reduces the readily available supply on exchanges, which can support price stability or even upward pressure. Furthermore, another notable transaction occurred when crypto investment manager Abraxas Capital also withdrew 7,191 ETH, worth $25.97 million, from Binance Exchange. These combined movements are not coincidental; they reflect a strategic positioning by major players in the market. Such actions typically suggest confidence in future price appreciation and a proactive approach to capitalize on anticipated market shifts. These withdrawals are distinct from routine operational transfers, highlighting a deliberate strategy. Are Institutional Crypto Players Gearing Up for Growth? The collective actions of entities like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital highlight a growing trend: institutional crypto players are actively positioning themselves for what they perceive as significant market opportunities. These firms manage substantial capital and their moves often provide crucial insight into broader market sentiment. When they pull significant amounts of assets off exchanges, it can reduce immediate selling pressure and signal accumulation for long-term holding or strategic deployment. This behavior aligns strongly with the expectation that these large investors anticipate an upward price trajectory for Ethereum. They are not merely observing the market from the sidelines; they are actively participating in ways that could influence its direction. This strategic accumulation by well-informed entities is a key indicator for many retail investors looking for cues on where the market might be headed. It underscores a belief in Ethereum’s fundamental strength and its role in the evolving digital economy. The Critical Role of a Crypto Market Maker in Bull Runs Understanding the vital role of a crypto market maker is crucial when analyzing these withdrawals. Firms like Cumberland are essential to market liquidity, facilitating seamless trades between buyers and sellers. When a market maker withdraws such a large amount of ETH, it implies they might be engaging in several strategic actions: Long-Term Holding: Moving funds to an off-exchange cold storage wallet for secure, long-term holding, indicating a belief in sustained value growth. DeFi Deployment: Preparing to deploy these assets into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for yield generation or participation in new projects, which often requires assets to be off-exchange. Inventory Management: Anticipating increased demand and thus reducing their exchange holdings to manage inventory more efficiently, preparing to sell at higher prices rather than dumping. Each of these scenarios points towards a positive outlook for Ethereum’s price. Market makers typically operate with sophisticated analytical models, and their significant moves are rarely arbitrary. Their actions are often a leading indicator of impending market shifts, suggesting that they foresee a significant Ethereum rally . Implications for Coinbase ETH Supply and Beyond The large withdrawal from Coinbase ETH reserves by Cumberland is particularly noteworthy due to Coinbase’s standing. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, frequently favored by institutional clients for its security and compliance. A substantial outflow from such a platform can have ripple effects, potentially reducing the readily available supply on exchanges and thus supporting price increases through basic supply-demand dynamics. This trend, coupled with similar movements from other major exchanges like Binance, paints a clear picture. Institutional investors and market makers appear to be preparing for the next significant upward movement in Ethereum’s price. Their actions suggest a strong belief in the asset’s fundamentals, its growing ecosystem, and its future growth potential. These strategic withdrawals are often a precursor to major market events, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. In conclusion, the recent substantial ETH withdrawals by major market participants like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital are strong indicators of an impending Ethereum rally . These strategic moves by institutional players and market makers suggest a collective anticipation of bullish momentum. As these large entities accumulate ETH and move it off exchanges, the market supply on exchanges decreases, potentially paving the way for upward price action. This is a moment where smart money appears to be making its move, signaling exciting times ahead for Ethereum and its vibrant ecosystem. Keeping an eye on these institutional flows can provide valuable insights for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of large ETH withdrawals from exchanges? Large ETH withdrawals often indicate that major investors or market makers intend to hold the assets for the long term, deploy them in DeFi, or are preparing for future demand. This reduces the supply available for immediate sale on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal for price. Q2: Who is Cumberland, and what is their role in the crypto market? Cumberland is a prominent crypto market maker. Their role is to provide liquidity by facilitating trades between buyers and sellers, helping to ensure smooth market operations. Their large transactions are often seen as indicators of institutional sentiment. Q3: Does institutional ETH withdrawal guarantee a price rally? While large institutional withdrawals are strong indicators of bullish sentiment and often precede price rallies, they do not guarantee a rally. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and price movements can be volatile. Q4: How do these movements affect the overall Ethereum supply? When large amounts of ETH are withdrawn from exchanges, it reduces the circulating supply readily available for trading on those platforms. This decrease in exchange supply, combined with potential increased demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price.

Just as Bitcoin and other digital assets react to global sentiment, so too do traditional currencies. Recently, the Asia FX Outlook has been a subject of keen interest, with many regional currencies experiencing slight weakening, while the Indian Rupee has staged a notable recovery from its recent record lows. This intriguing development is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) strategic decision to hold interest rates steady, providing a much-needed anchor in turbulent waters. But what exactly does this mean for the broader financial landscape, and how does it connect to the overarching themes of economic stability and growth? Decoding the Shifting Tides of Asia FX Outlook The past few weeks have seen a nuanced performance across Asian foreign exchange markets. While some currencies have shown resilience, others have succumbed to external pressures, reflecting the complex interplay of global economic forces. The general sentiment has been one of slight weakening across the board, influenced by factors such as a strong US dollar, rising commodity prices, and persistent inflation concerns. This broader trend sets the stage for understanding the individual performances within the region. External Pressures: A robust US dollar, fueled by expectations of continued hawkishness from the Federal Reserve, often puts downward pressure on emerging market currencies. Commodity Price Volatility: Fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices can significantly impact the trade balances of net importers or exporters in Asia, affecting their currency valuations. Inflationary Concerns: Rising inflation in various Asian economies prompts central banks to consider tighter monetary policies, which can attract or deter foreign investment based on interest rate differentials. Geopolitical Developments: Ongoing global events and geopolitical tensions contribute to uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets, often at the expense of riskier emerging market currencies. Despite these headwinds, the regional Asia FX Outlook remains a critical barometer for global economic health, with each currency’s movement telling a unique story of domestic policy and international influence. Indian Rupee Recovery: A Resilient Comeback Story Amidst the general weakening trend in Asia, the Indian Rupee Recovery stands out as a significant event. After touching a record low against the US dollar, the rupee has demonstrated remarkable resilience, bouncing back in a manner that has surprised many market observers. This recovery is not merely a statistical anomaly but a testament to underlying economic strengths and proactive policy measures. The rupee’s journey from its nadir has been closely watched. Several factors contributed to its initial decline, including a widening trade deficit, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows from Indian equities, and the broad strengthening of the US dollar. However, the recovery phase has been underpinned by: Strong Inflows: A resurgence of foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows, particularly into debt markets, has provided crucial support. Improved Economic Data: Positive domestic economic indicators, such as robust GDP growth figures and declining inflation (even if gradual), have bolstered investor confidence. RBI’s Intervention: The central bank’s strategic interventions in the forex market, including selling dollars from its reserves, have helped stabilize the currency. Export Performance: A healthy performance in key export sectors has helped narrow the trade deficit, reducing pressure on the rupee. This Indian Rupee Recovery highlights the dynamic nature of currency markets and the significant impact of both internal economic health and external market forces. RBI Monetary Policy: The Anchoring Force of Stability At the heart of the Indian Rupee’s recent stability and recovery lies the RBI Monetary Policy . The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% for the eighth consecutive time played a pivotal role in calming market jitters and providing a sense of predictability. This decision, announced after careful consideration of inflationary pressures and growth prospects, signals a cautious yet confident approach by the central bank. The RBI’s approach can be understood through these key points: Inflation Management: While inflation has shown signs of moderation, the RBI remains vigilant, aiming to bring it within its target range sustainably. Holding rates steady allows the central bank to assess the impact of previous rate hikes without stifling nascent economic growth. Growth Support: By not raising rates further, the RBI avoids adding to borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, thereby supporting economic expansion and investment. Exchange Rate Stability: A stable interest rate environment reduces interest rate volatility, which in turn helps stabilize the rupee. Predictable rates make India an attractive destination for foreign capital seeking reasonable returns. Global Cues: The RBI also considers global monetary policy trends, particularly those of major central banks like the US Federal Reserve. Aligning its policy helps prevent excessive capital outflows. The steadfastness of the RBI Monetary Policy demonstrates a commitment to balancing price stability with economic growth, a crucial factor in attracting and retaining foreign investment. Navigating Global Forex Trends and Their Local Impact The performance of Asian currencies, including the Indian Rupee, cannot be viewed in isolation. They are deeply intertwined with Global Forex Trends , which are influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from geopolitical tensions to shifts in major economies’ monetary policies. Understanding these broader trends is essential for grasping the local impact on currencies. Consider the following: Global Factor Impact on Asia FX Specific Effect on Rupee US Dollar Strength Puts downward pressure on most Asian currencies as capital flows to safe-haven assets. Increases import costs, widens trade deficit, puts depreciation pressure. Oil Price Fluctuations Net oil importers (e.g., India, Japan) face currency depreciation; exporters (e.g., Malaysia) see appreciation. Higher oil prices worsen current account deficit, increasing rupee vulnerability. China’s Economic Performance Significant impact on regional trade and investment flows, affecting currencies of trade partners. Slowdown in China can reduce demand for Indian exports, impacting rupee. Geopolitical Events Increases risk aversion, leading to capital flight from emerging markets. Can trigger sudden outflows, leading to sharp depreciation. The intricate dance of Global Forex Trends means that even strong domestic policies must contend with external headwinds. India’s ability to navigate these trends speaks volumes about its economic resilience and policy frameworks. Understanding Currency Market Volatility: What Drives the Swings? The very nature of foreign exchange markets is defined by Currency Market Volatility . Currencies are constantly in motion, responding to an endless stream of economic data, political developments, and market sentiment. For investors, understanding the drivers of this volatility is key to making informed decisions. Key drivers of currency fluctuations include: Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in one country relative to another can attract foreign capital, strengthening its currency. Economic Performance: Strong GDP growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation generally lead to a stronger currency, as the economy is perceived as healthy. Political Stability: Countries with stable political environments are often seen as safer investments, attracting capital and strengthening their currency. Conversely, political instability can lead to rapid depreciation. Trade Balances: A country with a persistent trade surplus (exports exceeding imports) tends to see its currency strengthen due to higher demand for its goods and services. Speculation: Large-scale speculative trading by financial institutions can significantly amplify currency movements, sometimes detached from economic fundamentals. While Currency Market Volatility presents risks, it also creates opportunities for investors who can accurately anticipate or react to these movements. The Indian Rupee’s recent journey is a prime example of how various factors converge to create significant shifts in value. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Landscape The current financial landscape, characterized by both global uncertainties and pockets of resilience, presents a mix of challenges and opportunities for investors and policymakers alike. Challenges: Sustained US Dollar Strength: The persistent strength of the US dollar continues to exert pressure on emerging market currencies, making imports more expensive and potentially fueling inflation. Global Inflationary Pressures: While some countries are seeing inflation cool, the risk of resurgence from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events remains. Capital Outflows: Higher interest rates in developed economies could lead to continued capital outflows from emerging markets, putting pressure on their currencies and equity markets. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing conflicts and trade tensions introduce uncertainty, deterring foreign investment and increasing market volatility. Opportunities: Resilient Domestic Demand: Economies with strong domestic consumption can cushion against global slowdowns, offering attractive investment opportunities. Policy Stability: Central banks like the RBI, demonstrating consistent and predictable monetary policy, enhance investor confidence and attract long-term capital. Diversification: For global investors, the performance of currencies like the Indian Rupee offers diversification benefits, especially if they show decoupling from broader negative trends. Technological Advancements: Digitalization and innovation in various sectors can drive productivity gains and attract investment, strengthening economic fundamentals. Navigating this complex environment requires a nuanced understanding of both macro-economic indicators and specific policy responses. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those looking to make sense of these currency dynamics, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from central banks like the RBI and the Federal Reserve. Their forward guidance on interest rates and inflation targets can provide crucial clues about future currency movements. Track Trade and Current Account Data: A country’s trade balance and current account deficit/surplus are strong indicators of its currency’s health. Improving figures often signal potential appreciation. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the Indian Rupee shows strength, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Consider Long-Term Fundamentals: Short-term volatility can be distracting. Focus on the long-term economic fundamentals of a country, such as GDP growth, fiscal health, and policy stability, when making investment decisions. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Geopolitical events can have swift and significant impacts on currency markets. Staying abreast of global news can help anticipate potential shifts. By applying these insights, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities presented by evolving currency markets. Conclusion: A Remarkable Recovery in a Volatile World The recent performance of the Asia FX Outlook , particularly the compelling Indian Rupee Recovery from its record lows, offers a fascinating case study in economic resilience and strategic central banking. The RBI Monetary Policy , characterized by its steady hand on interest rates, has proven instrumental in providing stability amidst a backdrop of fluctuating Global Forex Trends and persistent Currency Market Volatility . This delicate balance between supporting growth and managing inflation is a tightrope walk that the RBI has managed with notable success, instilling confidence in both domestic and international investors. While the broader Asian currencies faced slight headwinds, India’s economic fundamentals, coupled with timely policy interventions, allowed the rupee to chart a distinct and positive course. This remarkable comeback serves as a reminder that even in an interconnected global economy, strong domestic policies and robust economic indicators can provide a crucial buffer against external shocks. As we move forward, monitoring these trends will be vital for understanding the broader implications for investment, trade, and economic stability across the region.

Experts Split on Altcoin Market’s Next Move,https://cryptopotato.com/altseason-or-another-false-start-experts-split-on-altcoin-markets-next-move/,"Many experts have predicted the return of a long-awaited altcoin season. A declining share of Bitcoin dominance and sporadic outperformance in select altcoins have pointed to a subtle rotation into smaller, higher-risk assets, amidst growing appetite for the market. A recent report, however, casts doubt on the sustainability of an altcoin rally. Altcoin Rally Lacks Support Matrixport warned that it may once again fizzle out. Analyst Markus Thielen noted that, despite recurring calls for a new bull market, only two brief altcoin surges have occurred in recent memory. In fact, the most notable was in Q4 2024. These rallies, which saw temporary spikes in funding rates, lacked underlying fundamental support, which led to rapid reversals. As such, Thielen argued the current move mirrors previous patterns, with declining funding rates indicating that enthusiasm has already faded. The analyst added that the altcoin market remains structurally weak, and investors hoping for steady upside may be disappointed yet again. This comes as Bitcoin’s dominance briefly slipped near 60% which has historically preceded full altcoin seasons, where these tokens outperform BTC significantly. Certain data also pointed toward capital rotation, which further strengthened the narratives of an altseason. Conflicting Signals SwissBlock’s “Altcoin Vector” reported that the altcoin market is transitioning toward a potential breakout zone. It said that “smart capital” is rotating into positions before retail traders notice the shift. They highlighted that while momentum and market structure are improving, this is not yet a breakout; instead, it’s an early stage where informed investors begin pre-positioning for a possible future rally. This phase can offer strategic entry opportunities before broader market sentiment turns bullish and prices accelerate. Another market watcher argued that an altseason may soon begin based on USDT dominance, which has been stuck in a descending triangle pattern for nearly two years and now appears close to breaking down. A decline in USDT dominance typically suggests that traders are moving capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets like altcoins, thereby fueling broad altcoin rallies. As such, the market action seen so far has only been a warm-up, and a decisive breakdown in USDT dominance would trigger a strong shift of liquidity into altcoins, which could potentially spark a major altcoin bull run.

Recent data reveals a compelling trend: a select group of strategic firms are accumulating vast ETH reserves , signaling growing confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. This accumulation of Ethereum holdings by major players is a development every crypto enthusiast should know about, especially regarding the overall ETH supply . Unpacking the Scale of These ETH Reserves The combined ETH reserves held by 64 prominent firms have now surged past the 3 million ETH mark. Each of these firms holds more than 100 Ethereum, indicating a strategic long-term perspective. Specifically, these substantial holdings currently stand at approximately 3.04 million ETH, an impressive sum valued at over $10.87 billion. This substantial figure represents about 2.52% of the total ETH supply . Such a significant portion held by a relatively small number of entities highlights a concentrated interest in Ethereum’s future. Moreover, this trend suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s potential for continued growth, further solidifying the importance of these strategic Ethereum holdings . Who Leads the Charge in Institutional ETH Holdings? Delving deeper into these impressive figures, we find that nine of these firms individually hold more than 100,000 ETH. This concentration among a few key players is a testament to the scale of their investment strategies. The top three firms leading this charge in accumulating significant institutional ETH are particularly notable: Bitmine: Holding a staggering 833,100 ETH. SharpLink Gaming: Possessing a robust 521,900 ETH. The Ether Machine: With a substantial 345,400 ETH in its portfolio. These entities represent a significant portion of the overall crypto firm ETH on the market, showcasing a clear pattern of large-scale accumulation by strategic investors. Their actions often set a precedent for other market participants. Why Are These Ethereum Holdings So Significant? The accumulation of such large Ethereum holdings by these firms carries significant implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its long-term viability. When major crypto firm ETH allocations increase, it often indicates a bullish outlook and a belief in the future of the ETH supply . Secondly, these substantial ETH reserves can contribute to market stability. Large, long-term holders are less likely to engage in rapid selling, which can reduce volatility. Therefore, their presence helps to anchor the market, providing a foundation for organic growth. This strategic positioning suggests these firms are genuinely invested in the network’s success. What’s Next for Institutional ETH and the Market? The growing concentration of institutional ETH in the hands of a few large entities raises interesting questions about market dynamics. While it can reduce immediate selling pressure, it also means a significant portion of the ETH supply is not actively circulating. This can influence liquidity and price discovery in the long run. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Their decisions regarding these significant ETH reserves could have a ripple effect, impacting everything from network governance to future development initiatives. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the role of these major holders will undoubtedly remain a key area of focus for the entire crypto market. In conclusion, the substantial accumulation of over 3 million ETH by 64 strategic firms underscores a powerful trend of increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum. These significant Ethereum holdings by major players like Bitmine, SharpLink Gaming, and The Ether Machine highlight a long-term investment perspective that could foster greater market stability and signal a robust future for the network. As the crypto landscape matures, the strategic actions of these large holders, and their impact on the overall ETH supply , will continue to shape the trajectory of one of the world’s leading blockchains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are “strategic reserve firms” in this context? A1: Strategic reserve firms are entities, often institutional investors or large corporations, that hold significant amounts of cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, as a long-term investment or part of their treasury. They typically hold more than 100 ETH, indicating a strategic, rather than speculative, approach. Q2: How much ETH do these firms collectively hold? A2: According to Strategic ETH Reserve, 64 firms collectively hold approximately 3.04 million ETH, which is valued at over $10.87 billion. This represents about 2.52% of the total Ethereum supply. Q3: Which firms hold the largest amounts of ETH? A3: The top three firms identified with the largest Ethereum holdings are Bitmine (833,100 ETH), SharpLink Gaming (521,900 ETH), and The Ether Machine (345,400 ETH). Nine firms hold over 100,000 ETH each. Q4: What does this accumulation mean for Ethereum’s price? A4: Large-scale accumulation of ETH reserves by strategic firms often signals a bullish outlook. It indicates strong long-term confidence in Ethereum, which can contribute to market stability by reducing immediate selling pressure and potentially supporting future price appreciation. Q5: How does this affect the overall ETH supply? A5: When a significant portion of the ETH supply is held in strategic reserves, it means less of it is actively circulating in the market. This can impact liquidity and price discovery. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Q6: Is this a bullish or bearish sign for Ethereum? A6: Generally, the accumulation of large Ethereum holdings by strategic firms is considered a bullish sign. It demonstrates strong institutional confidence, long-term commitment, and can contribute to market stability, indicating a belief in Ethereum’s future growth and adoption.

This trend may now slow down, Novogratz said. “We've probably seen the peak in treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said today at Galaxy Digital's second-quarter 2025 earnings call. “The question now is: Which of the existing companies will become giants?” The more friendly regulatory environment in the US has seen a surge in the number of crypto treasury companies in recent months. These companies raise funds through IPOs and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets on their balance sheets. While early-stage companies followed Michael Saylor's Bitcoin-focused model, newer startups have begun adding Ethereum, Solana, and other smaller-cap crypto assets to their portfolios. Novogratz noted that Ethereum already has two major institutional holders, Tom Lee's BitMine and Joe Lubin's SharpLink, and predicted continued growth. However, he added that new entrants may “have trouble breathing.” Galaxy Digital currently works with more than 20 crypto treasury investment firms. The company earns management fees by managing their crypto assets. Novogratz claimed that this collaboration has brought approximately $2 billion in assets to their platform, providing “recurring revenue.” Related News: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Significant Changes to Ethereum: Here's What Will Happen If They Are Accepted According to the company's second-quarter financial results, Galaxy earned net income of $30.7 million this year, compared to a loss of $177 million in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.08, falling short of analyst expectations. Novogratz sees crypto treasury companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way for hedge funds to enter the sector without directly owning tokens. In the long run, he believes traditional financial institutions will also transition to blockchain-based market structures. However, tokenization, the process of transferring traditional assets (such as stocks) to the blockchain, remains an unresolved issue. Novogratz cited the “Project Crypto” initiative spearheaded by SEC Chairman Paul Atkins as an example, noting that US markets are being explored for potential blockchain migration. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal’s main goal is to protect Brazil’s reserves from foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks while also promoting blockchain innovation. So far, it attracted both support and criticism from top officials. This move is also part of the global trend that was started by a US executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Bitcoin is rising, with Michigan’s State Retirement System increasing its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF holdings to $11.3 million and maintaining a strong Ethereum position. Public pension funds, including Wisconsin’s $321 million Bitcoin bet, are helping fuel a surge in crypto ETF inflows, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to new highs. Brazil Considers Bitcoin Reserve Plan Brazil is moving closer to potentially becoming the next nation to embrace Bitcoin. On Aug. 20, the country’s House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing to discuss a bill that proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. The proposal was originally introduced in November of 2024, and its main goal is to allow up to 5% of Brazil’s treasury funds—approximately $15 billion based on the Central Bank's $300 billion reserve —to be allocated to Bitcoin. Scheduled hearing The hearing is expected to include participation from at least six prominent institutions, including the Central Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Finance, representatives from fintech companies, the traditional banking sector, and a crypto advocacy group. According to the bill, the purpose of the reserve is twofold: to safeguard the country’s international reserves against foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks, and to encourage the development and adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. While the proposal has received some support, it also caused debate. Pedro Giocondo Guerra , chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, voiced strong backing for the initiative earlier this year by calling Bitcoin “the digital gold” and asserting that the debate is crucial to Brazil’s long-term economic prosperity. On the other hand, critics are a bit more cautious. Nilton David , Brazil’s central bank director of monetary policy, argued that including crypto assets in the country’s foreign reserves would be inappropriate. This move by Brazil is part of a global trend that was started by US President Donald Trump’s March executive order to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Since then, countries like Kazakhstan revealed similar plans. Others like India and Sweden are also rumored to be exploring the idea. Currently, the countries with the largest Bitcoin holdings include the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador. Whether Brazil joins their ranks will depend on the outcome of the upcoming legislative process. Michigan Pension Fund Bets Bigger on Bitcoin It is not only countries creating Bitcoin stockpiles. Michigan’s State Retirement System made a big move into the digital asset space by increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal that by the end of Q2 2025, the pension fund owned 300,000 shares of ARKB. This is a large jump from the 110,000 shares it held the previous year. At press time, these shares were valued at approximately $11.3 million based on ARKB’s current trading price of $37.72, assuming no shares have been sold since the last disclosure. State of Michigan Retirement system holdings (Source: SEC ) The ARKB ETF, which is one of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC in January of 2024, provides direct exposure to Bitcoin, simplifying institutional investment into the asset. In addition to its Bitcoin stake, Michigan’s pension fund also holds 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), a position that is worth around $9.6 million. This ETH allocation stayed steady since September of 2024, which indicated that the fund has long-term confidence in both of the leading cryptos. Michigan is also not alone in this trend. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed a much larger Bitcoin investment of $321 million through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale’s GBT. This all suggests that there is a growing appetite among public pension funds for cryptocurrency exposure. This institutional came as Bitcoin ETFs continue to thrive in 2025. In fact, the sector experienced over $1 billion in net inflows on two consecutive days in mid-July. That inflow streak helped propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $123,000. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: BitBo ) Altcoins have not been left behind, as Ethereum ETFs are also gaining good traction. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF became the third-fastest fund to surpass $10 billion in assets under management. On-chain data from Dune Analytics shows that Ether ETF holdings surged by over 40% in the past month alone, which fueled a sharp rally in Ethereum’s price to above $3,800 in July—more than doubling in value since early May.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 05:30:00

This move signals a growing interest in bridging traditional finance with digital assets, especially from established tech companies. It is certainly a moment that captures the attention of anyone keen on the evolution of digital currencies. What is a USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? A USD-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, typically fiat currencies like the USD, or commodities like gold. Stability: Offers predictability in a volatile market. Utility: Facilitates transactions, remittances, and savings. Bridge: Acts as a crucial link between traditional finance and the decentralized world. NHN KCP’s recent actions highlight the increasing demand for reliable digital payment solutions. Their proposed stablecoin, named USDW, aims to serve these needs. NHN KCP’s Strategic Move: Introducing the USDW Stablecoin According to reports from Herald Business, NHN KCP has formally filed trademark applications for USDW. These filings were submitted to the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) on July 17 and July 29. This initiative follows a series of earlier trademark registrations. In June, the company secured 11 related trademarks for won-pegged stablecoins. The addition of a USDW stablecoin signifies a broader ambition to cater to both domestic and international markets. It suggests a comprehensive strategy to embrace the potential of digital currencies fully. Implications for the South Korean Stablecoin Market and Beyond NHN KCP’s foray into a South Korean stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar carries significant implications. It could bolster the country’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation. Furthermore, it might pave the way for wider adoption of digital assets in everyday transactions. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Adoption: A stable, reliable digital currency could encourage more businesses and consumers to use cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: A USD-pegged stablecoin simplifies international transactions, offering lower fees and faster processing. Regulatory Clarity: Such high-profile projects often prompt clearer regulatory frameworks, benefiting the entire industry. This move by NHN KCP, a subsidiary of a major tech firm, reflects a growing trend where established entities explore the practical applications of blockchain technology. It underscores the potential for a new era of digital currency use. The Future of Digital Currency and Stablecoins The global interest in stablecoins continues to surge. Governments and private entities worldwide are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued stablecoins. This trend is driven by the desire for efficient, secure, and transparent financial systems. NHN KCP’s proactive steps with the USD-pegged stablecoin USDW position them at the forefront of this evolution. Their strategy could inspire other traditional financial and tech companies to explore similar ventures. It certainly highlights the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. The future of payments is undeniably digital, and stablecoins are set to play a crucial role. Conclusion: A Landmark Step for Digital Finance NHN KCP’s trademark filings for the USDW stablecoin mark a significant milestone. It’s not just about a new digital asset; it’s about a major South Korean tech firm committing to the future of finance. This development could accelerate the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, offering a stable and efficient medium for digital transactions. As the digital economy continues to expand, such initiatives are vital in shaping its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is NHN KCP? A1: NHN KCP is a subsidiary of NHN, a prominent South Korean tech company. It is known for its payment gateway services and is now expanding into digital assets. Q2: What is the USDW stablecoin? A2: USDW is the proposed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin for which NHN KCP has filed trademark applications. It aims to maintain a stable value against the USD. Q3: Why is NHN KCP developing a USD-pegged stablecoin? A3: The company is likely developing USDW to provide a stable digital asset for transactions, potentially for both domestic and international use, leveraging the stability of the U.S. dollar. Q4: How does this relate to their previous won-pegged stablecoin filings? A4: The USDW filings follow earlier registrations for won-pegged stablecoins. This suggests a broader strategy to offer stable digital currencies pegged to both local (won) and international (USD) currencies, expanding their market reach. Q5: What impact could USDW have on the South Korean market? A5: USDW could enhance the adoption of digital currencies in South Korea by offering a stable and reliable option for payments and remittances, potentially leading to clearer regulatory guidelines for stablecoins.

SOL is moving sideways around the $160 mark, and DOGE is holding near $0.20 but showing little sign of a breakout. For many investors, that’s a cue to start looking beyond the usual names—toward altcoins with more energy, fresh narratives, and potential for meaningful growth. That shift in focus is bringing more attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin. As traders rotate out of DOGE and SOL, many are being drawn to MAGACOIN’s unique positioning—one that combines cultural relevance with a strong community ethos and anti-centralisation values. XRP Rebounds as Traders Look for Clarity and Conviction Interest in XRP isn’t just rising because of market hype—it’s about timing. With growing chatter around a possible breakthrough in the SEC case, some investors see XRP as well-positioned if regulatory clarity finally comes through. The network itself is still active, too—over a million new users joined in July, and transaction volume remains near the top of the charts. Even so, XRP isn’t the only name on traders’ watchlists. As the altcoin landscape shifts, so do portfolio strategies. Investors are paying closer attention to projects that offer more than just price movement—especially those that combine solid fundamentals with a strong community and a story that resonates. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Shift As a meme-powered cryptocurrency and decentralized political memecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the more talked-about newcomers in the space. Its focus on community governance, anti-centralization values, and a distinct ideological identity is resonating with traders—especially those from the SOL and DOGE camps who are starting to reconsider where they put their capital. Momentum around the project has been building. On-chain data shows a clear uptick in wallet activity, accumulation trends, and online engagement. Some are already drawing comparisons to the early growth trajectories of DOGE and SHIBA INU, with bullish forecasts suggesting MAGACOIN could deliver gains of up to 18,900%. It’s still early days, but the project’s appeal goes beyond tech. There’s a growing cultural relevance to what MAGACOIN represents—and in today’s crypto market, that kind of resonance can be just as powerful as the code behind it. Looking Ahead: Traders Want More Than Price Movement Whether or not XRP breaks past $3.12, or Solana and DOGE reclaim their previous highs, one thing is clear—traders are chasing more than just performance. Investors are on the lookout for altcoins with the potential to replicate massive gains and high returns. So far, MAGACOIN FINANCE has benefitted from the capital shift—not as a competitor to the top players, but as an indicator of where the market is headed.

49621457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780079,1754458257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49621457.jpeg,Beijing is still discussing consolidation plans with chip companies.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/beijing-stumbles-in-chip-merger-ivdre/,"Beijing is grappling with setbacks in its plan to turn a disjointed chip industry into a few powerhouse firms that can stand up to global competition. According to sources, the Chinese government has been discussing with key chip equipment manufacturers to consider a state-led merger that would pool their technologies. However, talks have derailed as companies and investors clashed over the proposed ownership setup and valuation. Lee says a merger could help China reduce its dependence on US firms Amid US efforts to limit China’s access to semiconductors, Beijing is pushing to reinforce its domestic chip industry , with the National Development and Reform Commission at the helm of the merger talks. Still, Beijing has a long way to go, especially with corporations and investors clashing over how the merger should be structured and valued. One person familiar with the talks commented, “There were too many split interests. The prospective sellers don’t want to sell at a loss, and the buyers don’t want to pay a premium.” Another insider confirmed that negotiations were still in progress, although he noted that a full-scale consolidation was becoming increasingly improbable. Meanwhile, analysts like Edison Lee, a semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, maintain that consolidation would aid the country in creating its own self-sufficient ecosystem and phase out reliance on US companies such as Applied Materials and Lam Research. Currently, 26 semiconductor acquisitions have been announced in 2025. The highest-profile deal so far is the merger between Hygon, a CPU designer for servers and data centers, and supercomputer maker Sugon. Their deal is valued at over $16 billion and will be completed via a share swap. Analysts are concerned that consolidation may not work to Beijing’s expectations Beijing is also aiming for more targeted financing for firms through mergers. According to Lin Qingyuan, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein, authorities have realized that fragmented investment fails to deliver the scale required for profitability. As a result, they’re focusing on developing a handful of globally competitive national champions. However, there are still concerns about whether consolidation would work to improve the country’s chip industry. An investor even explained that many of the companies up for sale have no true technological moat and thus, without a strategic plan, any acquisition attempt would likely fail. Lin also pointed out that most companies best equipped to acquire underperforming assets are often the first to reject them over concerns about the asset’s weaknesses and high price tag. Nonetheless, a widening range of industries, including real estate and textile equipment manufacturing, are beginning to explore acquisition opportunities in the chip sector. However, despite the growing enthusiasm, not all deals reach completion. Based on Wind data, eight mergers or acquisitions announced this year have collapsed. For instance, the Empyrean Technology, a leading Chinese EDA firm, announced in March its intention to acquire smaller competitor Xpeedic to expand its toolset. But the deal was scrapped last month due to unresolved disagreements over terms. Additionally, Zhejiang Aokang, a leather footwear manufacturer, and Ningbo Cixing, a knitting machinery specialist, have recently withdrawn from proposed semiconductor acquisitions due to valuation disputes. However, analysts have noted that most asset owners are unwilling to accept below-book-value offers even with deteriorating financial metrics, making consolidation and acquisition strategies unfeasible.

This week, the buzz surrounds a major development from BitBridge Capital Strategies , a prominent firm specializing in Bitcoin investment strategies. They are setting their sights on a prestigious Nasdaq listing , a move that could reshape how traditional finance views digital assets. BitBridge Capital Strategies Targets a Groundbreaking Nasdaq Listing BitBridge Capital Strategies, a firm dedicated to creating long-term shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC, recently made headlines with its ambitious plans. The Block reported that the company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This potential Nasdaq listing marks a significant milestone, indicating growing confidence from traditional financial markets in crypto-focused entities. Before their full Nasdaq debut, the company’s shares will commence trading on over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This pre-listing phase is slated for the end of the third quarter, offering early access to interested investors. The move highlights a calculated approach to entering the public market, building momentum and visibility for their unique Bitcoin investment approach. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Crucial for Bitcoin Investment Firms? A Nasdaq listing for a firm like BitBridge Capital Strategies provides immense benefits. It offers enhanced liquidity for shareholders, greater transparency through stringent regulatory oversight, and increased investor confidence. This exposure on a major exchange can attract a broader institutional and retail investor base, validating the firm’s strategic Bitcoin investment focus. Such a listing also elevates the perception of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance. It demonstrates that crypto-centric businesses can operate within established regulatory frameworks, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital to flow into the digital asset space. This move is a testament to the growing maturity of the crypto market. Strategic Focus: Maximizing Shareholder Value with BTC-Collateralized Loans BitBridge Capital Strategies emphasizes its core mission: generating sustained shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC. As part of this effort, the firm plans to introduce an innovative BTC-collateralized loan product. This offering aims to allow clients to borrow traditional currency using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral, providing flexible financial solutions without liquidating their BTC. The introduction of a BTC-collateralized loan product is a smart move in the evolving crypto finance landscape. It addresses a key need for crypto holders seeking liquidity while maintaining their long-term Bitcoin investment positions. This service could become a significant revenue stream and a cornerstone of their value creation strategy, appealing to a diverse set of investors and institutions. Navigating OTC Markets: A Key Step Before the Big Debut The decision to trade on OTC markets initially is a strategic and prudent one. OTC markets facilitate direct trading of securities between two parties, outside of formal exchanges like Nasdaq. This period allows BitBridge Capital Strategies to establish a public trading history, gauge market interest, and comply with various regulatory requirements before a full exchange listing. Trading on OTC markets provides an interim stage for the company to refine its public operations and attract initial investors. It’s a crucial step in their journey towards becoming a publicly traded entity on a major U.S. exchange, building anticipation for the eventual Nasdaq listing . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? The planned Nasdaq listing by BitBridge Capital Strategies signals a broader trend of institutional adoption and integration within the cryptocurrency space. As more crypto-native firms seek public market exposure, it further legitimizes the industry and bridges the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This development could inspire other Bitcoin investment firms to explore similar avenues, fostering greater capital flow and innovation across the sector. The expansion into services like the BTC-collateralized loan also highlights Bitcoin’s evolving utility beyond just a store of value. It showcases how firms are creating practical, yield-generating solutions that can attract traditional investors looking for new financial instruments. This is an exciting time for anyone watching the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, indicating a robust future for institutional crypto engagement. In summary, BitBridge Capital Strategies’ ambitious move towards a Nasdaq listing, preceded by strategic OTC trading and bolstered by its focused Bitcoin investment strategy and innovative loan products, marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and its undeniable integration into the global financial system. This development is certainly one to watch closely.

Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-to-drop-before-the-real-move-analyst-forecasts-new-highs-in-q3/,"As Solana (SOL) attempts to reclaim a crucial level, a market watcher forecasted a massive rally for this quarter. However, some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency will retest the range lows soon. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer Solana Nears Crucial Level On Tuesday, Solana surged 9.6% from the recent lows, driven by the start of Solana Mobile’s global shipments of the Seeker, its second-generation Web3 smartphone, to over 50 countries. The news propelled the altcoin to a multi-day high of $171, fueling bullish sentiment among investors before its price retraced to the mid-zone of its local range. Notably, SOL has been hovering between the $140-$180 range since the April-May breakout, attempting to reclaim the local high for the past three months. During the June correction, SOL momentarily lost its local range lows, retesting the $120-$130 zone as support. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed its range amid the July rally, briefly breaking out of the upper boundary and hitting a five-month high of $206 two weeks ago. Since then, Solana has seen a 25% correction from the highs to the mid-zone of its local price range, currently trading between the $160-$164 levels. Amid its recent performance, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted SOL’s most crucial levels, based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) indicator. According to the chart, the key support area for the altcoin is around the $165 mark, where the largest supply cluster is with 44.4 million SOL, or 7.42% of the supply. As a result, Solana must reclaim the $165 level soon, or it will risk turning this key level into a key resistance, leading to further downside. Nonetheless, if this level is reclaimed, then the altcoin would have to retest the crucial resistance levels around $177 and $189, where investors have also accumulated 27.6 million and 23.6 million SOL, respectively. SOL Preparing For The ‘Real’ Run? Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted Solana’s recent price action, asserting that SOL is “quietly trending higher” with higher lows and turning resistance levels as support. The market watcher forecasted that Solana would reach a new all-time high this quarter, as he doubts “the train stops anytime soon” once it finally breaks out of the $200 resistance. Meanwhile, Crypto Batman suggested that the altcoin will see another correction soon. To the analyst, Solana could have a 10% drop to its four-month ascending support line, which sits around the $150 level, before “the real move.” Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has bounced from this support line twice, in April and June, before rallying to local highs during the May and July price breakouts. Related Reading: Cardano Marks Historical Milestone With Governance Vote, Hoskinson Reacts Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows asserted that SOL could see a significant rally this year despite the recent underperformance, as network activity remains strong. He predicted a 10%-15% correction, affirming that “a dip towards $140-$150 before reversal is highly likely to happen.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $$163, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

Affiliates today look for stable systems, clear payouts, and full control of their earnings. Waiting weeks for payments or trying to figure out complex charts no longer works. This guide lists the 7 best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms in 2025, based on what really matters: steady income, easy tracking, and fast withdrawals. Whether you run a small blog or a high-traffic site, picking the right crypto platform can shape your success. Let’s look at who actually delivers and who falls short. Spartans: Easy-to-Track Payouts With Real Speed Spartans ranks highest among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms because it focuses on what matters: results you can see and money you can access. While other sites create multi-level systems or delay approvals, Spartans keeps things clear and fast. It gives you simple choices with CPA, RevShare, or Hybrid deals. There are no extra steps, no hidden conditions. What makes Spartans stand out in the list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms is that it uses its own crypto system to send your affiliate payouts fast. Once you earn, the payment goes straight to your wallet in seconds. You get real-time updates on how many players you referred, what they bet, and how much you made. The dashboard is mobile-ready and easy to read without any extra help. With more than 5,900 games, 43 providers, and a full sportsbook tied to one wallet, every referral is worth more. With regular promotions like a Lamborghini giveaway and strong deposit deals, the conversions stay high. That means more steady commissions. Spartans remains the top pick for affiliates who want simple terms, fast payments, and full control. Stake.com: Strong Traffic, But Complex Payout Rules Stake.com attracts affiliates with its huge traffic, wide crypto coverage, and global brand name. It has a smooth affiliate portal and several commission options. Still, it uses a tier system where your payout depends on hitting set levels, not just activity. It also has longer approval steps and delayed payouts, especially for new users. Stake works well for large affiliates with steady volume, but smaller partners may find it harder to keep pace. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Stake requires more effort to unlock top rewards. BC.Game: Fun Platform With Tracking Challenges BC.Game is well-known for its gamified betting site and wide crypto choices. Its affiliate setup allows both CPA and revenue share, and in-site bonuses can raise your referral earnings. However, its tracking tools are less accurate than what top sites offer. Some affiliates have also faced tracking errors or slow help from support. While it can still work for those familiar with the brand, it takes more time to manage. BC.Game still earns a spot on this list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms. Roobet: Great Brand, Slower Payout Timing Roobet is a popular name thanks to its fun live games and strong branding. Its affiliate plan pays through revenue share, with rates increasing based on referred player activity. But Roobet’s payments are not instant and follow fixed dates. You often need to send invoices or reach out for updates, which slows your growth. Still, for affiliates with audiences who enjoy Roobet’s style, the site remains useful. As one of the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Roobet’s main challenge is payout speed. Bet365: Trusted Brand, Limited Crypto Support Bet365 stands out for its strong reputation in online betting. Affiliates in fiat-based markets get good commissions and broad reach. But the site is not built for crypto, and payments go through banks instead of wallets. This might feel slow for those used to digital payouts. Still, Bet365’s brand strength can bring steady returns. Within the group of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, it offers reliability even if crypto tools are limited. Betano: Stable Option in Local Markets Betano performs well in some licensed areas, with a loyal user base, especially across Europe. It has a working affiliate system and pays on time, though it lacks in-depth tools and detailed tracking. Affiliates focused on crypto markets may find its fiat-first setup less useful. But for those in allowed regions with sports-focused traffic, it’s still a dependable choice. Betano’s inclusion in the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms list comes from its local strength. Gamdom: Appeals to Streamers, Needs Oversight Gamdom is a modern site that attracts younger players and stream viewers. It supports crypto, has a clean design, and features some rare games. Its affiliate plan is built more around reward codes and engagement than standard CPA or RevShare. Some users report success, while others see tracking problems or slow replies from support. If your audience is into streaming or eSports, it might work, but close tracking is important. Gamdom still finds a place among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms for its niche value. Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Affiliate Platform Crypto affiliates in 2025 want steady income, not just big names. Some sites focus more on brand than real tools. Spartans stands out by offering fast payouts, simple terms, and easy-to-read dashboards. Stake.com and Roobet give reach, but their systems can feel slower or harder to follow. If you want to grow affiliate income with less stress, Spartans offers what’s needed. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms , it brings speed, support, and clarity to the front.

With growing adoption of RippleNet and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), combined with increasing anticipation around upcoming U.S. regulatory updates, XRP recently broke through the $3.00 mark, showing its strongest performance in over a year. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is also benefiting from broader institutional interest, as spot ETFs and corporate treasury moves help drive demand. Both XRP and ETH are showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. But while XRP and ETH are drawing in the big money, retail investors and early adopters are shifting their focus to a rising star with even more upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new altcoin gaining major traction in early August 2025. XRP Surges as SEC Decision Looms XRP is currently trading between $3.00 and $3.05, after a sharp surge in early August. In just one minute, XRP recorded a massive $33 million trading volume spike, breaking past the psychological $3 barrier. Multiple factors are fueling this rally. The U.S. SEC is expected to submit a key status update by August 15, which could provide long-awaited regulatory clarity. This legal development is widely seen as a potential game-changer that could propel XRP to the next price tier. Analysts are watching a bullish falling wedge pattern, which historically signals an impending breakout. Price targets for August range from $3.12 to $4.00, with medium-term forecasts stretching as high as $5.53 if the bullish scenario plays out. Ethereum Maintains Strength as Institutions Shift Focus ETH has seen a 49% surge in trading volume over the past 24 hours, reflecting a spike in institutional and corporate interest. Recent developments show that major firms are buying ETH for their treasuries, including SharpLink and others now holding more than $5 billion in Ethereum. This marks a strategic shift, as companies look beyond Bitcoin for long-term blockchain exposure. As the network celebrates its 10th anniversary, mainstream analysts are recognizing Ethereum’s evolution from an experimental blockchain to a core part of global financial technology. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with projections of continued growth if historical August trends hold. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital Ripple’s aggressive push into the global banking sector has reignited interest in XRP, especially as institutional adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves. But while XRP may see solid gains, many early investors are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. This emerging altcoin is gaining momentum fast thanks to its innovative DeFi features, strong community backing, and deflationary tokenomics. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 32x returns in the next bull cycle, especially for those getting in early during the presale phase. It’s quickly becoming a top pick for high-growth altcoin investors. Final Thoughts: A Market on the Move Ripple’s growing presence in global finance and the upcoming SEC report are pushing XRP toward its most bullish setup in years. Ethereum is holding strong with institutional support and ETF inflows. And while the top coins continue to lead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building momentum in the background—possibly setting the stage for the next breakout success story. With hype building and early momentum on its side, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly being seen as one of the most explosive altcoin opportunities of the year.

He mentioned that the U.S. was preparing federal financing tools to support AI tech exports to approved countries. “The next trailblazing breakthrough will be made with and on American technology, and to fully harness them, you will want America’s AI infrastructure already in place.” – Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. China has always rallied against alleged U.S. surveillance and the administration’s efforts to limit its tech industry. The country’s cyberspace administration summoned Nvidia representatives last week to discuss U.S. efforts towards incorporating location-tracking to its H20 chips. Beijing is also worried about semiconductor sanctions designed to counter the country’s AI companies, such as Huawei Technologies and DeepSeek . The Trump administration plans to remove export restrictions on Nvidia’s chips to China as part of a trade agreement to secure sales of rare-earth minerals to the U.S. Nvidia mentioned on Tuesday that it distances itself from any backdoors or kill switches in its chips, noting that they undermine trust in U.S. technology. The company argued that using backdoors, kill switches, or spyware doesn’t mirror the company’s systems, which are built on trust. Kratsios also championed China’s AI action plan, saying that each country should set its own standards for regulating artificial intelligence. The country’s AI action plan includes forming a global organization to devise governance and technology standards. The White House official also believes the U.S. model will be the most attractive since it puts innovation first. U.S. charges Chinese nationals in Nvidia chip smuggling The FBI arrested two Chinese nationals on Saturday on charges alleging they knowingly exported to China tens of millions of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence ( #AI ) applications, in violation of the Export Control Reform Act. Details: https://t.co/Z05cXhQsg4 pic.twitter.com/Y1yC5aJQwm — FBI Los Angeles (@FBILosAngeles) August 5, 2025 The White House also acknowledged that it’s still working to mitigate the smuggling of chips to China. Kratsios said he’s not yet confirmed from either Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices about the exploration of location-tracking capabilities. The U.S. has also charged two Chinese nationals with smuggling millions of dollars’ worth of advanced Nvidia chips to Beijing. The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang illegally exported Nvidia GPUs to China from October 2022 to July 2025. The DOJ referred to export records, which showed that the duo orchestrated around 21 shipments to companies in Malaysia and Singapore through their California-based company, ALX Solutions. According to the report, the 28-year-olds allegedly exported a shipment of Nvidia H100 chips in December 2024 without the necessary licence from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Prosecutors also found that ALX Solutions received payments from companies in Hong Kong and China. Records showed that the firm received roughly $1 million from a China-based company in January 2024, instead of the company taking delivery. The DOJ also found incriminating evidence last week from ALX Solution’s office and Geng and Yang’s phones, including communications about chip shipments to China through Malaysia. The duo could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if convicted under the Export Control Reform Act.

Despite a minor dip of 0.43%, big money continues flowing in. Galaxy Digital just reported a Q2 profit of $30.7 million, bouncing back from a $295 million Q1 loss. The turnaround was driven by a strategic boost in BTC holdings, now totaling 17,102 BTC (worth roughly $1.95B), up from 13,704.

Trading activity might’ve slowed, but Galaxy’s Global Markets arm still clocked a 28% profit rise. Meanwhile, its Helios data center ramped up capacity, showing bullish infrastructure investment. Most importantly, Galaxy actively accumulated 4,272 BTC in Q2 alone. That kind of accumulation squeezes supply, and that could be a strong long-term tailwind for Bitcoin prices. Cango Mines 650 BTC in July, Up 44% MoM Cango, a Chinese firm formerly in auto loans, is now a full-blown Bitcoin miner—and growing fast. In July, it mined 650.5 BTC, a jump from 450 in June, powered by a $256 million Bitmain rig investment. With a hashrate of 32 EH/s, it’s now one of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin holders globally, sitting on 4,529.7 BTC ($512M).

Since April, Cango has mined over 1,600 BTC, showing both momentum and commitment. Their move reinforces institutional trust and strengthens BTC’s long-term supply absorption, especially noteworthy for a company based in a country known for strict crypto crackdowns. Trump’s Crypto Order Adds Political Tailwind Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order protecting crypto companies and conservative groups from “debanking.” The move targets Operation Chokepoint 2.0—allegedly used to cut off banking access to crypto firms. BREAKING: Trump is getting ready to sign an executive order that will fine banks for debanking crypto companies. No more ""operation chokepoint"" in the US! pic.twitter.com/Yp19BhAmph — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 5, 2025 The order pushes federal agencies to investigate potential violations and calls for reviews of regulations that might’ve enabled discrimination. While legal experts debate its enforceability, the broader message is clear: more political support for crypto access. If successful, this could improve funding and liquidity for the crypto space, opening doors for increased investor confidence, and potentially pushing Bitcoin higher in the long run. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Struggles Below $115K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin remains trapped below the descending trendline and the 50-EMA at $115,440—both acting as dynamic resistance. The recent rejection near $115,400, with small-bodied candles and spinning tops, signals indecision. RSI hovers at 46—bearish bias remains intact. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Unless bulls reclaim the $115,440 zone, BTC risks slipping toward key support levels: Immediate support : $112,178 Next support : $110,663 Deeper support : $109,060 On the upside, breaking above $115,440 could open targets at $116,912 and $118,878. Trade Setup: Entry: $113,800 Stop-loss: $115,600 Target 1: $112,180 Target 2: $110,660 This short setup favors bears unless BTC breaks above the 50-EMA and trendline.

Today, we are diving deep into the BTC perpetual futures market, specifically examining the crucial 24-hour long-short ratios . These ratios offer a powerful lens through which to view current crypto market sentiment , helping traders and investors make more informed decisions. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? When we talk about long-short ratios in BTC perpetual futures , we are referring to the proportion of long positions (bets that the price will rise) versus short positions (bets that the price will fall) on a given exchange over a specific period. This data is derived from open interest and trading volumes, providing a real-time snapshot of trader sentiment. For instance, if the long ratio is higher, it suggests a bullish bias among traders, expecting Bitcoin’s price to increase. Conversely, a higher short ratio indicates a bearish outlook. Monitoring these ratios is a key component of effective Bitcoin futures trading strategy. Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour Data: A Snapshot of Crypto Market Sentiment Let’s examine the recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across major exchanges: Total Market: Long 48.11%, Short 51.89% This overall figure suggests a slight bearish tilt in the market over the past day, with more traders positioned for a downside move in Bitcoin’s price. It indicates a cautious, perhaps even pessimistic, crypto market sentiment . How Do Top Exchanges Compare in Derivatives Data Analysis? Looking at individual exchanges provides a more granular view: Binance: Long 47.86%, Short 52.14% Bybit: Long 48.28%, Short 51.72% Gate.io: Long 48.05%, Short 51.95% Interestingly, all three top exchanges reflect a similar trend, with short positions slightly outweighing long positions. Binance shows the strongest short bias among the three, while Bybit is marginally less bearish. This consistency across major platforms strengthens the indication of prevailing bearish sentiment. Understanding these subtle differences through careful derivatives data analysis can offer insights into the trading behavior dominant on each platform. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Trading Strategy So, what can you do with this information? While long-short ratios are not a standalone trading signal, they are a vital piece of the puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Market Direction: A sustained trend in long-short ratios can signal a potential shift in market direction. If shorts continue to dominate, it might suggest further downward pressure. Identify Potential Reversals: Sometimes, an extreme imbalance can precede a reversal. If everyone is short, who is left to sell? This could lead to a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly rise. Confirm Your Bias: Use these ratios to confirm or challenge your own trading bias. If you are bullish but the market’s collective short bias is strong, it might be wise to re-evaluate your position or manage risk more tightly. Incorporating this derivatives data analysis into your overall strategy can significantly enhance your understanding of the market’s pulse. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting Long-Short Ratios While invaluable, interpreting long-short ratios requires caution. They are not foolproof. For example, a high short ratio could mean that many traders are hedging their spot positions, rather than purely speculating on a price drop. Also, liquidity and volume on specific exchanges can influence their individual ratios. Therefore, it is crucial to combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a holistic view of the crypto market sentiment and future price movements. In conclusion, the latest 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios reveal a prevailing cautious, slightly bearish sentiment across major exchanges. By understanding these dynamics and integrating them into your broader analysis, you can sharpen your Bitcoin futures trading decisions and navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. How are long-short ratios calculated? Long-short ratios are typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or by expressing each as a percentage of the total open interest) on a given exchange over a specified period. Why is it important to monitor crypto market sentiment? Monitoring crypto market sentiment, often reflected in long-short ratios, helps traders gauge the collective mood of the market. This insight can indicate potential price trends, identify overbought or oversold conditions, and inform trading strategies. Can long-short ratios predict price movements accurately? No, long-short ratios alone cannot accurately predict price movements. They are an indicator of current sentiment and positioning. Traders should combine this data with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive market outlook. Are these ratios the same across all exchanges? While general trends might be similar, the exact long-short ratios can vary between exchanges due to differences in trader demographics, liquidity, fee structures, and trading volumes on each platform.

The Tom Lee-chaired firm holds 833,100 ETH worth almost $3 billion, according to EthStrategicReserve. Speaking on the Natalie Brunell podcast on Tuesday, Lee said there was no conflict between Bitcoin treasuries and Ethereum treasuries because they were both scarce (comparing them to Tesla and Palantir stocks). The first “killer app” for crypto has emerged and is seeing widespread adoption, and that is stablecoins, he said. Wall Street is running to tokenize its entire system on the blockchain, and it requires smart contracts, he said before adding: “The biggest and most secure blockchain with no downtime is Ethereum, and it’s legally compliant.” The top three Ethereum treasury firms now hold 1.7 billion ETH, which equates to around 1.4% of the total supply.

Key Takeaways: Indonesian officials are exploring Bitcoin as a potential national reserve asset. Discussions included using local renewable energy for Bitcoin mining to boost economic growth. Bitcoin education was highlighted as a priority for long-term adoption and financial literacy. In an X post shared Monday , the group said it was invited to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country’s long-term financial stability. Among the key proposals discussed was leveraging Bitcoin mining as a tool for building national reserves—a concept rarely entertained at the government level. Indonesia Seriously Weighs Bitcoin to Strengthen Economy “Yes, seriously,” the group emphasized, noting that Indonesia is considering how Bitcoin might strengthen its economy over time. The discussion also touched on expanding mining infrastructure and launching education programs focused on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. With a population exceeding 280 million and a GDP of roughly $1.4 trillion, Indonesia ranks as the fourth most populous nation and the 16th largest economy in the world. Bitcoin Indonesia argued the country could tap into its rich geothermal and hydroelectric resources to power Bitcoin mining operations, pointing to other nations that have successfully turned similar strategies into job creators. The meeting was held with special staff from the office of Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka, and included bullish projections from figures like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. His forecast of Bitcoin potentially reaching $13 million to $49 million by 2045 was part of the pitch to showcase Bitcoin’s long-term value. Bitcoin Indonesia also pushed for education-focused initiatives to build broader public understanding of the asset. BIG NEWS: Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve.

What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 One official from the Vice President’s office appeared to echo the importance of financial literacy, reportedly stating that “Indonesia must also continue to educate about Bitcoin in the future.” While the idea of adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset is gaining momentum globally amid fears of inflation and rising debt, Indonesia’s macroeconomic picture may not necessitate such urgency. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at a manageable 39%, and annual inflation as of January 2025 is well contained at 0.76%. MEXC Backs Indonesia’s Crypto Exchange Triv As reported, MEXC Ventures has taken a strategic bet on Indonesia’s growing crypto market, investing in crypto exchange Triv at a $200 million valuation. The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia’s updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. In Indonesia, crypto is permitted for investment but not for payments. The market is growing rapidly. Crypto transactions in 2023 topped 650 trillion rupiah (around $40 billion), and user numbers across licensed platforms have surpassed 20 million, outpacing the country’s stock market participation. Indonesia’s annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023.
