This alignment establishes a robust technical foundation, indicating a potential breakout as buyers step in at this critical level. Key Support Level Near Aligning With VWAP Average In a post on X, CryptoPulse drew attention to SUI’s recent price action, noting that the token has pulled back into what is described as a “sweet spot” for potential buying opportunities. The price recently touched the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and is currently sitting directly on a critical structural support level around $3.50. Related Reading: SUI MACD Signals Massive Rally Ahead — 400% Price Surge Possible This zone has been a key area of interest for the analyst, who has been patiently waiting for SUI to reach this level before stepping in. The convergence of the VWAP and structural support creates a favorable setup that often precedes strong upward moves. Fundamentally, SUI is also gaining increasing recognition and traction within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The project’s growing presence, combined with solid chart structure, reinforces the possibility of substantial upside potential over the coming weeks and months. Currently, the analyst is actively averaging into their position, setting an initial target at $5. However, they remain optimistic that this setup can extend much further if momentum continues to build and key technical levels are broken. With both technical and fundamental factors converging, CryptoPulse views SUI as a project worth watching closely for possible significant gains ahead. SUI Chart Shows Promise, But Setup Needs Confirmation Sharing additional insights in a separate post, AlgoCats highlighted that SUI is currently showing a very promising chart setup. The analyst noted that while the structure looks favorable, they are waiting for a more defined formation to develop, which would offer a clearer signal for a long position before considering an entry point. Their target is a key resistance zone that has seen multiple wicks and a previous fake breakout, marking it as a critical level where price action could accelerate.

However, AlgoCats emphasized that patience is key, and they intend to wait for confirmation before making any move. Until that confirmation arrives, the focus remains on observing how SUI behaves around current levels. AlgoCats is prepared to act, but only when the chart provides a clean and confident signal for entry. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $3.54, demonstrating a nearly 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased significantly by more than 33% in the past day.

From presales that give you hands-on access before launch, to established names delivering consistent performance, the current market offers a mix of innovation and reliability. Whether it’s a coin redefining the presale experience, a blockchain built for speed and scalability, a community-powered token blending culture with finance, or an ecosystem mainstay that never loses relevance, each has its own story. Here’s a closer look at four standout picks making waves in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Where You Don’t Just Buy, You Feel the Trade BlockDAG is redefining what a presale can be. With its Dashboard V4, users aren’t left waiting to find out how it all works. Instead, they can log in right now and experience a fully interactive BDAG Exchange simulator. From watching the BDAG/USD price fluctuate in real time, to clicking “Buy” and seeing wallet balances update, the feeling is immediate. It’s no longer abstract. The simulation includes full BUY/SELL panels, live order books, price charts, and a market feed. This isn’t a teaser; it’s a hands-on demo that turns crypto from concept to contact. And the numbers? They match the energy. BlockDAG has already raised $363 million, sold over 24.7 billion BDAG, and is currently in batch 29 at $0.0276. That’s a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Right now, a limited window is open to buy in at $0.0016, allowing new users to secure significantly more upside. Among the top crypto coins 2025 has introduced, BlockDAG is the only one giving its users something they can feel now , not months down the line. 2. Avax: Smart Contracts with Speed and Scale Avax has carved out its position through a combination of speed, scalability, and multi-chain functionality. What users love most is how the platform balances advanced features with a relatively user-friendly experience. Transactions are confirmed in seconds, which gives it a real-world responsiveness that many platforms still struggle to match. Its ongoing development into subnets allows customized chains to run under the Avalanche umbrella, creating a network of networks. This adds utility for developers, but also gives investors confidence that the tech can scale. As we move through 2025, Avax continues to attract attention not just for performance, but for its approach to interoperability and speed. It’s earned its place on the list of top crypto coins 2025 by offering a blend of tech and usability that’s rare to find at scale. 3. Pengu: Where Culture Meets Coin Pengu isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement. Inspired by online culture and driven by a strong community, it has grown fast by doing what most coins can’t: staying lighthearted while building serious momentum. What sets Pengu apart is how emotionally connected its holders feel. The memes, the inside jokes, the vibe, it’s all part of the value. But it’s not just fluff. Pengu has rolled out staking, community rewards, and unique NFT integrations that make it feel like more than a meme coin. The roadmap includes utility-focused tools and cross-chain expansion, showing it’s aiming beyond just virality. In a market where people want both identity and opportunity, Pengu has become one of the top crypto coins 2025 by making crypto feel personal again. It’s a reminder that sometimes, fun and finance don’t have to be separate. 4. BNB: Consistency in a Volatile Market BNB has long been a staple in the portfolios of serious crypto holders. Tied to one of the largest ecosystems in the industry, it powers transactions, fuels smart contracts, and unlocks utility across a wide range of products. Even as trends shift and new coins make noise, BNB continues to show resilience. It’s used, held, and traded at volume, making it a practical choice for both experienced traders and those just entering the space. What’s powerful about BNB is its staying power. It’s not built on hype cycles or single-use cases. It’s functional, familiar, and constantly updated. For those looking for a grounded asset in their search for the top crypto coins 2025, BNB remains one of the most reliable options. Final Thoughts In 2025, the top crypto coins 2025 are defined by more than market cap or short-term gains, they’re shaped by the experience and value they deliver. BlockDAG stands out for giving users real trading interaction before launch. Avax offers a technical foundation of speed and interoperability. Pengu proves that community and culture can fuel serious growth. And BNB remains a pillar of stability in a fast-changing market. Whether you’re seeking innovation, engagement, or consistency, these coins represent strong candidates for long-term consideration. As the year unfolds, each will continue to play a unique role in shaping the crypto landscape.

With a U.S. national trust bank charter and RLUSD stablecoin integration on the horizon, institutional momentum around XRP and Litecoin is growing. These updates are sending price predictions higher for both coins. Yet it’s not just legacy assets in the spotlight—MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines, with analysts projecting a 22,400% ROI this quarter as it emerges as a new high-upside contender for investors seeking the next breakout. Ripple Bank Move Gains Traction Ripple’s bank strategy is now gaining serious momentum. With its OCC charter application for the Ripple National Trust Bank, a Federal Reserve master account pursuit, and a full suite of custodial partnerships, Ripple is placing itself at the center of institutional banking and XRP growth. The RLUSD stablecoin rollout is also primed to boost real-world payments and bank adoption of Ripple XRP. Analyst XRP price prediction calls remain positive, despite short-term pullbacks. The average forecast for August sits near $3.14, with a bullish scenario of $3.36. Fibonacci extension analysis targets $5.50 for 2025, while longer-term projections suggest a range between $4.50 and $9.00—assuming more regulatory clarity and continued institutional adoption. Ripple OCC charter news and Ripple bank partnership news are driving renewed market optimism and could set the stage for a major XRP price rally. Litecoin Price Bullish Prediction Litecoin is riding a fresh wave of optimism in the wake of Ripple news today. The current Litecoin price prediction 2025 averages $137, with a projected peak at $146.80. Institutional banking trends and the 80% odds of a Litecoin ETF approval are fueling a strong narrative for a Litecoin price boost. Analysts are watching closely for a Litecoin price rally after Ripple news, as the two coins often see correlated moves during periods of positive market sentiment. Ripple’s impact on Litecoin price is being felt through both direct institutional flows and broader altcoin performance after big ecosystem updates. For those looking at utility-focused crypto coins and cross-chain payment solutions, both XRP and Litecoin are high on the watchlist for the rest of 2025. Ripple’s Bank Strategy Sparks MAGACOIN FINANCE Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top story among traders scanning for Q3’s biggest opportunities. As Ripple’s bank strategy shakes up institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its combination of community-driven momentum and aggressive growth. Wallet growth, social chatter, and presale hype all point to explosive interest, with some analysts now calling for a staggering 22,400% ROI this quarter. This project’s appeal comes from its unique blend of real-world narrative, transparent governance, and volatility-friendly trading conditions. With the market focused on Ripple banking partnerships 2025 and the effect of bank adoption on XRP price, traders are looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for an early entry before mainstream attention hits. In a market hungry for utility-focused crypto coins and new narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is staking its claim as the next major contender for altcoin leadership in 2025. Next Moves: What to Watch as Bank News Lifts Crypto Institutional adoption and bank partnerships are reshaping the outlook for XRP and Litecoin, while Ripple ecosystem updates keep both coins near the top of analyst forecasts. Ripple’s ongoing bank strategy is boosting institutional confidence, translating to bullish calls for both price and adoption across the board. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 22,400% ROI projection, is stepping into the spotlight as the bold new pick for investors wanting high upside in a shifting market.

The company released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on Tuesday, offering two fully downloadable, customizable large language models that don’t require a license fee or API gate. Both models are text-only and are being shared under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning anyone can download the model weights from platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face. They also work on LM Studio and Ollama, and can run on everything from laptops to cloud servers. OpenAI said the models are optimized to function across a range of hardware, including consumer devices and chips from Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras, and Groq. OpenAI trained models to block malicious fine-tuning OpenAI said it delayed releasing the models to complete safety evaluations. During pre-training, the company filtered out sensitive material, specifically chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear data. It also tested scenarios where bad actors might try to fine-tune the models for malicious tasks. The company reported that none of those experiments led to models reaching its internal “high capability” threshold, a classification outlined in its Preparedness Framework, which it uses to assess harm potential. Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, told reporters, “It’s been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there.” gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!) (and a smaller one that runs on a phone). super proud of the team; big triumph of technology. — Sam Altman (@sama) August 5, 2025 He added that the company also included three external expert groups to audit and comment on the fine-tuning of safety tests. These models aren’t open-source in the traditional sense. OpenAI is only providing the model weights, not the full training code or datasets. But they are still open enough to allow users to test, fine-tune, and deploy them however they see fit. The company framed this as a middle ground between full transparency and maintaining some control. Amazon, Microsoft, and Anthropic expand AI marketplace The models will also be available through cloud platforms. Amazon , Microsoft , and Baseten are offering gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b directly to customers. This is the first time Amazon Web Services (AWS) will host OpenAI models, and they will be accessible through both Bedrock and Sagemaker. Amazon said these models will help customers build AI agents capable of advanced reasoning and step-by-step thinking. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, has positioned AWS as a marketplace where companies can pick from multiple AI providers, not just Amazon’s in-house tools. In addition to OpenAI, Amazon has also partnered with Anthropic, putting $8 billion into the AI startup. That deal lets AWS clients access Anthropic’s Claude models. On Tuesday, Anthropic said it would release a new Claude model, which it claims is better at coding, research, and data analysis than its previous versions. The release puts OpenAI in the same lane as other companies offering open-weight models, like Meta, Mistral AI (which is backed by Microsoft), and DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that previously gained attention for building an AI model with human-like reasoning. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, “OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they’re advancing innovation in open-source software.” Nvidia partnered with OpenAI to make sure the models perform well across its hardware. So did AMD, Cerebras, and Groq, giving users more flexibility when choosing where to run the models. Both gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b support chain-of-thought processing, tool usage, and tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Users can run them locally or in the cloud without needing to call an API or rely on a paid plan. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, fueled by media attention and the asset’s performance.

Often, Bitcoin’s strong performance acts as a catalyst for the entire cryptocurrency market , pulling altcoins along with it.

This significant move for BTC $114,000 underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its position at the forefront of the digital economy.

In after-hours trading, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell about 4%, as the forecast failed to meet some investor expectations, according to Reuters . Year to date, AMD shares have jumped over 40%, far outpacing a roughly 12% gain in the benchmark chip index, as investors wager on its role in the AI boom. Companies such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI rely on AMD’s advanced processors to run AI tasks. Cloud providers are increasing their spending plans to build out data-centre capacity for AI workloads. Meta recently lifted the low end of its annual capital spending range by $2 billion—to between $66 billion and $72 billion. Likewise, Microsoft projected a record $30 billion in capital outlays for the first quarter of its fiscal year to keep pace with surging AI demand. No China sales yet as licenses are still pending For the third quarter, AMD anticipates about $8.7 billion in revenue, give or take $300 million. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had an average forecast of $8.30 billion. That outlook excludes any sales from shipments of its MI308 AI chip to China, since export licenses are still under review by the U.S. government. In April, Washington imposed curbs requiring a licence to send advanced AI processors to China. The Commerce Department is now assessing AMD’s applications, and the company said it will resume those exports once approval is granted. In mid-July, the administration quietly reversed the prohibition on specially tailored, “China-compliant” chips. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Nvidia filed applications to resume H20 GPU sales , and AMD plans to seek licences for its MI308 accelerators, but approvals are still pending Over the past ten years, under CEO Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD has transformed into a major technology supplier across computing, capitalizing on Intel’s missteps to turn its own fortunes around. As a result, AMD’s market capitalization now exceeds Intel’s by about $200 billion. But Nvidia’s growth is far ahead of both companies as its dominance in AI accelerators has made it the world’s most valuable company. AMD remains the second‐largest producer of graphics chips, the foundation for data‐center AI accelerators, and its CPUs go head‐to‐head with Intel in both PC and server markets. AMD moves more manufacturing to the U.S. In May, Su described China as a “large opportunity” for semiconductors and AI, even amid tightening export rules and shifting tariff plans. “There should be a balance between export controls for national security as well as ensuring that we get the widest possible adoption of our technology,” Su told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “That’s a good thing for U.S. jobs in the U.S. economy.” She added that U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and widespread adoption “is the primary objective and a really great position for us to be in.” Su said there is a “balance to be played between” restricting chip exports and providing access to them. Meanwhile, CNBC reported Super Micro Computer Inc. shares fell 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the server maker reported disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued cautious guidance for the coming quarter. In the period ended June 30, revenue rose 7.5% year-over-year. The company projects adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.52 per share on $6 billion to $7 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated $0.59 per share on $6.6 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2026, Super Micro forecasts at least $33 billion in revenue, topping the $29.94 billion consensus. After a surge in demand during 2023 for Nvidia-equipped data-center servers used in artificial intelligence, growth has since moderated. The company dodged a Nasdaq delisting after delays in its financial filings and the departure of its auditor. As of Tuesday’s close, shares had climbed about 88% this year, while the S&P 500 gained 7%.

Now, the U.S. is turning up the scrutiny on Chinese AI startups and the people helping them on American soil. Following the arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting advanced Nvidia AI chips to China, a group of U.S. lawmakers and federal agencies has increased their scrutiny of Chinese AI activity. Separately, a group of Republican senators is also pressing the Commerce Department to evaluate the potential data security risks posed by open-source Chinese AI models like DeepSeek. U.S. senators call for an investigation into Chinese AI models On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, both 28, for allegedly violating export controls by shipping tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H100 processors, to China without the required government licenses. The chips are subject to strict export controls due to their strategic value in the development of AI technologies with potential military applications. The pair faces up to 20 years in prison under the Export Control Reform Act. According to prosecutors, Geng and Yang operated ALX Solutions Inc., a company based in El Monte, California, which they founded in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department began imposing tighter licensing requirements on AI chip exports. Investigators seized mobile phones and discovered communications that show the pair were fully aware that the company was used as a front to bypass export restrictions, routing shipments through Malaysia to disguise their final destination in China. The Justice Department noted that Yang had overstayed her visa, while Geng is a legal permanent U.S. resident. A federal judge in Los Angeles released Geng on a $250,000 bond, while a detention hearing for Yang is scheduled for August 12. No pleas have been entered in the case yet. The FBI and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security are leading the investigation . Senators target DeepSeek Seven Republican U.S. senators are urging the Commerce Department to probe DeepSeek , a Chinese open-source AI firm, for potential data security and export control violations. In a letter sent Tuesday , the senators, Todd Young, John Cornyn, John Curtis, Bill Cassidy, Marsha Blackburn, and Jon Husted, led by Sen. Ted Budd, called on the Commerce Department to assess whether Chinese AI models may be collecting data from American users and funneling it to the Chinese government or military. The letter raises several key concerns, like whether DeepSeek’s software could be transmitting U.S. personal or enterprise data back to Chinese servers, whether it has gained unauthorized access to export-controlled semiconductors, and whether it has violated terms of use for U.S.-based models to improve its own systems. The senators also referenced concerns that DeepSeek may have misappropriated U.S. AI technology, reiterating a previous statement made in January by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who vowed to impose restrictions if such violations were confirmed. U.S. officials remain skeptical of DeepSeek’s claims that its AI reasoning models were on par with, or superior to, leading U.S. models at a fraction of the cost. They still believe that the company’s success came from skimming off U.S. technologies. The Commerce Department has yet to comment on the senators’ letter or the latest criminal charges.

In a new YouTube video, Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers that if the S&P 500 (SPX) breaks out past a key resistance level, it may trigger FOMO (fear of missing out), driving Bitcoin and stocks even higher as people with cash on the sidelines rush in. “If the S&P is able to break out of this zone, break past the logarithmic resistance that spans back from the peak of 2007 – and 2009 being that low – I think we could go on a pretty significant run to the upside. And I could even say it’s severe for the bears or anyone sitting on the sideline with too much cash… Institutions, retail, no matter who it is… if they have too much still sitting on the sidelines, I think that’s where the FOMO would really kick in if we’re able to break out of this high that’s just been put in at around 6,400 points on the S&P 500.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Pizzino also shares a weekly chart showing Bitcoin’s historical price correlation with the S&P 500, suggesting the flagship crypto asset will likely print new all-time highs if the SPX logarithmic resistance level is breached. “If that occurs, Bitcoin’s price … would probably follow suit into that period.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube As of Monday’s close, the SPX is trading for 6,329. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $115,026 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours.

Traders are now targeting newer tokens with higher upside as XRP and DOGE lose momentum in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names starting to trend as funds rotate. The wider crypto market has seen a steady shake-up in recent weeks. The ETF-driven excitement of XRP is fading with declining odds as investors shift to other tokens. Meanwhile, DOGE has struggled to gain major fresh developments despite having a strong social media presence. Although altcoin rotation is nothing new, the pace of movement this time has surprised analysts. Investors are now more focused on narrative, token utility, and community strength. These shifts have helped spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE among a short list of coins that are set to explode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Steam as Traders Eye Gains XRP and DOGE funds are flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE as momentum grows around its presale. Interest in the coin is rising fast and early buyers are expecting up to 27x returns on initial investment. Traders say the timing is right—XRP hype is cooling, and DOGE lacks a clear path to new highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh narrative that ties political energy with meme coin appeal. Its capped supply model and strong branding makes it stand out in the presale market. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself to attract both crypto natives and new investors unlike other tokens that launch without structure. The project blends cultural relevance with smart economics. Its presale is already drawing in whales and retail holders. Wallet data shows presence of large flows from existing large-cap tokens into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The flow could mirror early SHIB cycles when capital moved quickly into high-upside opportunities. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to sell out ahead of schedule. Meme Coins Lose Momentum as Traders Search for the Next Big Run DOGE and SHIB kicked off the last meme cycle in late 2024. However, the coins are now trading sideways with low volatility. Even major news fails to bring meaningful movement. The lack of driving factors is pushing retail and mid-level traders to seek out smaller tokens with bigger potential. Newer tokens have the advantage of surprise. They attract early momentum with less overhead and fresh excitement. This has made the space competitive but also wide open for the right token at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be fitting that profile well. It combines cultural timing, simple access, and a strong hook—elements that made earlier meme tokens break out in past cycles. Final Thoughts Crypto is fast and unforgiving for investors who invest late. Crypto investors who catch trends early often see the biggest rewards. Right now, the trend is clear: large holders are trimming positions in older tokens and moving into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is receiving growing attention as this shift continues. If the presale closes as expected and demand holds, the coin may lead the next breakout wave in the crypto market.

Based in Daegu, Shin was found guilty of manipulating trading data and misleading customers. He is already serving a seven-year sentence for misappropriating ₩10 billion (about $7.5 million) in deposits, and now faces more jail time over a smaller but still serious scheme. Inflated Trading Volume And Misleading Announcements According to the Daegu District Court, Shin used false trading figures to pump up the crypto market price of Bitsonic Coin (BSC). He lured customers with fake announcements and boosted “KRW points” through sham buybacks. Those points then funded actual purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum from platform users. Once Shin converted the crypto into cash, he poured money into unrelated firms. The court found that this cycle netted him roughly ₩160 million ($115,000) in ill-gotten gains. Investigators noted that Shin also gave investors a lock-up period guarantee. In reality, neither the investments nor the promised interest could be returned. When victims pressed for their funds, they discovered the promise was hollow. Earlier Price Manipulation Conviction In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, known only by the surname Bae, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison for a separate fraud involving price manipulation. Reports said that this earlier verdict stemmed from a Seoul District Court finding that both executives deceptively profited by inflating trade volumes. At that time, Shin settled with the two biggest victims, which the judge said helped merit a lighter sentence. The February ruling emphasized that neither Shin nor Bae had prior convictions for similar crimes. Judge Seong Gi-jun noted that their lack of a criminal record and Shin’s partial restitution with major victims weighed in favor of a “lenient” approach under South Korean law. Yet the sizable sums involved—₩10 billion in deposits and the recent ₩160 million—underscore the scale of trust these executives betrayed. Questions Over Exchange Oversight According to Digital Asset reports , professionals indicate that the crypto exchange Bitsonic situation points to loopholes in real-time observation of exchange operations. Swollen volumes and unverified lock-up assurances are likely to go undetected without more robust on-chain analytics. Customer trust suffers every time a high-profile exchange scandal erupts. Some traders are already demanding mandatory proof-of-reserves audits and transparent order books to help deter such abuses.

49608228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799285,1754438454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49608228.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holds Steady At $115,000, But Realized Price Data Warns Of Fragility",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-115000-realized-price-data-warns/,"Following another rejection from the $120,000 region on July 21, Bitcoin (BTC) is now holding steady around the $115,000 level. However, realized price data suggests that BTC’s surface-level calm may be nearing its end. Old Bitcoin Whales Stop Realizing Gains According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin whale behavior indicates that the asset may be walking a tightrope. While “old whales” have stopped realizing profits, newer whales remain slightly in the green – though only marginally. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Market Flashes Warning: IBIT Outflows Paired With Drop In Tron USDT Transfers Here, old whales refer to large BTC holders who have held the digital asset for more than a year. New whales – including institutional players – are those who entered the market within the past year. Kripto Mevsimi notes that the current balance between old capital and newly invested capital may not hold much longer. A decisive break in either direction could push BTC into a new price range. The chart below illustrates the rising realized cap of old whales from 2022 to 2024, confirming that this cohort steadily realized profits during that period. Notably, this quiet distribution phase coincided with mid-cycle market conditions. However, since early 2025, the realized cap for old whales has flattened – signalling a pause in profit-taking. Their average cost basis of $39,400 puts them well in profit, suggesting they are likely waiting for higher prices before re-entering the market. In contrast, the average cost basis for newer whales is approximately $105,300 – a level that now serves as their psychological breakeven. As long as BTC remains above this threshold, these newer investors are unlikely to sell in large numbers. That said, a drop below this critical level could trigger risk-off behavior among new whales. Kripto Mevsimi suggests that such a move could escalate current conditions from moderate profit-taking to panic selling, potentially triggering a wave of leverage unwinds. Keep An Eye On Realized Price It’s worth noting that recent activity has been minimal across both BTC investor cohorts – old whales and new whales alike. As the CryptoQuant analyst puts it: Old whales are idle. New whales are exposed. Neither is pressing the market – yet. But once the range breaks, the reaction could be sharp. In short, Bitcoin holders should closely monitor realized price levels. If BTC maintains a price above $105,000, newer capital is likely to remain stable. However, a drop below that could weaken the floor and invite downside pressure.

That said, a few warning signs point to potential short-term weakness. For instance, BTC deposits to Binance have been rising steadily after months of decline, indicating that selling pressure may increase in the near future. At press time, BTC trades at $113,500, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

With speculation mounting that the SEC may withdraw its appeal, investors are recalibrating their expectations—some now targeting 20x returns , with prices potentially climbing past $40 if institutional inflows ignite post-ETF approval. On-chain data shows consistent whale accumulation despite short-term pullbacks like the recent –6.5% dip on August 2, reinforcing the view that smart money is preparing for a decisive breakout. The prospect of a U.S.-listed XRP spot ETF has reenergized the community, and analysts argue that legal clarity could finally unlock the long-stalled upside. At the same time, many retail traders are hunting for newer opportunities with similar potential but fewer regulatory hurdles – sparking fresh interest in high-traction presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional cues align with ETF optimism Multiple market analysts agree that XRP’s trajectory hinges on one factor: regulation. A spot ETF would require the SEC to cease its legal pursuit, a move that would not only enable relisting on U.S. exchanges but also pave the way for institutional exposure via regulated channels. If this scenario unfolds, capital could pour in similarly to what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF approvals. Reports indicate that whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP are already repositioning in anticipation, a strong sign of conviction. Still, some investors see faster ROI potential outside legacy altcoins, especially as timing and entry costs become crucial considerations in a maturing bull cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A presale play attracting serious attention Amid the growing buzz surrounding XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as one of the most trustworthy early-stage crypto plays on the market today. Its smart contracts recently passed multiple security audits , reinforcing its reputation as a safe and credible investment vehicle. With community growth accelerating and early-stages allocations rapidly disappearing , the project has also topped several crypto media watchlists in recent days. Compared to legacy assets like XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean-slate narrative, free from legal entanglements but packed with breakout potential . For risk-tolerant investors, it represents a calculated entry point into what some analysts call “t he next big story in crypto ”. Risk appetite shifts as breakout bets intensify XRP remains a compelling hold for long-term investors betting on regulation-driven rallies. But as the broader market recovers and sentiment tilts bullish , traders are expanding their exposure to include high-momentum, low-barrier presales with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this thesis perfectly – pairing real community growth with strategic development and audit-backed trust signals . Its rising profile across crypto Twitter and Telegram groups suggests that investor buzz is peaking at just the right moment. Conclusion: From legal win to breakout bets XRP’s legal clarity could catalyze a 20x surge , but for those looking to enter earlier, faster-growing narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s ongoing presale may offer a sharper edge. With trust confirmed via recent audits and rising demand threatening to close allocations, it’s one of the few altcoin stories keeping pace with XRP’s bullish momentum.

On-chain data analytics firm, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), disclosed this in an X post. According to Sentora , the stablecoin volume for July was over $1.5 trillion, surpassing previous highs, including May 2025, when it was $1.39 trillion, and April, when it was $1.44 trillion. Based on the chart, the new high continues a positive trend in on-chain stablecoin settlement since the start of 2025. While the volume was just $950 billion at the start of the year, it has been over $1.2 trillion in every other month of the year, apart from January and February. Stablecoins monthly on-chain volume (Source: Sentora) Interestingly, August has already recorded almost $200 billion in on-chain volume across the first five days and is now on track to finish above $1.2 trillion by the end of the month. Meanwhile, experts have attributed the surge in on-chain volume for stablecoins to increased DeFi activity. According to Defillama, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours to reach $137.33 billion. This is mostly due to Ethereum performance, with the network performance and ETH resurgence driving renewed interest in DeFi activity. Sentora data also backs this up with the data analytics firm noting that DeFi has reached a three-year high of $179 billion this week, thanks to inflows into liquid staking protocols and ETH ascent towards $4,000. USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin transactions The new milestone reflects stablecoins’ growing adoption and increasing use for on-chain transactions. With the US finally passing the GENIUS Act stablecoin law, the fiat-pegged tokens have seen their role in the financial system cemented. Interestingly, Circle USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin volume throughout 2025, accounting for between 48% to 40% of all DeFi transactions involving stablecoins. In comparison, Tether USDT usually accounts for around 27% – 20% of the total volume each, while MakerDAO DAI also records between 33% and 17% depending on the months. This highlights USDC dominance on-chain, especially in recent years, with USDT and DAI now taking the backseat, although they had commanded more volume at different times. Still, these three stablecoins account for over 90% of the on-chain monthly stablecoin volume, with only Ethena USDe coming close at around 3%. Meanwhile, USDT usage for on-chain transactions is growing again. The stablecoin has seen sizable growth on DeFi protocols this year, with the amount of USDT supplied on Aave increasing by 123% year to date and now close to $7.5 billion. Stablecoin supply inches close to $370 billion While USDC might dominate on-chain transactions, it is USDT that remains the biggest stablecoin by supply. With a market cap of $164.70 billion, the stablecoin, which has seen its supply increase by 3.28% in the past month, now has 61.41% dominance. By comparison, USDC supply is only $63.85 billion. With a similar growth trajectory over the past month, it looks unlikely to match the USDT level in supply at this rate. Meanwhile, Ethena USDe, Sky Dollar USDS, and Dai have $9.517 billion, $4.87 billion, and $4.33 billion. USDe has been one of the best-performing stablecoins in the past month, with 79.47% growth, a performance only bested by Falcon USD (USDf), which has seen a 102% increase in that period, going from $552 million to $1.09 billion. Overall, the stablecoin market cap has reached $268.20 billion after adding $13.2 billion in the past month. At the current market cap, stablecoin supply has already doubled in the past year, and it looks set for more growth, especially as clarity continues to develop. In a sign of regulatory clarity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued guidance allowing some fully backed redeemable USD stablecoins to be classified as cash equivalents. This is expected to provide some clarity in the meantime before the broader regulations arrive. Get seen where it counts.

The meme coin market is no longer a joke – it’s an evolving space where strategic early access often leads to life-changing profits. With new ecosystems rising and retail investor interest soaring, meme coins have transformed into serious contenders in the digital asset class. From secret staking pools to deflationary tokenomics, today’s meme coins are offering more than laughs – they’re delivering utility, hype, and substantial upside potential. Among the best-positioned tokens of 2025 is MoonBull ($MOBU), whose Whitelist is live now. Alongside promising projects like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF), MoonBull is emerging as a clear standout for investors seeking the next 100x opportunity. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) The MoonBull Whitelist is officially open – and it’s already being hailed as one of the most thrilling early access opportunities in the meme coin universe. What sets this apart is its razor-sharp exclusivity. Joining the whitelist gives you a front-row seat to the $MOBU revolution, packed with perks designed to reward early believers. Here’s what whitelist members get access to: Bonus Token Allocations : More $MOBU for the same investment, giving early birds a major edge. Hidden Staking Rewards : Passive income boosters not available to the general public. Early Roadmap Access : Get insider updates before they hit the streets. And here’s the kicker: this is strictly first-come, first-served. The faster you act, the more you stand to gain. All it takes is a simple email submission to lock in your whitelist spot. As launch inches closer, whitelisted users will be the first to receive exclusive notifications about the exact presale date – well before the public even sniffs it. This isn’t theoretical potential. It’s a real-world shot at being part of the next crypto breakout, and it’s unfolding now. Reference Past Whitelist Wins: A Proven Formula for Early Success In early 2024, Layer 2 meme coins like $TOSHI on Base offered early investors exclusive airdrops that were never made available to the general public. Similarly, $WEN – launched via Solana’s memecoin incubator – rewarded whitelist holders with 10x gains in under a month. Whitelisted wallets for $WEN also received free NFTs and pre-market access to its companion dApp. MoonBull ($MOBU) builds on these proven success models with an evolved approach specifically tailored to the meme coin generation of 2025. Its whitelist isn’t just an early bird ticket – it’s a launchpad for maximized gain. Those on the hunt for the best new coin launch in 2025 will find Moon Bull leading the charge with Ethereum-based security, real staking mechanics, and reward systems inspired by the biggest meme coin wins of the last bull cycle. 2. Test ($TST) Test ($TST) is a controlled experiment turned market phenomenon. Originally designed as a limited-release meme project, Test now leads in transparency, dev commitment, and organic virality. With no pre-mines and a locked liquidity strategy, it avoids many common pitfalls associated with rug pulls. It recently introduced a liquidity farming initiative allowing users to earn native rewards simply by holding the coin and participating in the community’s governance decisions. The buzz surrounding Test accelerated after several analysts began tracking its wallet activity and saw consistent accumulation across long-term holders. Smart money seems to be betting heavily on Test’s scalability. Test made it to this list because it defied initial skepticism and evolved into a case study for what successful meme coin experimentation looks like. 3. Coq Inu ($COQ) Coq Inu ($COQ) is more than a humorous reference – it’s a cultural movement backed by real-world engagement. Designed for maximum virality, Coq Inu’s meme architecture is coupled with robust marketing mechanics, including influencer collaborations and viral trend hijacking. Built on Avalanche, it leverages fast finality and low gas fees, enabling frictionless transactions. Its growing NFT partnership wing recently announced a drop themed around early crypto memes, aimed at further increasing its community footprint. What distinguishes Coq Inu is its consistent volume and multi-language support that has fueled international adoption. Coq Inu earns its spot here by combining viral branding with real-world functionality, paving the way as a leading example of meme coin globalization. 4. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Cheems ($CHEEMS) has become synonymous with meme coin nostalgia. Initially a tribute to one of the most beloved doge memes, it has transitioned into a smart-contract-driven meme ecosystem that rewards staking and participation. What elevates Cheems from copycats is its novel burn-and-earn mechanism. Tokens are permanently burned in proportion to user staking milestones, helping reduce total supply while rewarding committed holders. Cheems is also launching a comic-themed P2E game featuring community-voted storyline arcs. This adds a gamified layer to its token utility. Cheems is included in this list for its ability to retain cultural relevance while integrating innovative token mechanics that appeal to long-term holders. 5. Sudeng ($HIPPO) Sudeng ($HIPPO) is a quiet disruptor. Operating on a low-noise, high-delivery framework, HIPPO has seen consistent wallet growth and strategic exchange listings. Unlike many coins that rely solely on hype, HIPPO focuses on value-added features like LP auto-refill mechanisms and AI-generated meme campaigns. It recently launched HIPPO DEX, a decentralized trading platform aimed at meme tokens and microcaps, offering zero-slippage swaps during peak market activity. HIPPO has gained popularity in Southeast Asian and Latin American markets thanks to its community-centric strategy. Sudeng belongs on this list because it’s quietly building an infrastructure that positions it for breakout growth in the next meme cycle. 6. Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) holds a foundational position in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Functioning as the governance token of ShibaSwap, it allows users to vote on platform proposals and yield farming configurations. Recent upgrades to the ShibaSwap interface, coupled with BONE’s integration into upcoming Shibarium Layer 2 updates, are expected to multiply its utility. Its listing on major exchanges further affirms growing institutional interest. BONE has also partnered with decentralized identity projects to create wallets that integrate meme culture and serious DeFi protocols. BONE is featured in this list because it successfully bridges meme popularity with serious governance roles in a top-tier ecosystem. 7. AI Companions ($AIC) AI Companions ($AIC) merges two of the most innovative verticals: AI and crypto. Designed as a meme coin with a mind, AIC allows holders to interact with decentralized AI bots that evolve based on community training data. With a roadmap that includes AI-driven staking pools, voice-enabled wallet interactions, and NFT-based personality upgrades, AIC offers more than just meme value – it delivers tech utility. AIC recently released a teaser of its AI Meme Engine that generates viral memes using blockchain oracle data, a tool already gaining traction across social platforms. AI Companions made this list because it is redefining what meme coins can do in a Web3-AI integrated future. 8. Comedian ($BAN) Comedian ($BAN) brings a laughter-first philosophy with serious crypto fundamentals. Known for its censorship-resistant joke NFTs, BAN has built a fully decentralized meme publishing protocol. Its DAO structure votes on weekly joke contests, rewarding participants in BAN tokens. Its P2E comedy dungeon game is scheduled to launch Q2 2025 and features token-powered performance slots and improv challenges judged by the community. BAN made this list due to its novel integration of decentralized content creation and meme tokenomics, offering a blend of fun and functionality. 9. SLERF ($SLERF) SLERF ($SLERF) might just be the meme coin wildcard of the year. With a stealth launch that attracted 20,000 holders in under 48 hours, SLERF relies on zero marketing and 100 percent organic traction. The dev team claims no central leadership, no VCs, and no paid influencers. Its gamified airdrop mechanism locks rewards behind puzzle challenges, driving community engagement. Upcoming plans include the release of an animated meme film funded entirely by the community treasury. SLERF is included in this list because it proved that meme virality and utility can coexist even in the absence of traditional promotional channels. Conclusion: Secure the Next Big Wave Before It Leaves the Shore Based on the latest research, the new coin launch in 2025 includes MoonBull. Alongside MoonBull ($MOBU), other standout meme coins like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF) are drawing serious attention for their blend of utility and community impact. MoonBull whitelist offers a low-entry path into high-potential projects. With limited whitelist spots and early access incentives, getting in early could be the smartest crypto move of the year. As more countries adopt Bitcoin reserves and regulation adapts to support innovation, these tokens could define a new era of community-driven value creation.

This week we interviewed Eric Dresdale, President and Co-Founder of Entrokey Labs. White Hat (WH): What was the genesis for Entrokey Labs? Eric Dresdale (ED): Entrokey began with a patented innovation from KNWN Technologies, using cosmic radiation to generate quantum-resistant digital identities. After key conversations between myself and my co-founder David Harding, we realized this breakthrough could be a perfect response to the rising threats from AI and quantum computing. We set to work to evolve it from space-based to hardware-based, and ultimately into a software-only solution powered by generative AI trained on natural entropic phenomena. WH: What is Entrokey’s competitive edge? ED: EntroKey is rebuilding the cryptographic foundation for the post-quantum era, fixing entropy at the source to secure the world’s most critical digital systems. In crypto, blockchain, and Web3, we ensure the integrity of key generation and synchronization, enabling resilient wallets, trustless protocols, and quantum-safe infrastructure without hardware dependence. Our lightweight, stateless random number and key generator safeguards everything digital — from individual privacy to global enterprise systems — enabling organizations to scale trust and security without friction. WH: Who would best benefit from Entrokey’s security protocol? ED: Entrokey is a dual-use technology, making it ideal for governments, defense, and national security agencies where cryptographic integrity is mission-critical. In parallel, we are targeting regulated industries such as cloud providers, financial services including crypto and stablecoins, healthcare, and aviation where trust, compliance, and AI and post-quantum resilience are essential. WH: Crypto trading platform WOO X was hacked recently, how could have Entrokey prevented this? ED: Phishing happens. But with Entrokey, access alone is not enough. Our keys are bound to high-quality entropy and the environment they were created in. So even if an attacker gets in, they cannot use or move anything. No static keys to steal, no way to spoof the system. That is how we contain damage before it starts WH: What advice do you have for everyday crypto users to protect themselves? ED: Use an MPC or hardware wallet — These eliminate single points of failure. No seed phrase, no static key to steal. Watch for phishing — Most hacks start with a fake link. Never connect your wallet unless you're 100 percent sure. Keep your funds off exchanges — Centralized platforms are honeypots. If you're not trading, withdraw and hold on a cold wallet.

One of the most popular tools for gauging this mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital indicator recently shifted, moving from “Greed” to a “Neutral” reading of 54 as of August 6. This change reflects a cooling of intense optimism and suggests a more balanced, yet cautious, crypto market sentiment among participants. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies whether investors are feeling overly greedy (potentially leading to a market correction) or excessively fearful (which might signal a buying opportunity). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, often selling assets in panic. 25-49: Fear – General apprehension and uncertainty prevail. 50-54: Neutral – The current zone, indicating a balanced outlook without strong emotional biases. 55-74: Greed – Enthusiasm is growing, and prices might be rising. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often a sign of market tops. Understanding this scale helps you interpret the current investor sentiment and consider how it might influence market movements. How Does the Index Measure Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture of the market’s mood. These factors collectively capture various aspects of market volatility and activity, giving us a holistic view. Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Assesses current market volume and momentum. Strong buying volume usually points to greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various social media platforms, looking at crypto-related discussions. Surveys (15%): Historically involved polls about market outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors move from altcoins to Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like “Bitcoin price manipulation.” Each of these elements contributes to the final score, offering a nuanced perspective on prevailing crypto market sentiment . What Does “Neutral” Sentiment Really Mean for Investors? The recent shift to a “Neutral” reading of 54 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of equilibrium. It means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed dominates the market. For investors, this balanced state can imply several things: Uncertainty: A neutral reading often reflects a wait-and-see approach, where investors are not rushing into major decisions. Consolidation: Prices might move sideways, consolidating recent gains or losses as the market digests new information. Opportunity for Analysis: This phase provides an excellent opportunity to conduct thorough research rather than acting on impulse. It’s a time to evaluate fundamentals and technical indicators without the noise of extreme emotions. While some might view “Neutral” as uneventful, it is a crucial period for strategic planning. It suggests the market is taking a breath, potentially preparing for its next significant move, influenced by upcoming news or broader economic factors. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively? It serves as a valuable sentiment tool, but it’s important not to rely on it in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Historically, extreme fear has often presented buying opportunities, while extreme greed has preceded market corrections. A neutral phase prompts careful consideration. Combine with Other Indicators: Always pair the index with technical analysis (e.g., support/resistance levels, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (e.g., project developments, adoption rates). Risk Management: A neutral reading doesn’t eliminate risk. Maintain a diversified portfolio and stick to your risk management strategy, especially given ongoing market volatility . Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates, as these can quickly shift investor sentiment from neutral to either extreme. The index is a powerful indicator of human emotion in the market. Use it to understand the crowd’s psychology, but always make decisions based on your own research and financial goals. The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 54, settling into the “Neutral” zone, signifies a momentary pause in the intense emotional swings of the crypto market. This balanced state provides a valuable opportunity for investors to assess their positions without the pressure of extreme panic or euphoria. While not a definitive trading signal, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment empowers you to make more rational, data-driven decisions. Always remember that successful investing combines sentiment analysis with thorough research and a disciplined approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. 2. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. 3. What does a “Neutral” reading on the index mean? A “Neutral” reading, like the current 54, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market. It suggests a period of balance, uncertainty, or consolidation. 4. Should I make investment decisions based solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the index is a sentiment tool and should not be used in isolation. Always combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and your own risk management strategy for informed decisions. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The original content states that the survey component is currently paused, though the specific reason for the pause is not detailed within the index’s public information.

The guidance declares that liquid staking activities do not constitute securities transactions. This means participants would not be required to register such activities with the SEC. This move could ease regulatory pressure on blockchain networks and DeFi platforms offering these services. However, Crenshaw believes this interpretation is dangerously misleading. Crenshaw said the Liquid Staking Statement builds one assumption on top of another, creating what she described as a shaky wall of facts disconnected from the realities of the industry. She added that the guidance provides little clarity, lacks a legal foundation, and merely reflects the SEC staff’s views—not the Commission’s official position. Crenshaw criticized the guidance for drawing “definitive declarations about how liquid staking works” without providing evidence or addressing the diversity of staking mechanisms across blockchain ecosystems. She warned that the guidance fails to offer meaningful direction for companies trying to stay compliant. SEC’s liquid staking guidance sparks division Earlier in the day, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a legal interpretation stating that liquid staking—a system that allows users to earn staking rewards while still being able to trade or move their staked tokens—is not a securities offering. This clarification means platforms offering liquid staking services may not have to register with the SEC under current securities laws, potentially opening the door for broader innovation and user adoption. The stance represents a continuation of the pro-innovation regulatory steps rolled out under the Trump-era Project Crypto, which promoted hands-off regulatory approaches in certain aspects of the crypto economy. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also made a statement after the release from the agency, claiming that liquid staking is similar to a popular practice of leaving goods with an agent who gives receipts in return . Peirce wrote that the Division’s statement makes it clear that, in its view, liquid staking activities tied to protocol staking do not constitute the offer and sale of securities. But Crenshaw was quick to distance the full Commission from this interpretation. Crenshaw stated that the guidance holds no binding authority and does not represent the consensus of the Commission, either presently or in the future. She argued that the legal conclusions within the document rest entirely on narrow, hypothetical assumptions. If a liquid staking product differs significantly from the outlined assumptions, the exemption likely wouldn’t apply. Commissioner urges caution among liquid stakers Crenshaw’s warning was stark: don’t rely on this guidance as a free pass. She noted that any entity whose liquid staking program differs in any way from the long list of assumptions in the Liquid Staking Statement should take caution, emphasizing “caveat liquid staker”—a Latin phrase meaning “let the liquid staker beware.” She emphasized that entities operating in the liquid staking space are still at risk of enforcement, especially as the SEC continues its broader crackdown on crypto-related securities violations. Crenshaw has long voiced concerns that certain crypto products and platforms are sidestepping investor protections. Her comments mirror a broader fissure at the Commission on how to approach fast-changing digital money systems. Some staffers and commissioners argue that the existing regime only needs to be tinkered with to suit itself to crypto; Crenshaw is advocating a stricter, more data-informed approach. She argued that the rule cannot create regulatory certainty on unsupported assumptions. Some in the crypto world voiced a sense of hopefulness, however guarded. Perhaps most encouraging from a regulatory perspective, those in liquid staking saw enough in this statement to help them innovate without immediately worrying about regulatory hammer fallout. Still, Crenshaw’s dissent raised red flags with legal experts, who said the dissent, read literally, means any departure from those assumptions in staff guidance could lead to an enforcement action.

A prominent investor, known as @qwatio, faces the imminent threat of a substantial Bitcoin liquidation . This isn’t just any trade; it’s a staggering $115 million BTC short position , putting immense pressure on the market and the trader. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s High-Stakes Bet What exactly is happening? According to observations shared by @EmberCN on X, this particular Hyperliquid whale has placed a colossal bet against Bitcoin’s price. Their short position, valued at an eye-watering $115 million, is dangerously close to its liquidation point. The critical price level where this massive position could be forcibly closed is $114,491. For those new to the space, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market movements. A “short position” is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. If the price rises instead, the trader incurs losses, and if it hits the liquidation price, their position is automatically closed to prevent further losses, often leading to significant capital loss for the trader. The Perilous Dance of a $115M BTC Short Position The situation became even more dramatic earlier today. To avoid the dreaded Bitcoin liquidation of their massive BTC short position , the investor made a desperate move. They reportedly closed an Ethereum (ETH) short position at a loss. This action was a strategic, albeit costly, attempt to increase the margin for their Bitcoin bet, giving it more breathing room against the rising price. This maneuver highlights the extreme crypto trading risk inherent in highly leveraged positions. Traders often use leverage to amplify potential returns, but it also magnifies potential losses, making liquidation a constant threat if the market moves against their bet. The sheer scale of this particular position makes its potential liquidation a point of intense focus for market observers. What Does Imminent Bitcoin Liquidation Mean for the Market? When a large position like this faces Bitcoin liquidation , it can have ripple effects. The automated selling that occurs during liquidation can add selling pressure to the market, potentially causing further price drops, especially in illiquid conditions. While the overall market might absorb a $115 million liquidation, it still represents a significant event that traders and analysts closely monitor. The ability to track such events is largely due to the transparency offered by on-chain data . Analysts like @EmberCN can observe large movements and positions on decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, providing crucial insights into market sentiment and potential volatility. This transparency, while beneficial for market analysis, also puts a spotlight on individual traders’ high-stakes endeavors. Lessons from High-Leverage Crypto Trading Risk This unfolding scenario offers valuable lessons for all participants in the crypto market, especially those considering leveraged trading. The immense pressure on the Hyperliquid whale underscores the critical importance of risk management. Even experienced traders can find themselves in precarious positions if they misjudge market movements or overextend their leverage. Understand Liquidation Levels: Always know the exact price at which your position will be liquidated. Manage Your Margin: Proactively add margin or reduce position size before it becomes a desperate last-minute scramble. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged bet. Monitor On-Chain Data: While not a crystal ball, it provides valuable insights into large market movements and potential risks. The Power of On-Chain Data in Crypto Monitoring The role of on-chain data cannot be overstated in today’s transparent blockchain ecosystem. It allows for a level of market insight previously unavailable in traditional finance. By analyzing public ledger information, researchers and traders can identify significant positions, track whale movements, and anticipate potential market volatility. This real-time data empowers market participants to make more informed decisions, mitigating some of the inherent crypto trading risk . The dramatic plight of the Hyperliquid whale and their $115 million BTC short position serves as a potent reminder of the volatile and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. While the outcome remains uncertain, the situation vividly illustrates the power of market forces and the ever-present threat of Bitcoin liquidation for those who venture into leveraged positions without robust risk management. It’s a testament to the fact that even the largest players can find themselves on the brink. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a short position in cryptocurrency trading? A short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like Bitcoin) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later and return it, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the trader incurs losses. 2. What does it mean for a crypto position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a required maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial margin. 3. Who are @qwatio and @EmberCN? @qwatio is the pseudonymous trader holding the large Bitcoin short position on Hyperliquid. @EmberCN is an on-chain data analyst who brought attention to this specific high-risk trade, highlighting significant market activity. 4. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. It operates on a blockchain, offering high performance and transparency for its users. 5. How can crypto traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, setting stop-loss orders, and actively monitoring their positions to add margin or reduce exposure if the market moves against them.

According to analysts, the approval may follow the milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, investors are actively looking for other coins that may deliver massive returns before XRP gets to traditional finance. Five crypto presales already stand out due to their unique roadmaps and presale features. Investors are already accumulating the coins at a fast speed in the presale, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the forefront. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Leading with 33x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved to become the leading crypto presale before the anticipated approval of the XRP ETF. Its path is compared to the early years of Ripple in terms of ecosystem and community. Based on the Binance Smart Chain, MAGACOIN will offer staking benefits, meme potential, and a governance solution that attracts DeFi users and retail traders. The aggressive roadmap and the viral traction being made on social channels is what helps make MAGACOIN stand out. According to experts, the token has the potential for a 33x rise before the XRP ETFsurges, particularly as political meme tokens once again start to trend. The presale is currently active, and it is one of the remaining few ground-floor opportunities before the broader market catalysts step in. 2. Ozak AI – AI Meets Decentralized Analytics Ozak AI is blending artificial intelligence with decentralized analytics to revolutionize how businesses use data. The platform operates without intermediaries and offers real-time insights for sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. Its machine learning capabilities combined with blockchain security create a flexible and scalable ecosystem. Ozak AI is currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.005 per token. Over 40 million tokens have already been sold out of 200 million. 3. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – Meme Power with Real Momentum Little Pepe is one of the fastest-growing meme coins to pay attention to in 2025. The Ethereum-based project sold out Stage 8 of its presale two months earlier, raising $13.775 million. Its low token price and clear roadmap are attracting investors to rush in. Stage 9 will raise the price to $0.0018, and the present phase is a crucial entry point for investors. 4. BlockDAG – The Biggest Presale in Seven Years BlockDAG is rewriting the rules with over $361 million raised and 2.5 million users mining via its X1 app. The project is entering its final phase with only days left before its global launch on August 11. The confirmed listing price is 30 times higher than the current rate. Investors are swarming in for features like a 10 BTC auction pool and a no-vesting token release. 5. Maxi Doge – High-Yield Meme Coin Action Maxi Doge has already raised more than $315,000 in several days. The memecoin is gaining traction because of the staking rewards of more than 1,400% APY and viral branding. It provides a Web3-facilitated buying procedure and does not make any exclusive allocations but keeps all things clear and community-based. A new price increase is looming. After the presale, early investors will be able to stake or hold their tokens. Conclusion The launch of the XRP ETF has kindled new enthusiasm in the crypto industry. Retail investors are also in search of high-potential investments as institutions appear in the market. MAGACOIN is one of the most prominent presale tokens with an ambitious story. As these five coins become more popular, the opportunity to buy early could resemble the trajectory of XRP.

Investors are increasingly optimistic ahead of the SEC’s expected status report on August 15, which may finally end Ripple’s multi-year lawsuit. This outcome could unlock a flood of institutional adoption and pave the way for XRP spot ETF approvals. With whale wallets scooping up over $60 million in the token recently, market sentiment is turning decisively bullish. Whale Activity and ETF Buzz Signal Institutional Confidence XRP isn’t rallying alone as Institutional capital has flowed heavily into Ethereum and XRP over the past few weeks, according to CoinShares. XRP-related investment products saw $31.26 million in inflows, while whale trackers confirmed large transactions, including a single 20 million transfer from Upbit worth over $60 million. Additionally, anticipation is mounting over potential XRP ETF approvals. The SEC has set an October 17 deadline to rule on several XRP spot ETFs, and a recent policy shift enabling in-kind redemptions has eliminated key logistical barriers. If approved, these ETFs could dramatically reduce the token’s circulating supply and fuel further price appreciation. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

Its recent integration of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain opens the door for DeFi developers to launch dApps on the XRP Ledger using XRP for fees. Moreover, the XRPL now hosts one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury bill products, signaling its growing role in asset tokenization. Related Reading: Crash Incoming?

The cryptocurrency world constantly shifts, and understanding its dynamics is key to navigating its opportunities. Currently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 42. This figure, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), signals a clear shift: we are in a Bitcoin Season . What does this mean for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Let’s dive in. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market . As reported by CoinMarketCap, the index recently registered 42, a slight dip from the previous day. This specific number is crucial because it indicates that Bitcoin is currently outperforming the majority of altcoins. Index Range: The index scores from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, this phase begins when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 42 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season , highlighting a period where the leading cryptocurrency dominates market gains. Why Are We Seeing a Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors contribute to the current Bitcoin Season , influencing altcoin performance . Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, especially during periods of uncertainty or when institutional interest grows. Investors might gravitate towards Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” asset within the volatile crypto space. Key drivers often include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic shifts can push investors towards less speculative assets, and within crypto, Bitcoin often fills this role. Halving Narratives: Anticipation around Bitcoin’s halving events can drive significant pre-halving rallies, drawing capital away from altcoins. Spot ETF Approvals: Recent developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, have channeled substantial institutional capital directly into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and dominance. This increased focus on Bitcoin naturally impacts the Altcoin Season Index , pushing it lower as altcoins struggle to keep pace. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed investment decisions. During a Bitcoin Season , it is common for altcoins to either consolidate or see declines against Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but their gains may be less pronounced or even negative compared to Bitcoin’s. Consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Portfolio: Assess your exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. You might consider rebalancing if your portfolio is heavily skewed towards underperforming altcoins. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, projects with robust technology, strong communities, and clear use cases may still perform well in the long term. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those bullish on specific altcoins, DCA can be an effective strategy to accumulate assets at potentially lower prices. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a valuable tool to gauge shifts in market sentiment and identify potential turning points. When Might Altcoin Performance Rebound? The question on many investors’ minds is: when will the pendulum swing back, and when can we expect a strong Altcoin Season ? Historically, after periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This typically happens once Bitcoin’s rally cools down or consolidates at new highs. Watch for these signs: Bitcoin Price Stability: A period of consolidation for Bitcoin after a significant rally can free up capital for altcoin speculation. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Track Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A clear downtrend here often precedes an altcoin surge. Increased Volume in Altcoins: A significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins can signal renewed interest. The Altcoin Season Index will be your go-to metric, showing a sustained move above 75 as altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 42 clearly indicates we are in a Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to the broader altcoin market. While challenging for some altcoin holders, it presents opportunities for strategic rebalancing and focusing on long-term potential. Staying informed about crypto market trends and understanding the dynamics of altcoin performance are crucial for navigating these cycles effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, often tracked by CoinMarketCap, that measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin are performing better over a 90-day period. It indicates whether the market is in an “Altcoin Season” or a “Bitcoin Season.” Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season is determined when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index typically falls below 75 during this period. Q3: Should I sell all my altcoins during a Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While altcoins may underperform Bitcoin during a Bitcoin Season, selling all holdings might lead to missing out on future rallies. It’s often recommended to re-evaluate your portfolio, consider dollar-cost averaging, and focus on projects with strong fundamentals for long-term potential. Q4: What are the key indicators that an Altcoin Season might be approaching? Key indicators include Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, a declining Bitcoin dominance chart, and a significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index moving above 75 would confirm its arrival. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index include all cryptocurrencies? No, the Altcoin Season Index typically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to focus purely on the performance of native altcoins against Bitcoin within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Top-tier users enjoy perks like account managers and custom deals, but Stake’s withdrawal process can slow down, especially with large amounts. Also, the climb through levels may not appeal to users who prefer instant perks right from the start. For those who value structure and don’t mind the wait, Stake is still a strong choice, even if it lacks Spartans’ fluid experience. Roobet: Community-Centered with Personalized Bonuses Roobet earns a place among the best crypto gambling platforms by focusing on community and frequent player perks. It’s a favorite for regular users thanks to cashback, birthday rewards, and offers tailored to personal activity. VIP members also get exclusive gifts and merchandise. That said, Roobet’s payout system still involves reviews for larger sums, making it less suitable for those who want instant crypto access. Its VIP setup adds value but focuses more on engagement and experience rather than offering the raw advantages that big-stakes players seek. BetMGM: Familiar Comforts, Less Crypto Focus BetMGM appeals to those who prefer the feel of a traditional casino. Its VIP club features hotel perks, events access, and personal support for high-tier members. This appeals to users who enjoy combining real-world luxury with online betting. But when measured against the best crypto gambling platforms, BetMGM falls short on crypto compatibility. Its focus is still tied to fiat systems, with limited support for fast crypto withdrawals. That makes it less efficient for users who want frictionless rewards and quick access to their winnings. 1xBet: Massive Markets With Tiered VIP System 1xBet offers an extensive range of betting options, from global sports to niche markets, and pairs this with a multi-level VIP club. Users get cashback and rewards based on points. It’s a good fit for those who like variety and structured bonuses. Still, it doesn’t fully stand with top-tier crypto-native platforms. While crypto options exist, payouts may be slower, and bonuses often come with tight playthrough terms. It serves global high-volume players well, but lacks the speed and direct perks that define the best crypto gambling platforms. Final Thoughts The best crypto gambling platforms in 2025 go beyond loyalty tiers. Serious players want fast service, flexible benefits, and bonuses that reflect their activity. Spartans leads with its crypto-first model, instant payouts, and real-time perks. While Stake.com and Roobet bring organized loyalty systems, and BetMGM and 1xBet offer traditional VIP comfort, Spartans provides a full-service experience shaped around the needs of modern high-stakes users. Those who expect top treatment and quick access to their rewards will find Spartans to be the standout name among the best crypto gambling platforms .

49610545,548510,1754442023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49610545.jpeg,Coinbase Plans $2 Billion Private Convertible Note Offering Following Q2 Results,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-plans-2b-private-convertible-offering/,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private convertible note offering following a weaker-than-expected second-quarter performance. The move comes as COIN shares recorded a 15% decline on August 4, reflecting market reactions to the company’s reported drop in revenue and increased operational costs. Details of the Convertible Note Offering According to the announcement, the proposed fundraising will be conducted through a private placement targeting qualified institutional buyers. The offering will consist of two tranches of senior unsecured notes, each worth $1 billion, set to mature in 2029 and 2032 respectively. Coinbase stated that the proceeds would be allocated toward capped call transactions to limit dilution risks, with the remaining funds earmarked for general corporate purposes , including working capital, acquisitions, and potential debt repurchases. The $2 billion offering is structured as two separate note issues, one due October 1, 2029, and the other due October 1, 2032. Both instruments are convertible into cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of the two, at Coinbase’s discretion. The company also provided an option for initial buyers to purchase up to an additional $300 million in notes across both series, depending on investor demand at the time of pricing. Convertible notes are often used by companies seeking to access liquidity while managing potential shareholder dilution. Coinbase plans to enter into capped call transactions on each tranche, which can offset future conversion costs if its stock trades above a predetermined level. These hedging activities may involve trading Coinbase’s shares or related derivatives during and after the pricing period. The final interest rates and conversion terms will be determined upon completion of the offering. At the time of writing, COIN shares is down over 3%, dropping to $307 levels. Market Context and Investor Reactions Coinbase’s fundraising initiative follows a broader trend among cryptocurrency firms turning to convertible debt as a financing tool amid volatile market conditions. Other companies in the sector, including Marathon Digital (MARA), have recently issued similar instruments to promote balance sheet flexibility. Analyst sentiment on Coinbase remains mixed following its Q2 earnings release. While research firm Benchmark maintained a “Buy” rating, citing long-term growth opportunities, other analysts, including Mizuho, highlighted pressure on revenue streams such as USDC-related interest income from issuer partner Circle. Mizuho’s note suggested that shrinking margins from Circle’s reserves could affect Coinbase’s subscription and services revenue mix in upcoming quarters. The planned $2 billion raise is seen as part of Coinbase’s strategy to secure capital ahead of potential market shifts while maintaining options for managing existing debt obligations, such as the company’s outstanding 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2031 convertible and senior notes.

The Ethena chart setup is flashing a pattern that could lead to a move toward $1.33, a repeat of a rally traders still remember. Toncoin is feeling the pressure, dropping 3.63 % and moving closer to its $2.93 support level. Both are holding at important price zones, waiting for the next push. The wider market may be uncertain, but one project is moving in the opposite direction. Cold Wallet ($CWT) presale has already pulled in over $5.7M and sold more than 643.72 million coins in just 16 stages. The buys are not random, they are large, focused, and coming in before the next stage price increase. While others hold back, Cold Wallet (CWT) is being actively picked up by whales, pushing it into the spotlight among the best cryptos right now. Ethena Chart Hints At 89% Move Momentum builds in Ethena via a familiar pattern. Technicals echo a past breakout event. In 2024 ENA formed a falling wedge and double‑bottom structure. That led to an 89 % rally. Today’s dip mirrors that cycle. Current price action shows retest of the 200‑day moving average. Resistance lies near $0.70. A clean breakout above this level may push price toward $1.33. If it matches last year’s playbook, the move could be repeatable. Current chart setup remains bullish provided the neckline clears. Toncoin lurks Near $2.93 Support Toncoin sentiment is turning cautious. A 3.63 % daily drop pushed price down to $3.26. At the same time, trading volume jumped by almost 50 %, signaling rising sell‑side pressure. RSI trends toward oversold territory. The critical support at $2.93 is under test. If that level breaks, the price could fall toward $2.50. Some expect a rebound back to $3.43. Macro concerns weigh on market mood. Regulatory uncertainty linked to Telegram integration adds to the unease. Despite over 1,000 dApps supported and strong network speed, the sentiment remains divided. Dilution risk and competitive pressure further cloud the outlook. Bulls remain hopeful of rebound but overall market tone stays cautious. Cold Wallet Presale Attracts Whales With $5.7M Funding Cold Wallet presale has already raised over $5.7M at the current price of $0.00924 in Stage 16. More than 643.72 million coins are sold out of a 150‑stage schedule. Strong whale interest is driving early stage buys in a structured pattern. At the $0.00924 presale stage, large wallets are stacking coins before price moves upward. These purchases are deliberate and high‑value rather than spread‑out small buys. Such activity confirms serious confidence in Cold Wallet as one of the best crypto assets right now. Whale transactions have increased chatter across crypto channels. Big wallets entering at this stage signal rising trust. Over 643.72 million coins are already taken and more than $5.7M is raised. Only 134 stages remain before presale ends. Early holders paying $0.00924 could see a return near 3700 % if the token lists at $0.3517. That potential ROI makes every large wallet move significant. This profit projection stands at about 3,700 % from the entry price of $0.00924 to the launch price of $0.3517. Utility underlies the demand. Cold Wallet presale grants access to platform perks, early feature entry, and higher staking rewards. Participants at this stage secure more than just a coin, they gain privileged access running alongside the system. Whale behaviour reflects early strategic positioning, not speculation only. Wallets are backing Cold Wallet while price remains favorable. This presale shows that Cold Wallet is a platform with rising demand. With $5.7M raised, 643.72M coins sold, and strong whale uptake, it stands out amid broader market uncertainty. The momentum built by early stage participation paints a clear picture: Cold Wallet could deliver hefty gains for those joining now. Conclusion Looking at recent market moves, the gap between these updates is clear. Ethena’s chart hints at another possible rally, repeating a setup that previously took price near $1.33. Toncoin’s path looks tougher, with selling pressure building and sentiment split as it tests its $2.93 support. Cold Wallet tells a very different story. With over $5.7M raised, more than 643.72 million coins sold, and a projected 3,700 % ROI for those buying now at $0.00924, whale activity is building fast during the early stages. This surge in high‑value buys suggests Cold Wallet has become the preferred choice in the current market. Waiting too long could mean missing the most favorable entry point before the next price shift.

49610649,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=173604,1754442041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49610649.jpeg,Whale Shorts XRP & SOL Before Crash—DOGE Profits Revealed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whale-shorts-xrp-sol-before-crash-doge-profits-revealed/,"XRP and Solana just experienced a sharp shake-up, triggered by a wave of high-leverage short positions from crypto whales. With tens of millions poured into bearish bets, both tokens were pushed into volatile territory, leaving traders scrambling. But while the pressure mounted across much of the altcoin landscape, Dogecoin quietly posted another win—defying gravity with solid support and new gains. And beneath the surface of this volatility, another altcoin has started generating real buzz: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early investors are paying close attention to its momentum, as it rides market chaos with surprising resilience. XRP Faces Aggressive Whale Shorts XRP became the target of large short positions in early August, with at least one major whale placing a $3.33 million bet against it using 20x leverage around the $2.93 level. Cumulatively, shorts across XRP and Solana topped $17 million—applying strong sell-side pressure that briefly knocked XRP below $3. Despite the dip, not all shorts ended profitably. XRP quickly rebounded, triggering liquidations for over-leveraged traders. Still, sentiment remains conflicted. Some analysts forecast further declines toward $2.76, while others point to whale accumulation as a sign of long-term confidence. As Ripple pushes ahead with its Trust Bank initiative, XRP walks a fine line between bullish structural changes and looming short-term resistance. Solana Slips Amid Heavy Dumps Solana didn’t fare much better. One whale reportedly sold $17 million in SOL, aligning with a sharp 12% price decline over the past week. Technical charts now reflect a “rounding top” pattern—commonly seen before extended downtrends. If SOL fails to maintain its current support, analysts suggest a possible slide toward $120. Still, other large players continue to buy the dip, with some institutional wallets slowly building positions. This split sentiment underscores the broader theme: whales are using volatility to play both sides, long and short. Dogecoin Proves Surprisingly Resilient While other altcoins wobbled, Dogecoin showed strength. DOGE briefly climbed past $0.20 before consolidating just below it around $0.198. Strong volume spikes accompanied breakout attempts through $0.194 and $0.198—signals that traders haven’t lost interest. For August 2025, DOGE’s forecast range sits between $0.192 and $0.259, with upside potential toward $0.30 if momentum holds. Meme coin sentiment remains one of crypto’s most unpredictable forces—and Dogecoin appears to still be riding the wave. New Money Eyes Emerging Altcoin Contender As Whales are Shorting XRP and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture 24,800% ROI Before the Market Rebounds. That’s the claim making the rounds among crypto analysts tracking capital rotation into early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has recently seen a surge in whale-led inflows, even as larger-cap altcoins face heavy downside. This mirrors the kind of early activity seen in SHIBA and DOGE before their meteoric rises.With a capped token supply, a strong community, and a developer-backed roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a credible contender for the next big altcoin breakout. Investors who missed DOGE’s rise are watching closely – and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Volatility Rewards the Prepared Whether it’s XRP’s short-fueled swings, Solana’s uncertain footing, or Dogecoin’s steady grind upward, one thing is clear—whales are moving the market. For traders and investors watching from the sidelines, this volatility isn’t just noise—it’s opportunity. And with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining ground with every cycle shift, early positioning could unlock outsized rewards before the next bull leg begins.

Cardano is holding its bullish setup, managing to stay above key supports despite recent pressure. Ethereum is seeing a spike in open interest, signaling more leveraged trading and speculation around its next move. Both have signs worth tracking, but neither offers hands-on interaction before a launch. BlockDAG (BDAG) is different. It opens up a live trading environment now, giving buyers full access to BUY and SELL features, live BDAG/USD pricing, and instant wallet updates. This makes BlockDAG a standout choice for anyone weighing what crypto to invest in, as it delivers an active experience long before exchange listings. Cardano Bullish Setup Holds Firm Above Support Cardano continues to show strength despite a recent pullback, keeping its position inside a broader upward channel. Its price is holding above the 50-day EMA, a zone that has repeatedly attracted buyers. Sellers briefly pushed the price lower, but steady accumulation around the mid-range kept it from sliding further. Momentum indicators like RSI show that ADA is cooling off but not losing strength, leaving space for a possible rebound. The MACD also remains above its signal line, although the gap is narrowing, hinting that momentum could build again soon. Trading volumes show no major selling spikes, suggesting that this is a pause rather than a reversal. If ADA maintains its current range and reclaims near-term resistance, another upward push could follow. Ethereum Market View Shows High Activity and Rising Leverage Ethereum’s futures market is experiencing record open interest, now above $50 billion. This surge signals a strong rise in speculative and institutional activity. Over the past month, open interest has climbed 64%, showing that traders are heavily engaging in leveraged positions and expecting price movement soon. ETH has reclaimed a key zone between $3,150 and $3,300, turning it into both support and resistance for the current structure. This buildup in derivatives shows confidence, but it also raises risk, as high leverage often leads to sharp moves when sentiment flips. Historically, ETH performs well under these conditions, making this a period to watch closely for breakout potential. From Presale to Live Exchange Simulation: BlockDAG Changes the Game Most presales follow the same script: raise money, promise tools, and keep people waiting. BlockDAG breaks that pattern with its live, interactive trading dashboard. Through its latest version, users can experience a true simulation of exchange trading before the project even goes public. Inside this dashboard, buyers see real-time BDAG/USD price charts, a functioning order book, and instant wallet balance updates after every simulated trade. It’s not just a demo; it feels close to real market action. This changes how early participants view presales, turning a once passive process into active involvement. BlockDAG has already proven strong market traction, raising $362.5 million and selling over 24.7 billion coins. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, marking a 2,660% ROI from the very first batch. But the most exciting part is the special GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer: until August 11, BDAG can be purchased for just $0.0016, a massive discount that could see up to 3,025% returns once it lists at $0.05. This is not just about a low price; it’s a chance to engage with a working product ahead of time, while securing an early position before wider public access pushes prices higher. For anyone deciding what crypto to invest in, BlockDAG stands out by delivering both real utility now and one of the strongest potential ROIs in the market. In a Nutshell Cardano’s solid chart structure and Ethereum’s high market activity offer good reasons to watch both assets. But they still rely only on market speculation. BlockDAG delivers something far more tangible. With a live dashboard that includes real-time price feeds, working BUY and SELL options, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG is already functioning like a full-fledged exchange before its official launch. For those looking at what crypto to invest in right now, BlockDAG offers rare early-stage access, strong numbers, and one of the biggest potential ROIs in the market.

Recently, the Base network outage caused a temporary halt, sparking discussions across the crypto community. This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the intricate technicalities that underpin our decentralized future. What Caused the Coinbase Base Network Outage? On a recent Tuesday, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, experienced an unexpected 33-minute halt in its block production. This disruption wasn’t due to a malicious attack but rather a critical internal system failure. The active sequencer, a vital component responsible for ordering transactions, began to lag. An automated internal system, designed to maintain stability, promptly initiated a switch to a backup sequencer. However, this crucial transition failed. The primary reason for this failure was an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup system. Consequently, the network found itself unable to process new transactions or produce new blocks, leading to the brief but significant outage. This incident highlighted the delicate balance required for continuous operation within a complex Layer-2 blockchain environment. Understanding Layer-2 Blockchain Challenges and Network Stability What exactly is a Layer-2 network like Coinbase Base network , and why are sequencers so important? A Layer-2 blockchain is built on top of a main blockchain (like Ethereum) to increase its transaction throughput and reduce costs. It processes transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. Sequencers play a pivotal role in these networks. They are responsible for: Ordering Transactions: Ensuring transactions are processed in the correct sequence. Batching: Grouping multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch for efficient settlement on the main chain. Submitting Data: Posting the batched transaction data back to the Layer-1 blockchain. When a sequencer fails, as happened with Base, the entire process grinds to a halt. This directly impacts network stability and user experience, demonstrating the need for robust redundancy and flawless backup systems. Even a short outage can undermine trust and disrupt ongoing operations for users and decentralized applications alike. Lessons from the Base Network Outage: Ensuring Resilience The recent Base network outage provides valuable lessons for the broader blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the absolute necessity of rigorous testing and meticulous setup for all critical infrastructure components, especially backup systems. Relying on automated failovers is good, but only if those failovers are perfectly configured and ready to take over without a hitch. For users, such incidents emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying technology of the networks they use. While brief, this halt meant transactions could not be processed, potentially delaying operations for businesses and individuals on the network. For developers and network operators, the takeaway is clear: Comprehensive Testing: Continuously test backup systems under various conditions. Complete Configurations: Ensure backup sequencers and other critical components have identical and complete sequencer configuration to the active ones. Redundancy Beyond Basics: Explore multi-sequencer setups or decentralized sequencer models to minimize single points of failure and enhance overall network stability . This incident, though quickly resolved, serves as a powerful reminder that even leading platforms must remain vigilant in their pursuit of uninterrupted service. What Does This Mean for the Future of Base? While the 33-minute halt was inconvenient, it’s important to view it in context. The quick identification and resolution of the issue by the Base team demonstrate their operational capabilities. Incidents like these, while challenging, often lead to stronger, more resilient systems as lessons are learned and improvements are implemented. The commitment to enhancing network stability remains paramount for the continued growth and adoption of the Coinbase Base network . This event will undoubtedly prompt a thorough review of their backup protocols and configuration management, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable Layer-2 solution. The goal for all decentralized networks is to achieve near-perfect uptime, and every incident, big or small, contributes to refining that pursuit. The Base network outage , though brief, highlighted a critical vulnerability in its backup systems. A simple configuration error on a backup sequencer brought the entire network to a standstill for 33 minutes. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of meticulous planning, thorough testing, and robust redundancy in the complex world of Layer-2 blockchains. As the ecosystem matures, ensuring unwavering network stability will be key to fostering wider adoption and trust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer-2 blockchain developed by Coinbase, built on top of Ethereum to provide faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions. Q2: What caused the recent Base network outage? A2: The outage was caused by an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup sequencer. When the active sequencer lagged, the automated switch to the backup failed, halting block production.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The maturing digital assets market that has sophisticated market making, capital markets, and decentralized finance, is still lacking one key market infrastructure to compete with traditional finance: an institutional-grade credit agency. Architect aims to change this by launching crypto's first institutional-grade credit ratings service, similar to traditional finance's Moody's – because most TradFi ratings agencies just won't touch crypto. Sure, Moody's has dipped its toes into digital assets , but a full-blown credit agency that operates only in crypto is still missing. This is partly because crypto does not have a trusted intermediary to objectively assess creditworthiness, according to Ruben Amenyogbo, Architect's Managing Partner. The industry's anonymous actors, unconventional data, and opaque risk profiles make traditional underwriters nervous, leaving potential lenders reluctant to provide debt financing, Amenyogbo said. Then there is the ongoing surge of publicly traded companies, including miners and crypto treasury firms. They are all attempting to provide equity investors with exposure to crypto via stocks. But that market is now saturated and overvalued. “Crypto equity is extremely overvalued. Way too much money has been raised chasing equity opportunities in crypto,” said Amenyogbo. This combination of a lack of credit agencies and an exhausted equity market creates the perfect storm for a new opportunity in Web3. “There's a huge opportunity in credit, but no one's provided the missing market structure needed to assess risk properly,"" he said. This is where Architect comes in with plans to utilize its proprietary blockchain-based data to systematically evaluate credit risk and unlock new pools of institutional capital. Amenyogbo believes that the crypto market has now matured enough to support institutional-grade credit analysis. “With equity, you look forward, you assess future growth,” Amenyogbo said. “With credit, you must look backwards and ask, ‘Have these people reliably performed?’ Crypto was too young and unproven for that until recently, but now there’s enough history for meaningful credit analysis.” So who benefits from such service? Bitcoin miners and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) primarily, according to the Architect. In theory, with access to fiat credit, miners could reduce forced selling, allowing them to stake more assets, generate greater on-chain activity, and shift from reactive outflows to productive economic contribution, a “double knock-on effect” that turns liquidity pressure into real value creation. ""If I want to speculate on bitcoin, I would buy bitcoin. But as a credit lender, I can underwrite a bitcoin miner and make a bet on that mining operation and its cashflows outcompeting the market,” he said. Meanwhile, Architect sees Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) as a particularly attractive and underfunded niche for credit, with Amenyogbo explaining that DePIN provides real economic outputs rather than merely betting on digital asset price appreciation. In the end, Architect’s ultimate ambition isn’t just to lend, it’s to rebuild crypto’s capital stack from the ground up. By positioning itself as the first credible risk assessor for decentralized infrastructure and applying TradFi-grade underwriting standards, the firm hopes to unlock a new wave of institutional capital. “Raising a $100 million fund is cool, but it’s just a drop in the ocean,” Amenyogbo said. “What we’re really doing is laying the groundwork for crypto credit to scale the way traditional debt does, bundled, rated, insured, and syndicated into the largest pools of capital in the world.” Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading above $114K. ""Until BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume, the path of least resistance could remain sideways to down. Opportunistic traders may continue to find short-term setups in memecoins and alt-beta, but the broader picture hasn’t flipped,"" market maker Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk. ETH: ETH is trading at $3500, down 2.8% as ETF outflows ramp up. Gold: Gold prices dipped during the U.S. trading day, as a stronger U.S. dollar and falling oil prices weighed on sentiment, while silver saw modest gains and mixed global economic signals, including robust Chinese services data and growing Fed rate cut odds, added complexity to market direction. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday after Wall Street losses, as investors digested weak U.S. economic data and new technology tariff remarks from President Trump, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipping 0.12%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 fell 0.49% Tuesday as weak economic data and fresh Trump tariff remarks fueled concern, though analysts expect the bull market to continue despite near-term volatility.

Meanwhile, emerging meme coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention as it aims for the $5 mark. The project is worth $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The 7th phase will appreciate by 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are expecting a 71.43% return when the token is launched at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $14 million in funding and has received over 14,800 investors. As crypto markets pulse with ETF-driven momentum, Mutuum’s unique infrastructure positions it at the intersection of capital efficiency and trustless innovation, setting a compelling tone for what could be a pivotal quarter. Cardano (ADA) Nears $1 as ETF Optimism Builds Cardano is currently trading around $0.72 supported by a strong technical setup following a breakout above the $0.64 resistance zone. Institutional inflows and rising ETF approval odds, now estimated between 79% and 84%, are boosting sentiment and fueling a rally that analysts expect could target $1.00, with stretch objectives ranging from $1.30 to $1.80+ in 2025. While resistance near $0.77–$0.74 remains crucial, maintaining support above $0.70 could sustain bullish momentum toward key levels. In parallel, some attention is also shifting toward emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance as investors explore next-gen utility narratives. Investors Eye 71% Gains in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale stage 6 due to a presale stage 5 sell-out. Phase 6 investors will enjoy a 71.43% return on investment at token launch. More than $14 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is an increase of 14.23% over Stage 6. Mutuum Finance Boosts Protocol Security with Bug Bounty Supported by CertiK Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with security and transparency partner CertiK. Users will be rewarded 50,000 USDT in value for reporting probable bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four severity classes; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Mass MUTM Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway in which individuals who take part in the contest will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, with each token being worth $10,000. Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending revolution in a product that offers the maximum level of asset control to customers. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform developed by combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to the P2C lending pool comes through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing sentiment of the market, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of lending. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, creating room for direct lending, which is appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Cardano may be on track to reclaim $1, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself for much larger gains. Currently priced at $0.035 in phase 6, early investors could lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06, with longer-term upside potentially reaching $5. Backed by a $14M+ raise, 14,800+ investors, a CertiK-audited bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, MUTM is quickly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi plays of 2025.

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Cipher Mining made headlines with its latest operational update. The company announced its July performance, revealing a strategic approach to managing its digital assets. What Does Cipher Mining’s Latest Report Reveal? In an announcement made on August 5th via GlobeNewswire, Cipher Mining confirmed its operational results for July. The company reported a significant Bitcoin mining output while also detailing its sales activity for the month. This balance between mining new coins and selling existing ones offers valuable insights into their financial strategy. Bitcoin Mined: Cipher Mining successfully mined 214 BTC during July. This demonstrates their continued efficiency and operational capacity in the demanding Bitcoin mining sector. Bitcoin Sold: The company strategically sold 52 BTC in July. This decision helps cover operational expenses, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market conditions. Total BTC Holdings: Despite the sales, Cipher Mining’s total Bitcoin holdings grew to an impressive 1,219 BTC. This indicates a net accumulation strategy, strengthening their overall position in the cryptocurrency market . Why Do Bitcoin Miners Engage in BTC Sales? For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Cipher Mining, selling a portion of their mined Bitcoin is a common and necessary practice. It is not always a sign of distress; rather, it’s often a calculated move essential for sustainable growth. Miners face substantial operational costs that require regular capital injections. Consider these key reasons: Covering Operational Costs: Running a large mining facility demands significant electricity, maintenance, and infrastructure investments. Selling BTC provides the fiat currency needed to cover these ongoing expenses. Liquidity Management: Maintaining a healthy cash flow is crucial for any business. Strategic sales ensure Cipher Mining has sufficient liquidity to adapt to market changes or pursue new opportunities. Market Optimization: Miners may sell BTC when they perceive favorable market prices, allowing them to maximize revenue from their production. This proactive approach is part of a robust digital asset strategy . Analyzing Cipher Mining’s Growing BTC Holdings The fact that Cipher Mining’s total BTC holdings reached 1,219 BTC, even after selling 52 BTC, highlights a key aspect of their business model: accumulation. Many large miners aim to grow their Bitcoin reserves, viewing them as long-term assets. This strategy allows them to benefit from potential future appreciation of Bitcoin’s value. Their growing holdings reflect: Confidence in Bitcoin: Holding a significant amount of BTC signals the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and value proposition. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial Bitcoin reserve enhances the company’s balance sheet, potentially making it more attractive to investors and lenders. Strategic Flexibility: Larger holdings offer more flexibility for future financial maneuvers, whether it’s further sales, collateralization, or other forms of digital asset strategy . What Does This Mean for the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The activities of major miners like Cipher Mining have a ripple effect on the broader cryptocurrency market . When miners sell, it adds supply to the market; when they hold, it reduces potential selling pressure. Their operational updates provide valuable indicators of industry health and sentiment. This report suggests that despite some sales, Cipher Mining remains focused on growth and accumulation. This generally positive sentiment from a significant industry player can contribute to overall market confidence. Investors often watch miner activity closely for clues about market direction and underlying supply dynamics. Cipher Mining’s July report offers a clear picture of a well-managed Bitcoin mining operation. Their strategic decision to sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin while simultaneously increasing their overall BTC holdings showcases a balanced and forward-thinking digital asset strategy . This approach allows them to cover operational costs while continuing to build their long-term asset base in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market . It’s a testament to the complex but often rewarding dance between generating revenue and accumulating valuable digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Cipher Mining? Cipher Mining is a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in Bitcoin mining operations. They utilize advanced infrastructure to mine new Bitcoin, contributing to the network’s security and earning rewards. Q2: Why did Cipher Mining sell 52 BTC in July?

49612432,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780050,1754444451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49612432.jpeg,New Zealand jobless rate hits 5-year high as economic slowdown deepens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-zealand-jobless-rate-hits-5-year-high/,"New Zealand’s job market loses steam, with unemployment rising to a 15-year high of 5.2% in Q2. That is the strongest reading since the first full quarter of recovery following COVID in Q3 2020. In the second quarter , the jobless rate was 5.2%, slightly higher than 5.1% during the first three months of the year. Although the increase was below market expectations (economists predicted 5.3%), it further fuels worry about a wider economic slowdown. Employment also shrank by 0.1% during the quarter, matching analyst expectations. The drop may seem modest, but in context, it marks the latest sign that economic momentum is fading. Abhijit Surya, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the Reserve Bank was unlikely to take comfort in the slight rise in the unemployment rate, noting that a closer look at the data revealed significant slack in the labour market. The weakening labour market is emerging alongside sluggish consumer spending, contracting manufacturing and services sectors, and a languishing housing market — all of which point to a slowing economy. Participation drops as workers step back As previously pointed out, more people were jobless, and fewer people were even looking for work. The labour force participation rate — the working-age population either with a job or actively seeking employment — declined to 70.5%, down from Q1’s 70.7%. That marked the lowest level since early 2021. However, the hit has been even harder on mid-teenagers and young workers when we dig deeper into the data. Whether it was an artificial boom in the few months when workers were hard to come by during the post-pandemic hiring spike, many went into the labour market. Nonetheless, when the economy takes a hit and employers engage in less than whiplash hiring activity, these groups are often the first out of the door. Teenagers, in particular, were leaving the job market, many opting to return to school or study rather than being classed as jobless, said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac in Auckland. Year-on-year, total employment fell by 0.9%, confirming that the slowdown is not just a seasonal blip, but part of a broader cooling in the economy. Workers see slower wage growth amid rising costs Adding to the unease is a continued slowdown in wage growth. According to today’s report, annual wage inflation slowed for the ninth consecutive quarter. Ordinary time wages for non-government workers rose just 2.2% compared to a year earlier — down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. That signals a diminishing bargaining power for workers, even as the cost of living remains high for many households. Despite the year-on-year slowdown, quarterly wage growth grew slightly, rising 0.6%, above economists’ expectations of 0.5%. Meanwhile, average ordinary time hourly earnings for non-government workers jumped 1.9% from the previous quarter — the strongest quarterly rise since Q3 2020. Although the rise in pay growth looked encouraging, some analysts dismissed it as potentially short-lived or a function of different types of workers making up a larger share of employment rather than broad wage inflation. Businesses may be dishing out higher wages to keep on skilled workers while pulling back elsewhere in terms of headcount. That said, real wage growth underperforms for many employees, while inflation remains elevated and still tightens household budgets. The labour market data has added weight to expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will soon resume cutting interest rates. The RBNZ had forecast a 5.2% unemployment rate in May, but it also predicted employment growth of 0.2%, a clearly missed target. With inflation showing signs of easing and economic growth stalling, pressure is mounting on the central bank to support the economy. Most analysts now expect the RBNZ to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3% at its next meeting on August 20, especially after pausing in July.

49612842,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799170,1754445604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49612842.jpeg,Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory—Top Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-stuck-macro-purgatory-q4-or-bust/,"In his August 5 “Macro Monday” livestream, crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz delivered a review of the market’s late-summer state, arguing that while Bitcoin’s price action has gone quiet, the broader cycle remains intact. “We’re in this pocket of seasonal weakness for August and September that we typically see most years,” he explained, pointing to seasonality charts showing that historically, Bitcoin underperforms in this time window. “It’s a high likelihood that August and September is a giant nothing burger,” he added. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? At day 978 of the current cycle, the question many investors are asking, Olszewicz noted, is simple but existential: is the cycle already over? Will it end this year? Or is there more upside ahead? His answer leaned cautiously optimistic. “I’m in the ‘probably not over yet, could continue’ camp,” he said. “But we will have to see what happens in Q4. Ultimately, that’s going to determine it.” From a technical standpoint, the analyst sees no reason to declare the top is in. “Technicals still look fine. Price still looks okay. We had a pullback. All that is fine,” he said, emphasizing that Bitcoin has not yet exhibited the typical parabolic advance associated with major tops. Nor have other macro or on-chain metrics shown signs of terminal overheating. “We don’t have other metrics screaming from the rooftop saying it’s time yet.” Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ However, the short-term setup is underwhelming. After a cup-and-handle breakout that briefly pushed price toward the $122,000–$123,000 region, momentum faded. Olszewicz doubts such levels can be reclaimed soon: “In the next two weeks we’ll know if we can start to creep back towards $120,000, which is asking a lot admittedly for August.” The wildcard, he said, is ETF flows. “Do we see ETF flows for any reason? Then do we see treasury companies continuing to buy? Those are the marginal buyers right now.” He suggested that ETF buyers could return due to a combination of underweight positioning, opportunistic dip-buying, and monthly rebalancing dynamics. Still, he remains neutral overall. “Just a general softening of any bullishness we may have had,” he said. “Now it’d be a different story if this is October and we’re seeing this. That’s not normal.” A further reason for caution is the collapse in futures basis across major assets. “Premium is all the way down to under 7% on BTC. It’s under 8% on ETH. And I think SOL is a little more illiquid, but even SOL is way down—15% from 35%,” he noted. That contraction in futures premiums, typically a sign of speculative demand drying up, reflects a broader risk-off mood. “Not a lot of bullish sentiment, not a lot of craziness,” Olszewicz observed. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Losing Steam? Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support On-chain risk metrics confirm the trend. “There’s a decline here in risk appetite,” he said, referring to metrics like unrealized profit versus MVRV. He added that if Bitcoin were to enter a parabolic advance, “you will see this metric shoot up… But what’s it going to take?” Q4 Or Bust He floated a few possibilities: rate cuts, weakening Fed independence, or perhaps just seasonal strength and macro chaos in Q4. But for now, he advised traders to “take it easy on the 50X leverage,” especially those who’ve already made significant gains this cycle. “Do I need to put risk back on? Do I need to be as risky as I was earlier?” he asked rhetorically. “Or does it make more sense to be less risky here?” From a macroeconomic perspective, the picture is mixed. Inflation data from Trueflation remains low—currently at 1.65%—but Olszewicz warned that new post–August 1 tariffs may raise prices in the months ahead. “We are adding inflationary pressures with tariffs, no doubt about it,” he said, though the effect will take time to appear in the data. Meanwhile, core PCE is headed in the wrong direction, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is printing 2.1% growth for Q3—hardly recessionary, but not robust either. Labor market data continues to cloud the outlook. “If we account for a non-collapsing labor force participation, we could be as high as 4.9% on the actual unemployment rate,” Olszewicz warned. “And we’re continuing to see a degradation in job availability for manufacturing,” particularly in “Heartland Rust Belt types of jobs.” Liquidity dynamics are also in flux. He drew attention to the draining of the Fed’s reverse repo facility—once a $2 trillion reservoir of sidelined capital—which has supported risk assets through 2023 and 2024. “As this gets drained closer to completion, there’s a potential likelihood for liquidity hiccups and a liquidity intervention by the Fed,” he said. Importantly, this has kept overall US liquidity flat, offsetting quantitative tightening. “Despite QT, the drain of the reverse repo has offset QT, and US liquidity by this metric has been basically flat since 2022.” What changed the game, Olszewicz said, was not liquidity per se, but the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. “That has really been, in my opinion, a big difference maker,” he explained. “We got ETF approvals here, ETF started trading here, and the rest is history as far as flows are concerned.” In conclusion, Olszewicz emphasized that while the broader risk appetite has declined and price action remains dull, there is no evidence yet that the Bitcoin cycle has topped. “The cycle’s probably not over,” he said. “It’s just sleeping—and Q4 will ultimately determine whether it wakes up.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,041.

At the same time, the company has scaled back its exposure to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), signaling a shift in portfolio allocation strategy. Galaxy Digital Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Cuts Back On Ethereum According to the Q2 2025 report, Galaxy Digital posted a net income of $30.7 million for the quarter, reflecting strong financial performance across its core business segments. A key milestone during the quarter was the company’s official listing on Nasdaq under the ticker GLXY, which took place on March 16. Galaxy’s net digital asset holdings now stand at approximately $1.2 billion at current market prices – a 40% increase compared to Q1 2025. The jump in portfolio value was largely driven by the sharp rise in Bitcoin’s price over the past three months. To recap, BTC was trading near $70,500 on March 31. By June 30, it had surged to $108,700, marking a gain of more than 50% in just one quarter. The table below shows that as of June 30, the firm held 17,102 BTC, up from 12,830 BTC at the end of Q1. However, this accumulation came alongside a reduction in the company’s ETH and XRP positions, suggesting a cautious or rebalanced approach toward altcoins. Specifically, Galaxy’s ETH holdings declined from 155,026 ETH on March 31 to 90,521 ETH by the end of June. Other digital assets in the firm’s portfolio include Solana (SOL), Hype (HYP), SUI, and stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC. In addition to changes in crypto holdings, the firm also reported a strong increase in assets under management (AUM), which rose to $8.9 billion – up 27% quarter-over-quarter. Assets under stake also climbed to $3.1 billion, representing a 34% increase. The company anticipates continued strength into Q3, stating: July marked the strongest monthly financial performance for our Digital Assets operating business in the firm’s history, with record results in Global Markets and steady progress in Asset Management & Infrastructure Solutions. Will Galaxy Digital Adjust Its Crypto Strategy? While Galaxy Digital increased its BTC holdings and reduced ETH exposure in Q2, recent developments suggest the firm may adjust its portfolio strategy based on capital rotation and shifting market trends. Last week, a Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallet linked to Galaxy Digital initiated a massive sale of 22,700 BTC. The sell-off weighed on the market, bringing Bitcoin’s net realized profit down to $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently stated that Ethereum is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term, citing ETH’s expanding ecosystem and accelerating innovation. At press time, BTC trades at $113,230, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum|Galaxy Digital|solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 02:00:34

This bold prediction is backed by a range of technical models, Fibonacci cycles, and bullish macro trends. As the crypto market digests this news, XRP and ETH analysts are weighing the impact on altcoins, signaling the potential for a major price rally across the sector. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a high-profile altcoin, with analysts calling for even bigger gains and 31x upside before the next cycle peak. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Analysts Are Targeting $175K Bitcoin price news today is dominated by forecasts of $175,000 by September 2025. EGRAG Crypto, known for accurate technical calls, cites the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and 21-week EMA patterns—pointing to historical cycle peaks right at the $175K level. His timeline lines up with other prominent crypto analyst predictions, who reference a clear BTC and ETH price correlation when forecasting tops. Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell, who nailed earlier cycles, also backs the $175K BTC price target, using network inflows and historical trends. Robert Kiyosaki’s call for Bitcoin to reach $175,000–$350,000 in 2025 rounds out a strong consensus that the next phase of institutional adoption could send BTC much higher. The question on everyone’s mind: will Bitcoin hit $175,000, and how will altcoins react if it does? XRP and ETH Analysts React to Bitcoin’s Breakout Target The Bitcoin 2025 price prediction is pushing analysts to revisit their XRP price reaction and ETH analyst reaction calls. Many expect XRP and ETH to track Bitcoin higher, with XRP analyst predictions after Bitcoin surge pointing to potential rallies if BTC breaks out. XRP price prediction 2025 ranges from $5 to $8 if Bitcoin’s momentum continues, but volatility remains. The impact of Bitcoin price on altcoins is also showing up in ETH price prediction 2025 models, with most analysts calling for a new ETH high if BTC holds its gains. Ethereum price forecast after Bitcoin rally is bullish, driven by network upgrades and ETF inflows. Ripple news today and Ethereum market outlook both reflect a bullish sentiment as crypto market sentiment 2025 shifts into risk-on mode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Expect Bigger Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating serious hype among traders looking for high-upside altcoin price movement after Bitcoin surge headlines. With Bitcoin’s forecast now at $175K, some MAGACOIN analysts are projecting up to 31x gains for early holders, making it one of the top stories in crypto analyst predictions for Q3 and Q4. Why is MAGACOIN FINANCE getting so much attention? The project’s explosive community growth, active governance, and strong narrative are all driving rapid wallet expansion and increasing daily volume. As the rest of the market focuses on BTC and ETH short-term moves, investors searching for the next big opportunity are positioning ahead of what could be a new cycle leader. The current crypto market sentiment 2025 favors high-upside altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its ability to move independently, drawing both meme coin capital and strategic traders. With a 31x upside still on the table, this emerging project is on every radar. Wrapping Up The Bitcoin forecast raised to $175K has set a bullish tone for the rest of the market.

However, the bears were active near the $115,500 resistance and the price struggled to continue higher.

Consequently, the firm now possesses 480,031 ETH. The total ETH stack is now valued at $1.65 billion. Simultaneously, a specific ETH-based altcoin project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing significant investor attention during its ongoing presale. SharpLink’s strategic Ethereum bet SharpLink Gaming is actively mirroring successful Bitcoin treasury strategies. The company is firmly committed to Ethereum instead. This latest purchase, averaging $3,530 per token, involved using USDC over two days. Moreover, SharpLink appointed Joseph Chalom, formerly of BlackRock’s digital assets division, as Co-CEO in late July. This leadership move signals deep expertise guiding its crypto investment strategy. Consequently, SharpLink has positioned itself among the largest corporate holders of Ethereum globally. Overall, corporate ETH holdings now exceed 2.74 million tokens, worth $9.71 billion, indicating strong institutional crypto investment interest. Despite SharpLink’s stock (SBET) rising 35% monthly and 112% year-to-date, some analysts caution about its premium valuation. They suggest direct ETH exposure or crypto ETF products might offer clearer value propositions for investors monitoring crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum continues accelerating impressively. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out rapidly. Investors have already contributed over $14,100,000 since the presale began. Furthermore, participants have snapped up more than 665 million MUTM tokens. Total MUTM holders now stand at 14,800. The current price per token in this phase is $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase, or 3.5 times, the opening phase price of $0.01. The opportunity to acquire tokens at this level is diminishing quickly. Phase 7 will commence shortly, introducing a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Purchasing now, therefore, guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment. Future crypto predictions suggest significantly higher potential gains post-launch. Some analysts forecast targets reaching $1.50 or beyond based on platform adoption. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. CertiK awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an outstanding security score of 95.00. This result confirms a solid security posture for the platform. Importantly, auditors found zero vulnerabilities within the examined smart contract code. Furthermore, no security incidents have occurred during the past 90 days. To enhance security further, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK again. They launched an official Bug Bounty Program. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is available for ethical hackers. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: Critical findings: Highest rewards Major, minor, and low findings: Proportionate rewards This proactive approach incentivizes thorough scrutiny and strengthens the protocol continuously. Major giveaway fuels community excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is celebrating its presale progress enthusiastically. The team announced its largest giveaway ever. Participants stand to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of tokens.

This system incentivizes holding and strengthens long-term commitment among major supporters. Final thoughts SharpLink’s massive Ethereum acquisition underscores a strong institutional belief in ETH’s value. Concurrently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a timely presale opportunity within this growing altcoin segment. With its current price at $0.035 in Phase 6, the guaranteed 71% ROI at launch and strong post-launch crypto predictions present a compelling case.

His team is expected to issue an executive order within days. According to a report from The Independent, the order will push regulators to dig into possible breaches of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust rules, and consumer protection laws. It could hit banks with hefty fines, consent decrees, or other penalties. Background Of Banking And Crypto Clash Industry voices say crypto firms have long felt frozen out by big banks. They point to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” under the Biden years, which they claim led to sudden account closures without clear reasons. BREAKING: Trump to prepare executive order that punishes banks that discriminate against conservatives, according to Wall Street Journal report. — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) August 5, 2025 In 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said JPMorgan Chase warned it would shut accounts tied to main crypto income. In November the following year, Elon Musk said as many as 30 tech entrepreneurs lost bank access under that policy. Banks have since pushed back. They say decisions were about anti-money laundering rules. They add that managing reputational risk lets them guard against fraud and legal trouble. Trump To End Banks’ ‘Reputational Risk’ Shield According to The Wall Street Journal , the order will tell federal bank overseers to look for violations of key laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act bans discrimination in lending. Antitrust laws keep competition fair. Consumer protection statutes shield against unfair practices. If banks are found at fault, they face monetary penalties or binding consent orders. The move aims to stop banks from using compliance as an excuse for political bias. It could also strip away so-called reputational risk guidelines that critics blame for “debanking.” Penalties And Enforcement Based on a report by Reuters , the order could be in force as early as this week. It will empower regulators to impose fines or other disciplinary steps. It also asks the Small Business Administration to review banks that guarantee SBA loans. That means any lenders accused of cutting ties with certain customers may face fresh scrutiny. Calls for comment to the White House went unanswered, according to Reuters. The Politics Of Banking Cuts Trump has been outspoken about big banks. In January, he accused the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America of turning away conservative clients. The banks denied the claims. At the same time, Republican politicians and state officials have slammed “woke capitalism,” saying banks are cutting off gun makers, fossil fuel firms, and others that lean right. Those voices helped shape the executive order’s focus.

Analysts Split on What’s Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-gearing-up-for-a-major-move-analysts-split-on-whats-next/,"Ethereum’s price has experienced moderate declines over the past week, dropping around 5% after a period of notable gains in previous months. At the time of writing, ETH is trading near $3,633, fluctuating between the $3,500 and $3,700 range over the past day. This price movement follows a broader market cooling, with many traders engaging in profit-taking after Ethereum’s earlier upward trend. Recent on-chain and derivatives market data suggest that Ethereum may be heading into a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Battles Key Levels – Will Buyers Step Back In? Derivatives Market Data Signals Selling Pressure CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared an outlook indicating increased selling pressure and potential short-term weakness in the ETH futures market. The analyst highlighted that despite several attempts to breach the $4,000 resistance level, Ethereum has yet to break through, indicating possible market hesitancy at current levels. Darkfost emphasized that the behavior of the futures market has shifted notably over the past few weeks. According to data from Binance, Ethereum’s taker buy/sell ratio has dropped to 0.87, one of the lowest levels observed this year. A ratio below 1 typically indicates that sell orders are dominating over buy orders, suggesting that traders are either closing long positions or opening shorts. The analyst noted that this trend began around July 18 and has remained mostly negative since then, limiting upward momentum. Additionally, the seven-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMAs) have started to trend downward, which could be a sign of slowing market momentum. Binance continues to hold the largest share of ETH futures open interest among exchanges, making sentiment on this platform particularly influential. With sellers currently exerting more control, the data suggests a potential continuation of this consolidation phase until buying activity strengthens. Mixed Views on Ethereum’s Longer-Term Outlook While near-term market data points to a challenging period for Ethereum, some analysts maintain a positive longer-term outlook. A recent post by Titan of Crypto, a well-followed market commentator on X, projected a potential price target of $8,000. According to Titan of Crypto, Ethereum’s price structure is forming a large monthly triangle pattern that could eventually lead to a breakout, opening the way toward a significant rally.

The recent approval of the XRP ETF structure by the SEC has triggered fresh optimism among traders. XRP quickly gained momentum, with Ethereum following closely behind. Both are now being watched for breakout price action as ETF-driven demand picks up. Investors see this as a key turning point. The SEC’s greenlight on in-kind crypto ETF redemptions is fueling confidence that the altcoin market is finally entering a new phase of legitimacy. As a result, capital is rotating faster than ever, with early winners already starting to form. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the mix as part of this rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital as ETF Hype Reshapes the Market As XRP gains strength from ETF approval and ETH picks up bullish momentum, traders are expanding their search beyond the top ten. Many are now moving into emerging presale tokens that carry real upside. One name catching serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its presale underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing in traders who believe this cycle still has room for smaller tokens to explode. What stands out is how quickly funds are flowing in—not just from retail wallets but also from mid-sized holders moving capital out of XRP and Ethereum. The token’s appeal lies in more than just hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean token model, clear branding, and a cultural edge that taps into real-world sentiment. Its political theme resonates with a wide online community, giving it the viral spark that earlier meme tokens needed to catch fire. Based on current inflows and presale growth, some investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver gains of up to 37x. While no token is guaranteed to hit those heights, the early demand suggests it’s becoming one of the stronger contenders in this ETF-fueled rotation. XRP and ETH Set the Stage—But Newcomers Could Ride the Wave Higher XRP’s ETF support is helping rewrite the rules for altcoin legitimacy. Ethereum is positioned to benefit next, with many expecting a spillover effect as institutions embrace a wider range of assets. But while these giants lead the headlines, smart traders are already looking at the next layer down. The presale space is heating up again, and well-positioned tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are standing out. The key isn’t just hype—it’s timing. With ETF narratives dominating, tokens that align with broader trends have a better chance of rapid growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks that box with strong community roots and growing market visibility. Conclusion: The Window for Early Movers Is Open XRP and ETH are reigniting the altcoin cycle thanks to ETF approval momentum. As capital floods back into the market, traders are not only holding the old names—they’re rotating into new ones with greater upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a standout in that shift. Its presale is gaining speed as more investors recognize the potential for strong returns in a fast-changing market.

Investors witnessed a significant downturn today as the MYX token experienced a sharp 58% drop. This dramatic fall coincided directly with a scheduled token unlock, sparking immediate questions about market dynamics and investor behavior. What Triggered the Dramatic MYX Token Unlock Impact? On-chain analysis reveals that the considerable decline in the MYX token price was not random. It directly followed a pre-scheduled token unlock event. Token unlocks release previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply, which can increase selling pressure. In this case, a major investor, Hack VC, played a pivotal role. According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, Hack VC claimed a substantial amount of MYX tokens. Specifically, they received 1,279,890 MYX, valued at approximately $2.16 million at the time. This claim originated from an airdrop contract over a seven-hour period, setting the stage for the subsequent market reaction. Unpacking the Hack VC Sell-Off Following the token claim, Hack VC proceeded with a significant Hack VC sell-off . The firm executed two separate transactions to offload these newly acquired tokens onto the market. Such large-scale selling by a prominent investor can significantly influence a token’s price, especially if market liquidity is thin. Here’s a closer look at the impact of this specific event: Increased Supply: The release of 1.28 million MYX tokens from a locked state instantly increased the circulating supply. Investor Behavior: Hack VC’s decision to sell immediately after claiming suggests a strategy to realize profits or reduce exposure, contributing heavily to the downward pressure. Market Reaction: The sheer volume of the Hack VC sell-off overwhelmed buying demand, leading to the rapid price depreciation of the MYX token. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility After Token Unlocks The incident with MYX highlights a common pattern in the crypto space: the heightened crypto market volatility around token unlock events. When large tranches of tokens held by early investors or project teams become liquid, there’s an inherent risk of increased selling pressure. This can lead to sharp price corrections, even for otherwise promising projects. Understanding the token unlock impact is crucial for any crypto investor. These events are often publicly scheduled, allowing market participants to anticipate potential supply increases. However, the exact timing and scale of selling activity by specific entities, like the recent Hack VC sell-off , can be unpredictable and cause significant price swings. What Does This Mean for MYX Token Holders? For current holders of the MYX token , such a sharp decline can be concerning. It underscores the importance of thorough research into a project’s tokenomics, including its vesting schedules and unlock dates. While some projects mitigate the impact of unlocks with buybacks or strong development news, others may experience significant price discovery downwards. Investors should consider these points: Risk Assessment: Always evaluate the risks associated with token unlocks. Diversification: Avoid over-exposure to any single asset, especially those with significant upcoming unlocks. Long-Term View: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might present buying opportunities, but careful due diligence is paramount. The MYX token’s recent performance serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unforgiving nature of the digital asset market. In conclusion, the dramatic fall in MYX token price following its token unlock and the substantial Hack VC sell-off provides a valuable case study in the complexities of crypto market dynamics. It reinforces the critical need for investors to stay informed about tokenomics, vesting schedules, and the potential for increased crypto market volatility around such events. Understanding the immediate and long-term token unlock impact is key to navigating these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the MYX token price to drop so sharply? The MYX token price dropped significantly due to a large volume of tokens being unlocked and subsequently sold by a major investor, Hack VC, immediately after they claimed their tokens from an airdrop contract. What is a token unlock? A token unlock is a scheduled event where previously locked cryptocurrency tokens, often held by early investors, team members, or advisors, become available for trading. This can increase the circulating supply and potentially lead to selling pressure. Who is Hack VC and what was their role in the MYX token event? Hack VC is an investor in MYX Finance. They claimed 1,279,890 MYX tokens (worth approximately $2.16 million) from an airdrop contract and then sold them in two separate transactions, directly contributing to the MYX token price decline. Is it common for crypto prices to fall after a token unlock? Yes, it is relatively common for cryptocurrency prices to experience downward pressure or increased volatility after a token unlock, especially if large amounts of tokens are released and subsequently sold by major holders. How can investors prepare for potential token unlock impact? Investors can prepare by researching a project’s tokenomics, understanding its vesting schedule and unlock dates, and assessing the potential supply increase. Diversifying portfolios and practicing risk management are also crucial strategies. Did you find this analysis insightful?

One significant indicator of market health and sentiment is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process, often misunderstood, reveals massive shifts in trader positions and can signal impending volatility or corrections. Over the last 24 hours, we’ve witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering critical insights into current market trends. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what futures liquidation means. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. When a trader’s position, whether ‘long’ (betting on price increase) or ‘short’ (betting on price decrease), falls below a certain margin requirement, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This forced closure is called liquidation. It’s a mechanism to manage risk, but it can also amplify market moves, creating cascading effects. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have shown significant activity in the crypto perpetual futures market. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $107.83 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 68.95% of these were ‘long’ positions. This indicates that a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price increase faced forced closures, suggesting a recent downward price movement or a sudden dip caught many off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $56.59 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of ‘long’ positions at 82.67%. This strong bias towards long liquidations for BTC further emphasizes a prevailing bearish sentiment or sharp price corrections that impacted bullish traders. MYX: Interestingly, MYX recorded $15.60 million in liquidations, but here, ‘short’ positions accounted for 69.36%. This means traders who were betting on MYX’s price decrease were liquidated. This could point to a sudden upward price movement for MYX, contrasting with the general trend seen in ETH and BTC. These figures provide a snapshot of the intense pressure and rapid shifts occurring in the market. What Do These Liquidation Trends Tell Us About Crypto Market Analysis? Understanding these liquidation patterns is vital for accurate crypto market analysis . The high percentage of long liquidations for ETH and BTC suggests that these assets experienced notable price declines over the 24-hour period, catching many bullish traders by surprise. Such events often lead to increased selling pressure as liquidated positions add to the supply, potentially causing further price drops. Conversely, the significant short liquidation for MYX indicates an unexpected upward price surge, forcing bearish traders to close their positions. These contrasting movements highlight the diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of individual altcoins compared to market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders must always consider these underlying dynamics. Actionable Trading Insights from Recent Volatility What actionable trading insights can we glean from this data? Firstly, the prevalence of long liquidations for major assets like ETH and BTC underscores the importance of robust risk management. Over-leveraging in a volatile market can quickly lead to devastating losses. Secondly, the contrasting MYX data reminds us that not all assets move in lockstep. Diversification and specific research into individual altcoins are crucial. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. This data serves as a powerful reminder that while perpetual futures offer high leverage, they also come with amplified risks. Staying informed about these liquidation events can help traders anticipate potential price movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. The recent 24-hour market volatility , marked by significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation across ETH, BTC, and MYX, serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent risks and opportunities. These liquidations are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital shifts and illustrate the rapid changes in trader sentiment. By closely monitoring these metrics, market participants gain a deeper understanding of underlying pressures and can make more informed decisions. Always prioritize risk management and continuous learning in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, offering high leverage. 2. What causes a perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below the required margin level, leading the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses. This usually happens due to adverse price movements against the trader’s position. 3. What does a high percentage of “long” liquidations mean? A high percentage of “long” liquidations indicates that many traders who bet on a price increase (going long) were forced to close their positions, typically because the asset’s price decreased significantly. 4. How can traders use liquidation data? Traders can use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand areas of high leverage that might lead to further volatility or cascading liquidations. It highlights where significant capital is being lost or gained. 5. Is trading crypto perpetual futures risky? Yes, trading crypto perpetual futures is highly risky due to the leverage involved. While leverage can amplify gains, it can also significantly amplify losses, leading to rapid liquidations if the market moves against your position.

Toronto-based SOL Strategies recently made headlines with its July performance, reporting a significant surge in its digital asset portfolio. This news offers a fascinating glimpse into the operational success within the blockchain space, especially for those keen on crypto investments . What are SOL Strategies’ Impressive July Holdings? SOL Strategies , a prominent player in the Solana ecosystem, announced a remarkable month-over-month increase in its operations. According to a press release distributed via Newsfile, the company’s financial snapshot for July revealed substantial growth. This growth highlights the increasing interest and activity surrounding the Solana blockchain. Key figures from their July report include: 396,717 SOL held: This substantial amount of Solana’s native token represents a significant portion of their liquid assets. 26,440 JitoSOL held: JitoSOL is a liquid staking token on Solana, indicating SOL Strategies’ engagement with advanced DeFi strategies. 15% month-over-month increase in validator revenue: This impressive jump in earnings underscores their efficient and profitable staking operations. 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation: This figure demonstrates the trust placed in SOL Strategies by other SOL holders, who delegate their tokens to the company for staking purposes. These figures collectively paint a picture of a thriving entity within the Solana landscape, actively contributing to and benefiting from the network’s growth. The substantial SOL holdings reflect a strong commitment to the ecosystem. How Does Validator Revenue Boost Crypto Investments? The concept of validator revenue is central to understanding how companies like SOL Strategies generate income within proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana. Validators are crucial nodes that secure the network by verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. For this vital work, they earn rewards, often in the native cryptocurrency of the network. SOL Strategies’ reported 15% increase in validator revenue for July is a strong indicator of their operational efficiency and the health of the Solana network itself. Higher revenue suggests more successful block validation, potentially more delegated SOL, and overall robust network activity. For investors considering crypto investments , a company consistently growing its validator revenue demonstrates a stable and profitable business model in the volatile crypto market. Why Are SOL Holdings and Assets Under Delegation Significant? The reported SOL holdings of 396,717 SOL directly impact SOL Strategies’ influence and potential within the Solana ecosystem. Holding a large amount of the native token provides liquidity and flexibility for various operations, from staking to participating in governance. Furthermore, the 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation is equally, if not more, significant. Assets under delegation (AUD) represent the total amount of tokens that other Solana holders have entrusted to SOL Strategies’ validators. This delegation mechanism is fundamental to the security and decentralization of proof-of-stake networks. A large AUD figure means: Increased Network Security: More delegated SOL strengthens the network’s consensus mechanism. Enhanced Influence: Validators with more delegated SOL have a greater chance of being selected to validate blocks, leading to more rewards. Community Trust: A high AUD indicates strong trust from the Solana community in SOL Strategies’ reliability and performance. Therefore, these figures not only highlight SOL Strategies’ financial strength but also its crucial role in the broader Solana network’s health and development. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana and Crypto Investments? The continued growth of entities like SOL Strategies provides a positive outlook for the Solana blockchain. As more institutional players and specialized companies commit significant resources to validating and participating in the network, it reinforces Solana’s position as a robust and scalable platform. This stability and growth can attract further development, dApps, and users, creating a positive feedback loop. For individuals interested in crypto investments , observing the performance of professional validators like SOL Strategies can offer valuable insights. Their success indicates not just individual company strength but also the underlying potential of the Solana ecosystem as a whole. It underscores the viability of staking as a passive income strategy within the crypto space, provided it’s done through reputable and high-performing entities. In conclusion, SOL Strategies’ impressive July report, showcasing substantial SOL holdings and a significant boost in validator revenue , paints a compelling picture of growth and stability within the Solana ecosystem. Their commitment to the network, demonstrated through their vast assets under delegation, solidifies their position as a key player. This performance not only highlights their operational excellence but also serves as a positive indicator for the broader landscape of crypto investments , particularly for those eyeing the promising future of Solana.

China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) recently issued a stark alert, urging the public to exercise extreme caution. The warning highlights a concerning trend: foreign companies are reportedly attempting to collect sensitive iris information from users, dangling the enticing bait of crypto tokens . Why is China’s Ministry of State Security Issuing This Warning? On August 6, the MSS utilized its official WeChat channel to share this significant advisory. They did not name the specific overseas company involved, maintaining a focus on the broader threat. The core concern revolves around the surreptitious transfer of user biometric data, particularly iris scans, under the guise of distributing digital currencies. The MSS emphasized that such activities pose a direct threat. This isn’t just about individual privacy; it extends to the broader landscape of data security and even national security. When sensitive biometric identifiers like iris scans are compromised, the implications can be profound and far-reaching. Understanding the Threat: What is Iris Information and Why is it Valuable? Your iris is the colored part of your eye, containing a unique pattern that remains stable throughout your life. This makes it an incredibly reliable form of biometric identification, often considered more secure than fingerprints or facial recognition. Uniqueness: Each person’s iris pattern is distinct. Stability: Unlike fingerprints that can be altered, iris patterns remain constant. Irreversibility: Once compromised, you cannot change your iris pattern, unlike a password. Because of these characteristics, iris information is highly coveted by malicious actors. It can be used for identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, or even to create digital clones of individuals. The MSS’s warning underscores the severe risks associated with its unauthorized collection, especially when lured by incentives like crypto tokens . How Do Crypto Tokens Act as Bait for Personal Data? The allure of free or easily obtainable digital assets, such as crypto tokens , can be powerful. Many companies use token issuance, often through airdrops or sign-up bonuses, to attract new users and build their communities. However, this seemingly generous offer can sometimes hide a darker agenda. In this specific case, the MSS suggests that these foreign entities are using token distribution as a ‘bait’ to compel users to provide their biometric data. Users might be asked to scan their iris as part of a ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) process, or as a requirement to receive certain tokens or participate in a new project. Unwittingly, individuals might be trading their invaluable personal data for a speculative digital asset. This tactic highlights a growing concern in the cryptocurrency space: the intersection of digital finance and data security . As more innovative projects emerge, users must remain vigilant about the information they share, particularly highly sensitive biometric identifiers. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights The warning from China’s Ministry of State Security serves as a global reminder about the importance of safeguarding your personal data . Here are some actionable steps you can take: Be Skeptical of Freebies: If an offer of crypto tokens seems too good to be true, especially if it requires providing sensitive biometric data, it likely is. Read Terms and Conditions: Always thoroughly review the privacy policies and terms of service before signing up for any new platform or service, particularly those involving digital assets. Understand what data they collect and why. Verify Company Legitimacy: Research the company behind the token issuance. Look for a clear history, reputable founders, and transparent operations. A lack of transparency is a major red flag. Understand Data Risks: Recognize that biometric data, once compromised, cannot be easily changed. Treat your iris information and other unique identifiers with the utmost care. This vigilance is crucial not just for individuals but also for national security, as aggregated biometric data could be exploited for various nefarious purposes. The Broader Implications for Data Security and National Security The MSS’s warning underscores a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity: the escalating value of biometric data. For governments, the collection of such sensitive information by foreign entities raises profound national security concerns. It could potentially lead to: Espionage: Identifying and tracking individuals of interest. Cyberattacks: Using stolen identities to gain access to critical infrastructure. Surveillance: Building comprehensive databases of citizens. While the specific foreign company remains unnamed, the advisory from China’s Ministry of State Security clearly signals a heightened awareness and concern within the Chinese government regarding digital asset activities that could undermine national interests and compromise citizen safety. This incident serves as a stark reminder that the digital frontier, while offering immense opportunities, also harbors significant risks that demand constant vigilance and robust protective measures. Ultimately, this warning is a call to action for everyone engaging with digital currencies. Your personal data is a valuable asset, far more so than any speculative crypto tokens . Protecting your iris information and other biometric data is paramount in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

Analyst Explains How,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/binance-inflows-leading-altcoins-analyst/,"A quant has explained how altcoin inflows into cryptocurrency exchange Binance might act as a leading indicator for the market. Spikes In Binance Altcoin Inflows Tend To Precede Corrections In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend in the altcoin exchange inflows going to Binance. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Inflow Transaction Count,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of deposit transactions that investors are making to a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Buyers Aren’t Selling: $118,000+ Supply Remains Firm Below is a chart for the indicator that shows the trend in the altcoin deposits occurring on the various exchanges. As is visible in the graph, the altcoin Exchange Inflow Transaction Count peaked on all exchanges right before both the 2024 market tops, implying that deposit activity intensified on the platforms. Generally, investors transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so spikes in exchange inflows can lead into bearish price action. This appears to be what happened in these two instances. Interestingly, during the latest market drawdown that has occurred over the past few days, inflows on only one exchange have seen a spike: Binance. There have also been other instances in the past where this pattern developed. “Spikes in Binance inflows (represented by the purple area) frequently precede downward price movements or market corrections,” notes the analyst. The quant has also explained that Binance is not only the largest exchange in the sector in terms of trading volume, but also a hub for altcoin activity from both retail and institutional entities. As such, investor behavior on the platform can be quite relevant for the wider market. Speaking of alts, CryptoQuant has shared a few new indicators that can be used to track smart money. One of these is the Average Order Size, which differentiates between futures buy orders by their scale. The above chart shows the indicator’s data for Hyperliquid (HYPE). It would appear that whale-sized buy orders appeared when the altcoin was trading around $11 earlier in the year. Since then, its price has climbed to $39. Related Reading: Bitcoin Neutral Sentiment Didn’t Last Long: Investors Already Greedy Again Another indicator is the Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency. This one is the opposite: it points out periods of elevated activity from the small hands. From this graph, it’s apparent that overheated periods of retail interest coincided with price highs in Gala (GALA). ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, down more than 4% over the past week.

Dogecoin is climbing higher after bouncing strongly from a proven support zone, showing signs of renewed energy. Tron is also gathering attention as it trades above key levels and builds pressure near $0.50. Both show positive setups on the charts, but BlockDAG (BDAG) takes things to another level. Instead of waiting for an exchange listing, it offers a fully functional trading simulator now. Its live Dashboard V4 lets users interact with real-time BDAG/USD pricing, BUY and SELL panels, and instant wallet balance updates. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG delivers something rare: hands-on experience before public launch, making it one of the few presales that feels alive and active. Tron TRX Breakout Watch Nears as Bulls Target $0.50 Tron is pushing toward the $0.50 mark, drawing strong attention to a potential breakout move. With over 50% of all USDT currently moving through the Tron network, its role in handling stablecoins continues to strengthen, adding weight to its long-term value. Price action shows TRX holding above critical supports with steady trading volume supporting its climb. Technical signals are leaning bullish, and traders are adding Tron to their breakout watch lists as pressure builds. A clean close above $0.50 could mark the start of a stronger upward trend, supported by real network usage and growing confidence in its infrastructure. Dogecoin DOGE Rally Gains Strength as Key Level Holds Dogecoin is regaining bullish momentum after reclaiming a zone that has historically sparked major rallies. The bounce from around $0.22, combined with noticeable accumulation from larger holders, suggests building upward pressure. A possible golden cross is forming, with the 50-day moving average approaching a crossover above the 200-day—a classic sign of trend strength. If Dogecoin maintains this pace and secures $0.26 as firm support, analysts see potential for a run toward $0.46 or beyond. BlockDAG Turns Presale into a Full Trading Experience Before Launch Most early-stage projects only offer a promise: you buy early and wait. BlockDAG changes this approach completely by letting users experience a working trading environment long before exchange listings go live. Its Dashboard V4 is more than a preview; it simulates real market conditions with active tools. Inside the dashboard, users can open trades through functional BUY and SELL buttons, track live BDAG/USD charts, view an up-to-date order book, and see their wallets adjust instantly after each trade. This setup removes the usual guesswork of presales and replaces it with practical use. It allows participants to explore market trends, price shifts, and trade behavior firsthand, making the experience interactive instead of static. BlockDAG’s growth numbers highlight its strong traction. It has already raised $362.5 million, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% ROI from the first batch. But the real game-changer is the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, where, until August 11, buyers can access BDAG at only $0.0016. Based on the listing price of $0.05, this limited price could deliver 3,025% returns. What makes this opportunity stand out is not only the low entry point but also the ability to use a live trading setup before launch day. It builds trust and confidence, letting users practice and prepare ahead of time while securing their position before prices return to normal after August 11. For anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG sets a new standard, combining early access pricing with real-time utility that no other presale is offering. Which Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now? Tron’s chart structure is showing pressure toward a breakout, and Dogecoin is rebuilding its rally momentum. But both depend on future price confirmations to prove their setups. BlockDAG offers something different: it gives users full access to live trading tools today, before listings go live. With real-time price tracking, functional trade execution, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG delivers real utility now. For those choosing where to put their focus in this market, this early, hands-on experience sets BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to invest in now, combining active engagement with massive early access potential.

The current market trend is favoring choices that offer true use, actual utility, or potential growth. Instead of chasing trends, people are turning to assets showing long-term value. From cashback wallets changing fee structures to Layer 2s signaling a breakout, there’s real energy behind these names. This list of top-rated cryptos in 2025 includes projects addressing key pain points, like gas costs, privacy, and scaling, and shows why these assets are gaining attention in Q3. Cold Wallet, MNT, XMR, and NEAR each bring specific strengths, making it worth taking a closer look. Here’s why they’re considered top-rated cryptos in 2025. 1. Cold Wallet: Turning Every Fee Into a Reward Cold Wallet redefines how users interact with fees, changing typical charges into chances to earn. Gas fees, bridge costs, and swap charges are turned into cashback rewards through CWT, the core currency of the platform. Whether sending crypto, swapping, or bridging, users earn CWT. And the more CWT you keep in your wallet, the higher your cashback, starting at 10% and going up to 100%. No lock-ins or staking are needed, just hold and earn. This approach brings fairness to crypto use. The presale of CWT began at $0.00942 and follows a 150-stage pricing system where the price increases with each stage. Over $5.7 million has been raised so far, with more than 683 million coins sold. Currently in stage 16, Cold Wallet also gives referral bonuses: 10% for those who share and 5% for the ones they invite, all under a clear vesting plan. What really makes Cold Wallet stand out is not just rewards, but how it changes expectations. It’s built for real usage with zero gas overhead and a simple interface. In a space where most platforms take more than they give, Cold Wallet reverses the flow. That’s why it’s a top-rated crypto in 2025 for those who value practical use and fair returns. 2. MNT: Layer 2 Upgrade With Traction Mantle (MNT) isn’t just another token with price buzz; it’s showing progress with its UR beta utility layer, active until August 8. MNT aims to build a modular Ethereum Layer 2 that supports scalable apps and offers users relief from congestion and high costs. This cleaner setup is already pulling attention. Trading near $0.76 as of July 29, 2025, MNT recently dipped from its earlier high of $0.85. Still, technical indicators suggest a possible continued upward move, especially if it holds above the 200-day EMA. Analysts place year-end predictions between $0.79 and $1.38, based on development speed and adoption. With real structure, dependable tokenomics, and visible developer activity, MNT fits right into any list of top-rated cryptos in 2025. 3. XMR: A Consistent Name in Privacy-Focused Crypto Monero (XMR) continues to lead when it comes to privacy features. As of July 29, XMR is priced near $315 after reaching a recent high of $324. There were some concerns around mining power centralization with Qubic, but the quick release of version 0.18.4.1 “Fluorine Fermi” on July 25 helped address that and reaffirmed Monero’s commitment to decentralization. Outlooks for XMR remain positive. Conservative estimates predict an end-of-year target near $420, while some projections go as high as $670–$688 if the current pace continues. Monero stays relevant by focusing on privacy at a time when digital tracking is a rising concern. For those seeking real protection instead of just trend-driven DeFi plays, XMR still holds its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025. 4. NEAR: Technical Support and User Growth NEAR Protocol has kept steady performance across July with several price movements drawing attention. From July 24 to 25, NEAR jumped 6.9%, rising from $2.61 to $2.79, and has since corrected slightly to around $2.70. Despite the cooldown, trading signals still favor accumulation and a possible breakout. NEAR keeps building tools and attracting outside support, making it one of the few projects with both retail and institutional interest. Forecasts for August suggest a climb to $3.12–$3.27, and extended projections stretch toward $5.22 by 2026 if momentum continues. With new features rolling out and usage growing, NEAR earns its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025 for those chasing stable growth. Final Thoughts When evaluating top-rated cryptos in 2025, Cold Wallet stands out for turning routine fees into benefits and offering a smoother experience with fair rewards. MNT is proving itself through ongoing network upgrades and staying above key technical support levels. XMR remains unmatched for privacy, backed by strong community action and consistent price action. NEAR shows strength in both price structure and user adoption. Each of these picks has proven itself beyond short-term hype. They offer tools, functions, or structures that align with what today’s crypto user wants. If you’re mapping out your strategy, include these four in your watchlist of top-rated cryptos in 2025 . Not only are they making moves now, but their setups suggest they could still deliver much more ahead.

Solana, XRP Traders Rotate Into MAGACOIN FINANCE",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-to-5-solana-xrp-traders-rotate-into-magacoin-finance/,"As major altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP continue to consolidate near key technical levels, a shift is quietly happening beneath the surface. Traders and analysts alike are watching closely—but not just for a breakout in the usual names. Increasingly, smart money is rotating into lesser-known but high-conviction plays, including a decentralized political memecoin that’s quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With long-term optimism intact for the majors, short-term capital is flowing into projects offering sharper upside and stronger community traction—especially those with built-in cultural appeal and strategic momentum. Cardano’s $5 Ambition Gains Ground—but Momentum Is Slow Cardano has re-entered the spotlight after rebounding from recent lows, now gaining traction thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Its $71 million governance vote—backing enhancements like the Hydra scalability protocol and Acropolis node overhaul—signaled Cardano’s intent to accelerate decentralization. Developer activity is also ramping up, with the Midnight sidechain attracting serious attention ahead of the much-anticipated Glacier airdrop. Analysts say Cardano could test $0.81 resistance soon, and if it clears that threshold, a broader move toward the $5 zone may finally begin taking shape. XRP and Solana Still Bullish—But Risk Rotation Is Real XRP continues to show strength despite regulatory distractions. A brewing falling wedge pattern has technical traders on alert, with price targets pushing above $3.75 if breakout conditions are met. But Ripple’s ongoing licensing roadblocks and banking opposition have added uncertainty to the short-term outlook. Solana is showing clearer momentum. After recovering from a sharp dip, SOL now trades near resistance with analysts watching the $174 breakout level. Institutional interest remains strong, especially as Coinbase expands support for Solana-based DeFi and NFT tools. But even as XRP and SOL build solid bases, they’re starting to feel like slow burners. This has opened the door for capital to chase more agile plays—especially those with social buzz, ideological pull, and long-term infrastructure plans. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshine XRP This Quarter? While Cardano continues its slow march toward the $5 mark, and traders watch XRP and Solana build momentum without clear breakout signals, a new trend is emerging: capital rotation into high-upside altcoins with stronger cultural relevance and community-driven growth. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE—a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin—is gaining attention as the asset of choice for those seeking faster ROI. With sentiment cooling around slower-moving majors, MAGACOIN has become a focal point for traders projecting major upside potential in the next leg of the market cycle. Many early participants believe its unique positioning, combined with growing investor momentum, could support exponential returns—some projecting gains that rival or exceed 16,700%—as interest accelerates ahead of broader access and listings. Final Thoughts: W/hy Strategic Entry Matters Now The broader crypto market is once again showing signs of life—but the next leg of the bull cycle may reward agility over patience. While Cardano, XRP, and Solana remain foundational plays for long-term portfolios, early entrants into high-conviction narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for upside before the rest of the market catches on. The entry window remains open. But the conversation is clearly shifting—and investors looking for what’s next are already watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely.

In a post, the MSS described a case in which a foreign firm offered crypto token rewards to scan users' irises around the world. The company later transferred the biometric data abroad, raising concerns about both personal data privacy and national security. While the company wasn’t named, the description closely matches Worldcoin, the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which exchanges tokens for iris scans in a bid to build a global identity network. The project has already faced regulatory pushback in Germany, France , and Kenya , CoinDesk previously reported, where concerns have been raised over informed consent, data storage, and surveillance potential. Beijing's advisory goes further, citing other cases where stolen facial data has allegedly been used by foreign intelligence services to deepfake identities, allowing spies to infiltrate secure locations. Worldcoin's WLD token is trading for 93 cents, down 4%, according to CoinDesk market data .

The now-bankrupt FTX claims that the funds were “improperly transferred” by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to Bloomberg Law , CZ claimed that he’s a resident of the United Arab Emirates and that the FTX trust can’t claim it is within Delaware’s jurisdiction. “The complaint does not establish general jurisdiction because it does not allege that Mr. Zhao is ‘at home’ in Delaware,” Zhao said in a motion to dismiss filed on Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Further, he emphasized that the claims have minimal relevance to the US and that the regulations involved have no “extraterritorial application.” FTX Wants to Recoup $1.76B From Binance: Here’s Why In November 2024, FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance exchange and its founder CZ. FTX sought to recover $1.76 billion from Binance, claiming it was transferred as part of a fraudulent transaction. FTX has sued @binance and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance for $1.8B, alleging fraudulent dealings that damaged its stability. #FTX #Binance https://t.co/WaIpSYlx4v — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2024 The $1.76 billion transaction was a 2021 share purchase agreement that Binance made with FTX, which the latter claims was fraudulent due to its insolvency at the time. A Binance spokesperson said at the time that the exchange would defend itself against the “meritless” claims. This isn’t the first time Binance has filed a motion to dismiss FTX’s $1.76 billion clawback suit. A similar court paper submitted in May to a Delaware judge noted that the beleaguered company attempted to hold Binance accountable for FTX’s crash, and “shift the blame” away from Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX “Nonsensically Blame” CZ And Binance The Monday motion read that the FTX trust “nonsensically blame” CZ and Binance for Bankman-Fried’s “pervasive malfeasance”. “The claims are in any event legally unfounded, and many are outright incoherent,” it added. Further, Zhao said that the constructive fraud claims don’t meet legal requirements that permit “qualifying transactions” linked to a securities contract under federal law. CZ pled guilty to US anti-money laundering violations and served four months in prison . Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of several offences, including fraud and conspiracy.

The price is now trading below $2.980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3.060 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to continue higher above the $3.10 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the comments Tuesday during the firm’s second-quarter earnings call . “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said. “The question now is which of the existing companies become monsters.” Favorable US Rules Fuel Growth in Crypto Treasury Firms Crypto treasury companies have gained momentum in recent quarters, especially as US regulatory conditions have become more favorable. These firms raise capital in public markets and allocate a portion or all of their reserves into digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain-based tokens. A growing list of public companies has adopted this approach. That includes Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), GameStop, Trump Media & Technology Group, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital. Their holdings span Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Litecoin. Ethereum already has two major corporate treasury holders, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Novogratz expects both to keep expanding but warned that new entrants may “have a harder time getting oxygen” as the space becomes more saturated. Novogratz Sees Recurring Revenue From Treasury Partnerships Galaxy Digital manages crypto holdings for more than 20 treasury-focused firms. The company earns fees for overseeing these assets, which now total around $2b on its platform. Novogratz described it as “recurring income that will go on and on.” In May, Galaxy shifted its public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market. It now trades under the ticker symbol GLXY, marking a strategic move to deepen its US footprint. @galaxyhq has explored the tokenization of its $GLXY shares and reported a 43% drop in total assets to $6.3 billion in Q2. #GLXY #Tokenization https://t.co/2go2wQ7tLn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The company also disclosed in a SEC filing that it is exploring tokenization of its publicly traded shares . That initiative forms part of Galaxy’s broader effort to expand into blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Founded in 2018, Galaxy Digital offers a wide range of crypto-focused services, including asset management, trading, investment banking and infrastructure solutions. It targets institutional clients looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Novogratz suggested the market’s attention is turning away from the influx of new treasury players. Instead, focus is shifting to which existing firms will scale meaningfully in the next phase of the cycle.

What to Know Dogecoin fell 5% over the 24-hour session from August 4 at 21:00 to August 5 at 20:00, declining from $0.21 to $0.20. The token traded within a $0.013 range, with lows of $0.198 and highs of $0.211. A key liquidation event occurred during the 14:00 hour on August 5, with volumes reaching 877.9 million — nearly 4x the 24-hour average of 268.85 million — triggering a breakdown below $0.205. DOGE ended the session at $0.1985 after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, signaling continued institutional selling and confirming new downside momentum. The move comes amid broader crypto market weakness triggered by risk-off sentiment across global equities. News Background DOGE’s decline coincided with institutional outflows from crypto-linked ETFs totaling $223 million over the past week, per CoinShares data. Federal Reserve hawkishness and renewed geopolitical concerns — including retaliatory tariffs and commodity flow disruptions — have fueled risk aversion across both traditional and crypto markets. At the same time, the meme coin sector remains under pressure as retail enthusiasm fades and large holders continue to rotate into higher-beta altcoins or cash positions. DOGE had previously shown signs of accumulation last week, but failure to hold the $0.205 level invalidated the setup. Price Action Summary DOGE began the session strong, hitting $0.211 at 01:00, but reversed sharply through the day. The steepest decline occurred at 14:00, when price dropped from $0.205 to $0.199 amid 877.9 million in volume. By 19:51, another flush to $0.1975 occurred on 19.04 million volume — more than 70x the hourly average — before a shallow bounce to $0.1985 into the close. New resistance has formed near $0.205, with price unable to sustain any recovery above that level following the breakdown. The token currently trades near session lows and shows no confirmation of a reversal. Technical Analysis DOGE traded within a 6% range between $0.198 and $0.211 Volume spiked to 877.9 million at 14:00, nearly 4x above daily average Rejection at $0.205 triggered mid-session breakdown Support attempted at $0.198-$0.199, but volume on bounce remained weak Final hour saw 19.04M volume burst at $0.1975 level, creating local resistance at $0.1988 Momentum remains to the downside unless price reclaims $0.205 on convincing volume What Traders Are Watching Traders are closely watching whether DOGE can stabilize above $0.198 or face further downside toward $0.185. Failure to recover above $0.205 may extend liquidations. With volumes spiking on down moves and fading on recoveries, sellers remain in control unless macro risk sentiment improves or ETF outflows reverse.",Markets|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-06 04:24:23

The world of cryptocurrency investment is always buzzing, and recent data has certainly captured attention. On August 5, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable combined net outflow of $196.2 million. This marks the fourth consecutive trading day of such outflows, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment within the digital asset space. What Triggered These Significant Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the fourth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 5 paints a clear picture. Investors pulled a substantial amount from these popular investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Let’s look at the specifics of these significant movements: Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows, seeing $99.1 million exit its coffers. BlackRock’s IBIT followed, experiencing $77.4 million in outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed, with $19.7 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting the outflows were concentrated in a few key players. How Do These Outflows Impact the Crypto Market? These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows naturally raise questions about their broader implications for the crypto market . While a single day or even a few days of outflows don’t necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend, they do reflect immediate investor behavior and market sentiment. Such movements can contribute to short-term price volatility for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Understanding the reasons behind these shifts is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after periods of gains. Macroeconomic concerns: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, including digital asset holdings. Regulatory developments: Any news or speculation regarding cryptocurrency regulation can influence investor confidence. Market volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market itself can prompt some investors to seek safer havens. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Funds and ETF Performance? The recent figures provide a snapshot of current ETF performance for some of the largest digital asset funds . While the overall trend for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception has been positive, periods of outflows are a natural part of any investment cycle. They serve as a reminder that even established investment vehicles linked to cryptocurrencies are subject to market dynamics. For investors, it’s important to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. These outflows highlight the need for continued monitoring of: Institutional interest: Are large institutions still accumulating or are they pulling back? Retail participation: How are individual investors reacting to market movements? Underlying Bitcoin fundamentals: The strength of Bitcoin’s network and adoption remains a key factor. This data provides valuable insight into how capital is flowing in and out of the regulated crypto investment space. Looking Ahead: Navigating the Crypto Market The recent outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a significant event, but they are just one piece of the larger crypto market puzzle. For investors, the key is to remain informed and adopt a measured approach. While headlines about large outflows can seem daunting, they are often part of a healthy market’s ebb and flow. Consider these actionable insights: Stay informed: Continuously track data from reliable sources like Farside Investors. Diversify: Don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket. Long-term perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of digital assets rather than daily price swings. Risk assessment: Understand your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a timely reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. By understanding the underlying factors and maintaining a clear perspective, investors can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to buy, store, or secure the actual cryptocurrency. 2.

The specific causes can be complex, but common reasons for such Bitcoin ETF outflows include investor profit-taking, reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions, shifts in crypto market sentiment, or responses to regulatory news affecting digital asset funds . 3. How do these outflows affect the overall crypto market? While not solely indicative of the entire market’s health, significant outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. They also reflect investor confidence and can influence sentiment across the broader crypto market . 4. Is this a long-term trend for digital asset funds? It is too early to determine if this is a long-term trend. Outflows are a normal part of fund management and ETF performance . Investors should monitor subsequent trading days and broader market conditions to assess whether this represents a sustained shift or a temporary adjustment. 5.

The world of digital assets is always buzzing with activity, and recent developments in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs market have certainly captured attention. On August 5th, these investment vehicles witnessed a significant turnaround, recording a combined net inflow of $73.3 million. This positive shift follows two consecutive days of net outflows, sparking renewed optimism among investors and analysts tracking institutional crypto adoption. What Drove These Impressive Ethereum ETF Inflows? This notable surge in investment highlights a dynamic period for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs . Data from Farside Investors indicates a clear preference for certain funds, even as others experienced outflows. Understanding which ETFs attracted the most capital provides crucial insight into market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the key players and their performance on August 5th: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the charge by a significant margin, attracting a remarkable $88.8 million in new capital. Its strong performance suggests growing confidence in BlackRock’s offerings. VanEck’s ETHV: Adding to the positive momentum, VanEck’s ETF saw $5.2 million in inflows. This indicates broader interest beyond just the largest players. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: With $3.6 million in inflows, ARK 21Shares also contributed positively to the overall net figure. Grayscale’s Funds: In contrast, Grayscale’s mini ETH and ETHE experienced net outflows of $13.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. These outflows suggest some investors may be rebalancing their portfolios or moving to newer, potentially lower-fee products. The remaining ETH ETF products reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining their existing positions. Why Are These U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF Movements Significant for the Crypto Market? The return to net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it reflects evolving institutional crypto adoption and potential shifts in broader crypto market trends .

Market Stability: Increased institutional participation can contribute to greater market stability and liquidity. Future Growth: It sets a precedent for continued growth and further integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios. The fact that major players like BlackRock are seeing such strong interest in their Ethereum ETF inflows is a powerful indicator for the future of digital asset investing.

On-chain data now points to a possible ETH short squeeze if Ether climbs above $4,000, while $5.6 billion in BTC shorts could be liquidated if Bitcoin breaks out above $125,000. These aggressive trades are setting up a critical juncture for the entire market, raising new questions about XRP’s next move and opening the door for high-upside altcoins. As investors brace for crypto market volatility for ETH, BTC, XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new contender, attracting attention for its potential 39x gains in Q3. Massive Short Positions on ETH and BTC ETH and BTC short positions in 2025 are near peak levels. According to CoinGlass, nearly $331 million in short positions on ETH would be wiped out by an ETH short squeeze above $4,000. Most of these positions are stacked just below recent resistance—any breakout could force shorts to cover, fueling rapid price spikes. For Bitcoin, Bitget data shows more than $5.6 billion in short positions on BTC could face liquidation if Bitcoin moves past $125,000. This amount of exposure makes the current market a “ticking time bomb.” A breach of the $120K–$122K resistance could spark a massive BTC short squeeze, forcing shorts to exit and creating a swift upside move. Traders are closely watching what happens if BTC shorts get liquidated, knowing the ripple effects could hit altcoins across the board. Ripple XRP Faces Market Shockwaves Ripple’s XRP price has dropped below $3 in the last 24 hours, impacted by both Bitcoin’s moves and its own surge in futures activity. Binance reports XRP futures open interest at a record $3.9 billion, with 50.77% of positions now short. This heavy shorting leaves XRP vulnerable to rapid swings and makes the next direction hard to predict. If Bitcoin and Ethereum trigger a squeeze, the impact of BTC and ETH shorts on XRP could create outsized moves in XRP’s price. Market watchers are split—will XRP crash if Bitcoin drops, or could it rebound sharply if the shorts unwind? XRP market shockwaves are likely either way, as crypto market volatility (ETH, BTC, and XRP) is fueling wild swings across the sector. The best strategy for XRP during market crash conditions may be to watch resistance levels after a BTC dump and prepare for sharp reversals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is The Coin To Watch Now? MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum among investors seeking returns beyond major cap volatility. As short selling affects XRP and other blue chips, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new high-upside option for traders seeking Q3 growth. Whale accumulation, social buzz, and trading volume are all surging, with analysts tipping the project for up to 39x gains in the current quarter. Part of the appeal is its community-driven structure and resistance to the wild swings seen in ETH and BTC.

Crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital unstaked a massive 250,000 SOL, valued at an impressive $40.7 million, and promptly moved it to the Binance Exchange. This notable SOL Binance transfer occurred just hours ago, as reported by Lookonchain on X, citing precise data from Solscan. Such a considerable movement of assets from a major player like Galaxy Digital often sparks considerable discussion and speculation within the market. What Does This SOL Binance Transfer Signify? When a firm like Galaxy Digital executes a large SOL transaction of this magnitude, it typically indicates a strategic maneuver. Unstaking assets frees them from locking periods, making them liquid and available for various purposes. These purposes might include preparing for a sale, rebalancing portfolios, or even facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals that bypass immediate market impact. However, a direct deposit to an exchange like Binance often suggests an intention to increase liquidity on the platform, potentially for trading activities. This action by Galaxy Digital is not just a simple transfer; it is a clear signal of their active management of their Solana holdings. It underscores the dynamic nature of institutional participation in the crypto space, where large entities constantly adjust their positions based on market conditions and strategic objectives. Analyzing the Large SOL Transaction and Market Implications The immediate question following such a substantial large SOL transaction is its potential effect on Solana’s price. While a direct deposit to an exchange does not automatically mean a sell-off, it does increase the available supply on the exchange. If these SOL tokens were to be sold, it could create temporary selling pressure on the market. However, it is also possible that Galaxy Digital is using Binance for liquidity provision, derivatives trading, or other strategic financial operations that do not involve immediate liquidation. Observing the market’s reaction in the hours and days following this transfer will provide clearer insights. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring Solana’s price action and overall trading volume on Binance to gauge the true intent behind this significant deposit. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking Solana’s ecosystem. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity and Solana Market Impact This move by Galaxy Digital perfectly exemplifies typical crypto whale activity . Whales, or large holders of cryptocurrency, possess the power to influence market dynamics through their substantial transactions. Their actions are often seen as indicators of broader market sentiment or upcoming trends. When a whale unstakes and deposits assets to an exchange, it creates a ripple effect, prompting other market participants to analyze the potential reasons and consequences. The ultimate Solana market impact from this specific deposit will depend on subsequent actions. If a significant portion of the deposited SOL is sold, we might see downward price pressure. Conversely, if it is held or used for other purposes, the impact could be minimal or even positive, indicating institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term prospects. This event serves as a reminder of how crucial it is to monitor the on-chain movements of major players in the crypto world. What Should Investors Watch For? Price Action: Monitor SOL’s price performance on Binance and other major exchanges. Significant dips could suggest selling. Volume Changes: Look for unusually high trading volumes for SOL, which might accompany large buy or sell orders. Further Transfers: Keep an eye on Solscan for any additional large movements from Galaxy Digital or other institutional wallets. News & Announcements: Stay updated on any official statements from Galaxy Digital that might clarify their intentions. In conclusion, the recent Galaxy Digital SOL deposit of $40.7 million into Binance is a notable development in the Solana ecosystem. While the immediate implications remain speculative, this large SOL transaction highlights the ongoing crypto whale activity and its potential Solana market impact . It underscores the strategic maneuvers of institutional players like Galaxy Digital, reminding us of the importance of vigilance in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Staying informed about such significant transfers is key to navigating the volatile crypto markets effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Galaxy Digital’s role in this SOL transfer? Galaxy Digital is a prominent crypto financial services firm. Their role in this transfer was to unstake 250,000 SOL and deposit it into the Binance Exchange, indicating active management of their crypto assets. Why did Galaxy Digital deposit SOL into Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly stated, depositing to an exchange like Binance typically suggests increasing liquidity for potential trading, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. How does a large SOL transaction affect the Solana market? A large SOL transaction, especially a deposit to an exchange, can increase the available supply. If these tokens are sold, it could create temporary selling pressure. However, if held or used for other purposes, the market impact might be minimal or even positive. What is “crypto whale activity”? “Crypto whale activity” refers to the significant transactions made by individuals or entities holding a large amount of cryptocurrency. These movements are closely watched as they can influence market sentiment and price trends due to their sheer volume. Should investors be concerned about this SOL movement? Investors should remain informed but avoid immediate panic. Such movements are part of institutional asset management. It’s crucial to monitor subsequent market reactions, such as price action and trading volume, rather than assuming an immediate sell-off. Did you find this analysis helpful?

In 2025, these offers are not judged by big numbers alone, but by how fast players can access their winnings and how clear the rules are. Players now prefer sites that give bonuses they can actually use and cash out, without hidden terms. This article ranks the best crypto casino bonus offers this year, focusing on clear rules, payout time, and overall user experience. Spartans ranks highest for giving rewards that are easy to understand and quick to claim. Spartans: Top-Rated Bonus Offers for Fast Crypto Payouts Spartans is the best crypto casino for bonuses in 2025. It gives large welcome rewards, frequent deposit boosts, and quick crypto withdrawals in one easy setup. The biggest difference at Spartans is how simple everything is. First-time users get a 300% bonus on casino and sports betting with only a $5 minimum deposit. Bonus terms are shown clearly, including how wagering works, which games qualify, and any payout rules. There are no confusing limits or hidden rules in the small text. Players know what to expect and how to use each offer. Regular users also benefit from ongoing deposit bonuses. A 25% bonus is available every day on both casino and sports deposits. These offers are simple to activate, process quickly, and lead to real crypto earnings. Whether you play slots or place bets on sports, these bonuses are made to be used, not just advertised. With games that load quickly, many supported cryptos, and a smooth user layout, Spartans gives players a bonus setup that saves time and avoids confusion. Unlike most other sites, winnings from bonuses at Spartans are available for withdrawal right after meeting the rules. This makes Spartans the most trusted and useful crypto bonus program in 2025. Stake.com: Bigger Bonuses, Slower to Unlock Stake.com continues to be a top option for crypto players, and its reward system reflects its strong user base. New users get a matched deposit bonus, while current users can access regular challenges, VIP perks, and prize events. Still, the bonuses on Stake come with higher wagering terms than those on Spartans. Players often have to complete several steps before their rewards are fully released. This setup can reduce the appeal for users who want quick and simple benefits. While Stake stands out among the best crypto casino options, the path to withdrawing bonus winnings is not the fastest. Roobet: Bold Promotions with Some Limits Roobet promotes itself with big signup bonuses and themed offers connected to featured games and events. The site often runs active bonus programs, but how these bonuses work can be unclear. The playthrough rules are sometimes detailed, and bonuses may expire fast or be limited to certain games. Loyal players benefit from cashback and tournaments, but for first-time users, the real value may fall short of what the ads suggest. Roobet may appeal to experienced users who understand the terms, but for those new to crypto casinos, Spartans or Stake may offer a smoother experience among the best crypto casino platforms. BC.Game: Custom Bonus Options with Some Trade-Offs BC.Game provides a large range of promos aimed at crypto users, such as spin-based rewards, tiered bonuses, and offers linked to specific tokens. The site lets users choose how they want their rewards delivered, which adds flexibility. Still, many of the promotions are tied to the platform’s own token. This may not suit users who prefer using well-known cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Bonus withdrawal times also change based on what offer is used. For those who like to personalize their rewards, BC.Game offers variety. But it doesn’t provide the fast, direct bonus experience seen with Spartans, which sets the pace among the best crypto casino choices. Betano: Local Bonus Strength, Global Gaps Remain Betano offers strong bonus deals in selected regions, especially across Europe and Latin America. These include welcome rewards, no-risk bets, and reload offers designed for specific markets. While bonus amounts are solid in those areas, the platform does not offer full crypto support across all locations. Payout times are fair but not fast, with many withdrawals needing manual review. For users looking for faster service and crypto freedom, Betano may feel limited outside its core regions, especially when compared to the best crypto casino options. 888Casino: Well-Known Brand, Classic Bonus Style 888Casino is trusted by many and provides a safe playing space, but its bonus system sticks to a more standard setup. New members can get a matched deposit bonus, and there are rotating daily rewards and VIP benefits for long-term users. Though crypto payment choices are growing, bonus programs are still mainly set around fiat. This brings slower payouts, manual checks for bonus use, and limited ways to take out winnings from bonus rewards. While steady and trusted, 888Casino has not yet built the kind of crypto-first reward system seen on the best crypto casino platforms. Final Thoughts In 2025, bonus offers are judged by how simple and fast they are to use. Players now want rewards they can track, unlock, and withdraw without problems. Spartans stands out for clear terms, easy daily boosts, and fast crypto payouts. Other choices like Stake.com and Roobet still hold value, but include more rules and slower access. For users focused on the best crypto casino reward programs, Spartans offers the strongest and clearest path to real payouts.

Experts Weigh XRP vs Ethereum in Long-Term Outlook,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-100-by-2025-experts-weigh-xrp-vs-ethereum-in-long-term-outlook/,"The XRP community is excited once again, and for good reason. With a string of bullish developments unfolding and mainstream adoption growing, many traders are now asking the big question: Can XRP actually hit $100 in 2025? While it sounds far-fetched, one thing is clear—there’s serious momentum building behind this prediction. As the XRP buzz gets louder, some early traders are already pivoting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new DeFi token that investors are hoping to catch the next big breakout before it goes mainstream. What’s Driving the XRP Hype? XRP’s history has been anything but boring. After years of battling the SEC in court, Ripple’s fortunes appear to be shifting. A possible XRP ETF is now one of the hottest topics in the crypto space. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gives it the green light, it could open the floodgates for institutional money—just like what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The most explosive long-term catalyst lies in global bank adoption. XRP’s speed and low fees make it a strong candidate to replace the SWIFT system, which has remained largely unchanged for decades. If financial institutions begin using XRP to process cross-border transactions, trillions could flow through the network, putting enormous upward pressure on price. Ethereum’s Strong Rebound Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the altcoin space. ETH is trading around $3,600. From its June lows, ETH has surged 78%, now boasting a $427.09B market cap with $22.13B in daily volume. Technical indicators show bullish momentum. ETH is pushing past resistance at the current levels. A break above $3,700 could open the path toward $4,500-$7,000 in the coming months. MAGACOIN FINANCE Traders Target Gains While the spotlight shines on XRP and Ethereum, early traders are quietly flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap DeFi project with big ambitions. With its tokenomics designed for exponential growth, many believe it could deliver 20,300% gains—mirroring early-stage breakouts like Shiba Inu or Pepe. The token’s fundamentals include a strong focus on yield generation, decentralized tools, and integration with emerging altcoin ecosystems. As crypto markets rotate into higher-risk, high-reward assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next major breakout. Timing might be everything—and early birds are already circling. Final Thoughts So, can XRP hit $100 by 2025? The odds are steep, but the ingredients are there: institutional demand, real-world use cases, and growing legitimacy. Traders eyeing better returns are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that today’s low-cap DeFi projects might deliver XRP-like gains before the big players catch on.

Over the past week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has declined by nearly 4%, trading at $113,993 at the time of writing. This represents a drop of approximately 7.2% from the peak price of above $123,000 reached in July. The decline has sparked renewed discussion among analysts about the asset’s current price discovery phase and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto Bitcoin Price Discovery and the Potential for Q4 Gains CryptoQuant analyst Oinonen shared his latest assessment of Bitcoin’s market performance, noting that while the recent pullback appears significant, it primarily reflects technical market conditions. In his post on the QuickTake platform, he explained that a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, technical indicators turning bearish, and liquidation events has contributed to the decline. However, he described the ongoing situation as a “technical correction” within Bitcoin’s longer-term bullish structure. Despite the short-term weakness, analysts remain focused on Bitcoin’s price discovery process. This phase, according to Oinonen, is essential in establishing the asset’s fair market value as supply and demand interact in the market. Following the all-time high of $123,400 on July 14, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating, potentially setting the stage for further upward movement later in the year. “Bitcoin has historically performed well in the fourth quarter,” Oinonen noted, suggesting that a return to its previous peak and even a potential move toward $200,000 could be on the horizon if historical patterns hold. Additionally, the analyst pointed to Binance’s high stablecoin reserves as a factor that may influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. These reserves represent capital that could flow into Bitcoin and other digital assets if market sentiment improves. A positive shift in buying activity, combined with Bitcoin’s reflexive market behavior, could support further gains, although the extent to which this would benefit altcoins remains uncertain.

Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support Caution Over Negative Coinbase Premium Signals While some market participants anticipate a possible rebound later this year, other analysts are urging caution. Another CryptoQuant contributor, known as BQYoutube, highlighted a recent change in the Coinbase Premium Index, a metric comparing prices on Coinbase versus other exchanges. Since June 30, the premium has shifted to negative, indicating weaker buying pressure from US-based investors. “Historically, stronger Bitcoin rallies have coincided with a positive Coinbase Premium,” BQYouTube wrote, suggesting that traders may want to wait for signs of renewed spot demand before expecting a sustainable uptrend.

Tron Has Just Seen Its Largest Profit-Taking Wave In Months In a new thread on X, Glassnode has discussed about the profit-taking spree that has just occurred on the Tron network. Over the last 24 hours, the Realized Profit has hit $1.4 billion, which is the second largest amount for 2025 so far. The “Realized Profit” here naturally refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of gain that TRX investors are realizing through their transactions. It works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to check what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value was less than the latest spot price for any token, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a profit realization equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this profit involved in all transfers occurring on the blockchain during a given day. An indicator known as the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. From the above table, it’s visible that this metric’s value has remained low for TRX, suggesting no capitulation has accompanied the profit-taking. While the latest spike in the Realized Profit is massive, it hasn’t come in isolation. As the below chart shows, the metric’s value has been elevated for Tron in the past few days. Since Saturday, the network has been seeing nearly $1 billion in profit-taking every day. “This marks the most sustained wave of realized profit for TRON in months,” notes the analytics firm. Now, the main question is, who are the investors responsible for this profit realization wave? The below chart answers the question, breaking down the Realized Profit for the various holder groups. The cohorts displayed here have been divided based on coin age . For example, investors who have been holding since between 1 week and 1 month ago are put in the 1w-1m band. It would appear that the 3y-5y band, corresponding to addresses holding since at least three years and at most five years ago, have made up for the majority of the recent Realized Profit spike. “This suggests participants from the 2020–2021 cycle are exiting into strength – a notable shift in behavior that could influence short-term market dynamics,” says Glassnode. TRX Price While most of the cryptocurrency sector has taken a hit during the past week, Tron is relatively unscathed as its price is still trading around $0.33.",Altcoins|Glassnode|tron|Tron Profit-Taking|trx|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 05:00:50

Local outlet Global Times reported Wednesday that the ministry outlined the growing risks tied to biometric technologies. It said recent cases have shown foreign intelligence agencies illegally harvesting facial data from targeted individuals to carry out espionage activities inside China. The ministry did not identify specific firms, but the description of the scheme closely mirrors the model used by World, the crypto startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. China's Ministry of State Security has publicly warned that a foreign company is using the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a gimmick to scan and collect user iris information worldwide and transfer the data source, posing a threat to personal information security and even… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 6, 2025 Crypto Token Incentives Used to Collect Iris Data, China Ministry Says World, formerly known as Worldcoin , offers crypto tokens in exchange for users’ iris scans. The company claims the scans help verify a user’s unique identity and enable digital financial access, particularly in underserved markets. However, World was not explicitly named in the MSS advisory. Cryptonews has reached out to World for comment on the matter. The ministry described a case in which a foreign company allegedly used the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a pretext to scan and collect iris data from users around the world. This data was then transferred overseas, according to the statement, raising red flags for national and individual security. Officials Link Biometric Data Leaks to National Security Threats Biometric identification technologies, the ministry noted, have gained rapid traction in recent years. Used for their speed and accuracy, these systems collect and process facial features, fingerprints, irises and even body movements. While these tools offer convenience, the ministry warned that the risk of data leaks and misuse has also grown significantly. Officials cited cases in which foreign spies forged biometric information to gain access to classified materials or infiltrate sensitive workplaces. In another example, a fingerprint payment system linked to a corporate database was repeatedly breached due to lax cybersecurity, resulting in major data leaks. Further, the ministry said that iris patterns are especially sensitive. They are highly stable and nearly impossible to replicate, making them valuable for authentication in high-security environments. Their uniqueness, however, also makes them a prime target for malicious actors, the ministry said. China Warns Citizens to Scrutinize Biometric Data Practices The warning comes as biometric systems continue to expand across sectors ranging from finance to border control. In this context, the ministry urged the public to remain cautious when handing over biometric data, especially for services involving facial, fingerprint or iris recognition. Citizens, the statement said, have the right to ask data collectors to explain how personal information will be stored, processed and used. The ministry also advised individuals to review privacy policies carefully and to stay alert for signs of excessive data collection.

Recently, a major crypto market participant made a substantial move, hinting at a bullish outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency. This activity often precedes notable price shifts, catching the attention of investors worldwide and sparking discussions about future market direction. Such large-scale movements by institutional players are closely watched indicators. What Do Recent ETH Withdrawals Signify for the Market? According to precise data from The Data Nerd on X, crypto market maker Cumberland executed a massive ETH withdrawal . Specifically, they moved 36,918 ETH, valued at an impressive $132.86 million, from Coinbase Exchange just hours ago. This kind of large-scale withdrawal from an exchange often indicates an intent to hold or use the assets for other purposes, rather than immediately selling them on the open market. This reduces the readily available supply on exchanges, which can support price stability or even upward pressure. Furthermore, another notable transaction occurred when crypto investment manager Abraxas Capital also withdrew 7,191 ETH, worth $25.97 million, from Binance Exchange. These combined movements are not coincidental; they reflect a strategic positioning by major players in the market. Such actions typically suggest confidence in future price appreciation and a proactive approach to capitalize on anticipated market shifts. These withdrawals are distinct from routine operational transfers, highlighting a deliberate strategy. Are Institutional Crypto Players Gearing Up for Growth? The collective actions of entities like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital highlight a growing trend: institutional crypto players are actively positioning themselves for what they perceive as significant market opportunities. These firms manage substantial capital and their moves often provide crucial insight into broader market sentiment. When they pull significant amounts of assets off exchanges, it can reduce immediate selling pressure and signal accumulation for long-term holding or strategic deployment. This behavior aligns strongly with the expectation that these large investors anticipate an upward price trajectory for Ethereum. They are not merely observing the market from the sidelines; they are actively participating in ways that could influence its direction. This strategic accumulation by well-informed entities is a key indicator for many retail investors looking for cues on where the market might be headed. It underscores a belief in Ethereum’s fundamental strength and its role in the evolving digital economy. The Critical Role of a Crypto Market Maker in Bull Runs Understanding the vital role of a crypto market maker is crucial when analyzing these withdrawals. Firms like Cumberland are essential to market liquidity, facilitating seamless trades between buyers and sellers. When a market maker withdraws such a large amount of ETH, it implies they might be engaging in several strategic actions: Long-Term Holding: Moving funds to an off-exchange cold storage wallet for secure, long-term holding, indicating a belief in sustained value growth. DeFi Deployment: Preparing to deploy these assets into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for yield generation or participation in new projects, which often requires assets to be off-exchange. Inventory Management: Anticipating increased demand and thus reducing their exchange holdings to manage inventory more efficiently, preparing to sell at higher prices rather than dumping. Each of these scenarios points towards a positive outlook for Ethereum’s price. Market makers typically operate with sophisticated analytical models, and their significant moves are rarely arbitrary. Their actions are often a leading indicator of impending market shifts, suggesting that they foresee a significant Ethereum rally . Implications for Coinbase ETH Supply and Beyond The large withdrawal from Coinbase ETH reserves by Cumberland is particularly noteworthy due to Coinbase’s standing. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, frequently favored by institutional clients for its security and compliance. A substantial outflow from such a platform can have ripple effects, potentially reducing the readily available supply on exchanges and thus supporting price increases through basic supply-demand dynamics. This trend, coupled with similar movements from other major exchanges like Binance, paints a clear picture. Institutional investors and market makers appear to be preparing for the next significant upward movement in Ethereum’s price. Their actions suggest a strong belief in the asset’s fundamentals, its growing ecosystem, and its future growth potential. These strategic withdrawals are often a precursor to major market events, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. In conclusion, the recent substantial ETH withdrawals by major market participants like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital are strong indicators of an impending Ethereum rally . These strategic moves by institutional players and market makers suggest a collective anticipation of bullish momentum. As these large entities accumulate ETH and move it off exchanges, the market supply on exchanges decreases, potentially paving the way for upward price action. This is a moment where smart money appears to be making its move, signaling exciting times ahead for Ethereum and its vibrant ecosystem. Keeping an eye on these institutional flows can provide valuable insights for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of large ETH withdrawals from exchanges? Large ETH withdrawals often indicate that major investors or market makers intend to hold the assets for the long term, deploy them in DeFi, or are preparing for future demand. This reduces the supply available for immediate sale on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal for price. Q2: Who is Cumberland, and what is their role in the crypto market? Cumberland is a prominent crypto market maker. Their role is to provide liquidity by facilitating trades between buyers and sellers, helping to ensure smooth market operations. Their large transactions are often seen as indicators of institutional sentiment. Q3: Does institutional ETH withdrawal guarantee a price rally? While large institutional withdrawals are strong indicators of bullish sentiment and often precede price rallies, they do not guarantee a rally. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and price movements can be volatile. Q4: How do these movements affect the overall Ethereum supply? When large amounts of ETH are withdrawn from exchanges, it reduces the circulating supply readily available for trading on those platforms. This decrease in exchange supply, combined with potential increased demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price.

Just as Bitcoin and other digital assets react to global sentiment, so too do traditional currencies. Recently, the Asia FX Outlook has been a subject of keen interest, with many regional currencies experiencing slight weakening, while the Indian Rupee has staged a notable recovery from its recent record lows. This intriguing development is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) strategic decision to hold interest rates steady, providing a much-needed anchor in turbulent waters. But what exactly does this mean for the broader financial landscape, and how does it connect to the overarching themes of economic stability and growth? Decoding the Shifting Tides of Asia FX Outlook The past few weeks have seen a nuanced performance across Asian foreign exchange markets. While some currencies have shown resilience, others have succumbed to external pressures, reflecting the complex interplay of global economic forces. The general sentiment has been one of slight weakening across the board, influenced by factors such as a strong US dollar, rising commodity prices, and persistent inflation concerns. This broader trend sets the stage for understanding the individual performances within the region. External Pressures: A robust US dollar, fueled by expectations of continued hawkishness from the Federal Reserve, often puts downward pressure on emerging market currencies. Commodity Price Volatility: Fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices can significantly impact the trade balances of net importers or exporters in Asia, affecting their currency valuations. Inflationary Concerns: Rising inflation in various Asian economies prompts central banks to consider tighter monetary policies, which can attract or deter foreign investment based on interest rate differentials. Geopolitical Developments: Ongoing global events and geopolitical tensions contribute to uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets, often at the expense of riskier emerging market currencies. Despite these headwinds, the regional Asia FX Outlook remains a critical barometer for global economic health, with each currency’s movement telling a unique story of domestic policy and international influence. Indian Rupee Recovery: A Resilient Comeback Story Amidst the general weakening trend in Asia, the Indian Rupee Recovery stands out as a significant event. After touching a record low against the US dollar, the rupee has demonstrated remarkable resilience, bouncing back in a manner that has surprised many market observers. This recovery is not merely a statistical anomaly but a testament to underlying economic strengths and proactive policy measures. The rupee’s journey from its nadir has been closely watched. Several factors contributed to its initial decline, including a widening trade deficit, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows from Indian equities, and the broad strengthening of the US dollar. However, the recovery phase has been underpinned by: Strong Inflows: A resurgence of foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows, particularly into debt markets, has provided crucial support. Improved Economic Data: Positive domestic economic indicators, such as robust GDP growth figures and declining inflation (even if gradual), have bolstered investor confidence. RBI’s Intervention: The central bank’s strategic interventions in the forex market, including selling dollars from its reserves, have helped stabilize the currency. Export Performance: A healthy performance in key export sectors has helped narrow the trade deficit, reducing pressure on the rupee. This Indian Rupee Recovery highlights the dynamic nature of currency markets and the significant impact of both internal economic health and external market forces. RBI Monetary Policy: The Anchoring Force of Stability At the heart of the Indian Rupee’s recent stability and recovery lies the RBI Monetary Policy . The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% for the eighth consecutive time played a pivotal role in calming market jitters and providing a sense of predictability. This decision, announced after careful consideration of inflationary pressures and growth prospects, signals a cautious yet confident approach by the central bank. The RBI’s approach can be understood through these key points: Inflation Management: While inflation has shown signs of moderation, the RBI remains vigilant, aiming to bring it within its target range sustainably. Holding rates steady allows the central bank to assess the impact of previous rate hikes without stifling nascent economic growth. Growth Support: By not raising rates further, the RBI avoids adding to borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, thereby supporting economic expansion and investment. Exchange Rate Stability: A stable interest rate environment reduces interest rate volatility, which in turn helps stabilize the rupee. Predictable rates make India an attractive destination for foreign capital seeking reasonable returns. Global Cues: The RBI also considers global monetary policy trends, particularly those of major central banks like the US Federal Reserve. Aligning its policy helps prevent excessive capital outflows. The steadfastness of the RBI Monetary Policy demonstrates a commitment to balancing price stability with economic growth, a crucial factor in attracting and retaining foreign investment. Navigating Global Forex Trends and Their Local Impact The performance of Asian currencies, including the Indian Rupee, cannot be viewed in isolation. They are deeply intertwined with Global Forex Trends , which are influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from geopolitical tensions to shifts in major economies’ monetary policies. Understanding these broader trends is essential for grasping the local impact on currencies. Consider the following: Global Factor Impact on Asia FX Specific Effect on Rupee US Dollar Strength Puts downward pressure on most Asian currencies as capital flows to safe-haven assets. Increases import costs, widens trade deficit, puts depreciation pressure. Oil Price Fluctuations Net oil importers (e.g., India, Japan) face currency depreciation; exporters (e.g., Malaysia) see appreciation. Higher oil prices worsen current account deficit, increasing rupee vulnerability. China’s Economic Performance Significant impact on regional trade and investment flows, affecting currencies of trade partners. Slowdown in China can reduce demand for Indian exports, impacting rupee. Geopolitical Events Increases risk aversion, leading to capital flight from emerging markets. Can trigger sudden outflows, leading to sharp depreciation. The intricate dance of Global Forex Trends means that even strong domestic policies must contend with external headwinds. India’s ability to navigate these trends speaks volumes about its economic resilience and policy frameworks. Understanding Currency Market Volatility: What Drives the Swings? The very nature of foreign exchange markets is defined by Currency Market Volatility . Currencies are constantly in motion, responding to an endless stream of economic data, political developments, and market sentiment. For investors, understanding the drivers of this volatility is key to making informed decisions. Key drivers of currency fluctuations include: Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in one country relative to another can attract foreign capital, strengthening its currency. Economic Performance: Strong GDP growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation generally lead to a stronger currency, as the economy is perceived as healthy. Political Stability: Countries with stable political environments are often seen as safer investments, attracting capital and strengthening their currency. Conversely, political instability can lead to rapid depreciation. Trade Balances: A country with a persistent trade surplus (exports exceeding imports) tends to see its currency strengthen due to higher demand for its goods and services. Speculation: Large-scale speculative trading by financial institutions can significantly amplify currency movements, sometimes detached from economic fundamentals. While Currency Market Volatility presents risks, it also creates opportunities for investors who can accurately anticipate or react to these movements. The Indian Rupee’s recent journey is a prime example of how various factors converge to create significant shifts in value. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Landscape The current financial landscape, characterized by both global uncertainties and pockets of resilience, presents a mix of challenges and opportunities for investors and policymakers alike. Challenges: Sustained US Dollar Strength: The persistent strength of the US dollar continues to exert pressure on emerging market currencies, making imports more expensive and potentially fueling inflation. Global Inflationary Pressures: While some countries are seeing inflation cool, the risk of resurgence from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events remains. Capital Outflows: Higher interest rates in developed economies could lead to continued capital outflows from emerging markets, putting pressure on their currencies and equity markets. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing conflicts and trade tensions introduce uncertainty, deterring foreign investment and increasing market volatility. Opportunities: Resilient Domestic Demand: Economies with strong domestic consumption can cushion against global slowdowns, offering attractive investment opportunities. Policy Stability: Central banks like the RBI, demonstrating consistent and predictable monetary policy, enhance investor confidence and attract long-term capital. Diversification: For global investors, the performance of currencies like the Indian Rupee offers diversification benefits, especially if they show decoupling from broader negative trends. Technological Advancements: Digitalization and innovation in various sectors can drive productivity gains and attract investment, strengthening economic fundamentals. Navigating this complex environment requires a nuanced understanding of both macro-economic indicators and specific policy responses. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those looking to make sense of these currency dynamics, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from central banks like the RBI and the Federal Reserve. Their forward guidance on interest rates and inflation targets can provide crucial clues about future currency movements. Track Trade and Current Account Data: A country’s trade balance and current account deficit/surplus are strong indicators of its currency’s health. Improving figures often signal potential appreciation. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the Indian Rupee shows strength, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Consider Long-Term Fundamentals: Short-term volatility can be distracting. Focus on the long-term economic fundamentals of a country, such as GDP growth, fiscal health, and policy stability, when making investment decisions. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Geopolitical events can have swift and significant impacts on currency markets. Staying abreast of global news can help anticipate potential shifts. By applying these insights, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities presented by evolving currency markets. Conclusion: A Remarkable Recovery in a Volatile World The recent performance of the Asia FX Outlook , particularly the compelling Indian Rupee Recovery from its record lows, offers a fascinating case study in economic resilience and strategic central banking. The RBI Monetary Policy , characterized by its steady hand on interest rates, has proven instrumental in providing stability amidst a backdrop of fluctuating Global Forex Trends and persistent Currency Market Volatility . This delicate balance between supporting growth and managing inflation is a tightrope walk that the RBI has managed with notable success, instilling confidence in both domestic and international investors. While the broader Asian currencies faced slight headwinds, India’s economic fundamentals, coupled with timely policy interventions, allowed the rupee to chart a distinct and positive course. This remarkable comeback serves as a reminder that even in an interconnected global economy, strong domestic policies and robust economic indicators can provide a crucial buffer against external shocks. As we move forward, monitoring these trends will be vital for understanding the broader implications for investment, trade, and economic stability across the region.

Experts Split on Altcoin Market’s Next Move,https://cryptopotato.com/altseason-or-another-false-start-experts-split-on-altcoin-markets-next-move/,"Many experts have predicted the return of a long-awaited altcoin season. A declining share of Bitcoin dominance and sporadic outperformance in select altcoins have pointed to a subtle rotation into smaller, higher-risk assets, amidst growing appetite for the market. A recent report, however, casts doubt on the sustainability of an altcoin rally. Altcoin Rally Lacks Support Matrixport warned that it may once again fizzle out. Analyst Markus Thielen noted that, despite recurring calls for a new bull market, only two brief altcoin surges have occurred in recent memory. In fact, the most notable was in Q4 2024. These rallies, which saw temporary spikes in funding rates, lacked underlying fundamental support, which led to rapid reversals. As such, Thielen argued the current move mirrors previous patterns, with declining funding rates indicating that enthusiasm has already faded. The analyst added that the altcoin market remains structurally weak, and investors hoping for steady upside may be disappointed yet again. This comes as Bitcoin’s dominance briefly slipped near 60% which has historically preceded full altcoin seasons, where these tokens outperform BTC significantly. Certain data also pointed toward capital rotation, which further strengthened the narratives of an altseason. Conflicting Signals SwissBlock’s “Altcoin Vector” reported that the altcoin market is transitioning toward a potential breakout zone. It said that “smart capital” is rotating into positions before retail traders notice the shift. They highlighted that while momentum and market structure are improving, this is not yet a breakout; instead, it’s an early stage where informed investors begin pre-positioning for a possible future rally. This phase can offer strategic entry opportunities before broader market sentiment turns bullish and prices accelerate. Another market watcher argued that an altseason may soon begin based on USDT dominance, which has been stuck in a descending triangle pattern for nearly two years and now appears close to breaking down. A decline in USDT dominance typically suggests that traders are moving capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets like altcoins, thereby fueling broad altcoin rallies. As such, the market action seen so far has only been a warm-up, and a decisive breakdown in USDT dominance would trigger a strong shift of liquidity into altcoins, which could potentially spark a major altcoin bull run.

Recent data reveals a compelling trend: a select group of strategic firms are accumulating vast ETH reserves , signaling growing confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. This accumulation of Ethereum holdings by major players is a development every crypto enthusiast should know about, especially regarding the overall ETH supply . Unpacking the Scale of These ETH Reserves The combined ETH reserves held by 64 prominent firms have now surged past the 3 million ETH mark. Each of these firms holds more than 100 Ethereum, indicating a strategic long-term perspective. Specifically, these substantial holdings currently stand at approximately 3.04 million ETH, an impressive sum valued at over $10.87 billion. This substantial figure represents about 2.52% of the total ETH supply . Such a significant portion held by a relatively small number of entities highlights a concentrated interest in Ethereum’s future. Moreover, this trend suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s potential for continued growth, further solidifying the importance of these strategic Ethereum holdings . Who Leads the Charge in Institutional ETH Holdings? Delving deeper into these impressive figures, we find that nine of these firms individually hold more than 100,000 ETH. This concentration among a few key players is a testament to the scale of their investment strategies. The top three firms leading this charge in accumulating significant institutional ETH are particularly notable: Bitmine: Holding a staggering 833,100 ETH. SharpLink Gaming: Possessing a robust 521,900 ETH. The Ether Machine: With a substantial 345,400 ETH in its portfolio. These entities represent a significant portion of the overall crypto firm ETH on the market, showcasing a clear pattern of large-scale accumulation by strategic investors. Their actions often set a precedent for other market participants. Why Are These Ethereum Holdings So Significant? The accumulation of such large Ethereum holdings by these firms carries significant implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its long-term viability. When major crypto firm ETH allocations increase, it often indicates a bullish outlook and a belief in the future of the ETH supply . Secondly, these substantial ETH reserves can contribute to market stability. Large, long-term holders are less likely to engage in rapid selling, which can reduce volatility. Therefore, their presence helps to anchor the market, providing a foundation for organic growth. This strategic positioning suggests these firms are genuinely invested in the network’s success. What’s Next for Institutional ETH and the Market? The growing concentration of institutional ETH in the hands of a few large entities raises interesting questions about market dynamics. While it can reduce immediate selling pressure, it also means a significant portion of the ETH supply is not actively circulating. This can influence liquidity and price discovery in the long run. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Their decisions regarding these significant ETH reserves could have a ripple effect, impacting everything from network governance to future development initiatives. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the role of these major holders will undoubtedly remain a key area of focus for the entire crypto market. In conclusion, the substantial accumulation of over 3 million ETH by 64 strategic firms underscores a powerful trend of increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum. These significant Ethereum holdings by major players like Bitmine, SharpLink Gaming, and The Ether Machine highlight a long-term investment perspective that could foster greater market stability and signal a robust future for the network. As the crypto landscape matures, the strategic actions of these large holders, and their impact on the overall ETH supply , will continue to shape the trajectory of one of the world’s leading blockchains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are “strategic reserve firms” in this context? A1: Strategic reserve firms are entities, often institutional investors or large corporations, that hold significant amounts of cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, as a long-term investment or part of their treasury. They typically hold more than 100 ETH, indicating a strategic, rather than speculative, approach. Q2: How much ETH do these firms collectively hold? A2: According to Strategic ETH Reserve, 64 firms collectively hold approximately 3.04 million ETH, which is valued at over $10.87 billion. This represents about 2.52% of the total Ethereum supply. Q3: Which firms hold the largest amounts of ETH? A3: The top three firms identified with the largest Ethereum holdings are Bitmine (833,100 ETH), SharpLink Gaming (521,900 ETH), and The Ether Machine (345,400 ETH). Nine firms hold over 100,000 ETH each. Q4: What does this accumulation mean for Ethereum’s price? A4: Large-scale accumulation of ETH reserves by strategic firms often signals a bullish outlook. It indicates strong long-term confidence in Ethereum, which can contribute to market stability by reducing immediate selling pressure and potentially supporting future price appreciation. Q5: How does this affect the overall ETH supply? A5: When a significant portion of the ETH supply is held in strategic reserves, it means less of it is actively circulating in the market. This can impact liquidity and price discovery. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Q6: Is this a bullish or bearish sign for Ethereum? A6: Generally, the accumulation of large Ethereum holdings by strategic firms is considered a bullish sign. It demonstrates strong institutional confidence, long-term commitment, and can contribute to market stability, indicating a belief in Ethereum’s future growth and adoption.

This trend may now slow down, Novogratz said. “We've probably seen the peak in treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said today at Galaxy Digital's second-quarter 2025 earnings call. “The question now is: Which of the existing companies will become giants?” The more friendly regulatory environment in the US has seen a surge in the number of crypto treasury companies in recent months. These companies raise funds through IPOs and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets on their balance sheets. While early-stage companies followed Michael Saylor's Bitcoin-focused model, newer startups have begun adding Ethereum, Solana, and other smaller-cap crypto assets to their portfolios. Novogratz noted that Ethereum already has two major institutional holders, Tom Lee's BitMine and Joe Lubin's SharpLink, and predicted continued growth. However, he added that new entrants may “have trouble breathing.” Galaxy Digital currently works with more than 20 crypto treasury investment firms. The company earns management fees by managing their crypto assets. Novogratz claimed that this collaboration has brought approximately $2 billion in assets to their platform, providing “recurring revenue.” Related News: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Significant Changes to Ethereum: Here's What Will Happen If They Are Accepted According to the company's second-quarter financial results, Galaxy earned net income of $30.7 million this year, compared to a loss of $177 million in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.08, falling short of analyst expectations. Novogratz sees crypto treasury companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way for hedge funds to enter the sector without directly owning tokens. In the long run, he believes traditional financial institutions will also transition to blockchain-based market structures. However, tokenization, the process of transferring traditional assets (such as stocks) to the blockchain, remains an unresolved issue. Novogratz cited the “Project Crypto” initiative spearheaded by SEC Chairman Paul Atkins as an example, noting that US markets are being explored for potential blockchain migration. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal’s main goal is to protect Brazil’s reserves from foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks while also promoting blockchain innovation. So far, it attracted both support and criticism from top officials. This move is also part of the global trend that was started by a US executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Bitcoin is rising, with Michigan’s State Retirement System increasing its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF holdings to $11.3 million and maintaining a strong Ethereum position. Public pension funds, including Wisconsin’s $321 million Bitcoin bet, are helping fuel a surge in crypto ETF inflows, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to new highs. Brazil Considers Bitcoin Reserve Plan Brazil is moving closer to potentially becoming the next nation to embrace Bitcoin. On Aug. 20, the country’s House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing to discuss a bill that proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. The proposal was originally introduced in November of 2024, and its main goal is to allow up to 5% of Brazil’s treasury funds—approximately $15 billion based on the Central Bank's $300 billion reserve —to be allocated to Bitcoin. Scheduled hearing The hearing is expected to include participation from at least six prominent institutions, including the Central Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Finance, representatives from fintech companies, the traditional banking sector, and a crypto advocacy group. According to the bill, the purpose of the reserve is twofold: to safeguard the country’s international reserves against foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks, and to encourage the development and adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. While the proposal has received some support, it also caused debate. Pedro Giocondo Guerra , chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, voiced strong backing for the initiative earlier this year by calling Bitcoin “the digital gold” and asserting that the debate is crucial to Brazil’s long-term economic prosperity. On the other hand, critics are a bit more cautious. Nilton David , Brazil’s central bank director of monetary policy, argued that including crypto assets in the country’s foreign reserves would be inappropriate. This move by Brazil is part of a global trend that was started by US President Donald Trump’s March executive order to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Since then, countries like Kazakhstan revealed similar plans. Others like India and Sweden are also rumored to be exploring the idea. Currently, the countries with the largest Bitcoin holdings include the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador. Whether Brazil joins their ranks will depend on the outcome of the upcoming legislative process. Michigan Pension Fund Bets Bigger on Bitcoin It is not only countries creating Bitcoin stockpiles. Michigan’s State Retirement System made a big move into the digital asset space by increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal that by the end of Q2 2025, the pension fund owned 300,000 shares of ARKB. This is a large jump from the 110,000 shares it held the previous year. At press time, these shares were valued at approximately $11.3 million based on ARKB’s current trading price of $37.72, assuming no shares have been sold since the last disclosure. State of Michigan Retirement system holdings (Source: SEC ) The ARKB ETF, which is one of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC in January of 2024, provides direct exposure to Bitcoin, simplifying institutional investment into the asset. In addition to its Bitcoin stake, Michigan’s pension fund also holds 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), a position that is worth around $9.6 million. This ETH allocation stayed steady since September of 2024, which indicated that the fund has long-term confidence in both of the leading cryptos. Michigan is also not alone in this trend. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed a much larger Bitcoin investment of $321 million through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale’s GBT. This all suggests that there is a growing appetite among public pension funds for cryptocurrency exposure. This institutional came as Bitcoin ETFs continue to thrive in 2025. In fact, the sector experienced over $1 billion in net inflows on two consecutive days in mid-July. That inflow streak helped propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $123,000. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: BitBo ) Altcoins have not been left behind, as Ethereum ETFs are also gaining good traction. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF became the third-fastest fund to surpass $10 billion in assets under management. On-chain data from Dune Analytics shows that Ether ETF holdings surged by over 40% in the past month alone, which fueled a sharp rally in Ethereum’s price to above $3,800 in July—more than doubling in value since early May.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 05:30:00

This move signals a growing interest in bridging traditional finance with digital assets, especially from established tech companies. It is certainly a moment that captures the attention of anyone keen on the evolution of digital currencies. What is a USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? A USD-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, typically fiat currencies like the USD, or commodities like gold. Stability: Offers predictability in a volatile market. Utility: Facilitates transactions, remittances, and savings. Bridge: Acts as a crucial link between traditional finance and the decentralized world. NHN KCP’s recent actions highlight the increasing demand for reliable digital payment solutions. Their proposed stablecoin, named USDW, aims to serve these needs. NHN KCP’s Strategic Move: Introducing the USDW Stablecoin According to reports from Herald Business, NHN KCP has formally filed trademark applications for USDW. These filings were submitted to the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) on July 17 and July 29. This initiative follows a series of earlier trademark registrations. In June, the company secured 11 related trademarks for won-pegged stablecoins. The addition of a USDW stablecoin signifies a broader ambition to cater to both domestic and international markets. It suggests a comprehensive strategy to embrace the potential of digital currencies fully. Implications for the South Korean Stablecoin Market and Beyond NHN KCP’s foray into a South Korean stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar carries significant implications. It could bolster the country’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation. Furthermore, it might pave the way for wider adoption of digital assets in everyday transactions. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Adoption: A stable, reliable digital currency could encourage more businesses and consumers to use cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: A USD-pegged stablecoin simplifies international transactions, offering lower fees and faster processing. Regulatory Clarity: Such high-profile projects often prompt clearer regulatory frameworks, benefiting the entire industry. This move by NHN KCP, a subsidiary of a major tech firm, reflects a growing trend where established entities explore the practical applications of blockchain technology. It underscores the potential for a new era of digital currency use. The Future of Digital Currency and Stablecoins The global interest in stablecoins continues to surge. Governments and private entities worldwide are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued stablecoins. This trend is driven by the desire for efficient, secure, and transparent financial systems. NHN KCP’s proactive steps with the USD-pegged stablecoin USDW position them at the forefront of this evolution. Their strategy could inspire other traditional financial and tech companies to explore similar ventures. It certainly highlights the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. The future of payments is undeniably digital, and stablecoins are set to play a crucial role. Conclusion: A Landmark Step for Digital Finance NHN KCP’s trademark filings for the USDW stablecoin mark a significant milestone. It’s not just about a new digital asset; it’s about a major South Korean tech firm committing to the future of finance. This development could accelerate the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, offering a stable and efficient medium for digital transactions. As the digital economy continues to expand, such initiatives are vital in shaping its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is NHN KCP? A1: NHN KCP is a subsidiary of NHN, a prominent South Korean tech company. It is known for its payment gateway services and is now expanding into digital assets. Q2: What is the USDW stablecoin? A2: USDW is the proposed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin for which NHN KCP has filed trademark applications. It aims to maintain a stable value against the USD. Q3: Why is NHN KCP developing a USD-pegged stablecoin? A3: The company is likely developing USDW to provide a stable digital asset for transactions, potentially for both domestic and international use, leveraging the stability of the U.S. dollar. Q4: How does this relate to their previous won-pegged stablecoin filings? A4: The USDW filings follow earlier registrations for won-pegged stablecoins. This suggests a broader strategy to offer stable digital currencies pegged to both local (won) and international (USD) currencies, expanding their market reach. Q5: What impact could USDW have on the South Korean market? A5: USDW could enhance the adoption of digital currencies in South Korea by offering a stable and reliable option for payments and remittances, potentially leading to clearer regulatory guidelines for stablecoins.

SOL is moving sideways around the $160 mark, and DOGE is holding near $0.20 but showing little sign of a breakout. For many investors, that’s a cue to start looking beyond the usual names—toward altcoins with more energy, fresh narratives, and potential for meaningful growth. That shift in focus is bringing more attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin. As traders rotate out of DOGE and SOL, many are being drawn to MAGACOIN’s unique positioning—one that combines cultural relevance with a strong community ethos and anti-centralisation values. XRP Rebounds as Traders Look for Clarity and Conviction Interest in XRP isn’t just rising because of market hype—it’s about timing. With growing chatter around a possible breakthrough in the SEC case, some investors see XRP as well-positioned if regulatory clarity finally comes through. The network itself is still active, too—over a million new users joined in July, and transaction volume remains near the top of the charts. Even so, XRP isn’t the only name on traders’ watchlists. As the altcoin landscape shifts, so do portfolio strategies. Investors are paying closer attention to projects that offer more than just price movement—especially those that combine solid fundamentals with a strong community and a story that resonates. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Shift As a meme-powered cryptocurrency and decentralized political memecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the more talked-about newcomers in the space. Its focus on community governance, anti-centralization values, and a distinct ideological identity is resonating with traders—especially those from the SOL and DOGE camps who are starting to reconsider where they put their capital. Momentum around the project has been building. On-chain data shows a clear uptick in wallet activity, accumulation trends, and online engagement. Some are already drawing comparisons to the early growth trajectories of DOGE and SHIBA INU, with bullish forecasts suggesting MAGACOIN could deliver gains of up to 18,900%. It’s still early days, but the project’s appeal goes beyond tech. There’s a growing cultural relevance to what MAGACOIN represents—and in today’s crypto market, that kind of resonance can be just as powerful as the code behind it. Looking Ahead: Traders Want More Than Price Movement Whether or not XRP breaks past $3.12, or Solana and DOGE reclaim their previous highs, one thing is clear—traders are chasing more than just performance. Investors are on the lookout for altcoins with the potential to replicate massive gains and high returns. So far, MAGACOIN FINANCE has benefitted from the capital shift—not as a competitor to the top players, but as an indicator of where the market is headed.

49621457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780079,1754458257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49621457.jpeg,Beijing is still discussing consolidation plans with chip companies.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/beijing-stumbles-in-chip-merger-ivdre/,"Beijing is grappling with setbacks in its plan to turn a disjointed chip industry into a few powerhouse firms that can stand up to global competition. According to sources, the Chinese government has been discussing with key chip equipment manufacturers to consider a state-led merger that would pool their technologies. However, talks have derailed as companies and investors clashed over the proposed ownership setup and valuation. Lee says a merger could help China reduce its dependence on US firms Amid US efforts to limit China’s access to semiconductors, Beijing is pushing to reinforce its domestic chip industry , with the National Development and Reform Commission at the helm of the merger talks. Still, Beijing has a long way to go, especially with corporations and investors clashing over how the merger should be structured and valued. One person familiar with the talks commented, “There were too many split interests. The prospective sellers don’t want to sell at a loss, and the buyers don’t want to pay a premium.” Another insider confirmed that negotiations were still in progress, although he noted that a full-scale consolidation was becoming increasingly improbable. Meanwhile, analysts like Edison Lee, a semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, maintain that consolidation would aid the country in creating its own self-sufficient ecosystem and phase out reliance on US companies such as Applied Materials and Lam Research. Currently, 26 semiconductor acquisitions have been announced in 2025. The highest-profile deal so far is the merger between Hygon, a CPU designer for servers and data centers, and supercomputer maker Sugon. Their deal is valued at over $16 billion and will be completed via a share swap. Analysts are concerned that consolidation may not work to Beijing’s expectations Beijing is also aiming for more targeted financing for firms through mergers. According to Lin Qingyuan, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein, authorities have realized that fragmented investment fails to deliver the scale required for profitability. As a result, they’re focusing on developing a handful of globally competitive national champions. However, there are still concerns about whether consolidation would work to improve the country’s chip industry. An investor even explained that many of the companies up for sale have no true technological moat and thus, without a strategic plan, any acquisition attempt would likely fail. Lin also pointed out that most companies best equipped to acquire underperforming assets are often the first to reject them over concerns about the asset’s weaknesses and high price tag. Nonetheless, a widening range of industries, including real estate and textile equipment manufacturing, are beginning to explore acquisition opportunities in the chip sector. However, despite the growing enthusiasm, not all deals reach completion. Based on Wind data, eight mergers or acquisitions announced this year have collapsed. For instance, the Empyrean Technology, a leading Chinese EDA firm, announced in March its intention to acquire smaller competitor Xpeedic to expand its toolset. But the deal was scrapped last month due to unresolved disagreements over terms. Additionally, Zhejiang Aokang, a leather footwear manufacturer, and Ningbo Cixing, a knitting machinery specialist, have recently withdrawn from proposed semiconductor acquisitions due to valuation disputes. However, analysts have noted that most asset owners are unwilling to accept below-book-value offers even with deteriorating financial metrics, making consolidation and acquisition strategies unfeasible.

This week, the buzz surrounds a major development from BitBridge Capital Strategies , a prominent firm specializing in Bitcoin investment strategies. They are setting their sights on a prestigious Nasdaq listing , a move that could reshape how traditional finance views digital assets. BitBridge Capital Strategies Targets a Groundbreaking Nasdaq Listing BitBridge Capital Strategies, a firm dedicated to creating long-term shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC, recently made headlines with its ambitious plans. The Block reported that the company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This potential Nasdaq listing marks a significant milestone, indicating growing confidence from traditional financial markets in crypto-focused entities. Before their full Nasdaq debut, the company’s shares will commence trading on over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This pre-listing phase is slated for the end of the third quarter, offering early access to interested investors. The move highlights a calculated approach to entering the public market, building momentum and visibility for their unique Bitcoin investment approach. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Crucial for Bitcoin Investment Firms? A Nasdaq listing for a firm like BitBridge Capital Strategies provides immense benefits. It offers enhanced liquidity for shareholders, greater transparency through stringent regulatory oversight, and increased investor confidence. This exposure on a major exchange can attract a broader institutional and retail investor base, validating the firm’s strategic Bitcoin investment focus. Such a listing also elevates the perception of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance. It demonstrates that crypto-centric businesses can operate within established regulatory frameworks, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital to flow into the digital asset space. This move is a testament to the growing maturity of the crypto market. Strategic Focus: Maximizing Shareholder Value with BTC-Collateralized Loans BitBridge Capital Strategies emphasizes its core mission: generating sustained shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC. As part of this effort, the firm plans to introduce an innovative BTC-collateralized loan product. This offering aims to allow clients to borrow traditional currency using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral, providing flexible financial solutions without liquidating their BTC. The introduction of a BTC-collateralized loan product is a smart move in the evolving crypto finance landscape. It addresses a key need for crypto holders seeking liquidity while maintaining their long-term Bitcoin investment positions. This service could become a significant revenue stream and a cornerstone of their value creation strategy, appealing to a diverse set of investors and institutions. Navigating OTC Markets: A Key Step Before the Big Debut The decision to trade on OTC markets initially is a strategic and prudent one. OTC markets facilitate direct trading of securities between two parties, outside of formal exchanges like Nasdaq. This period allows BitBridge Capital Strategies to establish a public trading history, gauge market interest, and comply with various regulatory requirements before a full exchange listing. Trading on OTC markets provides an interim stage for the company to refine its public operations and attract initial investors. It’s a crucial step in their journey towards becoming a publicly traded entity on a major U.S. exchange, building anticipation for the eventual Nasdaq listing . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? The planned Nasdaq listing by BitBridge Capital Strategies signals a broader trend of institutional adoption and integration within the cryptocurrency space. As more crypto-native firms seek public market exposure, it further legitimizes the industry and bridges the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This development could inspire other Bitcoin investment firms to explore similar avenues, fostering greater capital flow and innovation across the sector. The expansion into services like the BTC-collateralized loan also highlights Bitcoin’s evolving utility beyond just a store of value. It showcases how firms are creating practical, yield-generating solutions that can attract traditional investors looking for new financial instruments. This is an exciting time for anyone watching the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, indicating a robust future for institutional crypto engagement. In summary, BitBridge Capital Strategies’ ambitious move towards a Nasdaq listing, preceded by strategic OTC trading and bolstered by its focused Bitcoin investment strategy and innovative loan products, marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and its undeniable integration into the global financial system. This development is certainly one to watch closely.

Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-to-drop-before-the-real-move-analyst-forecasts-new-highs-in-q3/,"As Solana (SOL) attempts to reclaim a crucial level, a market watcher forecasted a massive rally for this quarter. However, some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency will retest the range lows soon. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer Solana Nears Crucial Level On Tuesday, Solana surged 9.6% from the recent lows, driven by the start of Solana Mobile’s global shipments of the Seeker, its second-generation Web3 smartphone, to over 50 countries. The news propelled the altcoin to a multi-day high of $171, fueling bullish sentiment among investors before its price retraced to the mid-zone of its local range. Notably, SOL has been hovering between the $140-$180 range since the April-May breakout, attempting to reclaim the local high for the past three months. During the June correction, SOL momentarily lost its local range lows, retesting the $120-$130 zone as support. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed its range amid the July rally, briefly breaking out of the upper boundary and hitting a five-month high of $206 two weeks ago. Since then, Solana has seen a 25% correction from the highs to the mid-zone of its local price range, currently trading between the $160-$164 levels. Amid its recent performance, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted SOL’s most crucial levels, based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) indicator. According to the chart, the key support area for the altcoin is around the $165 mark, where the largest supply cluster is with 44.4 million SOL, or 7.42% of the supply. As a result, Solana must reclaim the $165 level soon, or it will risk turning this key level into a key resistance, leading to further downside. Nonetheless, if this level is reclaimed, then the altcoin would have to retest the crucial resistance levels around $177 and $189, where investors have also accumulated 27.6 million and 23.6 million SOL, respectively. SOL Preparing For The ‘Real’ Run? Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted Solana’s recent price action, asserting that SOL is “quietly trending higher” with higher lows and turning resistance levels as support. The market watcher forecasted that Solana would reach a new all-time high this quarter, as he doubts “the train stops anytime soon” once it finally breaks out of the $200 resistance. Meanwhile, Crypto Batman suggested that the altcoin will see another correction soon. To the analyst, Solana could have a 10% drop to its four-month ascending support line, which sits around the $150 level, before “the real move.” Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has bounced from this support line twice, in April and June, before rallying to local highs during the May and July price breakouts. Related Reading: Cardano Marks Historical Milestone With Governance Vote, Hoskinson Reacts Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows asserted that SOL could see a significant rally this year despite the recent underperformance, as network activity remains strong. He predicted a 10%-15% correction, affirming that “a dip towards $140-$150 before reversal is highly likely to happen.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $$163, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

Affiliates today look for stable systems, clear payouts, and full control of their earnings. Waiting weeks for payments or trying to figure out complex charts no longer works. This guide lists the 7 best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms in 2025, based on what really matters: steady income, easy tracking, and fast withdrawals. Whether you run a small blog or a high-traffic site, picking the right crypto platform can shape your success. Let’s look at who actually delivers and who falls short. Spartans: Easy-to-Track Payouts With Real Speed Spartans ranks highest among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms because it focuses on what matters: results you can see and money you can access. While other sites create multi-level systems or delay approvals, Spartans keeps things clear and fast. It gives you simple choices with CPA, RevShare, or Hybrid deals. There are no extra steps, no hidden conditions. What makes Spartans stand out in the list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms is that it uses its own crypto system to send your affiliate payouts fast. Once you earn, the payment goes straight to your wallet in seconds. You get real-time updates on how many players you referred, what they bet, and how much you made. The dashboard is mobile-ready and easy to read without any extra help. With more than 5,900 games, 43 providers, and a full sportsbook tied to one wallet, every referral is worth more. With regular promotions like a Lamborghini giveaway and strong deposit deals, the conversions stay high. That means more steady commissions. Spartans remains the top pick for affiliates who want simple terms, fast payments, and full control. Stake.com: Strong Traffic, But Complex Payout Rules Stake.com attracts affiliates with its huge traffic, wide crypto coverage, and global brand name. It has a smooth affiliate portal and several commission options. Still, it uses a tier system where your payout depends on hitting set levels, not just activity. It also has longer approval steps and delayed payouts, especially for new users. Stake works well for large affiliates with steady volume, but smaller partners may find it harder to keep pace. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Stake requires more effort to unlock top rewards. BC.Game: Fun Platform With Tracking Challenges BC.Game is well-known for its gamified betting site and wide crypto choices. Its affiliate setup allows both CPA and revenue share, and in-site bonuses can raise your referral earnings. However, its tracking tools are less accurate than what top sites offer. Some affiliates have also faced tracking errors or slow help from support. While it can still work for those familiar with the brand, it takes more time to manage. BC.Game still earns a spot on this list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms. Roobet: Great Brand, Slower Payout Timing Roobet is a popular name thanks to its fun live games and strong branding. Its affiliate plan pays through revenue share, with rates increasing based on referred player activity. But Roobet’s payments are not instant and follow fixed dates. You often need to send invoices or reach out for updates, which slows your growth. Still, for affiliates with audiences who enjoy Roobet’s style, the site remains useful. As one of the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Roobet’s main challenge is payout speed. Bet365: Trusted Brand, Limited Crypto Support Bet365 stands out for its strong reputation in online betting. Affiliates in fiat-based markets get good commissions and broad reach. But the site is not built for crypto, and payments go through banks instead of wallets. This might feel slow for those used to digital payouts. Still, Bet365’s brand strength can bring steady returns. Within the group of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, it offers reliability even if crypto tools are limited. Betano: Stable Option in Local Markets Betano performs well in some licensed areas, with a loyal user base, especially across Europe. It has a working affiliate system and pays on time, though it lacks in-depth tools and detailed tracking. Affiliates focused on crypto markets may find its fiat-first setup less useful. But for those in allowed regions with sports-focused traffic, it’s still a dependable choice. Betano’s inclusion in the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms list comes from its local strength. Gamdom: Appeals to Streamers, Needs Oversight Gamdom is a modern site that attracts younger players and stream viewers. It supports crypto, has a clean design, and features some rare games. Its affiliate plan is built more around reward codes and engagement than standard CPA or RevShare. Some users report success, while others see tracking problems or slow replies from support. If your audience is into streaming or eSports, it might work, but close tracking is important. Gamdom still finds a place among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms for its niche value. Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Affiliate Platform Crypto affiliates in 2025 want steady income, not just big names. Some sites focus more on brand than real tools. Spartans stands out by offering fast payouts, simple terms, and easy-to-read dashboards. Stake.com and Roobet give reach, but their systems can feel slower or harder to follow. If you want to grow affiliate income with less stress, Spartans offers what’s needed. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms , it brings speed, support, and clarity to the front.

With growing adoption of RippleNet and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), combined with increasing anticipation around upcoming U.S. regulatory updates, XRP recently broke through the $3.00 mark, showing its strongest performance in over a year. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is also benefiting from broader institutional interest, as spot ETFs and corporate treasury moves help drive demand. Both XRP and ETH are showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. But while XRP and ETH are drawing in the big money, retail investors and early adopters are shifting their focus to a rising star with even more upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new altcoin gaining major traction in early August 2025. XRP Surges as SEC Decision Looms XRP is currently trading between $3.00 and $3.05, after a sharp surge in early August. In just one minute, XRP recorded a massive $33 million trading volume spike, breaking past the psychological $3 barrier. Multiple factors are fueling this rally. The U.S. SEC is expected to submit a key status update by August 15, which could provide long-awaited regulatory clarity. This legal development is widely seen as a potential game-changer that could propel XRP to the next price tier. Analysts are watching a bullish falling wedge pattern, which historically signals an impending breakout. Price targets for August range from $3.12 to $4.00, with medium-term forecasts stretching as high as $5.53 if the bullish scenario plays out. Ethereum Maintains Strength as Institutions Shift Focus ETH has seen a 49% surge in trading volume over the past 24 hours, reflecting a spike in institutional and corporate interest. Recent developments show that major firms are buying ETH for their treasuries, including SharpLink and others now holding more than $5 billion in Ethereum. This marks a strategic shift, as companies look beyond Bitcoin for long-term blockchain exposure. As the network celebrates its 10th anniversary, mainstream analysts are recognizing Ethereum’s evolution from an experimental blockchain to a core part of global financial technology. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with projections of continued growth if historical August trends hold. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital Ripple’s aggressive push into the global banking sector has reignited interest in XRP, especially as institutional adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves. But while XRP may see solid gains, many early investors are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. This emerging altcoin is gaining momentum fast thanks to its innovative DeFi features, strong community backing, and deflationary tokenomics. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 32x returns in the next bull cycle, especially for those getting in early during the presale phase. It’s quickly becoming a top pick for high-growth altcoin investors. Final Thoughts: A Market on the Move Ripple’s growing presence in global finance and the upcoming SEC report are pushing XRP toward its most bullish setup in years. Ethereum is holding strong with institutional support and ETF inflows. And while the top coins continue to lead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building momentum in the background—possibly setting the stage for the next breakout success story. With hype building and early momentum on its side, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly being seen as one of the most explosive altcoin opportunities of the year.

He mentioned that the U.S. was preparing federal financing tools to support AI tech exports to approved countries. “The next trailblazing breakthrough will be made with and on American technology, and to fully harness them, you will want America’s AI infrastructure already in place.” – Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. China has always rallied against alleged U.S. surveillance and the administration’s efforts to limit its tech industry. The country’s cyberspace administration summoned Nvidia representatives last week to discuss U.S. efforts towards incorporating location-tracking to its H20 chips. Beijing is also worried about semiconductor sanctions designed to counter the country’s AI companies, such as Huawei Technologies and DeepSeek . The Trump administration plans to remove export restrictions on Nvidia’s chips to China as part of a trade agreement to secure sales of rare-earth minerals to the U.S. Nvidia mentioned on Tuesday that it distances itself from any backdoors or kill switches in its chips, noting that they undermine trust in U.S. technology. The company argued that using backdoors, kill switches, or spyware doesn’t mirror the company’s systems, which are built on trust. Kratsios also championed China’s AI action plan, saying that each country should set its own standards for regulating artificial intelligence. The country’s AI action plan includes forming a global organization to devise governance and technology standards. The White House official also believes the U.S. model will be the most attractive since it puts innovation first. U.S. charges Chinese nationals in Nvidia chip smuggling The FBI arrested two Chinese nationals on Saturday on charges alleging they knowingly exported to China tens of millions of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence ( #AI ) applications, in violation of the Export Control Reform Act. Details: https://t.co/Z05cXhQsg4 pic.twitter.com/Y1yC5aJQwm — FBI Los Angeles (@FBILosAngeles) August 5, 2025 The White House also acknowledged that it’s still working to mitigate the smuggling of chips to China. Kratsios said he’s not yet confirmed from either Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices about the exploration of location-tracking capabilities. The U.S. has also charged two Chinese nationals with smuggling millions of dollars’ worth of advanced Nvidia chips to Beijing. The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang illegally exported Nvidia GPUs to China from October 2022 to July 2025. The DOJ referred to export records, which showed that the duo orchestrated around 21 shipments to companies in Malaysia and Singapore through their California-based company, ALX Solutions. According to the report, the 28-year-olds allegedly exported a shipment of Nvidia H100 chips in December 2024 without the necessary licence from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Prosecutors also found that ALX Solutions received payments from companies in Hong Kong and China. Records showed that the firm received roughly $1 million from a China-based company in January 2024, instead of the company taking delivery. The DOJ also found incriminating evidence last week from ALX Solution’s office and Geng and Yang’s phones, including communications about chip shipments to China through Malaysia. The duo could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if convicted under the Export Control Reform Act.

Despite a minor dip of 0.43%, big money continues flowing in. Galaxy Digital just reported a Q2 profit of $30.7 million, bouncing back from a $295 million Q1 loss. The turnaround was driven by a strategic boost in BTC holdings, now totaling 17,102 BTC (worth roughly $1.95B), up from 13,704.

Trading activity might’ve slowed, but Galaxy’s Global Markets arm still clocked a 28% profit rise. Meanwhile, its Helios data center ramped up capacity, showing bullish infrastructure investment. Most importantly, Galaxy actively accumulated 4,272 BTC in Q2 alone. That kind of accumulation squeezes supply, and that could be a strong long-term tailwind for Bitcoin prices. Cango Mines 650 BTC in July, Up 44% MoM Cango, a Chinese firm formerly in auto loans, is now a full-blown Bitcoin miner—and growing fast. In July, it mined 650.5 BTC, a jump from 450 in June, powered by a $256 million Bitmain rig investment. With a hashrate of 32 EH/s, it’s now one of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin holders globally, sitting on 4,529.7 BTC ($512M).

Since April, Cango has mined over 1,600 BTC, showing both momentum and commitment. Their move reinforces institutional trust and strengthens BTC’s long-term supply absorption, especially noteworthy for a company based in a country known for strict crypto crackdowns. Trump’s Crypto Order Adds Political Tailwind Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order protecting crypto companies and conservative groups from “debanking.” The move targets Operation Chokepoint 2.0—allegedly used to cut off banking access to crypto firms. BREAKING: Trump is getting ready to sign an executive order that will fine banks for debanking crypto companies. No more ""operation chokepoint"" in the US! pic.twitter.com/Yp19BhAmph — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 5, 2025 The order pushes federal agencies to investigate potential violations and calls for reviews of regulations that might’ve enabled discrimination. While legal experts debate its enforceability, the broader message is clear: more political support for crypto access. If successful, this could improve funding and liquidity for the crypto space, opening doors for increased investor confidence, and potentially pushing Bitcoin higher in the long run. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Struggles Below $115K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin remains trapped below the descending trendline and the 50-EMA at $115,440—both acting as dynamic resistance. The recent rejection near $115,400, with small-bodied candles and spinning tops, signals indecision. RSI hovers at 46—bearish bias remains intact. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Unless bulls reclaim the $115,440 zone, BTC risks slipping toward key support levels: Immediate support : $112,178 Next support : $110,663 Deeper support : $109,060 On the upside, breaking above $115,440 could open targets at $116,912 and $118,878. Trade Setup: Entry: $113,800 Stop-loss: $115,600 Target 1: $112,180 Target 2: $110,660 This short setup favors bears unless BTC breaks above the 50-EMA and trendline.

Today, we are diving deep into the BTC perpetual futures market, specifically examining the crucial 24-hour long-short ratios . These ratios offer a powerful lens through which to view current crypto market sentiment , helping traders and investors make more informed decisions. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? When we talk about long-short ratios in BTC perpetual futures , we are referring to the proportion of long positions (bets that the price will rise) versus short positions (bets that the price will fall) on a given exchange over a specific period. This data is derived from open interest and trading volumes, providing a real-time snapshot of trader sentiment. For instance, if the long ratio is higher, it suggests a bullish bias among traders, expecting Bitcoin’s price to increase. Conversely, a higher short ratio indicates a bearish outlook. Monitoring these ratios is a key component of effective Bitcoin futures trading strategy. Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour Data: A Snapshot of Crypto Market Sentiment Let’s examine the recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across major exchanges: Total Market: Long 48.11%, Short 51.89% This overall figure suggests a slight bearish tilt in the market over the past day, with more traders positioned for a downside move in Bitcoin’s price. It indicates a cautious, perhaps even pessimistic, crypto market sentiment . How Do Top Exchanges Compare in Derivatives Data Analysis? Looking at individual exchanges provides a more granular view: Binance: Long 47.86%, Short 52.14% Bybit: Long 48.28%, Short 51.72% Gate.io: Long 48.05%, Short 51.95% Interestingly, all three top exchanges reflect a similar trend, with short positions slightly outweighing long positions. Binance shows the strongest short bias among the three, while Bybit is marginally less bearish. This consistency across major platforms strengthens the indication of prevailing bearish sentiment. Understanding these subtle differences through careful derivatives data analysis can offer insights into the trading behavior dominant on each platform. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Trading Strategy So, what can you do with this information? While long-short ratios are not a standalone trading signal, they are a vital piece of the puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Market Direction: A sustained trend in long-short ratios can signal a potential shift in market direction. If shorts continue to dominate, it might suggest further downward pressure. Identify Potential Reversals: Sometimes, an extreme imbalance can precede a reversal. If everyone is short, who is left to sell? This could lead to a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly rise. Confirm Your Bias: Use these ratios to confirm or challenge your own trading bias. If you are bullish but the market’s collective short bias is strong, it might be wise to re-evaluate your position or manage risk more tightly. Incorporating this derivatives data analysis into your overall strategy can significantly enhance your understanding of the market’s pulse. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting Long-Short Ratios While invaluable, interpreting long-short ratios requires caution. They are not foolproof. For example, a high short ratio could mean that many traders are hedging their spot positions, rather than purely speculating on a price drop. Also, liquidity and volume on specific exchanges can influence their individual ratios. Therefore, it is crucial to combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a holistic view of the crypto market sentiment and future price movements. In conclusion, the latest 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios reveal a prevailing cautious, slightly bearish sentiment across major exchanges. By understanding these dynamics and integrating them into your broader analysis, you can sharpen your Bitcoin futures trading decisions and navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. How are long-short ratios calculated? Long-short ratios are typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or by expressing each as a percentage of the total open interest) on a given exchange over a specified period. Why is it important to monitor crypto market sentiment? Monitoring crypto market sentiment, often reflected in long-short ratios, helps traders gauge the collective mood of the market. This insight can indicate potential price trends, identify overbought or oversold conditions, and inform trading strategies. Can long-short ratios predict price movements accurately? No, long-short ratios alone cannot accurately predict price movements. They are an indicator of current sentiment and positioning. Traders should combine this data with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive market outlook. Are these ratios the same across all exchanges? While general trends might be similar, the exact long-short ratios can vary between exchanges due to differences in trader demographics, liquidity, fee structures, and trading volumes on each platform.

The Tom Lee-chaired firm holds 833,100 ETH worth almost $3 billion, according to EthStrategicReserve. Speaking on the Natalie Brunell podcast on Tuesday, Lee said there was no conflict between Bitcoin treasuries and Ethereum treasuries because they were both scarce (comparing them to Tesla and Palantir stocks). The first “killer app” for crypto has emerged and is seeing widespread adoption, and that is stablecoins, he said. Wall Street is running to tokenize its entire system on the blockchain, and it requires smart contracts, he said before adding: “The biggest and most secure blockchain with no downtime is Ethereum, and it’s legally compliant.” The top three Ethereum treasury firms now hold 1.7 billion ETH, which equates to around 1.4% of the total supply.

Key Takeaways: Indonesian officials are exploring Bitcoin as a potential national reserve asset. Discussions included using local renewable energy for Bitcoin mining to boost economic growth. Bitcoin education was highlighted as a priority for long-term adoption and financial literacy. In an X post shared Monday , the group said it was invited to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country’s long-term financial stability. Among the key proposals discussed was leveraging Bitcoin mining as a tool for building national reserves—a concept rarely entertained at the government level. Indonesia Seriously Weighs Bitcoin to Strengthen Economy “Yes, seriously,” the group emphasized, noting that Indonesia is considering how Bitcoin might strengthen its economy over time. The discussion also touched on expanding mining infrastructure and launching education programs focused on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. With a population exceeding 280 million and a GDP of roughly $1.4 trillion, Indonesia ranks as the fourth most populous nation and the 16th largest economy in the world. Bitcoin Indonesia argued the country could tap into its rich geothermal and hydroelectric resources to power Bitcoin mining operations, pointing to other nations that have successfully turned similar strategies into job creators. The meeting was held with special staff from the office of Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka, and included bullish projections from figures like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. His forecast of Bitcoin potentially reaching $13 million to $49 million by 2045 was part of the pitch to showcase Bitcoin’s long-term value. Bitcoin Indonesia also pushed for education-focused initiatives to build broader public understanding of the asset. BIG NEWS: Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve.

What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 One official from the Vice President’s office appeared to echo the importance of financial literacy, reportedly stating that “Indonesia must also continue to educate about Bitcoin in the future.” While the idea of adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset is gaining momentum globally amid fears of inflation and rising debt, Indonesia’s macroeconomic picture may not necessitate such urgency. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at a manageable 39%, and annual inflation as of January 2025 is well contained at 0.76%. MEXC Backs Indonesia’s Crypto Exchange Triv As reported, MEXC Ventures has taken a strategic bet on Indonesia’s growing crypto market, investing in crypto exchange Triv at a $200 million valuation. The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia’s updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. In Indonesia, crypto is permitted for investment but not for payments. The market is growing rapidly. Crypto transactions in 2023 topped 650 trillion rupiah (around $40 billion), and user numbers across licensed platforms have surpassed 20 million, outpacing the country’s stock market participation. Indonesia’s annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023.

This was spurred by profit-taking as the digital asset had risen to levels not seen before back in July 2025. However, this recovery does not mean that Bitcoin is completely out of the water, especially given the fact that it has retraced to a level that would be considered bearish at this point. Bearish FVG Could Send Bitcoin Price Crashing In an analysis, crypto analyst Kamran Asghar revealed that the Bitcoin retrace could only be temporary and short-lived as it has moved back into a bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG). This comes after a small bounce from $112,000 toward $115,000, with this bearish FVG lying between $114,000 and $115,500. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest This fair value gap had been created following the price crash from $118,000, suggesting that the Bitcoin price would be looking to fill it again. Additionally, this level acts as a major supply zone, meaning that bulls would have to turn up the buying if the Bitcoin price is to cross this level without issue. Given the fact that the bearish FVG and the supply zone are riding ahead of the cryptocurrency, it shows that there is a lot of resistance building at this level. Kamran suggests that the next move after hitting this supply zone would be a rejection from this level, leading to a further beating down of the price. How Low Could BTC Go? In the event of a hard rejection, the crypto analyst sees the Bitcoin price tumbling further downward into mid-July levels between $107,500 and $109,000. This would mean another 5% crash for the Bitcoin price before it is able to find support. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The silver lining of this possible crash is the fact that Bitcoin has major support at this level. Thus, Bitcoin bulls could stage a rebound using this level as the next lift-off point for a recovery. Due to this, the crypto analyst warns investors to keep an eye on the digital asset to see how it reacts at this level. Interestingly, at this time, the Bitcoin funding rate is still positive, Coinglass shows. What this means is that traders believe that the digital asset is still in a bull market, and more investors are betting on the price continuing to rise from here. However, the positive funding rate has seen some decline in the month of August, suggesting a slowdown among bulls.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says conditions are now ripe for the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised down the job growth figures for June from 147,000 to 14,000. “I think the data is just catching up to what we already know. The labor market has been soft, so I think it’s a positive setup because now the Fed has more ammunition to make a dovish pivot in the fall, and it’s not too late because we know the thing that they’re going to stimulate is the housing market… So that is what strengthens the economy in 2026. So I think it’s quite a positive setup, we’re just consolidating, and then we make a bigger move higher.” According to Lee, the Fed now needs to shift its focus from inflation to unemployment amid the softness in the labor market. He also notes that if the Fed removes housing market data from its calculations, inflation would be below 2%. “I think when they look at their dual mandate, they’re probably drifting further from the employment metric now because the unemployment rate, if you use the existing participation rate before the [recent] report, it’s almost 5% now. So the Fed now has to be considering the risk of the jobs market going into a cycle of weakening.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The surge in onchain activity pushed stablecoin transactions to $1.5T , which marked a new all-time high for the sector. The total transaction volume went up 19% compared to the previous month. The new legislation provides greater clarity on stablecoins and other digital assets, thus easing institutional and retail fears about the sector and boosting adoption. We can also expect some of the new retail attention to expand to other altcoins on Ethereum. Read on for the full context and the best crypto to buy amid the stablecoin and altcoin boom. Stablecoin Volume Hits New ATH at $1.5T Sentora Research revealed in its latest report that the transaction volume of stablecoins broke the $1.5T mark in July. This surpasses the previous ATH of $1.4T set in August last year, and marks a considerable rebound from the $1.26T recorded in June, 2025. Circle’s $USDC stablecoin led the market in July with over $748B, which accounts for nearly 50% of the total volume during the period. Meanwhile, Tether’s $USDT came in second with $420B, or 28% of the volume. The surge in stablecoin activity can be attributed to the signing of the GENIUS Act into law on July 18. This provided the regulatory framework for stablecoins, which boosted their stability and trust among consumers. But it isn’t just the stablecoin sector that will benefit from added clarity on digital assets. This impacts the crypto market at large as investor confidence grows and crypto onboards more users. As capital rotations could shift from stablecoins to assets with an upside, other top trending cryptocurrencies and even emerging altcoins could get more attention from retail investors. In fact, some emerging altcoins are already booming in pre-market, having raised millions from early adopters. Here are some of the freshest examples. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Trading Bot Project Helping You Flip Crypto the Easy Way Snorter Token ($SNORT) is currently beta-testing a Telegram trading bot that helps users sniff, snipe, and lock in profits with automated commands. Think about it: the crypto market is vast and confusing. Finding new opportunities is notoriously difficult. You also need to do ample research just to avoid getting scammed by the hundreds of rigged tokens coming out every day. The user-friendly Snorter Bot, which will be compatible with the Ethereum, Solana, and Base networks, could take care of it all. It automatically detects and grabs the top new performers, helping you get ahead of other bots and whales. For peace of mind, Snorter Bot also detects and blocks scams like honeypots and rug-pulls. When the project goes live, its native $SNORT token will ensure exclusive holder access and voting rights within the ecosystem. $SNORT is currently on presale for only $0.1003. It also offers dynamic staking rewards, currently at 155% APY, for those who want to multiply their tokens passively. The Snorter fundraiser has already stacked an impressive $2.8M from early buyers, and the price is going to go up again today. If the trading bot sees the expected traction upon release, the $SNORT token could reach $0.94 in late 2025. Visit the official Snorter Token website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility Token Behind the Most User-Friendly Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of an emerging digital crypto wallet. Currently on presale, the token is a fundraising project for the development of Best Wallet . Whether you want to hold Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins, or meme coins, you need a secure place to store them. This is where Best Wallet comes in. It’s a crypto wallet for your iOS and Android device that makes it convenient to store, sell, swap, and trade cryptocurrencies, even as a complete beginner. It also comes with a ‘Token Launchpad,’ where you can find other crypto presales before they hit exchanges. When out and tradable, the $BEST token will give holders exclusive benefits within the wallet ecosystem: Reduced transaction fees, Voting rights on key project decisions, Staking benefits in the upcoming staking aggregator. Priced at $0.025445 and already sitting on $14.5M raised on presale, the $BEST token is one of the early opportunities with a functional project already live. To learn more about $BEST’s growth potential, we suggest reading our Best Wallet Token price prediction . Or visit the Best Wallet Token presale page for more details. 3. Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) – Viral Meme Coin with the Fastest-Growing Flash Presale Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) brings something different. It’s not a flashy tech project like $SNORT or $BEST – just a purely meme-based project, inspired by the famous Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. Its main goal is community building, with a target of 10M holders and over $10B in fully diluted market volume by Q4, 2025. Right now, the $BPENGU token is undergoing a flash presale , having already raised over $2M in just 8 days. The ICO runs from July 28 to August 27, with the first listing scheduled 72 hours after the presale ends. There are also 15 price milestones, with the token’s price increasing by 5% on each stage. $BPENGU is currently priced at $0.00128. Taking a page from Pudgy Penguin’s success, Bitcoin Penguins also has a roadmap that includes toy manufacturer partnerships. This is planned in Q4 2025, after $BPENGU hopefully reaches its price target of $2 and announces its BTC/BPENGU trading pair. The Age of Stablecoins is Here With the stablecoin market volume hitting a new ATH in July, it’s safe to say that things will only go up from here. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, investors and consumers now have more confidence to hold and trade stablecoins. This can also have a positive impact on the altcoin market as a whole, including some of the emerging utility projects on Ethereum, such as Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) .

While the community is excited for what might be the end of the lawsuit, some are spreading misinformation about the current state of the lawsuit and its potential end. Bill Morgan, a well-known community member and attorney closely following the proceedings, has corrected these false assertions, explaining Judge Torres’ current role, the next move the SEC needs to make, and what the XRP army should expect. Morgan Says Judge Torres’ Role Has Ended A recent thread on X suggested that Judge Analisa Torres still has a pending role in resolving the case and that a decision from the court is imminent. Morgan explained that contrary to these claims, Judge Torres has already completed her responsibilities in the matter. However, the appeal itself remains formally unresolved because neither party has yet finalized the necessary joint dismissal. Morgan clarified that both parties had earlier signed a conditional agreement to dismiss their respective appeals. Still, the conditions were not met, as Judge Torres rejected their joint motion for an indicative ruling that would have put that settlement agreement into effect. The contains inaccuracies.

We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 August 15 Is Not a Final Deadline The upcoming August 15 date has been widely referenced as a potential turning point in the case. While it is true that both parties are expected to file a status update with the appellate court by that date, Morgan emphasized that this is not a legal deadline for resolving the appeals themselves. Rather, it is a reporting obligation to inform the court about the current status of the appeals. “Dismissal of the appeals may happen, and is more likely to happen than not, before the 15 August deadline,” Morgan noted. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has also stated that the SEC will likely file its dismissal before that date , but emphasized that it is not a deadline. Morgan also left open the possibility that the parties might request another extension. While Morgan sees an additional extension as unlikely, he acknowledged that the litigation has already defied expectations multiple times. He concluded that nothing should be assumed with certainty until formal steps are taken. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The voting architecture is three-phased: an open nomination round that advances the top ten to a live or recorded debate stage; a follow-up ballot a week later to determine the final three; and a concluding vote one week after debates. “The final vote will be final,” the post states. Candidates must create public profiles, and while anyone can self-nominate, the foundation reserves a veto right; the winner must complete KYC with the foundation and sign an NDA “as you would expect in any state.” Kusama proposes a token-weighted mechanism across the ecosystem, writing that “1 token = 1 vote” for “any and all of the ecosystem tokens,” a design explicitly intended to align outcomes with holders who “have the most skin” in the project’s success. While emphasizing openness, the document asks the community to “rigorously vet, check and learn about all candidates.” The role described for the interim president is sweeping. The office holder would coordinate the transfer of power, steward the “Shib Paper” vision, and stand up the first congress—“consisting of the four Dao councils,” the inter-branch DAO envisaged in prior materials. The post underscores the stakes by putting a number on what’s being overseen, citing responsibility to a community of millions and “the financial responsibility of a 7 billion dollar token.” Governance plumbing also gets a notable tweak. The document proposes shifting the Economic Council under the Shib DAO rather than Treat, freeing Treat “to focus on innovation.” The council would shape how Shib “makes and retains revenue or a treasury system (outside the other daos),” described as “vitally important to the long term success of the project.” In parallel with the procedural outline, Dhairya’s message sought to keep the Shiba Inu community unified around the broader ecosystem rather than splintering initiatives, inviting exploration of new ideas under the Shib umbrella. “Elections are the first step,” he wrote, urging contributors to “think differently and collaboratively.” The team says logistical specifics—dates and precise timings for nominations, debates and balloting—will follow, and stresses that its own role shifts with this handover. “Upon the release of this document, our role will shift,” the post notes, adding that the group will continue building alongside Treat DAO and external initiatives aligned with its vision.

49625931,https://cryptonews.com/?p=404408,1754465823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49625931.jpeg,"Base Network Releases 33-Minute Outage Report, Said Caused by Sequencer Handover Failure",https://cryptonews.com/news/base-network-releases-33-minute-outage-report-said-caused-by-sequencer-handover-failure/,"Base network released a detailed postmortem revealing that its August 5 outage lasted 33 minutes, not the initially reported 19 minutes, caused by a failed sequencer handover in the network’s high-availability cluster. The Coinbase-backed Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain experienced a block production halt from 6:07 UTC to 6:40 UTC when an automated system called Conductor failed to transfer control between sequencer instances properly. Automated Failover System Backfires During High Activity Period The incident began when the active sequencer fell behind due to on-chain activity, triggering Conductor’s automated handoff to a backup sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and couldn’t produce blocks, while Conductor wasn’t fully enabled on the replacement system to initiate another handoff. Base’s monitoring systems detected the issue at 6:09 UTC, leading to a formal incident declaration by 6:12 UTC. @base network suffers 19-minute block production halt before recovery as token creation surge overtakes Solana with 54,000 daily launches testing infrastructure limits. #Base #Solana https://t.co/e3CJPMQE1m — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The team manually paused Conductor and transferred leadership to a healthy sequencer, taking several minutes to ensure no blockchain reorganization occurred during the recovery process. The outage impacted deposits, withdrawals, block production, and Flashblocks functionality during Base’s unprecedented growth period. The network recently overtook Solana in daily token launches, reaching 54,000 new tokens on July 27, driven by creator coin integration through Zora and Farcaster platforms. Simple Breakdown: When the Traffic Controller Failed Think of Base network like a busy highway system where sequencers are traffic controllers managing the flow of transactions. Source: Mirror To prevent problems, Base operates multiple traffic controllers in a backup system managed by a supervisor called Conductor. When the main traffic controller started falling behind due to heavy traffic, Conductor automatically tried to switch to a backup controller. However, the backup controller wasn’t ready for duty yet and couldn’t manage traffic properly. Typically, if a backup controller can’t handle the job, Conductor would quickly switch to another one. But in this case, Conductor itself wasn’t properly installed on the backup system, so it couldn’t make another switch automatically. This left Base’s highway without a functioning traffic controller for 33 minutes, preventing all transactions from processing. The technical team had to manually step in, pause the automatic system, and carefully switch control to a working traffic controller. The manual process took extra time because engineers needed to ensure switching controllers wouldn’t cause any transactions to be lost or duplicated. Once they confirmed everything was safe, they successfully restored normal operations. Infrastructure Challenges Plague Growing Blockchain Networks Base’s outage joins a pattern of infrastructure failures across major blockchain networks as they scale to accommodate mainstream adoption. Recent incidents included Sui’s hour-long crash , TON’s six-hour disruption during DOGS token demand, and Solana’s repeated five-hour outages throughout 2024. It can be said that the traffic controller failed due to a large volume of traffic, coinciding with Base’s explosive growth in creator economy applications, where social posts automatically generate tradable tokens. Daily token launches surged from 6,649 on July 1 to approximately 50,000 by month-end, with 1.6 million tokens created and nearly 3 million traders participating. Source: Dune Analytics Base’s institutional adoption has also accelerated with JPMorgan’s JPMD digital deposit token launch and Shopify’s USDC payment integration across 34 countries. In fact, with the network’s Flashblocks upgrade, block times have been reduced from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds, processing international transactions under $0.01. This has allowed Base’s creator economy to generate substantial trading volume through automatic token minting from social content. The network has expanded from 6,649 daily token launches to 50,000 within a month. The ZORA token, for instance, achieved $200 million market cap while notable creator coins reached valuations exceeding $485 million. However, security challenges accompanied this rapid growth, including the $2.5 million Arcadia Finance hack on July 15 through smart contract vulnerabilities. As a result, Coinbase responded with a $5 million bug bounty program targeting Base network components. Looking forward, Base has renounced its dedication to infrastructure improvements, ensuring sequencers can consistently perform well even during peak hours. The network will release updates to enhance testing and deploy fixes to strengthen automated system robustness and prevent similar handover failures.

A recent development from India serves as a stark reminder of this reality: Indian authorities have taken decisive action against a major fraudulent operation. They successfully executed a substantial asset freeze , targeting an individual behind a sophisticated Coinbase scam that defrauded countless users of their valuable crypto assets . This move underscores the growing vigilance of global regulators in combating digital financial crimes. What Led to This Crucial Asset Freeze by Indian Authorities? India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently announced a significant breakthrough. In an official press release, the ED confirmed the freezing of approximately $4.8 million in assets. These assets belonged to Chirag Tomar, identified as the mastermind behind a deceptive fake Coinbase website, along with his family members and associated entities. The ED conducted seizures of multiple properties and bank accounts located in Delhi. These actions were carried out under the provisions of the country’s Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA). This legislation empowers authorities to target ill-gotten gains from criminal activities, including those involving digital currencies. This aggressive enforcement highlights the determination of Indian authorities to tackle financial fraud head-on, especially when it involves the complex world of cryptocurrency. Unmasking the Massive Fake Coinbase Scam Chirag Tomar’s operation was not a small-scale endeavor. Reports indicate that he managed to steal an astonishing estimated $20 million in crypto assets over a period spanning from mid-2021 to late 2023. His method was deceptively simple yet highly effective: creating a fraudulent website that mimicked the legitimate Coinbase platform. Scammers often use such tactics, known as phishing, to trick users into divulging their login credentials or directly transferring funds. Victims, believing they were interacting with a trusted exchange, unknowingly handed over their digital wealth. This specific Coinbase scam demonstrates the pervasive nature of online fraud and the constant need for user vigilance. How Does the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) Combat Crypto Crimes? The Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) is a powerful legal tool in India, designed to prevent and control money laundering . In this case, it allowed the ED to trace and freeze assets acquired through the illegal proceeds of the Coinbase scam . The act enables authorities to: Investigate suspected cases of money laundering. Attach or freeze properties derived from criminal activity. Prosecute individuals involved in such illicit financial flows. The successful asset freeze against Tomar and his associates sends a strong message: illicit gains, even those in cryptocurrency, are not beyond the reach of the law. This case serves as a crucial example of how traditional financial laws are being adapted to address the challenges posed by digital currencies and their potential misuse for money laundering . Safeguarding Your Crypto Assets: Lessons from This Case This incident offers vital lessons for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. Protecting your crypto assets requires proactive steps and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Website Authenticity: Always double-check the URL of any cryptocurrency exchange or wallet you use. Scammers often use slight misspellings or different domain extensions. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts even if they have your password. Be Wary of Unsolicited Communications: Legitimate exchanges rarely ask for personal information or private keys via email or text messages. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics, phishing attempts, and social engineering tricks used by fraudsters. The vigilance of Indian authorities is commendable, but individual responsibility remains paramount in the decentralized world of crypto. A Resounding Message Against Crypto Fraud The freezing of $4.8 million in assets by Indian authorities linked to the fake Coinbase scam is a significant victory in the ongoing fight against cryptocurrency fraud. It demonstrates the increasing capability of law enforcement to track and recover illicitly obtained crypto assets , even across complex digital trails. This action not only brings justice closer for the victims of the scam but also serves as a powerful deterrent to other potential fraudsters engaged in money laundering schemes. As the crypto landscape evolves, so too do the methods of protection and enforcement, ensuring a safer environment for legitimate participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the “fake Coinbase scam” mentioned in the article? The fake Coinbase scam involved Chirag Tomar creating a fraudulent website designed to look exactly like the legitimate Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. This tricked users into entering their credentials or sending their crypto assets directly to the scammer. Who is Chirag Tomar, and what was his role? Chirag Tomar is the individual identified by India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) as the mastermind behind the fake Coinbase website. He is accused of stealing approximately $20 million in crypto assets through this elaborate scheme. What is the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA)? The PMLA is an Indian law that empowers authorities like the Enforcement Directorate to investigate, attach, and freeze properties derived from criminal activities, including those involving money laundering and financial fraud like the crypto assets stolen in this case. How much in assets did Indian authorities freeze? Indian authorities, specifically the Enforcement Directorate, froze approximately $4.8 million in assets belonging to Chirag Tomar, his family members, and associated entities as part of their investigation into the fake Coinbase scam. How can I protect my crypto assets from similar scams? To protect your crypto assets, always verify website URLs, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts, be suspicious of unsolicited communications asking for personal details, and continuously educate yourself on common scam tactics. Does this action by Indian authorities mean all stolen crypto assets will be recovered? While the freezing of $4.8 million is a significant step, it represents a portion of the estimated $20 million stolen. Recovery of all stolen crypto assets can be complex and depends on various factors, including the traceability of funds and the legal process. Did you find this article informative?

Pump.fun burns PUMP tokens to boost price Pump.fun has not sent out SOL to exchanges in a few weeks, instead accumulating the fees for a buyback and reward program. To date, Pump.fun has repurchased PUMP for 139,759 SOL, valued at over $23M. In the past few weeks, this helped PUMP inch up from its lows of $0.002 to $0.0034, following a boost from Bybit trading activity. For now, PUMP is still being sold by whales, as it retains a long list of early backers. Some early buyers are even selling at a loss to recoup some liquidity. Pump.fun aims to rebuild its reputation as the leading platform, as it recently recovered its top spot in terms of new tokens created. In the past 24 hours, Pump.fun deployed 15,031 tokens, while LetsBonk.fun stalled at 12,236 tokens. Other contenders are launching a few hundred tokens, with Bags Tokens achieving 2,569 token launches. Get seen where it counts.

Representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia recently met with officials from the Vice President’s office to present a proposal outlining how Bitcoin could contribute to long-term economic growth. In a statement shared on X, Bitcoin Indonesia revealed that their presentation focused on leveraging Bitcoin mining as part of a national reserve strategy. “Yes, seriously. [The country] is looking into how Bitcoin could fuel long-term economic strength,” the group emphasized. Their pitch included potential uses of the country’s rich hydroelectric and geothermal resources to power Bitcoin mining, with the aim of driving job creation and technological advancement. Indonesia, home to over 280 million people and the world’s 16th largest economy, is uniquely positioned to explore such innovations. While the country has maintained a conservative stance on cryptocurrency payments, its openness to reserve diversification suggests a complex but evolving policy landscape. Bitcoin’s Role in Mining and Education During the presentation, Bitcoin Indonesia also discussed the broader implications of embracing Bitcoin, including education and public awareness. A notable highlight was the inclusion of a long-term price prediction by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who forecasts Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045 in a base scenario — and potentially as high as $49 million under bullish conditions. Bitcoin Indonesia emphasized the need for education initiatives to ensure widespread understanding and adoption, a point reportedly supported by Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s office. Though the country’s macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio of 39% and stable inflation of 0.76% (as of January 2025), don’t present the same urgency as in other nations adopting Bitcoin for economic hedging, the proposal reflects growing interest in future-proofing economic reserves. Crypto Taxes Raised in Indonesia In contrast to the pro-Bitcoin reserve strategy, Indonesia’s Finance Ministry recently imposed higher taxes on cryptocurrency activities. Income tax on crypto sales more than doubled — from 0.1% to 0.21% for local exchanges, and from 0.2% to 1% for foreign platforms. Additionally, value-added tax on mining has also risen sharply from 1.1% to 2.2%. While the country has banned crypto payments since 2017, enforcement remains loose. In tourist-heavy areas like Bali, several businesses continue to accept Bitcoin, especially in real estate transactions.

Others include: The United States had around 200,000 Bitcoins in March 2025 Kazakhstan is currently looking to invest in Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain companies Bhutan still held on to $1.4B Bitcoin in reserves as of July 2025 Crypto adoption at the highest levels of power, and globally speaking, means the industry is bigger than ever before. More institutional and retail investors are seeing the appeal. And they’re coming for Bitcoin and altcoins alike. Michaël van de Poppe said August is typically a period of accumulation and dip-buying . And that’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) come into play. An innovative Layer-2 for Bitcoin, the presale has already raised over $7.2M and whales are rushing to buy. Brazil, Indonesia Conduct Stakeholder Meetings on Bitcoin Bitcoin Indonesia, Asia’s largest Bitcoin community, revealed via a post on X yesterday that it met with Indonesia’s Vice-President to discuss the country’s potential Bitcoin strategy. During the meeting, community leaders proposed Bitcoin mining as a national reserve strategy. They shared Michael Saylor’s $BTC price prediction for 2045 ($17.6M by 2045), which will coincide with Indonesia’s 100th year of independence. According to Bitcoin Indonesia’s post, the Vice-President was bullish on the ideas they presented. Even during global volatility, Bitcoin can be a save haven of long-term financial stability, they argued. Let’s also not forget that many US investors and institutions are starting to use Bitcoin as a hedge against the impending inflation in the country. While this is still early stage planning from Indonesia, we’re seeing this trend continue grow as more countries explore this strategy. That includes Brazil, which will meet with citizens on August 20 to discuss the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. It’s the first-ever crypto public hearing in the country after the introduction of a bill in November 2024. The bill called for the diversification of Brazil’s assets to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Several key figures will attend the meeting, including Diego Kolling, CEO of Bitcoin Strategy at Méliuz, and Rudens Sardenberg, Chief Economist at the Brazilian Federation of Banks. This shows crypto is receiving attention from the highest levels of authority in Brazil. And this can only increase hopes for crypto-positive legislation in Brazil in the near future. With so many countries gunning for Bitcoin and crypto, we foresee a bigger influx of investors looking for investment opportunities. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one project that might ride the hype wave due to its unique utility promises. Let’s discuss it below. Bitcoin Hyper: Delivering the Next Phase of the Bitcoin Ecosystem While there’s no toppling Bitcoin’s status as the number one cryptocurrency, the blockchain is currently plagued with issues that hinder its growth. These include slow transaction speeds (7 transactions per second), high fees, and limited scalability. These are understandable, though, since $BTC is the first of its kind, but it’s also true that a lot has changed in the crypto landscape since its launch in 2009. And modern times require modern solutions, as they way. The Bitcoin blockchain is arguably behind the times, especially given its lack of support for dApps and smart contracts. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. It’s a project aiming to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2 that will add Solana-level speeds, low transaction fees, and expanded capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these include support for GameFi, marketplaces, DAOs, and even NFT infrastructures (aside from dApps and smart contracts). The project has gained a lot of traction since its token presale began in May, and has already raised over $7.2M, making it one of the best presales of 2025. To support Bitcoin Hyper, you can buy its native $HYPER tokens via its official website . Each one only costs $0.01255, which makes this one of the best low cap coins in August. Alternatively, you can stake your tokens for 148% APY. When combined with our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction at $0.32 (+2,450%) for the end of 2025, the profit potential is quite high. For more information on how you can buy and/or stake your $HYPER tokens, be sure to read our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . National Bitcoin Reserve: Coming Soon To a Country Near You? With Brazil and Indonesia beginning to explore national Bitcoin reserves, it’s safe to say that this trend will spread like wildfire in the coming years. Thanks to the US government spearheading this initiative, there’s even more pressure for other countries to adapt or risk getting left behind. Bullish news about Bitcoin’s future is naturally beneficial to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and other related projects too. That’s because they’ll help pave the way for the world’s most valuable crypto to become more important than ever before. Remember to do your own research before you invest.

A significant Binance trading update has just hit the wires, directly impacting those involved in derivative markets. Major crypto exchange Binance has officially announced its decision to delist certain perpetual futures contracts, specifically targeting DEFI and MEMEFI tokens. This move is set to take effect on August 11 at 09:00 UTC, prompting traders to re-evaluate their positions. Understanding the Binance Delists Futures Decision Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, made a clear statement on its official website regarding the removal of the DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures contracts. For many traders, perpetual futures are a popular way to gain exposure to crypto assets without owning the underlying coin. They offer leverage and continuous trading without an expiry date, making them a staple in the derivatives market. The specific contracts being delisted are the DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures. This means that after the stated deadline of August 11, 09:00 UTC, users will no longer be able to trade these specific contracts on Binance’s futures platform. This is a direct action that requires immediate attention from anyone holding or planning to open positions in these particular assets. Why the DEFI Futures Delisting and MEMEFI Futures Binance Move? When an exchange like Binance makes such a move, it often signals underlying considerations. While Binance’s official announcement didn’t detail the exact reasons, delistings typically stem from several factors. These can include: Low Liquidity: If trading volume for specific contracts is consistently low, maintaining them can be inefficient for the exchange. Regulatory Compliance: Evolving regulations in various jurisdictions might necessitate changes to offerings. Market Performance: Prolonged poor performance or reduced interest in the underlying assets (DEFI and MEMEFI in this case) can lead to such decisions. Risk Management: Exchanges continually assess the risks associated with certain contracts, especially in volatile markets. Understanding these potential reasons helps traders contextualize the decision, even without an explicit statement from Binance. Navigating the Impact: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Perpetual Futures? This Binance delists futures announcement has immediate implications for traders. If you currently hold open positions in DEFI or MEMEFI perpetual futures on Binance, you need to act promptly. The primary concern is to manage your risk and avoid potential forced liquidation or unexpected closures by the exchange. Key actions for affected traders include: Closing Positions: It is highly advisable to close any open DEFI or MEMEFI perpetual futures positions before the August 11 deadline. Monitoring Announcements: Stay vigilant for any further announcements from Binance regarding the delisting process or alternative trading options. Re-evaluating Strategy: Consider how this change impacts your overall portfolio and trading strategy. Diversification or exploring other perpetual futures contracts might be prudent. Ignoring this update could lead to unfavorable outcomes for your trades. Proactive management is key. Actionable Steps Before the Deadline: A Binance Trading Update Checklist With the August 11 deadline fast approaching, taking decisive action is critical. Here’s a brief checklist to help you navigate this Binance trading update : Identify Affected Positions: Log into your Binance Futures account and identify all open DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures positions. Plan Your Exit: Decide whether to close your positions manually or set stop-loss/take-profit orders to manage your exit automatically. Withdraw Funds (if necessary): After closing positions, consider withdrawing any funds associated with these contracts if you do not wish to reallocate them within Binance. Stay Informed: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements for any last-minute updates or clarifications. Remember, the goal is to manage your risk effectively and ensure a smooth transition away from these specific contracts. The Broader Picture for Crypto Perpetual Futures While this news specifically targets DEFI and MEMEFI, it highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto perpetual futures market. Exchanges frequently review their offerings to ensure market health, compliance, and user safety. Such delistings, while impactful for specific token communities, are part of an exchange’s ongoing operational adjustments. This event serves as a reminder for all crypto traders to always be aware of the terms and conditions of the platforms they use and to keep a close eye on official announcements. The crypto market evolves rapidly, and staying informed is your best defense against unexpected changes.

The company was previously valued at $300B after securing $8.3B for a second tranche of the $40B fundraising round led by SoftBank Group Corp. The stock sale was oversubscribed by nearly five times. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter said the company was targeting billions of dollars from the stock sales. The secondary sale is expected to raise more than last year’s $1.5 billion. OpenAI’s recurring annual revenue has grown to $12 billion since it launched ChatGPT in 2022, and it forecasts an ARR of over $20 billion in 2025. ChatGPT is dropping GPT-5 in August. Existing investors like Thrive Capital reportedly approached the company seeking to buy some of the shares set aside for employees. Preliminary talks with Brookfield Asset Management, JPMorgan, and Apollo Global Management have already taken place. However, none of the discussions have progressed into solid commitments. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently confirmed that SoftBank has committed $30 billion and has already invested $7.5 billion. The rest is due by the year’s end. OpenAI mixes private equity strategies Sources familiar with OpenAI’s private capital funding, who requested anonymity, said the ChatGPT maker was mixing up its fundraising strategy, targeting new and old investors. Dragoneer Investment Group, a San Francisco tech-focused fund, pledged $2 billion in what is allegedly to be the largest cheque written for a startup by one company. Other investors include TPG, T Rowe Price, and Blackstone through the private equity strategies fund it runs for wealthy individuals. Other Venture Capital participating in the last round include Coatue Management, Thrive Capital, Founders Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Fidelity Management, and Altimeter Capital. However, none of these companies has made any official statements or comments regarding the funding round. One AI analyst clarified that the secondary sale meant money was going to staff, not the company’s treasury. The deal would allow employees to cash out as OpenAI geared up for the GPT-5 release. The analyst believes “turning options into liquid cash” for the employees will keep the company’s ChatGPT core architects focused. OpenAI announced earlier this week that ChatGPT was almost hitting 700 million active users every week. Funding edges OpenAI closer to an IPO The money coming in is reportedly bringing OpenAI closer to an IPO. Large financial support is a prerequisite for the company to go public. The company said the funds will be used to expand infrastructure through a partnership with Oracle. SoftBank’s 2.77% stake also reinforces the company’s valuation and position ahead of the IPO. OpenAI’s last funding round was reportedly completed way ahead of schedule. One analyst suggested this was a “stepping stone” towards an IPO. The company’s CEO said the funding round signified confidence in AI’s future. He also mentioned that his company’s ability to achieve such a high valuation would set new enterprise value benchmarks in the tech space. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s CFO, also said the company’s over $13 billion restructuring investment from Microsoft brought it closer to a potential IPO. However, she pointed out that the company would go public “if and when” it wanted to. Friar confirmed that the IPO was not yet cast in stone. The OpenAI CFO added that her company and the market would have to be ready for it to launch on the stock market. “You can show up at the altar all ready to go, and if the market’s not ready for you, yeah, you’re just out of luck.” – Sarah Friar , CFO at OpenAI Friar believes that any company planning to go public should build a sustainable business structure backed by enough funds. She said public companies needed “some sense of predictability,” ambition, and appetite. Friar added that the market could only put up with “a certain level of unpredictability.” Forge data showed that OpenAI had raised over $61.9 billion in 11 funding rounds.

Why XRP Could Face A Deeper Correction In an X thread posted early Wednesday, Martinez opened with: “XRP may be headed for a deeper correction. Here’s why!” and pointed to a Tom DeMark Sequential sell signal on the three-day chart “right at the local top,” which he said “trigger[ed] the ongoing pullback.” His remarks follow a weekend note flagging $2.40 as the “next key support level to watch” after that three-day TD sell signal. Martinez expanded on market structure, arguing that while the $3.00 area has intermittently acted as support, historical accumulation patterns make $2.80 a temporary buffer, with “real support” beginning below $2.48—a zone he has mapped using on-chain positioning. Related Reading: XRP Price May Be ‘Controlled’ By This Market, Says Analyst He reiterated on Aug. 3 that “past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48,” adding that the most consequential level on his dashboard remains $2.40. Independent coverage of his analysis echoed those thresholds, framing $2.80 as a light cushion with heavier demand pockets sub-$2.50. Flow data has added to the bearish case in the near term. Martinez said whales have offloaded over 720 million XRP, intensifying sell-side pressure in recent sessions; earlier, on Aug. 2, he specified that “whales have sold over 710 million $XRP in the past 24 hours!” That spike in large-holder distribution has been picked up by multiple market trackers and recaps over the past few days. He also flagged the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) signal turning sharply negative. “The MVRV ratio just flashed a death cross,” Martinez wrote, calling it “another sign that a steeper correction could be underway.” The post underscores the crossover as a warning of rising downside risk if short-term holders’ cost basis begins to overhang market value. While “death cross” language is more commonly associated with moving-average pairs, Martinez uses the term here to describe a momentum break in MVRV curves. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Flashes Death Cross: More Decline Ahead? The TD Sequential—a Tom DeMark-designed exhaustion model often used to anticipate trend reversals—has been central to Martinez’s view since late July, when he tracked a three-day “sell” print near the top of the latest rally leg. He has since framed the path of least resistance as lower unless the market can establish sustained closes back above the high-volume node near $3.00–$3.20, while on-chain profiles continue to privilege $2.48–$2.40 as the area of “real” demand. As he put it on Aug. 3: “The next key support level to watch is $2.40!” For now, Martinez’s roadmap rests on three pillars: an exhaustion sell on the 3-day TD Sequential, large-holder distribution in the hundreds of millions of XRP, and a bearish MVRV crossover, all of which he argues raise the probability of a deeper corrective leg toward the high-$2s and, if momentum deteriorates, the mid-$2s. Whether bulls can defend the shallower buffers near $2.80 may determine if XRP’s decline remains a garden-variety pullback or morphs into a larger reset toward his $2.40 magnet. At press time, XRP traded at $2.93.

Ripple shared news of this acknowledgment on its official X account, noting its inclusion among leading corporate contributors to the local community. Ripple’s Philanthropic Impact In the public statement, Ripple disclosed that the San Francisco Business Times had named it one of the region’s most active corporate philanthropists. This recognition reflects the company’s broad engagement with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, as well as its focus on promoting financial accessibility through technological innovation . Ripple also shared its 2024 Impact Report, which outlines the extent of its charitable initiatives over the past year. According to the report, Ripple supported over 70 universities and nonprofit organizations in 2024. More than half of these beneficiaries received multi-year funding commitments. Ripple’s philanthropic strategy includes allocating a fixed share of 1% of its profits to expanding access to financial services , particularly through blockchain technology. Ripple’s social engagement also extends to crisis response. In 2024, the company assisted communities impacted by natural disasters, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In those instances, Ripple donated XRP to relief organizations such as World Central Kitchen, which delivered aid to affected areas. These contributions are part of Ripple’s broader objective to apply blockchain-based solutions in support of both immediate relief and long-term development.

On the same day as Ripple’s announcement, Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, reported a notable transfer involving 20 million XRP ($60.5 million) from the South Korean exchange Upbit to an unidentified wallet. Large withdrawals from major exchanges are often associated with internal transactions, such as fund redistributions between exchange-managed wallets. Given the size of the transaction and the absence of further details, it has drawn speculation from market watchers, as the XRP ecosystem has recently seen notable whale activity . At the same time, XRP’s price has shown upward movement. After a recent decline to $2.74, the asset recovered most of those losses, briefly regaining the $3 level. The asset has dipped slightly, now trading at $2.93. However, it is still up almost 30% from last month. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In an era where information is both weaponized and walled off, the war over internet freedom is being fought not just in parliaments and courtrooms, but in code. And at the center of this digital battlefield lies a potent alliance: blockchain technology and mirror domains. Together, they’re rewriting the rules of access, permanence, and resistance in the face of rising global censorship. From decentralized file hosting to uncensorable domain systems, these tools offer more than just technical solutions—they represent a radical vision for a freer internet. But this vision is not without its challenges, controversies, and consequences. As governments clamp down harder and the web grows more fragmented, the intersection of blockchain, mirror domains, and censorship raises an urgent question: What’s really at stake? The Censored Web: A Growing Reality Across the world, access to the internet is being curated, filtered, or flat-out denied. Entire websites vanish at the stroke of a key. News portals go offline, independent voices are silenced, and activist platforms are rendered unreachable. In places like China, Iran, India, Turkey, and Russia, national firewalls and blacklists determine what’s seen and what’s not. Even in countries that claim to champion digital freedom, takedown orders, algorithmic suppression, and geo-restrictions are tightening control. What was once a global village now resembles a patchwork of gated communities. Mirror Domains: The First Line of Digital Resistance Mirror domains—replicas of original websites hosted under different URLs or IPs—have long been the first response to censorship. When a site gets blocked, a mirror pops up elsewhere, allowing users to continue accessing the same content. While effective, mirror domains face a cat-and-mouse game: governments blacklist mirrors as fast as they appear. Hosting providers, under legal pressure, pull the plug. DNS providers delist them. And so, the cycle continues. This is where blockchain enters the equation—not just as a technology, but as a philosophy. Enter the Blockchain: Building a Web That Can’t Be Shut Down At its core, blockchain is about decentralization and immutability—two qualities that strike at the heart of censorship. When applied to web hosting and domain management, it offers a fundamentally different architecture: Decentralized Storage : Platforms like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Arweave allow users to store website files across distributed nodes, removing single points of failure. Blockchain-Based Domains : Services such as Unstoppable Domains or ENS (Ethereum Name Service) enable users to create domain names that are stored on the blockchain itself, beyond the reach of traditional domain registrars or DNS authorities. Censorship Resistance : Once a site is hosted on IPFS and linked to a blockchain domain like .crypto or .eth, it’s nearly impossible to take down. There’s no central host to sue, no registrar to pressure, no DNS to hijack. “It’s not just about mirroring anymore,” says Sara Zhang, CTO of a blockchain infrastructure startup. “It’s about building websites that can’t be deleted. Period.” The Stakes: Freedom vs. Abuse Of course, with such power comes deep complexity. A truly uncensorable web can just as easily protect whistleblowers and journalists as it can shield hate groups, pirated content, or extremist propaganda. In a blockchain-powered internet, there is no moderator, no flag button, no authority to appeal to. And that’s where the ethical stakes rise. “The problem isn’t the technology,” argues Dr. Jonas Weir, a digital ethics scholar. “It’s that we haven’t collectively decided how to govern a space where nothing can be undone. The blockchain doesn’t forget. That’s powerful, but also dangerous.” Governments and rights organizations are now grappling with this dilemma. Should blockchain-hosted extremist content be tolerated in the name of digital freedom? Who bears responsibility when illegal material becomes permanently embedded across decentralized networks? Crypto-Anonymity: Fueling the Fire or Defending the Innocent? Anonymity is another double-edged sword. Blockchain transactions and domain registrations, particularly in privacy-centric networks, allow creators to remain untraceable. While this empowers activists under repressive regimes, it also enables bad actors to operate unchecked. The 2021 launch of blockchain-based dark web alternatives raised red flags globally, with many calling for new frameworks to distinguish between ethical resistance and criminal evasion. “We need decentralized accountability, not just decentralized access,” says Nisha Verma, a policy advisor with the Internet Governance Forum. “Otherwise, we’re just trading one form of control for another.” The Web3 Vision: A Censorship-Free Future or a New Wild West? Proponents of Web3—an internet built on blockchain principles—see this as the dawn of a more democratic digital age. Websites no longer hosted on central servers. Identities owned by users, not platforms. Monetization systems that bypass traditional gatekeepers. Yet critics warn that without regulation, Web3 may replicate the very power imbalances it seeks to dismantle—just under different banners. The tension is clear: the more uncensorable the web becomes, the more important it is to define ethical boundaries, technical safeguards, and global norms for its use. Conclusion: A Web Reimagined—But at What Cost? The intersection of blockchain, mirror domains, and censorship is more than a technical convergence—it’s a cultural crossroads. It forces us to rethink control, expression, permanence, and responsibility in an online world that is simultaneously expanding and fracturing. We’re no longer just asking whether we can build an uncensorable internet. We’re asking whether we should —and if we do, who ensures it serves the greater good? In the pursuit of digital freedom, blockchain may very well hold the keys. But the question that remains is: freedom for whom, and freedom at what cost?

BitBridge joins a growing list of public companies building Bitcoin treasuries. The firm also revealed plans to uplist to the NASDAQ, aiming to join the ranks of public companies leveraging Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, according to a Tuesday press release . Unlike many firms in the space, BitBridge emphasizes that it has no legacy operations and is entirely focused on expanding the Bitcoin economy. BitBridge Bets on Bitcoin Reserve and Sound Money Strategy BitBridge’s strategy centers on building a long-term Bitcoin reserve and introducing financial products that align with a sound money philosophy. The company also announced the upcoming launch of Respect Loan, a lending product that uses Bitcoin as collateral. Designed with multi-year terms and low interest rates, the program is intended to generate sustainable returns while avoiding the volatility typically associated with crypto-backed loans. To boost visibility, BitBridge plans to sponsor a high-profile college football team and launch an educational podcast hosted by CEO Paul Jaber. “BitBridge is positioned to bridge the gap between a declining traditional finance system and a thriving Bitcoin standard,” Jaber said in the release. The move follows a growing trend of companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, first popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy.

Novogratz Says Treasury Crypto Boom Has Peaked, Focus Shifts to Survivors Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes the wave of new crypto treasury companies has likely hit its peak , with attention now shifting to which existing firms can scale and dominate. Speaking during Galaxy’s Q2 earnings call, he said, “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” signaling a more competitive phase ahead. The boom in treasury-based crypto firms was fueled by favorable U.S. regulations, with companies like Strategy, GameStop , Trump Media , and SharpLink allocating reserves to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. However, Novogratz warned that saturation could make it harder for newcomers to gain traction, especially as Ethereum-focused treasuries like BitMine and SharpLink continue to expand. Galaxy Digital currently manages around $2 billion in assets for over 20 treasury-focused clients, generating steady fees in the process. The firm recently shifted its listing to Nasdaq and is exploring tokenizing its shares , part of a broader strategy to build blockchain-based financial infrastructure for institutional investors.

Satsuma Technology , a prominent UK-listed AI infrastructure firm, has successfully closed a remarkable funding round, securing an impressive £163.7 million ($217.6 million). This achievement not only significantly surpassed their initial target by a remarkable 64% but also boldly included a substantial Bitcoin investment as a core component of the raise. This strategic decision by Satsuma Technology underscores a rapidly accelerating trend of cryptocurrency adoption by established, forward-thinking companies, especially those operating at the innovative forefront of the artificial intelligence sector. What Makes This Funding Round Unique for Satsuma Technology? This recent funding round for Satsuma Technology stands out as particularly noteworthy in the current financial landscape. The company, which recently rebranded from Tao Alpha, managed to secure over $217 million, a clear testament to the strong investor confidence in its vision and capabilities. The list of prominent backers reads like a who’s who of leading venture capital and crypto-focused funds, including ParaFi, Pantera, DCG, and Kraken. Their involvement highlights the widespread interest in this pioneering AI infrastructure firm and its strategic direction. The most distinctive aspect of this raise is undoubtedly the direct acceptance of 1,097 Bitcoin (BTC) as a portion of the total funding. This significant acquisition boosts Satsuma Technology’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,125.85 BTC. For a UK company funding round of this magnitude to directly integrate a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin on such a substantial scale sends a powerful message. It clearly illustrates the evolving nature of corporate finance and the increasing willingness of public companies to embrace digital currencies as legitimate treasury assets. Why is Bitcoin Investment Gaining Traction Among AI Infrastructure Firms? The strategic choice by Satsuma Technology to make a significant Bitcoin investment is far from coincidental; it reflects a calculated alignment with their core business. AI infrastructure firms are inherently positioned at the vanguard of technological advancement, making the integration of digital assets a natural fit for their progressive ethos. Holding Bitcoin can serve several critical strategic purposes for such entities: Treasury Diversification: Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset class, potentially providing a hedge against traditional market volatility and inflationary pressures. It provides an alternative store of value outside of conventional fiat currencies. Strategic Alignment and Innovation: For companies deeply embedded in technology and innovation, embracing a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin perfectly aligns with their forward-thinking, disruptive culture. It signals a commitment to future financial paradigms. Future-Proofing Business Models: As global cryptocurrency adoption continues to expand and digital economies mature, having direct exposure to Bitcoin positions the company advantageously. It prepares them for a future where digital assets play an even more central role in commerce and finance. Operational Efficiency: In some cases, Bitcoin can facilitate faster, more cost-effective international transactions, which is beneficial for globally-minded tech firms. It is important to note that Satsuma Technology, under its previous name Tao Alpha, had already publicly announced its intentions to invest in Bitcoin. This pre-existing commitment underscores that this was a deliberate, well-considered strategy, not a reactive decision. This proactive approach by an AI infrastructure firm like Satsuma Technology highlights a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the digital future. What Does This Mean for Broader Cryptocurrency Adoption? The actions of a publicly listed and respected entity like Satsuma Technology , particularly its acceptance of Bitcoin as part of its substantial UK company funding , carries significant weight. It can profoundly influence the trajectory of broader cryptocurrency adoption . This move provides a compelling, real-world example for other corporations and institutional investors who may be contemplating similar strategies. This high-profile institutional endorsement not only lends considerable credibility to digital assets but also helps to normalize their inclusion in corporate balance sheets and financial operations. While the opportunities presented by Bitcoin investment are substantial, companies exploring this path must also navigate inherent considerations such as market volatility and the evolving landscape of regulatory clarity. However, the successful execution by Satsuma Technology demonstrates that with a clear vision, robust due diligence, and effective risk management strategies, these challenges are indeed manageable for pioneering firms. This development signifies a crucial shift: innovative companies are no longer merely observing the crypto space from the sidelines; they are actively participating and integrating it into their core financial strategies. This sets a powerful precedent for how future capital raises and corporate treasury management might evolve, increasingly blurring the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world. It’s a clear signal of maturation for the entire crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, Satsuma Technology’s impressive £163.7 million funding round, prominently featuring a significant Bitcoin investment , marks a truly pivotal moment for both the AI and crypto sectors. This event not only reinforces the increasing institutional confidence in digital assets but also paves a clearer path for greater cryptocurrency adoption , especially within the dynamic and rapidly evolving realm of AI infrastructure. This bold move by a leading UK company funding itself partly in Bitcoin is a resounding indicator that the future of corporate finance is undeniably and increasingly intertwined with the digital economy.

A massive USDC transfer , totaling nearly $700 million, occurred from the Binance exchange to an unidentified digital address. This monumental event, flagged by blockchain tracker Whale Alert, immediately raised questions across the crypto community. Unpacking the Recent Binance USDC Transfer Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain transaction tracking service, reported a staggering USDC transfer . Specifically, 698,990,107 USDC, valued at approximately $699 million, moved from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The destination? An unknown wallet address, shrouded in digital anonymity. This single transaction highlights the sheer scale of liquidity and activity within the stablecoin market. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1. This makes it a crucial asset for large-scale transfers, enabling significant value movement without price volatility. The Significance of a Large Crypto Transfer When such a large crypto transfer takes place, it’s natural for market observers to speculate on its implications. Transactions of this magnitude are not everyday occurrences, even on a bustling exchange like Binance. They often signal significant strategic moves by institutional players, high-net-worth individuals, or even exchanges themselves. Several possibilities exist for why such a substantial amount of Binance USDC would move to an unknown wallet: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional trades often happen off-exchange to avoid impacting market prices. Exchange Rebalancing: Binance might be moving funds for internal wallet consolidation or security purposes. Custodial Services: A large client could be moving funds to a personal or institutional cold storage solution. Strategic Investment: A major player could be preparing for a significant investment or acquisition. Decoding the Whale Transaction Phenomenon The term ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of digital assets. This recent movement certainly qualifies as a whale transaction . Crypto whales wield considerable influence due to their ability to move vast sums, which can sometimes impact market sentiment or even liquidity for specific assets. Understanding these large movements helps analysts gauge market sentiment. While the identity of the recipient wallet remains unknown, the sheer size of this particular crypto wallet transfer suggests a calculated and deliberate action rather than a casual one. Monitoring these whale activities provides valuable insights into potential future market trends or strategic shifts. Implications for Crypto Wallet Transfer Security The fact that nearly $700 million can be transferred in a single crypto wallet transfer underscores both the efficiency and the robust security of blockchain technology. Despite the unknown destination, the transaction itself was executed securely on the blockchain network, verifying the integrity of the transfer process. This event also subtly reminds us of the dual nature of crypto: while transactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, the identities behind wallet addresses can remain anonymous. This blend of transparency and privacy is a fundamental aspect of decentralized finance. Conclusion: Monitoring the Digital Tides The recent USDC transfer of nearly $700 million from Binance to an unknown wallet serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Such large-scale movements by crypto whales are always noteworthy, signaling significant activity that could influence future market developments. While the exact purpose of this particular transaction remains a mystery, it certainly keeps the crypto community vigilant and engaged, continuously monitoring these digital tides. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning one USDC is intended to always be redeemable for one U.S. dollar. It is fully backed by cash and short-dated U.S. government treasuries. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. It helps the crypto community monitor significant movements by large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Why are large crypto transfers significant? Large crypto transfers are significant because they often indicate major strategic moves by institutional investors, exchanges, or high-net-worth individuals. These movements can sometimes precede market shifts or reveal insights into market sentiment and liquidity. What does an ‘unknown wallet’ mean? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address whose owner or custodian has not been publicly identified. While the transaction itself is visible on the blockchain, the real-world identity behind the address remains private. Could this transfer impact the price of USDC? As USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, a large transfer of USDC typically does not directly impact its price. Its value is designed to remain stable at $1. However, it can indicate significant liquidity shifts within the broader crypto ecosystem. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Toncoin Hits Key Zone as Big Deal Looms,https://cryptopotato.com/buy-the-dip-toncoin-hits-key-zone-as-big-deal-looms/,"TL;DR Toncoin hits demand zone near $3.20 after 7% drop, signaling a possible short-term bounce. MACD and RSI indicators suggest selling pressure is weakening, hinting at potential price reversal. Verb Technology to rebrand and back TON with $558M, deal closes on August 7, 2025. Toncoin Pulls Back Toward Key Support Toncoin (TON) traded near $3.19 at press time, down around 5% over the past day and roughly 7% weekly. The token recently pulled back from the $3.70 area and is now moving into a support range between $3.30 and $3.20. This zone has acted as a base for past price movements. According to analyst Naveed, the current dip aligns with a key demand area. If the price holds, a short-term recovery could follow. A bounce from this zone may push TON back toward the $3.45 level. Continued strength could open the path toward $3.70 again. $TON is pulling back after reaching the $3.7 area Price is now around $3.3, and we could be heading into a strong support zone between $3.3 – $3.2 Wait for price to hit demand zone and look for signs of a bounce If that happens, it could be a good opportunity for a move HIGHER https://t.co/BZ1myNMROT pic.twitter.com/44YZ3wJACD — Naveed (@navex_eth) August 5, 2025 Indicators Show Early Signs of Support The 4-hour chart shows a previous break in structure near $3.45. The asset is now below this level, but still within range to reclaim it. There’s also a fair value gap between $3.32 and $3.50. If buyers return, this area may attract prices back toward higher levels. On the MACD, the blue line remains under the orange signal line. The histogram shows red bars, but they are shrinking, which suggests that selling pressure may be slowing. If a crossover happens, it could point to a shift in trend. Source: TradingVie w RSI sits at 33. This is close to oversold territory, which starts at 30. While not fully oversold yet, the reading shows that TON is nearing levels where buyers may begin to re-enter the market. A rise above 35 could hint at early buying strength. Verb Technology Shifts Focus to Toncoin Verb Technology, a public company known for its video tech and AI services, is rebranding to TON Strategy Co. (TSC). It has secured $558 million in capital through a private placement of 58.7 million shares at $9.51 each. This funding is allocated to build a reserve primarily made up of Toncoin. Meanwhile, Kingsway Capital is backing the strategy, and the deal is expected to close by August 7, 2025. If finalized, TSC would become the first publicly traded company to hold TON as a treasury asset officially. This shift marks a new approach, with a direct focus on Toncoin rather than more widely adopted tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Price Levels to Watch Moving Forward Analyst Ali Martinez points to $2.87 as a key support level, sitting just above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. Price stability around this area helps maintain the broader upward structure. On the upside, $5.30 is a level to watch, lining up with the 0.786 Fibonacci extension and a previous supply zone. If the existing support at $3.20-$3.30 remains intact, the price may head towards $3.45 level in the short term. A drop under $3.20 can set the stage for a decline to $3.02 or lower levels.

The latest launch represents the first concrete result of their collaboration, which was originally unveiled in February 2024. XRP Goes Live on BDACS In its tweet, BDACS stated that XRP is among the most widely held digital assets in South Korea, and the new custody support opens the door for institutions to engage with it in a secure, compliant manner. Ripple’s Ripple Custody platform, specifically designed for institutional-grade asset management, will underpin the storage and management of both XRP and Ripple’s enterprise-focused stablecoin, RLUSD. The development also follows BDACS’s integrations with Korea’s top crypto exchanges, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, which give institutions seamless access to the crypto asset across the country’s most liquid venues. The custodian had previously said that its collaboration with Ripple aligns with South Korea’s regulatory roadmap for digital assets, as outlined by the Financial Services Commission, which aims to accelerate institutional adoption. BDACS noted that its mission is not only to provide custody services but also to boost innovation on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), particularly in tokenization and stablecoin use cases. The move echoes market research, which predicted that crypto custody could manage up to $16 trillion in assets by 2030, with tokenized assets accounting for 10% of global GDP. Ripple’s Asia-Pacific managing director, Fiona Murray, said the partnership was indicative of a growing institutional demand amid shifting regulations in the region. Meanwhile, BDACS CEO Harry Ryoo had commented, “BDACS will provide a secure and reliable custody service to support Ripple’s pioneering blockchain initiatives. Ultimately, this partnership will enable both companies to enhance and expand the digital asset ecosystem.” Besides XRP, BDACS is already active in Busan’s blockchain regulation-free zone and has partnered with players like Avalanche and Polymesh. “Meme Coin” Label in USA Today Sparks Backlash As institutional infrastructure expands, XRP’s market performance has captured global attention. The asset recently surged over $3.6, and hit a new all-time high after a 500% rally since the US elections. However, a new USA Today article praising XRP’s utility and regulatory outlook has raised concerns. Historically, glowing mainstream coverage, especially from outlets like The Motley Fool, which influenced the article, has coincided with market tops. The article controversially calls XRP a former “meme coin,” a mischaracterization that stirred significant backlash. While media sentiment doesn’t always dictate price trends, such enthusiastic coverage has often preceded corrections. Given this pattern, some market watchers view the positive press as a potential top signal for the token in 2025.

The central bank’s policy rate decision also aligned with expectations from economists polled by Reuters. India’s Reserve Bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points during its previous meeting in June. The Bank’s Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, argued that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the previous 50-basis-point cut. India expects inflation to remain below 4% https://t.co/adYFVZbNQw — ReserveBankOfIndia (@RBI) August 6, 2025 India’s RBI has issued three consecutive rate cuts totaling 100 basis points since February, adding that its latest decision to switch from neutral to accommodative was unanimous. It also mentioned that its stance on monetary policy came due to easing inflation and rising global uncertainties. Analysts at Bank of America argued that New Delhi’s previous rate cuts saved the country’s markets. They believe that the RBI will only pause rates for now, but that could change if there’s a major shift in the macroeconomic outlook. The analysts also expect another rate cut this year – likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 – once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. Malhotra argued that volatile food prices have kept headline inflation much lower than projected earlier. RBI also warned that a 10% surge in crude prices could increase inflation by 20 basis points. India’s inflation reading in June hit a fresh six-year low of 2.1%, suggesting a possible rate cut. The Monetary Policy Committee expects India’s inflation for 2025 to remain significantly below the RBI’s target of 4%. The committee also estimates that food price volatility will cause a rise in inflation in Q4 of 2025. Malhotra said the MPC will determine the future trajectory of monetary policy by assessing the incoming data and economic projections. “On balance, the current macroeconomic conditions, outlook, and uncertainties call for continuation of the policy repo rate of 5.5% and wait for further transmission of the front-loaded rate cut to the credit markets and the broader economy.” – Sanjay Malhotra , Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. The RBI also kept its GDP growth forecast neutral, at 6.5% for the financial year ending March 2026. It also cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous estimates of 3.7%. India saw a surge in its GDP in the quarter ended March at 7.4%, which was higher than the Reuters poll estimates of 6.7%. India’s FY24/25 also registered an overall economic growth of 6.5% in line with the government’s estimate. India faces trade challenges and geopolitical uncertainties Malhotra argued that the central bank’s decision to maintain rate cuts came as New Delhi faces global trade challenges with the U.S. Earlier last week, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs and additional unspecified penalties on the country starting August 7. Trump condemned India for having energy deals with Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The President argued that the purchase of Russian oil helps finance Moscow’s war on Ukraine and that India didn’t care how many lives were lost in the war. He also believed that New Delhi was purchasing Russian oil and selling it on the open market for big profits. Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, Michael Kugelman, believes that Trump is trying to wean India off its autonomy policy by going after its ties with Russia. On Monday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs accused the U.S. and EU of double standards for having trade deals with Moscow. India revealed that its Minister of External Affairs, S Jaishankar, will visit Russia later this month. The country also disclosed that its National Security Adviser Ajit Doval landed in Moscow yesterday and Putin will also visit India later this year for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the majority of members are keeping interest rates steady, citing ongoing uncertainty from tariffs. As interest rate cut hopes continue to intensify in September, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan released his forecast. Speaking to CNBC, the BofA CEO talked about interest rate cuts and the economic situation in the US. The famous CEO stated that it is unlikely that the FED will cut interest rates this year. Moynihan stated that the decline in inflation was slower than expected and predicted that interest rate cuts would only begin next year. “Our economists predict that it will take longer for inflation to decline, and therefore I do not expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. At this point, it seems likely that the Fed will only begin cutting interest rates next year.” Finally, Moynihan added that he does not expect the US to enter a recession. FedWatch data shows a 90% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September. Investors are pricing in an 87.5% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the September FOMC meeting, according to CME FedWatch. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins are back in the red, with substantial price declines from the likes of XRP, SOL, HYPE, XLM, LTC, TON, and others. BTC’s Insecurity Continues The primary cryptocurrency’s troubles began last Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve refused to lower the key interest rates for the fifth consecutive time. BTC retraced by a few grand but bounced to $119,000 on Thursday. However, macro uncertainty, such as new tariffs and nuclear submarine movements, resulted in another, more painful nosedive. In just a few days, the cryptocurrency plunged by several grand and bottomed during the weekend at $112,000. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and started to push the asset north. The gradual ascent culminated yesterday when BTC briefly neared $116,000 but was stopped ahead of that resistance. In the following hours, bitcoin dropped to under $113,000 once again. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $114,000, with a market cap of just under $2.270 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins stands close to 60% on CG. BTCUSD.

BNB, TRX, and BCH are with minor losses, while XRP, SOL, DOGE , HYPE, XLM, and TON have dropped by more substantial percentages of up to 4%. Pi Network’s native token has dropped by 4% as well, and sits close to its all-time low once again, which was recorded at the end of the previous business week. BONK and PENGU have dropped the most from the largest 100 alts, losing 6-7% each. Litecoin’s LTC is down by 5% after yesterday’s impressive surge .

Matt Hougan says the market cap of Uniswap ( UNI ), which is approximately $6 billion, currently “feels too small.” “[Uniswap] would be the 400th largest financial services business in the world – roughly the same size as Storebrand, a savings and insurance business in Norway.” According to Hougan, regulatory uncertainty could be driving Uniswap’s current undervaluation, but that could change amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent initiatives to provide regulatory clarity for crypto assets. Per a Grayscale Research report released in late June, Uniswap is among the top-10 decentralized exchanges. Over six months ending on May 31st, Uniswap ranked third in terms of volumes. Uniswap generated $487 million in fees behind Solana-based decentralized exchanges Raydium, Meteora and Jupiter over that period. UNI is trading at $9.89 at time of writing, up by 36% over the past month and down by around 78% from the all-time high reached in May of 2021. Turning to Ethereum, Hougan notes that spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap recorded $5.4 billion in net inflows in July, the highest monthly net inflows ever. “When you consider Ethereum is 20% the size of Bitcoin, the scale of those flows really hits home. Imagine if Bitcoin ETFs did $27 billion in a month…” According to crypto ETFs tracker SoSoValue, the highest net inflows figure for spot Bitcoin ETFs was the $6.49 billion reached in November of 2024.

According to the ministry, misuse of such data could allow foreign actors to exploit Chinese citizens and conduct surveillance or infiltration activities against state institutions. The MSS pointed to a recent case involving an unnamed overseas company that allegedly scanned iris data worldwide under the guise of issuing cryptocurrency tokens, later transferring the data elsewhere. Authorities said this posed “a threat to personal information security and even national security,” highlighting the potential use of such data in espionage operations or long-term manipulation of digital identities. “Unlike passwords, biometric keys cannot be changed,” the MSS warned, calling for stronger public awareness and caution when engaging with platforms that request biometric input. Facial recognition was also flagged as “threat to national security,” if “improper storage” solutions lead to leaks. Officials cited instances where foreign intelligence services were able to use manipulated facial data in espionage. The MSS called for tighter oversight of how companies store, transmit, and protect collected biometric information, warning that poor safeguards could lead to massive leaks or deliberate misuse. Did China point fingers at Worldcoin? While the bulletin did not name any specific companies, the description appears to align with World (formerly Worldcoin), a project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Worldcoin collects iris data in exchange for its World (WLD) token, promoting what it calls a “proof of personhood” system aimed at distinguishing real humans from bots in a digital economy. Worldcoin has claimed that its operations span over 160 countries, although China is not among them. Its system relies on proprietary hardware called the Orb, which scans users’ irises to create unique digital identities. In exchange, users receive WLD tokens, which they can store or trade. Although Worldcoin promotes itself as a tool for digital inclusion and universal access to income, its use of biometric data has raised red flags among regulators in several countries. Kenya, for instance, suspended Worldcoin’s operations in 2023 after more than 300,000 people had signed up, raising alarms over how the project handled sensitive user data. Spain took similar action the following year, ordering the company to erase all stored biometrics after finding breaches of EU data protection laws. Other countries, including Germany, Portugal, Brazil , South Korea, Colombia, and Hong Kong, also moved to suspend or investigate Worldcoin’s operations, often citing non-compliance with local data protection regulations. Indonesia, one of the latest to intervene, froze Worldcoin’s operations earlier this year for failing to register its local entity as an Electronic System Operator. Authorities there labelled the project’s unlicensed activity a serious violation of domestic digital law. In Singapore, police opened investigations into individuals trading Worldcoin accounts, and have warned that accounts tied to biometric identities could be exploited for terrorism financing or money laundering. While Worldcoin and its parent entity, Tools For Humanity, have maintained that they are working with local regulators and prioritising transparency, critics argue that the project’s approach to consent and data handling remains insufficient given the sensitivity of biometric identifiers. Is there an alternative to Iris scans? As an alternative, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a concept called “pluralistic identity,” which avoids reliance on any single data source or verification method. Instead of enforcing a rigid one-person-one-ID system based on biometric scans, pluralistic models allow identity to emerge from multiple independent attestations, such as from governments, social networks, or even individual communities. Buterin and other supporters of decentralised identity systems argue that a multi-layered approach balances the need for authentication while preserving privacy.

While digital assets often grab headlines, shifts in major currency pairs like GBP/USD can signal broader economic trends, influencing everything from global trade to investor sentiment. Recently, a significant forecast from banking giant UBS has caught the attention of market participants: they anticipate the GBP/USD forecast to reach 1.40 by mid-2026. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential indicator of shifting economic tides between the UK and the US, and understanding its implications can offer valuable insights for diversified portfolio strategies. Understanding the GBP/USD Forecast : UBS’s Bullish Stance The GBP/USD currency pair, often referred to as ‘Cable,’ represents the exchange rate between the British Pound (GBP) and the US Dollar (USD). It’s one of the most actively traded pairs globally, reflecting the economic health and monetary policy divergence between the United Kingdom and the United States. UBS, a leading global financial services company, has put forth a notably optimistic GBP/USD forecast , projecting a rise to 1.40 within the next two and a half years. This target, if realized, would mark a substantial appreciation for the Pound against the Dollar from its current levels, signaling a potential reversal or significant strengthening trend. What’s Fueling the UBS Prediction ? Key Drivers Behind the Pound’s Potential Ascent UBS’s bullish outlook isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s grounded in a meticulous analysis of various macroeconomic factors. Several key drivers are expected to contribute to the Pound’s potential strengthening against the Dollar. Monetary Policy Divergence: A primary factor is the anticipated shift in monetary policy between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). While both central banks have been aggressive in raising interest rates to combat inflation, market expectations suggest the BoE might maintain a relatively tighter policy for longer, or at least be slower to cut rates compared to the Fed. Higher interest rates typically attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the local currency. Inflation Trends: The trajectory of inflation in both economies plays a crucial role. If UK inflation proves more persistent, compelling the BoE to keep rates elevated, while US inflation moderates more rapidly, allowing the Fed to ease policy, this divergence would naturally support the Pound. Economic Resilience: The relative economic performance of the UK versus the US is another consideration. Signs of greater resilience or unexpected growth in the UK economy, especially as it navigates post-Brexit challenges, could bolster investor confidence in the Pound. Conversely, any signs of a significant slowdown or recession in the US could weaken the Dollar. Global Risk Appetite: The US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. If global economic conditions stabilize or improve, leading to increased risk appetite among investors, the demand for safe-haven assets like the Dollar might decrease, allowing riskier currencies like the Pound to gain ground. To illustrate the potential divergence in economic indicators that could underpin this UBS prediction , consider the following hypothetical scenario: Economic Indicator UK Outlook (UBS Perspective) US Outlook (UBS Perspective) Interest Rates (BoE vs. Fed) Higher for Longer / Slower Cuts Earlier / More Aggressive Cuts Inflation Trend Persistent, Gradual Decline Moderating Faster GDP Growth Steady, Gradual Recovery Potential Soft Landing / Mild Slowdown Labour Market Tight, Wage Growth Pressure Cooling, but Resilient Navigating the Forex Market : Opportunities and Challenges for Traders A significant move in GBP/USD, as projected by UBS, presents both opportunities and challenges for participants in the Forex market . Opportunities: Long Positions: Traders who believe in the UBS forecast could take long positions on GBP/USD, aiming to profit from the Pound’s appreciation. Carry Trade Potential: If the interest rate differential between the UK and the US widens in favor of the Pound, carry trades (borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a high-interest currency) could become more attractive. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with exposure to GBP or USD could use this forecast to refine their hedging strategies, potentially reducing currency risk on international transactions. Challenges: Uncertainty and Volatility: The path to 1.40 is unlikely to be linear. Geopolitical events, unexpected economic data, or shifts in central bank rhetoric can introduce significant volatility, leading to sharp price swings. Policy Reversals: Central bank policies are data-dependent. A sudden resurgence of inflation in the US or an unexpected economic downturn in the UK could force policy reversals, invalidating current forecasts. External Shocks: Global events, such as new conflicts, commodity price spikes, or financial crises, can override domestic economic fundamentals and impact currency valuations unpredictably. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone looking to engage with the Forex market effectively, whether through direct trading or managing currency exposure in broader investments. What Does This Mean for the Pound to Dollar Exchange Rate? Broader Implications The potential ascent of the Pound to Dollar exchange rate to 1.40 has far-reaching implications beyond just currency traders. For UK Exporters: A stronger Pound makes UK exports more expensive for international buyers, potentially reducing demand. Conversely, it makes imported goods cheaper, which could help dampen domestic inflation. For US Tourists in the UK: A higher GBP/USD rate means US tourists get fewer Pounds for their Dollars, making holidays in the UK more expensive. For UK tourists in the US, their Pound would buy more Dollars, making US travel more affordable. For Investors with International Portfolios: UK-based investors holding US assets would see the value of those assets decrease in Pound terms as the Pound strengthens. Conversely, US-based investors holding UK assets would see their investments appreciate in Dollar terms. For Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations with significant operations or revenues in either currency will see their reported earnings affected by currency fluctuations. For example, a US company earning in GBP would see its Dollar-denominated earnings increase with a stronger Pound. This movement isn’t just about numbers on a screen; it directly impacts the purchasing power of consumers, the profitability of businesses, and the returns on international investments. The shift in the Pound to Dollar ratio reflects fundamental economic shifts that resonate across various sectors. Crafting Your Strategy: Actionable Insights for the Currency Outlook Given UBS’s intriguing currency outlook for GBP/USD, how can individuals and investors position themselves? While no forecast is guaranteed, prudent planning can help navigate potential market shifts. Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep a close eye on inflation reports, interest rate decisions, GDP figures, and employment data from both the UK and the US. These releases are often the primary catalysts for short-term currency movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on a single currency pair or asset class can be risky. Diversifying across different currencies, asset classes (including traditional equities, bonds, and even cryptocurrencies), and geographies can help mitigate exposure to adverse currency movements. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you have significant exposure to either GBP or USD through international business or investments, explore hedging options like forward contracts or currency options to lock in exchange rates and protect against unfavorable swings. Understand Risk Management: For those directly trading Forex, always employ robust risk management techniques, including setting stop-loss orders, managing position sizes, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Volatility can be high, and even strong forecasts can be subject to unforeseen events. Consult Financial Professionals: For complex financial decisions or significant investments, seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who specializes in currency markets or international investments can provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation and risk tolerance. The journey to 1.40 for GBP/USD, if it materializes, will be influenced by a multitude of factors. Staying informed and adopting a strategic approach to your investments, considering this long-term currency outlook , is paramount. In conclusion, UBS’s forecast of GBP/USD reaching 1.40 by mid-2026 presents a compelling narrative for the coming years. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by expectations of diverging monetary policies, varying inflation trajectories, and relative economic resilience between the UK and the US. While the path ahead will undoubtedly be marked by volatility and external factors, understanding the potential drivers and implications of such a significant move is vital for anyone engaged in the financial markets. Whether you’re a seasoned Forex trader, an international business, or an investor looking to diversify, keeping this GBP/USD forecast in perspective can inform more strategic decision-making and help navigate the evolving global economic landscape.

Typically, news of impending interest rate cuts might signal weakness for a currency. However, in a fascinating twist, analysts are increasingly pointing towards potential gains for the Aussie dollar. This counter-intuitive outlook presents a compelling narrative for investors and currency traders alike, suggesting a strategic opportunity emerging from evolving monetary policy. Understanding the RBA’s Stance on Interest Rates : What’s Driving the Shift? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has recently adopted a more dovish tone, signaling that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon. This shift in monetary policy is primarily influenced by several key factors: Inflationary Pressures Easing: While inflation has remained sticky, the RBA has noted a clear deceleration in price growth, particularly in goods. Services inflation remains a concern, but the overall trend suggests that the aggressive rate hikes implemented previously are having their intended effect. Global Economic Slowdown: Weakening global growth prospects, particularly in major trading partners, put downward pressure on Australia’s export-driven economy. Lowering interest rates can stimulate domestic demand and support economic activity in a challenging external environment. Labor Market Dynamics: Although the Australian labor market has remained resilient, there are signs of some softening. The RBA aims to maintain full employment and can use rate cuts as a tool to prevent a significant downturn in job creation. Balancing Act: The RBA is navigating a delicate balance between bringing inflation back to its target band (2-3%) and avoiding a severe economic recession. Signaling future cuts allows the RBA flexibility and can help manage market expectations. Historically, a central bank easing cycle often weakens a currency as it makes domestic assets less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. However, the current scenario for the Australian Dollar is nuanced. Markets have largely priced in these cuts, and the forward guidance provides clarity, reducing uncertainty. Furthermore, if other major central banks (like the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank) are also expected to cut rates, or even cut more aggressively, the RBA’s moves might not be seen as uniquely dovish. Why is the Australian Dollar Poised for Gains Amidst Rate Cuts? This seems contradictory, doesn’t it? A currency strengthening when its central bank is cutting rates. Yet, several dynamics explain this intriguing forecast for the Australian Dollar : “Sell the Rumor, Buy the News” Phenomenon: A significant portion of the RBA’s expected rate cuts has already been factored into the market. Traders often front-run such announcements, selling the currency in anticipation. Once the cuts are confirmed or clearly signaled, the “news” is out, and the selling pressure can abate, leading to a rebound as speculative positions are unwound. Relative Monetary Policy Divergence: The key lies in comparison. If the RBA is perceived to be cutting rates at a slower pace, or starting later, than other major central banks (e.g., the European Central Bank or Bank of England), then the yield differential might not necessarily widen against the AUD. In some scenarios, if the RBA is seen as being more measured, it could even lead to relative strength. Commodity Price Resilience: Australia is a major exporter of commodities, including iron ore, coal, and natural gas. Strong global demand for these resources, particularly from China, provides a fundamental underpinning for the Australian Dollar . If commodity prices remain robust or even rise, this can offset some of the negative pressure from lower interest rates. Improved Global Risk Sentiment: A more stable global economic outlook, even if it involves slower growth, can boost demand for risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD. As a “pro-cyclical” currency, the Australian Dollar often benefits from improving global risk appetite, especially if concerns about a severe global recession recede. Domestic Economic Resilience: Despite the RBA’s caution, the Australian economy has shown remarkable resilience in certain sectors. If the economy avoids a sharp downturn and unemployment remains relatively low, it provides a stable foundation for the currency, even with easing monetary policy . This complex interplay of factors suggests that while the RBA is signaling a pivot, the market’s interpretation, coupled with underlying economic strengths, could propel the Australian Dollar higher. What Does This Mean for the AUD Forecast ? Predicting currency movements is an intricate art, but the current signals from the RBA offer significant clues for the AUD forecast . Analysts are now adjusting their models to reflect the likelihood of easing, and the consensus is leaning towards a more constructive outlook for the Aussie dollar in the medium term. Key elements influencing the AUD forecast include: Timing and Pace of RBA Cuts: The market will closely watch the RBA’s actual actions. A slower, more measured pace of cuts than initially expected could provide more significant upside for the AUD. Commodity Price Performance: Australia’s strong ties to global commodity markets mean that prices of key exports will continue to play a crucial role. A sustained rally in iron ore or energy prices would be a powerful tailwind for the Australian Dollar . China’s Economic Recovery: As Australia’s largest trading partner, China’s economic health is paramount. Any robust recovery in China, especially in its industrial and construction sectors, directly translates to increased demand for Australian resources and thus strengthens the AUD. Global Interest Rate Environment: The relative positioning of the RBA’s interest rates compared to other major central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ) will be critical. If other central banks cut more aggressively, the AUD’s yield advantage could improve, even with RBA cuts. Many institutional forecasts suggest the Australian Dollar could strengthen against the US Dollar (AUD/USD) in the latter half of the year, potentially moving towards the 0.68-0.70 range or even higher, depending on the factors mentioned above. This positive AUD forecast is a significant shift from earlier predictions of continued weakness. Navigating the Forex Market : Opportunities in Currency Trading For individuals and institutions engaged in currency trading , the anticipated movements of the Australian Dollar present compelling opportunities. Understanding the dynamics at play is crucial for formulating effective trading strategies. Here’s how traders might approach the evolving landscape: Strategy Description Potential Benefit Long AUD Positions Buying the Australian Dollar against currencies where central banks are expected to cut rates more aggressively or maintain lower rates. Capitalize on AUD’s relative strength and potential appreciation. Commodity-Linked Trades Monitoring and reacting to trends in key Australian commodity exports (e.g., iron ore, coal). Strong commodity prices often correlate with a stronger AUD. Leverage fundamental drivers of the Australian economy. Carry Trades (Cautious Approach) While RBA cuts reduce the interest rate differential, if other currencies cut even more, or if risk sentiment improves, cautious carry trades could still be considered. Earn interest rate differential, though less prominent in an easing cycle. Risk-On/Risk-Off Positioning The AUD is often a “risk-on” currency. If global risk appetite improves, buying the AUD can be a strategy. Conversely, during “risk-off” periods, caution is advised. Align with broader market sentiment shifts. However, it’s vital to remember that currency trading involves inherent risks. Volatility can be high, and unexpected global events or shifts in RBA communication could quickly alter the outlook. Effective risk management, including stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing, is paramount. The Broader Impact of Monetary Policy Shifts The RBA’s evolving monetary policy stance has ripple effects beyond just the Australian Dollar . It influences various aspects of the Australian economy and global financial markets: Economic Stimulus: Lower interest rates aim to stimulate borrowing and spending by businesses and consumers, supporting economic growth and potentially boosting employment. Inflation Management: While cutting rates, the RBA must remain vigilant about inflation. If inflationary pressures re-emerge unexpectedly, the RBA might have to reverse course, creating market volatility. Housing Market: Lower interest rates typically make mortgages more affordable, potentially supporting the housing market, which is a significant component of the Australian economy. Equity Markets: Reduced borrowing costs can be positive for corporate earnings, potentially boosting the Australian stock market (ASX). However, a weakening economy (which often precedes rate cuts) can be a drag. Global Capital Flows: Changes in Australian interest rates influence the attractiveness of Australian assets to international investors, impacting capital flows into and out of the country. The RBA’s careful calibration of its monetary policy is a crucial determinant of Australia’s economic health and its standing in the global financial system. The signals of rate cuts are not merely about the currency; they reflect a broader strategy to navigate complex economic currents. Challenges and Considerations for the Australian Dollar ‘s Trajectory While the outlook for the Australian Dollar appears positive, several challenges and uncertainties could impact its trajectory: Global Economic Shocks: Unexpected downturns in major economies, geopolitical tensions, or supply chain disruptions could weigh heavily on commodity prices and global risk sentiment, negatively impacting the AUD. Inflation Persistence: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, the RBA might delay or even reverse rate cuts, potentially disappointing market expectations and putting downward pressure on the currency. Divergence in Central Bank Policies: While relative policy is a factor for strength, a significant divergence where other major central banks cut rates far less than the RBA, or even hike, could reduce the AUD’s attractiveness. Domestic Economic Weakness: Despite current resilience, if the Australian economy experiences a more severe slowdown than forecast, it could undermine confidence in the AUD. Commodity Price Volatility: While currently supportive, commodity prices are inherently volatile. A sharp decline could quickly erode the AUD’s fundamental support. These factors underscore the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies for anyone involved in currency trading or holding AUD-denominated assets. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders Given the nuanced outlook for the Australian Dollar , what should investors and traders consider? Stay Informed on RBA Communications: Closely follow RBA statements, minutes, and speeches. Any shift in language regarding inflation, employment, or global outlook can provide crucial clues about future monetary policy . Monitor Commodity Markets: Keep a keen eye on the prices of iron ore, coal, and other key Australian exports. Strong commodity prices often signal a stronger AUD. Watch Global Risk Sentiment: The AUD is a risk-sensitive currency. During periods of improved global economic outlook and risk appetite, the AUD tends to perform well. Compare Relative Central Bank Policies: Don’t just focus on the RBA. Understand the expected actions of the Fed, ECB, BoE, and BoJ. The relative pace and timing of rate adjustments will significantly impact cross-currency pairs involving the AUD. Diversify and Manage Risk: As with any investment, diversification is key. For currency trading , utilize robust risk management tools like stop-loss orders and consider position sizing carefully to protect capital from unexpected volatility. The current environment presents a unique opportunity for those who can navigate the complexities of central bank signals and global economic interdependencies. The narrative surrounding the Australian Dollar is undergoing a fascinating transformation. What might initially seem like a paradox – a currency strengthening despite anticipated rate cuts – is in fact a testament to the complex interplay of market expectations, relative central bank policies, and fundamental economic drivers. The RBA’s strategic pivot on interest rates , coupled with the “sell the rumor, buy the news” dynamic and resilient commodity markets, paints a remarkably positive AUD forecast . For those engaged in the Forex market , particularly in currency trading , this signals a period ripe with potential. While challenges remain, the prevailing sentiment suggests the Australian Dollar is poised for a significant ascent, making it a crucial currency to watch in the coming months.

Visa has previously taken steps to integrate cryptocurrency usage through direct partnerships and network access. One example provided in the documentation shared by SMQKE shows Visa granting principal membership status to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. This membership enables Coinbase to issue debit cards that allow customers to spend their holdings of bitcoin, ether, and XRP at any merchant that accepts Visa. The arrangement removes intermediaries from the process of converting crypto to fiat at the point of sale.

According to the information presented, Visa envisions the platform as an interoperability layer connecting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), public cryptocurrencies, and legacy financial systems. While the exact countries participating were not specified in the document, Visa was listed as the main organization involved. The analysis highlights three interoperability methods under consideration: APIs, bridges, and other options. Specifically, Visa identified the Universal Payments Channel (UPC), RippleNet, and the Interledger Protocol as examples of frameworks that could enable seamless transfers across different types of digital assets and settlement networks. RippleNet is Ripple’s global payments network designed for faster, lower-cost cross-border transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Interledger Protocol allows for interoperability between disparate ledgers by facilitating the routing of payments without requiring all participants to adopt the same underlying technology. Effect on XRP and the Broader Payments Ecosystem The inclusion of RippleNet and Interledger Protocol in Visa’s exploration of settlement solutions suggests an interest in expanding the ability to settle transactions involving XRP and other digital currencies. While the documentation reviewed by SMQKE does not specify implementation timelines or definitive commitments, the listing of Ripple’s infrastructure alongside Visa’s Universal Payments Channel indicates that Ripple technology is recognized as a viable interoperability option. This approach aligns with Visa’s strategy of positioning itself as a central hub to bridge traditional payment methods with emerging digital assets. The focus on interoperability underscores Visa’s recognition that future payments systems may depend on the ability to route value across multiple networks, including CBDCs , cryptocurrencies, and conventional card rails. Crypto Researcher SMQKE’s tweet, accompanied by the two referenced documents, emphasizes Visa’s strategic efforts to integrate digital currencies into its settlement capabilities.

This particular price drop comes in a rather surprising period, as Ripple and its cryptocurrency have seen some enhanced adoption developments lately. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP’s Price Struggles Looking on a monthly scale, XRP managed to do the unthinkable in mid-July when it broke out of its consolidation range at around $2.2-$2.3 and shot up to a new all-time high at over $3.6 – a moment that its community had waited for over seven years. However, the subsequent correction was almost immediate and culminated last week when the asset plunged to $2.73 (on Bitstamp) as whales were disposing of large token quantities. Nevertheless, XRP bounced off in the following days and jumped to $3.1 yesterday despite some warnings by analysts. As the perma-bullish XRP Army was convinced that the $3 resistance had been conquered and turned into support, the bears reemerged and pushed the asset south. Earlier today, Ripple’s cross-border payments token dumped to $2.9, which represented a 6.5% daily decline. Despite recovering some ground since then, XRP is still 4% down on the day and is well below $3. Why So? Obviously, the most probable reason that can be listed is the overall market condition, as almost all digital assets have failed to post any substantial gains in the past several days. The global macro situation also seems quite uncertain. However, Ripple and its native token have been the subject of quite a few positive developments lately. As reported earlier today, South Korea’s BDACS announced support for XRP. Separately, rumors emerged recently that BlackRock might be joining the XRP ETF race. Last but not least, Japan’s largest banking group, SBI Japan, said in its Q2 report that it had filed to launch ETFs tracking the performance of bitcoin and XRP. Although the report was published on July 31, it reached social media channels and mainstream media in the past day or so, which should, at least in theory, positively impact the underlying asset’s price.

After two weeks of steady declines, XRP is showing signs of life. The digital asset has officially broken its downtrend streak, reclaiming the crucial $3.14 resistance level, according to market analyst Adex Crypt. Meanwhile, the $2.76 mark, previously the upper boundary of a descending channel, has flipped into solid support, indicating a shift in market sentiment. XRP's recent price action is stirring optimism among traders and investors. The asset surged past key resistance after forming a rounded bottom pattern, typically seen as a bullish reversal indicator. Volume has also ticked upward, suggesting growing confidence behind the move. However, caution still lingers in the market. ”XRP has snapped its 2-week downtrend, reclaiming the $3.14 resistance level, while $2.76 continues to hold firm as support,” Adex crypt noted . “Signs of a potential trend reversal are emerging, but is this the bulls' comeback or just a temporary bounce?” For now, XRP remains in a critical juncture as bulls try to invalidate the broader bearish structure. At the time of this writing, XRP was down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2.95, according to CoinGecko data . Corporate XRP Treasury Commitments Big players, such as Trident Digital, Webus International, VivoPower International, Wellgistics Health, Hyperscale Data, and Worksport Ltd. are moving beyond observation, they’re deploying sizable XRP allocations into their corporate treasuries. Together, these four players anchor nearly $986 million in corporate XRP commitments, with overall disclosed corporate XRPs approaching $1 billion. Institutional Commitment with Real Scale Leading the charge is Singapore‑based Nasdaq‑listed fintech firm Trident Digital Tech Holdings, which has announced plans to raise up to US $500 million to build one of the largest corporate XRP treasuries. That allocation will be used for long‑term reserves, staking, and deeper integration into the Ripple ecosystem. Close behind, Webus International is setting aside $300 million via credit lines and financing to build an XRP treasury and operationalize Ripple-based cross‑border payment solutions. Yield and Liquidity: VivoPower & Wellgistics VivoPower International has earmarked about $121 million from a recent private placement toward XRP. The company intends to stake its XRP on the Flare Network to generate yield, reinvesting that income into its treasury strategy. Meanwhile, Wellgistics Health has secured a $50 million credit line to acquire XRP, aimed at facilitating real‑time payments within its pharmaceutical distribution network and creating a strategic liquidity buffer. Data, DeFi, and Broader Use Cases Hyperscale Data Inc., through subsidiary Ault Capital Group, has committed $10 million in XRP. The goal is to support a DeFi lending platform for publicly listed firms, with loans on‑chain and hedged with futures contracts, underscoring XRP’s role as more than a store of value. Worksport Ltd. has quietly allocated around $5 million from operational cash reserves into XRP and Bitcoin with plans to start accepting XRP payments on its online platform underway, a signal of wanting to integrate crypto into both treasury and commercial operations. What It Means for Corporate Treasury Strategy This wave of allocation marks a clear pivotal point that XRP is now treated as a functional financial tool used for payments, loans, staking, and treasury diversification. Collectively, these six firms have committed nearly $1 billion toward XRP treasury programs, spanning sectors from tech and energy to healthcare and data services. Conclusion Trident, Webus, VivoPower, Wellgistics, Hyperscale Data, and Worksport aren’t sitting on the sidelines, they’re building live XRP treasury strategies. For corporations, XRP is increasingly not just an asset, but a strategic lever woven into treasury, payments, and DeFi infrastructure. Meanwhile, the coming days will be telling as XRP battles to prove whether this breakout above $2.76 has real legs, or is merely a pause before the next leg down.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|TREASURY|FLR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 09:33:08

Yet, the actions taken by these financial behemoths to manage national currency values, such as the Swiss Franc strength , create profound ripples across global financial markets. These ripples can indirectly influence everything from traditional forex trading to the broader risk sentiment that shapes the digital asset space. A recent analyst statement has brought the SNB’s proactive stance into sharp focus, suggesting the bank is poised to act, likely to prevent further “excessive CHF strength” in the near term. This isn’t just a technical detail for forex enthusiasts; it’s a critical signal about Switzerland’s economic health, its strategic positioning in the global economy, and the SNB’s unwavering commitment to its monetary policy objectives. But why is the SNB so determined to manage the Swiss Franc’s value, and what does this mean for the intricate currency market dynamics that impact global finance? SNB Intervention: A Proactive Stance Against Unwanted Strength The Swiss National Bank holds a unique position among central banks due to its long and often unconventional history of intervention in the foreign exchange market. While many central banks primarily intervene to prevent currency weakness that could fuel inflation, the SNB frequently steps in to curb excessive Swiss Franc strength . This proactive, almost defensive, approach is a cornerstone of their monetary policy , aiming to stabilize the economy, manage inflationary pressures, and protect the competitiveness of Swiss industries. Historical Context and Past Actions: 2011 Euro Zone Crisis: Faced with massive safe-haven inflows during the European sovereign debt crisis, the SNB implemented a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss Francs per Euro. This was an unprecedented move, effectively pegging the CHF to the EUR to prevent its runaway appreciation. 2015 Unpegging: The abrupt removal of this peg in January 2015 sent shockwaves through global markets, demonstrating the SNB’s willingness to make bold, decisive moves when its policy framework is challenged. The unpegging led to a massive, sudden appreciation of the CHF, highlighting the inherent pressure for its value to rise. Post-2015 Interventions: Following the unpegging, the SNB continued to intervene, primarily through foreign exchange purchases, to counter the franc’s strength, often accumulating vast foreign currency reserves in the process. The SNB’s Toolkit for Intervention: The SNB employs a range of tools to influence the Swiss Franc’s value. While direct market intervention is often the most visible, other policy instruments play a crucial supporting role: Foreign Exchange Sales/Purchases: This is the most direct method. To weaken the CHF, the SNB sells CHF and buys foreign currencies (like EUR or USD) in the open market. This increases the supply of CHF, theoretically reducing its value. Conversely, to strengthen the CHF (less common, but possible), they would buy CHF and sell foreign currency. Interest Rate Adjustments: While interest rates are primarily set to achieve price stability, their impact on the exchange rate is undeniable. Very low or negative interest rates, which the SNB employed for years, make holding CHF less attractive, discouraging capital inflows and thus reducing upward pressure on the currency. Recent rate hikes by the SNB have made the CHF more attractive, creating a new dynamic where direct intervention might become more necessary if appreciation becomes excessive. Verbal Intervention (Jawboning): Often overlooked but highly effective, verbal intervention involves SNB officials making statements or issuing warnings about their discomfort with the CHF’s level. This can influence market expectations and discourage speculative buying, acting as a low-cost, preliminary tool before direct market action. The analyst’s statement suggests that despite recent rate hikes aimed at combating inflation, the SNB perceives a renewed risk of the CHF appreciating too rapidly. This could stem from its persistent safe-haven appeal or a shift in global risk sentiment, prompting the SNB to signal its readiness for further SNB intervention . Why Does Excessive Swiss Franc Strength Pose a Challenge? While a strong national currency might intuitively seem like a sign of economic health and prosperity, for an export-oriented economy like Switzerland, an overly strong Swiss Franc strength can be profoundly detrimental. The SNB’s constant vigilance against it stems from several critical economic impacts: Impact on Exports: Switzerland is renowned for its high-value exports, including pharmaceuticals, machinery, watches, and precision instruments. When the CHF strengthens, Swiss goods become more expensive for international buyers. This reduces demand, erodes profit margins for Swiss exporters, and can lead to reduced production, job losses, and a decline in export revenues, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Tourism Sector Woes: Switzerland is a premier global tourist destination. An overly strong CHF makes holidays, accommodation, and services significantly more expensive for foreign visitors. This deters tourists, leading to lower occupancy rates for hotels, reduced spending in retail and hospitality, and a decline in overall tourism revenue. Deflationary Pressures: A stronger CHF makes imported goods and services cheaper in local currency terms. While this might seem beneficial for consumers in the short term, if persistent, it can contribute to lower inflation or even outright deflation. Deflation can stifle economic growth by discouraging spending and investment, as consumers postpone purchases anticipating even lower prices in the future. The SNB actively combats deflation to maintain price stability. Safe-Haven Dilemma: In times of global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or financial market turmoil, the CHF is often sought after as a safe-haven currency. This leads to massive capital inflows into Switzerland, pushing the CHF’s value up undesirably from the SNB’s perspective. This inherent safe-haven appeal often works against the SNB’s desired currency level, creating a constant battle between market forces and policy objectives. To illustrate the conflicting impacts of a strong CHF, consider the table below: Stakeholder/Perspective Benefits of Strong CHF Challenges of Strong CHF Swiss Consumers Cheaper imports, higher purchasing power abroad for travel and goods. Potential job losses in export and tourism sectors; overall economic slowdown. Swiss Exporters N/A (Generally negative impact on competitiveness and profitability). Reduced competitiveness, lower profits, potential for production cuts and layoffs. Swiss Tourism Industry N/A (Generally negative impact on visitor numbers and revenue). Higher costs for international visitors, deterring tourism and reducing revenue. SNB (Monetary Policy) Helps curb imported inflation; reinforces stability image. Creates deflationary pressure, harms economic growth targets, complicates interest rate policy. Global Investors Safe-haven asset during crises; preservation of capital. Lower yield potential (due to low/negative rates), less attractive for carry trades. What’s the Current CHF Outlook? Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment The current CHF outlook is a subject of intense debate among financial analysts and market participants. While Switzerland’s robust economic fundamentals, low public debt, and political stability inherently support the franc’s value, the market is increasingly pricing in the likelihood of proactive SNB intervention to prevent runaway appreciation. Diverging Views: Some analysts, focusing on Switzerland’s relative economic strength and lower inflation compared to the Eurozone or the US, predict continued modest appreciation for the CHF. They argue that higher interest rates globally might not be enough to offset the franc’s intrinsic safe-haven appeal. However, a growing number of strategists emphasize the SNB’s clear and consistent communication that it stands ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market if deemed necessary. This creates a ceiling for how much the CHF can appreciate without triggering a response. Key Influencers on the CHF Outlook: The trajectory of the Swiss Franc will be heavily influenced by a confluence of factors: Global Risk Sentiment: Escalations in geopolitical tensions (e.g., conflicts, trade wars) or signs of a global economic slowdown will likely increase demand for safe havens, including the CHF. Interest Rate Differentials: The difference in interest rates between Switzerland and major economies like the Eurozone and the US plays a role. If other central banks pause or cut rates while the SNB maintains its stance, it could make the CHF relatively more attractive. Switzerland’s Domestic Inflation Trajectory: If Swiss inflation remains stubbornly low or falls significantly, it gives the SNB more leeway to intervene to weaken the CHF without jeopardizing its price stability mandate. Conversely, if inflation rises, the SNB might be less inclined to intervene to weaken the currency, as it would exacerbate inflationary pressures. The market’s perception of the SNB’s ‘pain threshold’ for CHF strength is crucial. Analysts are constantly trying to decipher at what level the SNB would feel compelled to act more forcefully, whether through direct FX sales or a shift in its interest rate guidance. The SNB’s Monetary Policy: A Balancing Act for Currency Value The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy is inextricably linked to its currency management strategy. The primary overarching goal of the SNB is to ensure price stability, defined as an annual inflation rate between 0% and 2%. Achieving this often involves navigating the complex relationship between interest rates, inflation, and the exchange rate. Interest Rates as a Primary Tool: For years, the SNB maintained negative interest rates to combat deflationary pressures and curb the CHF’s strength. While they have recently shifted away from negative rates, their rate decisions are always made with an acute awareness of their potential impact on the CHF. Higher rates generally make a currency more attractive, supporting its value. However, if the SNB deems the resulting appreciation excessive and detrimental to its price stability or economic growth goals, they might signal a pause in hikes, or even a future cut, or intensify direct foreign exchange interventions. Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate: The exchange rate is a significant channel through which inflation is transmitted to the Swiss economy. A strong CHF makes imports cheaper, directly reducing imported inflation. While this can help the SNB meet its inflation target if domestic prices are rising, an overly strong CHF can lead to deflationary pressures that are harder to combat, especially if domestic demand is weak. The SNB must carefully balance these forces. Communication as a Policy Instrument: The SNB places immense importance on clear and consistent communication. Their monetary policy assessments, press conferences, and speeches by SNB officials are meticulously scrutinized by markets. The SNB often uses ‘verbal intervention’ or ‘jawboning’ to signal its discomfort with the CHF’s level. This communication, even without direct market action, can effectively influence market expectations and discourage speculative buying, acting as a critical, low-cost tool in their arsenal to manage currency market dynamics . The SNB’s commitment to maintaining its policy independence and its focus on domestic price stability means it will continue to use all available tools, including FX interventions, to manage the Swiss Franc strength in line with its overall economic objectives. Navigating Currency Market Dynamics: Ripple Effects and Trader Insights The SNB’s actions, or even just their credible signals of intent, have significant implications for global currency market dynamics . Traders, investors, and businesses operating internationally closely watch the SNB for cues, as its policy decisions can lead to substantial shifts in exchange rates and market sentiment. Direct Impact on Key Currency Pairs: The most immediate impact is seen on CHF-related currency pairs, particularly EUR/CHF and USD/CHF. A strong signal from the SNB about preventing excessive CHF strength would typically lead to a weakening of the CHF against these major currencies, meaning EUR/CHF and USD/CHF would likely move higher. Conversely, if the SNB were to signal comfort with a stronger franc (less likely in the current context), these pairs would likely move lower. Volatility and Trading Opportunities: Periods surrounding SNB monetary policy announcements or analyst statements suggesting intervention can lead to increased volatility in CHF pairs. This presents both heightened risks and potential opportunities for forex traders who can anticipate or react quickly to these shifts. Understanding the SNB’s historical patterns and communication style is key to navigating these periods. Global Spillover Effects: While Switzerland is a relatively small economy, its status as a financial hub and the CHF’s safe-haven role mean that SNB actions can have broader implications. For instance, a weakening CHF (due to SNB intervention) might reduce some of the safe-haven demand that could otherwise flow into other currencies like the Japanese Yen or the US Dollar. Moreover, the SNB’s willingness to use unconventional tools like direct FX intervention can serve as a case study or even a precedent for other central banks facing similar currency appreciation pressures. Indirect Influence on Broader Markets (including Crypto): While not a direct cause-and-effect, central bank actions like SNB intervention influence overall market liquidity, risk appetite, and the cost of capital. When central banks provide clear policy signals, it can reduce uncertainty in traditional markets, potentially leading to a more stable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unexpected central bank moves or increased volatility in major fiat currencies can spill over into crypto markets as investors seek or shed risk. For participants in global finance, understanding the SNB’s likely next steps is not just an academic exercise; it’s a practical necessity for managing exposure and identifying potential trading opportunities in the ever-evolving landscape of currency market dynamics . Challenges and Considerations for the SNB Despite its formidable toolkit, the SNB faces several inherent challenges in its mission to manage Swiss Franc strength effectively: Global Uncertainty and Safe-Haven Flows: Geopolitical events, global economic slowdowns, or financial crises inevitably drive capital towards safe havens. The CHF’s status as a premier safe haven means that these external shocks can trigger massive inflows, making it incredibly difficult for the SNB to contain its appreciation without resorting to large-scale, potentially costly interventions. Policy Space and Reserve Accumulation: While the SNB has ample reserves, there are practical limits to how much it can intervene without distorting domestic markets or accumulating an unsustainably large balance sheet. Large foreign currency holdings also expose the SNB to valuation risks. Communication Credibility: The SNB must maintain its credibility. If markets believe the SNB is bluffing or unwilling to act decisively, its verbal interventions become less effective, forcing it into more costly direct market actions. Inflation vs. Growth Dilemma: The SNB constantly walks a tightrope between achieving its price stability mandate (combating inflation/deflation) and supporting economic growth. Intervening to weaken the CHF can help exporters but might fuel imported inflation, creating a policy conflict. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders For those operating in traditional forex markets, or simply observing broader financial trends that can influence cryptocurrency sentiment, understanding the SNB’s likely actions is crucial: Monitor SNB Statements Closely: Pay meticulous attention to SNB press conferences, quarterly monetary policy assessments, and speeches by SNB officials. Look for any nuanced language or shifts in tone regarding their comfort level with the CHF’s exchange rate. Key phrases indicating overvaluation or readiness to intervene are critical. Watch Key Swiss Economic Data: Swiss inflation figures, GDP growth, and export performance can provide vital clues about the SNB’s likely next moves. Weak economic data or persistent low inflation might give the SNB more justification to intervene against CHF strength. Observe EUR/CHF as a Barometer: The EUR/CHF currency pair is often considered a direct barometer of SNB intervention sentiment. A sustained move below certain levels (e.g., 0.95 or 0.96) might trigger more aggressive SNB action, as this indicates significant CHF strength against its largest trading partner’s currency. Consider Global Risk Appetite: Keep an eye on global risk indicators. If global uncertainty rises, expect renewed safe-haven flows into CHF, potentially prompting an SNB response. Conversely, a ‘risk-on’ environment might naturally ease some of the upward pressure on the franc. Conclusion The analyst’s view regarding the Swiss National Bank’s likely actions underscores the institution’s unwavering commitment to preventing excessive Swiss Franc strength . This proactive approach, deeply embedded in their monetary policy framework, is absolutely crucial for maintaining Switzerland’s economic stability, supporting its vital export and tourism sectors, and managing inflation effectively. While the CHF’s intrinsic safe-haven appeal and Switzerland’s robust economic fundamentals will continue to exert upward pressure, the SNB stands ready to utilize its comprehensive arsenal of tools to navigate the complex currency market dynamics . For investors and traders alike, understanding the SNB’s likely actions and their potential ripple effects is vital for making informed decisions in an interconnected global financial landscape. The SNB’s decisive moves will continue to shape the CHF outlook and influence broader market sentiment, making it a central bank to watch closely in the coming months.

Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy has also confirmed the firm is exploring stablecoin launch options , potentially enabling real-time funding for brokerage accounts. The $110 billion market value company serves nearly 3.9 million customers and already supports crypto trading through partnerships with Paxos and Zero Hash. Payments processor @remitly will soon integrate stablecoins into its global network, aiming to speed up and reduce the cost of international money transfers. #Remitly #Stablecoins https://t.co/VCG75mundR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Most recently, Remitly launched beta testing for its multi-currency digital wallet supporting both fiat and stablecoins , with live deployment scheduled for September. The Seattle-based fintech added stablecoin payout options through Bridge, a Stripe-owned infrastructure provider, while integrating USDC into internal treasury operations. All these corporate adoptions come as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged the significance of stablecoins, noting that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is linked to the US dollar. The federation believed that “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by making it more accessible worldwide. Corporate Giants Defy New Regulations While Adoption Accelerates Coinbase and PayPal continue offering stablecoin yield programs despite the GENIUS Act provisions explicitly banning interest payments from stablecoin issuers. Both companies argue the restrictions don’t apply because they operate as intermediaries rather than direct issuers of the stablecoins they reward. @Coinbase and @PayPal are pushing forward with stablecoin yield programs, despite new US legislation banning such incentives for issuers. #Coinbase #PayPal https://t.co/F4bTmQbl6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated, “We are not the issuer,” while defending the company’s 4.1% APY rewards on USDC holdings. Though Coinbase co-developed USDC with Circle, it ceased formal issuing responsibilities in 2023, with Circle now serving as the sole issuer without offering direct yield. PayPal offers 3.7% annual returns on PYUSD holdings through both PayPal and Venmo platforms. While PYUSD bears PayPal’s name, technical issuance by third-party firm Paxos allows PayPal to claim exemption from GENIUS Act restrictions. Previously, Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that private stablecoin launches could create privacy invasions and systemic risks, predicting companies would “come begging for bailout when it inevitably blows up.” Despite criticism, global corporations, including Amazon, Walmart, JD.com, and Alipay , continue exploring stablecoin integration. The competitive stablecoin space has intensified with approximately 20 million addresses now transacting with stablecoins on public blockchains. MetaMask’s proposed entry would leverage its massive user base and Stripe’s compliance infrastructure to claim its share of the market.

Many investors are observing a peculiar holding pattern in the crypto market. However, a significant shift might be on the horizon, not from internal market dynamics, but from a powerful external force: global liquidity . This vital economic indicator could soon become the primary catalyst for the next major BTC trend , offering a fresh perspective on the crypto market outlook . Let’s dive into how M2 money supply specifically plays a crucial role in this anticipated movement. Why Is Bitcoin Price Experiencing a Holding Pattern? Currently, Bitcoin price is trading sideways, leading to a period of consolidation. According to Negentropic, the insightful X account run by Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel, the market finds itself in a peculiar equilibrium. Sellers, it appears, have exhausted their available ‘ammo,’ while buyers remain largely inactive. This creates a stalemate, preventing any significant upward or downward movement. This observation highlights a crucial point: the market needs an external push. Without new capital flowing in or out, the existing supply and demand dynamics keep prices relatively stable. Therefore, understanding the broader economic picture becomes essential for anticipating the next big move in the BTC trend . How Global Liquidity and M2 Money Supply Drive the Next BTC Trend The key to unlocking Bitcoin’s next direction lies within global liquidity , particularly the M2 money supply. Negentropic emphasizes that only a change in global M2 money supply can truly alter the current market trajectory. This economic metric represents the total amount of money circulating within an economy, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. In the cryptocurrency world, a widely held belief suggests that Bitcoin price movements often lag behind changes in M2 supply. Historically, when M2 liquidity expands, it eventually trickles into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, pushing prices higher. Conversely, a contraction in M2 can lead to downward pressure. Intriguingly, Negentropic forecasts that M2 liquidity is expected to begin rising in approximately four days from their analysis. This projection aligns with the historical correlation, suggesting a potential positive impact on the crypto market outlook soon. What Does the M2 Money Supply Data Reveal for the Crypto Market Outlook? Data from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) provides a clear picture of recent M2 movements. For instance, M2 peaked at 22,055.1 on April 14 and stood at 22,005.4 as of July 30. While these figures represent a slight dip from the peak, the anticipated rise in M2 could reverse this trend, potentially fueling the next leg up for the Bitcoin price . Investors should pay close attention to these liquidity flows. An increase in global liquidity typically signals more capital available for investment, which can boost demand across various asset classes, including digital assets. Monitoring M2 supply data, therefore, becomes a crucial part of any informed investment strategy in the crypto space. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin price is in a consolidation phase due to balanced buying and selling pressure. Global liquidity , specifically M2 money supply, is the critical external factor expected to drive the next market shift. M2 is projected to start rising soon, historically preceding positive movements in Bitcoin price . Monitoring M2 data from sources like FRED is vital for understanding the future crypto market outlook and anticipating the next BTC trend . In conclusion, while the current Bitcoin price action might seem uninspiring, the underlying economic currents are setting the stage for what could be a significant move. The impending rise in global liquidity , particularly the M2 money supply, positions itself as the primary catalyst. By keeping a close eye on these macroeconomic indicators, investors can better navigate the evolving crypto market outlook and prepare for the next definitive BTC trend . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is M2 money supply? A1: M2 money supply is a broad measure of the money circulating in an economy. It includes physical cash, checking accounts, and easily convertible financial assets like savings deposits, money market mutual funds, and small-denomination time deposits. Q2: How does M2 money supply impact Bitcoin price? A2: A common theory in crypto markets suggests that an increase in M2 money supply often leads to more capital seeking investment opportunities. A portion of this capital tends to flow into riskier assets like Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price, often with a slight lag. Q3: Who are Negentropic? A3: Negentropic is the X (formerly Twitter) account of Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel. They provide on-chain and macroeconomic analysis for cryptocurrency markets. Q4: When is M2 liquidity expected to start rising, according to Negentropic? A4: Negentropic’s analysis indicates that M2 liquidity is expected to begin rising in approximately four days from their initial observation, suggesting an imminent change in the liquidity landscape. Q5: What is the current status of the Bitcoin price and BTC trend? A5: The Bitcoin price is currently in a holding pattern, trading sideways. The BTC trend is awaiting a significant external catalyst, primarily from global liquidity flows, to determine its next major direction. Did you find this analysis helpful?

For those of us navigating the exciting, yet volatile, landscape of cryptocurrencies, it’s crucial to remember that macro trends in traditional finance, especially concerning major currencies like the US Dollar (USD), often dictate broader market sentiment and liquidity. Recently, a significant insight from UBS has caught the attention of market watchers: they see compelling opportunities in selling USD upside . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how can you position yourself to potentially benefit? Decoding the USD Upside : Why UBS Sees Opportunity in Selling? When UBS talks about “selling USD upside,” they are not necessarily predicting a catastrophic collapse of the dollar. Instead, they are signaling a belief that the dollar’s recent strength, or its potential for further significant gains, is limited. This perspective suggests that the risk-reward profile for betting on continued dollar appreciation is unfavorable, and that opportunities lie in positioning for either a consolidation, a modest decline, or a slower pace of appreciation against other major currencies. Essentially, it’s about capitalizing on the idea that the dollar’s rally may be running out of steam. Why this shift in outlook? Several factors contribute to UBS’s strategic view: Peak Interest Rates? The US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hiking cycle has been a primary driver of dollar strength. However, as inflation shows signs of cooling and the Fed signals a potential pause or even future cuts, the interest rate differential favoring the USD might narrow. Global Growth Rebalancing: While the US economy has shown resilience, other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, are starting to show signs of recovery or stabilization. This could lead to a rebalancing of global growth expectations, reducing the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. Valuation Concerns: After a period of strong performance, the dollar may be considered overvalued against some currencies, making it ripe for a correction or mean reversion. For investors, this insight is a call to re-evaluate their currency exposures. It’s about recognizing that the easy gains from a relentlessly strong dollar might be behind us, and that a more nuanced approach is now required to find profitable avenues in the currency market. Forex Market Analysis : Unpacking the Drivers of Dollar Dynamics UBS’s stance on the dollar is rooted in a comprehensive Forex market analysis that considers a multitude of economic and geopolitical factors. The currency market, the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, is a complex interplay of interest rates, economic growth, inflation, trade balances, and investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial to interpreting any institutional outlook. Key elements that UBS likely scrutinizes include: Monetary Policy Divergence: The actions of central banks globally are paramount. While the Fed has been hawkish, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have adopted different paces. As these policies converge or diverge, they directly impact currency valuations. UBS is likely forecasting a narrowing gap in policy stances, which would reduce the dollar’s relative attractiveness. Economic Data: Employment figures, GDP growth, retail sales, and manufacturing data from major economies provide a snapshot of economic health. Stronger data from other regions relative to the US could shift capital flows away from the dollar. Geopolitical Stability: In times of global uncertainty, the dollar traditionally acts as a safe haven. If geopolitical tensions ease, or if new areas of stability emerge, the demand for the dollar as a safe asset might diminish. Consider this simplified comparison of key factors influencing major currency pairs: Factor US Dollar (USD) Euro (EUR) Japanese Yen (JPY) Interest Rate Outlook Peak/Potential Cuts Continued Hikes (slower) Ultra-loose (potential shift) Inflation Trend Decelerating Sticky, but decelerating Rising (from low base) Economic Growth Resilient, but slowing Improving, but fragile Modest recovery Safe Haven Appeal High (decreasing) Moderate (increasing) High (traditional) UBS’s analysis likely suggests that the factors that have historically supported dollar strength are either losing momentum or are being counterbalanced by improving conditions elsewhere. This nuanced view is essential for developing effective currency trading strategies . Currency Trading Strategies : Navigating the Waters of Dollar Weakness If UBS sees opportunities in selling USD upside , what practical currency trading strategies can investors consider? It’s not about making reckless bets, but about strategic positioning to benefit from anticipated shifts in currency valuations. Here are some approaches to explore: Shorting the Dollar Against Stronger Counterparts: This is the most direct approach. If the dollar is expected to weaken, one would sell USD and buy a currency expected to appreciate. Common candidates include: EUR/USD: As the European economy potentially strengthens and the ECB continues its tightening cycle (even if at a slower pace), the euro could gain against the dollar. JPY/USD: The Bank of Japan has maintained ultra-loose monetary policy for an extended period. Any shift towards tightening, or even a hint of it, could lead to significant yen appreciation. GBP/USD: While the UK economy faces its own challenges, if inflation proves persistent and the Bank of England maintains a hawkish stance longer than the Fed, the pound could find support. Utilizing Options and Derivatives: For more sophisticated investors, options contracts can offer leveraged exposure with defined risk. Buying put options on the USD or selling call options against it can be ways to express a bearish dollar view. Futures contracts also provide a way to gain exposure to currency movements. Hedging Existing USD Exposure: For businesses or investors with significant assets denominated in USD, a strategy to sell USD upside could involve hedging. This protects against potential losses if the dollar weakens, safeguarding the value of their dollar-denominated assets when converted back to their base currency. Diversifying Portfolios Away from USD-Centric Assets: Beyond direct currency trades, investors can indirectly express a view on dollar weakness by increasing allocations to assets that typically perform well when the dollar is declining. This could include: Commodities (like gold and oil, often priced in USD). Emerging market equities and bonds (which often benefit from a weaker dollar as it eases their dollar-denominated debt burden). Non-US developed market equities. It’s crucial to remember that any trading strategy involves risk. Proper risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and understanding position sizing, is paramount. Always align your strategy with your risk tolerance and investment goals. The Broader UBS Outlook : A Comprehensive Economic Perspective The UBS outlook on the dollar is not an isolated prediction; it’s part of a broader, holistic view of the global economy. Their analysis encompasses everything from inflation trajectories and central bank responses to geopolitical developments and shifts in global trade dynamics. This comprehensive approach is what lends weight to their specific currency calls. What are the underlying pillars of this broader UBS perspective that inform their dollar stance? Inflationary Dynamics: UBS likely anticipates that global inflation, while still elevated, is on a decelerating path. This expectation reduces the urgency for central banks, including the Fed, to maintain ultra-tight monetary policies, thereby diminishing the allure of high-yielding dollar assets. Recessionary Risks: While a hard landing might be avoided, UBS may foresee a period of slower growth or a mild recession in key economies. Such an environment could prompt central banks to ease monetary policy, which typically weighs on a currency’s value. Global Liquidity and Capital Flows: As global growth rebalances, capital flows might diversify away from the US. If other regions offer more attractive investment opportunities or yield prospects, the demand for dollar-denominated assets could wane, contributing to dollar weakness . China’s Reopening and Impact: The reopening of China’s economy has significant implications for global growth and trade. A stronger Chinese economy could boost demand for commodities and other currencies, potentially diverting capital from the dollar. This multi-faceted analysis forms the bedrock of UBS’s confidence in identifying opportunities to sell USD upside . They are not merely looking at interest rates in isolation but considering the complex web of interconnected global economic forces. Dollar Weakness : Implications Across Global Markets and Beyond A period of sustained dollar weakness , as anticipated by UBS’s strategic view, would have profound implications far beyond just currency trading. Its effects would ripple through various asset classes and global economies, indirectly influencing even the cryptocurrency market. Here are some key implications: Commodity Prices: Commodities like oil, gold, and industrial metals are typically priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, thereby increasing demand and potentially pushing up their prices. This could be a boon for commodity-exporting nations and related companies. Emerging Markets (EM): Many emerging market countries and corporations have significant dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar reduces the cost of servicing this debt, freeing up capital and potentially boosting economic growth in these regions. This often leads to increased investor interest in EM equities and bonds. US Corporate Earnings: For US multinational corporations, a weaker dollar means that their earnings generated overseas, when converted back into dollars, are worth more. This can provide a boost to their profitability and stock performance. Global Trade: A weaker dollar makes US exports more competitive on the global stage, potentially boosting American manufacturing and trade balances. Conversely, imports become more expensive. Indirect Impact on Crypto: While not a direct cause-and-effect, a weaker dollar can indirectly benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. When the dollar is strong, it often acts as a safe haven, drawing capital away from more speculative assets. If the dollar weakens, investors might be more inclined to seek higher returns in riskier ventures, potentially channeling funds into the crypto market. Additionally, a weaker dollar could signal a period of greater global liquidity, which has historically been supportive of crypto valuations. Understanding these broader implications is vital for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the shifts predicted by institutions like UBS. It’s about seeing the bigger picture beyond just the immediate currency pair. Potential Challenges and Risks to the UBS Outlook While UBS’s analysis of opportunities in selling USD upside is compelling, it’s crucial for savvy investors to acknowledge that no market prediction is without its risks. The financial landscape is constantly evolving, and unforeseen events can quickly alter even the most well-reasoned outlooks. Here are some potential challenges and risks that could impact the anticipated dollar weakness: Unexpected Fed Hawkishness: Should US inflation prove more persistent than anticipated, or if the US economy continues to outperform global peers, the Federal Reserve might be forced to maintain higher interest rates for longer, or even resume rate hikes. This would provide renewed support for the dollar, defying expectations of significant weakness. Global Economic Slowdown: A severe downturn in the global economy, perhaps triggered by a major geopolitical event or a deeper-than-expected recession in China or Europe, could trigger a flight to safety. In such scenarios, the US dollar traditionally acts as the ultimate safe-haven currency, leading to renewed strength despite other factors. Geopolitical Black Swans: Unforeseen geopolitical conflicts, major political instability, or significant global crises could dramatically increase demand for the dollar as a safe asset, irrespective of economic fundamentals. Investors tend to flock to the perceived safety and liquidity of US treasuries and the dollar during times of extreme uncertainty. Divergent Central Bank Policies: While UBS might anticipate a convergence of central bank policies, a renewed divergence, where other central banks (like the ECB or BoJ) become unexpectedly more dovish or the Fed remains significantly more hawkish, could alter currency dynamics. Data Surprises: Key economic data releases, such as surprisingly strong US jobs reports, higher-than-expected inflation figures, or robust retail sales, could challenge the narrative of impending dollar weakness and lead to a rebound. Investors should continuously monitor these factors and be prepared to adjust their strategies. A flexible approach, rather than rigid adherence to a single forecast, is key to navigating the volatile currency markets. Actionable Insights for Savvy Investors Given UBS’s strategic insights into selling USD upside , how can individual investors and those interested in the broader financial ecosystem take actionable steps? It’s about informed decision-making and strategic positioning: Stay Informed on Macro Trends: Regularly follow economic news, central bank statements, and global geopolitical developments. Understand how these factors influence currency valuations and broader market sentiment. Pay particular attention to inflation data and interest rate expectations. Evaluate Your Currency Exposure: Assess your existing portfolio for direct or indirect dollar exposure. Do you hold a lot of USD-denominated assets? Are your international investments hedged against currency fluctuations? Understanding your current positioning is the first step. Consider Diversification: If your portfolio is heavily concentrated in dollar-denominated assets, explore opportunities to diversify into other major currencies or asset classes that tend to perform well during periods of dollar weakness, such as commodities or certain emerging market assets. Explore Specific FX Strategies: For those comfortable with currency trading, research and consider strategies like shorting the dollar against potentially stronger currencies (e.g., EUR, JPY) or utilizing currency-related ETFs or options for managed exposure. Consult Financial Professionals: If you’re unsure about how to implement these strategies or assess your risk, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Monitor Institutional Outlooks: Keep an eye on reports and analyses from leading financial institutions like UBS. While not infallible, their research can offer valuable insights and help you anticipate market shifts. The opportunity to capitalize on shifts in currency dynamics is not just for institutional traders. With careful research and a strategic mindset, individual investors can also position themselves to potentially benefit from anticipated dollar weakness. Conclusion: Seizing the Strategic Opportunity in a Shifting Dollar Landscape UBS’s insightful perspective on selling USD upside offers a compelling narrative for investors navigating today’s complex financial markets. It signals a potential pivot point for the US Dollar, moving from a period of dominant strength to one where opportunities lie in positioning for consolidation or even decline. This outlook is rooted in a comprehensive Forex market analysis , considering factors like peak interest rates, global growth rebalancing, and valuation concerns. By understanding these dynamics and exploring strategic currency trading strategies , investors can prepare for potential shifts. The broader UBS outlook suggests that the forces that have propelled the dollar are losing momentum, leading to implications such as higher commodity prices, stronger emerging markets, and potentially a more favorable environment for risk assets, including an indirect boost for crypto. While risks always exist, recognizing the potential for dollar weakness allows for proactive portfolio adjustments. For savvy investors, this isn’t a call for panic, but rather an invitation to strategically re-evaluate and optimize their exposure in a constantly evolving global economy.

For those accustomed to the wild swings of Bitcoin and Ethereum, understanding the more measured yet significant movements in the Forex market can offer valuable insights into broader economic trends and even potential hedges or opportunities. Recently, a significant EUR/USD forecast has emerged from global financial giant UBS, predicting a notable strengthening of the Euro against the US Dollar, targeting the 1.20 mark. This development isn’t just a headline for traditional traders; it signals shifts in global economic power dynamics that can indirectly influence sentiment and capital flows across all asset classes, including digital assets. What’s Driving the UBS EUR/USD Forecast? UBS, a leading global financial services company, has put forth a compelling case for the Euro’s appreciation against the US Dollar. Their EUR/USD forecast of 1.20 is not merely an arbitrary number; it is rooted in a comprehensive analysis of macroeconomic factors, central bank policies, and evolving market sentiment. The primary drivers underpinning this optimistic outlook for the Euro include: European Central Bank (ECB) Policy: The ECB has maintained a hawkish stance, indicating a commitment to combat inflation through sustained interest rate hikes. This contrasts with expectations for the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is perceived to be nearing the end of its tightening cycle or even contemplating rate cuts in the near future. Higher interest rates in the Eurozone make Euro-denominated assets more attractive to international investors, increasing demand for the currency. Diverging Economic Performance: While the US economy shows signs of slowing, with concerns about a potential recession lingering, the Eurozone has demonstrated resilience. Despite initial fears, the region has largely navigated the energy crisis and is showing signs of steady, albeit modest, growth. This relative economic stability enhances the Euro’s appeal. Energy Price Normalization: The significant drop in natural gas prices from their 2022 peaks has provided a substantial tailwind for the Eurozone economy. Reduced energy costs alleviate inflationary pressures and improve the region’s terms of trade, boosting the Euro’s fundamental strength. Current Account Balance Improvement: The Eurozone’s current account balance has shown a marked improvement, shifting from deficit to surplus. This positive development indicates stronger external demand for Eurozone goods and services, contributing to capital inflows and supporting the Euro. UBS’s analysis suggests that these factors collectively create a robust environment for the Euro to gain ground. The market’s anticipation of these shifts often precedes the actual economic data, driving currency movements. Understanding the Euro USD Exchange Rate Dynamics The Euro USD exchange rate is a reflection of the economic health, monetary policy, and geopolitical stability of two of the world’s largest economic blocs: the Eurozone and the United States. Its movements are influenced by a complex interplay of forces. Historically, the EUR/USD pair has seen significant fluctuations, reacting to major global events from financial crises to trade wars. Currently, the dynamics are largely shaped by: Factor Impact on Euro (EUR) Impact on US Dollar (USD) Interest Rate Differentials Higher rates attract capital, strengthening EUR. Lower rates or rate cut expectations reduce USD appeal. Economic Growth Stronger growth signals a healthy economy, supporting EUR. Slowing growth or recession fears weaken USD. Inflation Outlook Persistent inflation may lead to more ECB hikes, boosting EUR. Declining inflation may signal Fed pause/cuts, weakening USD. Geopolitical Stability Increased stability in Europe enhances investor confidence in EUR. Global risk-off sentiment often favors USD as a safe haven. The interplay of these factors creates a dynamic environment for the Euro USD exchange rate , making it one of the most actively traded currency pairs globally. Traders and investors constantly monitor economic data releases, central bank speeches, and geopolitical developments to anticipate future movements. A Deeper Dive into Forex Market Analysis: Beyond the Headlines For any serious participant in the Forex market, a superficial understanding of news headlines is insufficient. A thorough Forex market analysis involves both fundamental and technical approaches. Fundamental analysis focuses on economic data, government policies, and geopolitical events that affect currency values. Technical analysis, on the other hand, involves studying price charts and indicators to identify patterns and predict future price movements. Fundamental Factors Driving EUR/USD: Central Bank Divergence: The differing paths of the ECB and the Fed are paramount. The ECB’s continued focus on fighting inflation, even at the risk of slower growth, supports a stronger Euro. Conversely, the Fed’s potential pivot towards easing, driven by concerns about economic slowdown or financial stability, could weigh on the Dollar. Economic Resilience: The Eurozone’s ability to withstand various shocks, including the energy crisis and high inflation, has surprised many analysts. Indicators like Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, industrial production, and consumer confidence surveys are closely watched for signs of sustained recovery. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: A country or bloc with a persistent trade surplus tends to see its currency appreciate as foreign demand for its goods and services translates into demand for its currency. Similarly, robust foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows can strengthen a currency. Technical Considerations: From a technical perspective, the EUR/USD pair has shown a tendency to respect key support and resistance levels. A move towards 1.20 would represent a significant breach of recent trading ranges and could trigger further momentum buying. Traders often look for: Breakouts: A clear break above a resistance level, like the 1.10 or 1.12 marks, often signals strong bullish momentum. Moving Averages: Crossovers of short-term and long-term moving averages can indicate shifts in trend. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions, providing potential entry or exit signals. Combining both fundamental and technical Forex market analysis provides a more robust framework for making informed trading decisions. However, the market is also susceptible to sudden shifts based on unexpected news or sentiment changes. The Shifting Sands: What’s Next for the USD Outlook? The other side of the EUR/USD equation is the US Dollar. A strengthening Euro inherently implies a weakening US Dollar, at least in relative terms. The current USD outlook is influenced by several factors that suggest a period of depreciation, especially against major currencies like the Euro. Federal Reserve Policy Pivot: The market widely anticipates that the Fed is either at or very near the end of its tightening cycle. Future rate hikes are likely to be limited, and discussions about potential rate cuts in late 2024 or 2025 are gaining traction. This dovish shift in monetary policy would reduce the yield advantage of US assets, making the Dollar less attractive. Inflation Deceleration: While inflation remains above the Fed’s target, there are clear signs of disinflation across various sectors of the US economy. This reduction in price pressures gives the Fed more room to ease its monetary policy without risking a resurgence of inflation. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Despite a resilient labor market, other economic indicators suggest a slowdown in the US economy. Manufacturing activity has contracted, and consumer spending, while robust, faces headwinds from high interest rates and persistent inflation. A significant slowdown or recession would typically lead to a weaker Dollar. Growing US Debt: The rising US national debt and fiscal deficits are long-term concerns that can weigh on the Dollar. While not an immediate trigger for depreciation, the sheer volume of government borrowing can erode investor confidence over time. Return of Risk Appetite: In times of global uncertainty, the US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. However, if global economic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, investors may shift capital away from safe-haven assets like the Dollar towards higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets elsewhere, including emerging markets or even alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. The confluence of these factors paints a picture of a Dollar that may struggle to maintain its strength, especially against currencies whose central banks are perceived to be more hawkish or whose economies show greater relative resilience. This shifting USD outlook is a critical component of the UBS forecast. Navigating the Waves: Practical Currency Trading Strategy Given the UBS EUR/USD forecast and the broader market dynamics, what does this mean for traders and investors? Developing a robust currency trading strategy is essential for navigating these anticipated movements. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches from ECB and Fed officials, as well as minutes from their policy meetings. Any hints about future rate decisions or changes in economic outlook can trigger significant market reactions. Track Key Economic Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PPI), employment figures (NFP, unemployment rates), GDP growth, and manufacturing/services PMIs for both the Eurozone and the US. These data points provide concrete evidence of economic trends. Consider Interest Rate Differentials: The carry trade, where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency, becomes more attractive as the interest rate differential widens in favor of the Euro. Risk Management is Paramount: Currency markets can be volatile. Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and define your risk-to-reward ratio before entering a trade. Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the EUR/USD forecast is compelling, it’s prudent to diversify across different currency pairs or asset classes to mitigate risk. For crypto investors, understanding these macro Forex trends can inform decisions on stablecoin holdings or the impact of a weaker USD on Bitcoin’s purchasing power for international buyers. Look for Technical Confirmation: Before entering a trade based on fundamental analysis, look for technical signals that confirm the direction. This could include price breaking key resistance levels, bullish candlestick patterns, or indicators signaling momentum. For those looking to capitalize on the anticipated Euro strength, a long position on EUR/USD would be the primary trade. However, always conduct your own due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor. The market can be unpredictable, and forecasts, while informed, are not guarantees. Strategy Element Actionable Insight Entry Point Consider entering long on EUR/USD during pullbacks to strong support levels or on a confirmed breakout above minor resistance. Target Price Initial targets around 1.15-1.18, with the ultimate UBS target of 1.20 as a long-term objective. Stop Loss Place stop loss below recent significant low or strong support to protect capital. Risk Management Allocate a small percentage of trading capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%). Monitoring Regularly review economic calendars, news feeds, and technical charts. The Broader Implications: Benefits and Challenges A strengthening Euro against the USD carries significant implications beyond just currency traders. For the Eurozone, a stronger Euro can make imports cheaper, helping to alleviate inflationary pressures and reducing the cost of raw materials and energy for businesses. It also enhances the purchasing power of Eurozone consumers when traveling abroad. However, it can make Eurozone exports more expensive for international buyers, potentially impacting export-oriented industries. Conversely, for the United States, a weaker Dollar makes US exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting manufacturing and trade. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to inflationary pressures and reduce the purchasing power of US consumers when buying foreign goods or traveling abroad. For the cryptocurrency market, a weaker USD can sometimes be seen as a positive for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. If the Dollar loses value, investors seeking to preserve purchasing power might look towards alternative assets. Furthermore, a weaker USD can make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cheaper for international buyers using stronger currencies, potentially increasing demand. However, the correlation is not always direct and depends on a multitude of other factors, including overall market sentiment, regulatory developments, and specific crypto-related news. Conclusion: A Compelling Outlook for the Euro UBS’s confident EUR/USD forecast of 1.20 signals a significant shift in the global currency landscape. Driven by the ECB’s hawkish stance, the Eurozone’s economic resilience, and the anticipated dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve, the Euro appears poised for a period of appreciation against the US Dollar. This outlook is not merely a technical projection but is deeply rooted in fundamental macroeconomic divergences between the two major economies. While the journey to 1.20 may encounter market volatility and unforeseen events, the underlying drivers suggest a compelling case for Euro strength. For investors across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro Forex trends is crucial for informed decision-making and navigating the evolving global financial environment. The ascendant path of the Euro could redefine capital flows and investment strategies in the coming months, making this a development to watch closely.

During Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest price correction, an intriguing pattern emerged: both the largest holders, known as ‘whales’ (entities holding over 10,000 BTC), and the smallest participants, everyday retail investors (those with less than 1 BTC), became net buyers. This widespread strategic move suggests a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, even when prices experience significant dips. Unveiling Strategic BTC Dip Buying: What Does It Mean? Glassnode, a prominent on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted this compelling trend via their X platform. Their data revealed that these two vastly different investor cohorts, despite their varying scales, actively engaged in buying. This isn’t merely coincidental trading; it strongly indicates deliberate BTC dip buying . When the price of Bitcoin falls, instead of succumbing to panic or selling off assets, these market participants perceive it as an invaluable opportunity to acquire more Bitcoin at a reduced cost. It’s akin to a major clearance sale for the digital asset, and smart investors are seizing the moment. Whale Activity: These colossal entities often possess sophisticated market insights, extensive resources, and well-defined long-term investment strategies. Their consistent buying during downturns typically signals robust conviction in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its intrinsic value. Retail Investor Behavior: While individual retail holdings are small, their collective action is incredibly powerful. The sheer number of retail investors participating in this buying spree demonstrates growing mainstream confidence and a shared belief that the current dip is a temporary phase, making their collective retail investor behavior a critical component of broader market sentiment. How Are Crypto Market Trends Influenced by These Groups? The combined force of both large-scale whale activity and widespread retail engagement significantly shapes overall crypto market trends . Glassnode’s analytical approach, which utilizes a 15-day moving average, provides a clear, albeit slightly delayed, snapshot of this persistent accumulation. This metric indicates that a diverse spectrum of market participants is actively involved in Bitcoin accumulation , consistently identifying value at current price levels and positioning themselves for future growth. It is crucial to understand that while insightful, this particular metric functions as a lagging indicator. It reflects buying actions that have occurred over the preceding 15 days, rather than providing real-time insights into immediate market volatility. Nevertheless, its value lies in offering profound insight into the underlying market sentiment and the strategic, long-term positioning adopted by these influential investor groups. This historical perspective can often predict future market directions more reliably than short-term fluctuations. The Astonishing Resilience: Why BTC Dip Buying Matters This coordinated and sustained buying, originating from such disparate investor groups, paints an astonishing picture of market resilience. It strongly suggests that participants are not easily swayed or discouraged by short-term price corrections. Instead, they are proactively strengthening their portfolios, preparing for what they anticipate will be future market upswings. This pattern of aggressive BTC dip buying frequently precedes significant market recoveries, as the influx of demand helps to stabilize prices and eventually propels them higher. Understanding these deep-seated patterns is fundamental for comprehensive Bitcoin market analysis . It reveals that beneath the often-turbulent surface of daily price movements, there exists a strong, unwavering foundational belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. This long-term perspective is absolutely vital for successfully navigating the inherently volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Investors who recognize these underlying trends are often better equipped to make informed decisions and capitalize on opportunities. In summary, the recent data illuminating significant Bitcoin accumulation by both ‘whales’ and everyday retail investors during a market correction serves as a powerful and encouraging signal. It profoundly highlights a widespread and growing belief in Bitcoin’s enduring long-term potential and a remarkably strategic approach to digital asset investment. This collective confidence, sustained even amidst periods of pronounced price volatility, emphatically underscores the increasing maturity and inherent resilience of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. It firmly suggests that a significant portion of the market views price dips not as alarming threats, but rather as exceptional, opportune moments to strategically expand and strengthen their Bitcoin holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin accumulation? Bitcoin accumulation refers to the process where investors steadily increase their holdings of Bitcoin, often by buying during price dips or corrections, with a long-term investment horizon in mind. Q2: Who are ‘whales’ in the crypto market? In the crypto market, ‘whales’ are individual or institutional investors who hold exceptionally large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices with their trades. For Bitcoin, Glassnode defines them as holding over 10,000 BTC. Q3: Why do whales and retail investors buy during a dip? Both whales and retail investors often buy during a dip because they view the price correction as a temporary discount. They believe the asset’s long-term value is higher, making current lower prices an attractive entry or accumulation point. Q4: Is Glassnode’s data on Bitcoin accumulation real-time? No, Glassnode explicitly states that their metric for Bitcoin accumulation is based on a 15-day average. This means it reflects trends over a period, making it a lagging indicator rather than a real-time reflection of immediate market volatility. Q5: How does this trend of accumulation impact Bitcoin’s future? This consistent Bitcoin accumulation by diverse investor groups during dips suggests strong underlying confidence and demand. It can contribute to price stability, potentially setting the stage for future market recoveries and indicating a robust, maturing ecosystem less prone to panic selling.

Despite a minor recovery to $114,000 at the time of writing, several top crypto tokens remain under pressure. Solana dropped by 10% over the past week, while XRP and Dogecoin fell 5.5% and 9.5% respectively, according to data from CoinMarketCap. These declines are particularly notable given conditions such as a decrease in Bitcoin dominance (down 5.5% in the last month). Ether’s 40% rally generally signals the beginning of altcoin rotation. But this time, the market has reacted differently. Weak Altcoin Reaction Sparks Market Caution Bitfinex analysts noted that while Bitcoin’s pullback should have, in theory, spurred a move into altcoins, speculative interest appears to be fading. “Interestingly, this break did not translate into a sustained altcoin bid — quite the opposite,” they said in a market report on Tuesday. This shift suggests investors are not rotating capital into smaller-cap coins, but rather de-risking altogether. They added that the “OTHERS” index — which tracks cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 by market cap — dropped nearly 19% in the past 10 days before seeing a modest rebound. The data, they argue, supports the theory that speculative appetite is cooling across the board. Mixed Signals as Analysts Watch for Next Move While signs point to a broader consolidation phase , optimism still lingers among some market watchers. Bitfinex analysts noted that while the current trend leans toward caution, upcoming macroeconomic news or renewed ETF inflows could quickly shift market sentiment. Some traders believe this pullback is a setup for a bigger move. Crypto analyst Ted wrote on X, “This is your best opportunity to stack utility alts before they go parabolic,” urging long-term investors not to lose sight of the bigger picture. Similarly, Merlijn The Trader highlighted that many altcoins are “coiling for a violent breakout,” drawing comparisons to historic chart patterns. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which read 55 (indicating “Altcoin Season”) on July 21, had slipped back to 40 by Tuesday — officially signaling a return to “Bitcoin Season.” The post Altcoin Market Struggle to Recover as Bitcoin Stumbles, But Hope for Alt Season Remains appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Altcoin News|Altcoin news|altcoin season,EN,0,0,MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-08-06 09:58:25

Why Ethereum Might Be The Biggest Macro Trade Lee argued there is no contradiction between his longstanding Bitcoin optimism and his conviction on Ethereum. Bitcoin, in his telling, remains the monetary primitive and store of value. Ethereum, by contrast, is the execution layer for tokenized finance. “I don’t see this as a conflict,” he said when asked why he champions both assets. Drawing an analogy to equities, he added that investors can sensibly own scarce, category-defining names in parallel: “You know you should own both.” Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Deepens As Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Hits One Of The Lowest Levels This Year The crux of Lee’s Ethereum case is the convergence of Wall Street’s tokenization push with real-world adoption of stablecoins. He described stablecoins as crypto’s first ubiquitous application and the accelerant for institutional on-chain activity. “That is the ChatGPT moment for crypto,” he said. “The first killer app for crypto has emerged… which is stablecoins, and now Wall Street is running to tokenize and maybe even financialize their entire system on the blockchain. But that means they require smart contracts.” In Lee’s assessment, “the biggest and most secure blockchain with no downtime is Ethereum. And it’s legally compliant.” He further contended that “the majority of stablecoins and real-world assets that have been tokenized are taking place on Ethereum,” positioning the network as the default venue for capital-markets infrastructure to migrate on-chain. Brunell pressed on perceived weaknesses introduced since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, including increased complexity, centralization vectors, bridge and Layer-2 attack surfaces. Lee acknowledged those critiques but weighed them against what he views as the incumbent system’s brittleness. “These risks that you describe seem like smaller risks compared to the fragility of the existing financial system,” he said, pointing to legacy “trust vectors” and fraud rates in traditional rails. In other words, even with Ethereum’s trade-offs, the relative security-and-efficiency frontier still tilts in its favor for modern financial plumbing. Related Reading: Why Ethereum to Outperform Bitcoin: $5.4B ETF Inflows, Whale Accumulation, and 2021 Breakout Pattern Lee linked his timeline to the institutional learning curve. When he first wrote about Bitcoin in 2017, he said, the investment community was just beginning to recognize a credible digital-gold thesis. “I think Ethereum is having its 2017 moment now because now is the time that Wall Street will take tokenization seriously and it’s taking place on Ethereum,” he said. That adoption vector—tokenized dollars and securities settling under programmable contracts—underpins his claim that Ethereum is the preeminent macro trade ahead. Asked to choose a single asset for the next decade, Lee resisted the premise but ultimately answered in line with his current mandate. “If I had to choose… because I’m chairman of Bitmine, which is an Ethereum treasury, then I of course would choose Ethereum,” he said. He closed by reiterating that generational shifts in technology and attitudes will keep compounding crypto’s addressable market, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum benefiting. But on the specific question of where institutional financial infrastructure is most likely to land, his stance was unambiguous: “Wall Street will take tokenization seriously and it’s taking place on Ethereum.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,625.

49631613,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77021,1754474455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"August’s Best Undervalued Crypto, Stronger Early Traction Than Chainlink (LINK) in 2018",https://timestabloid.com/augusts-best-undervalued-crypto-stronger-early-traction-than/,"In 2018, Chainlink (LINK) quietly emerged with a promise to revolutionize decentralized data transfer. While the vision was compelling, adoption was slow and utility was still theoretical. Fast forward to today, and a new project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is making waves before even hitting the open market—already attracting over 14,800 holders and securing more than $14.10 million in its presale. Unlike LINK in its infancy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the scene with a functioning dual-model lending framework, a thriving community, and a token still priced at just $0.035 during Phase 6. For those who missed LINK under $1, this may be the best second chance at a foundational crypto opportunity. A Dual Lending Model Built for DeFi’s Future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not trying to reinvent lending; it is redefining its execution. The project is being designed to revolve around two distinct lending mechanisms—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—each designed to serve different market needs while remaining part of the same ecosystem. The P2C model will offer a smart-contract-based experience that prioritizes blue-chip and stable assets. Users will be able to deposit major cryptocurrencies like AVAX, ETH, and USDT into audited smart contract pools and, in return, will receive mtTokens in 1:1, which will track their share and compound interest. For instance, a user who lends $12,000 in AVAX at a 9.6% APY will earn $1,152 per year in passive income. These mtTokens will not only appreciate in value with accrued yield, but will also serve as collateral, giving lenders dual utility for their capital. On the borrowing side, users will unlock stablecoin liquidity without giving up exposure to long-term price growth of their blue-chip holdings. Someone who deposits $4,000 worth of XRP into the protocol will be able to borrow $2,600 in stablecoins, based on a 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This will create a new dynamic where users maintain upside exposure while still accessing liquid capital—ideal for trading, yield farming, or covering real-world expenses. For riskier, more volatile assets such as meme tokens—think DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE—the platform will introduce a separate P2P lending layer. This structure will isolate unstable tokens from the main liquidity pools, protecting P2C participants from unwanted volatility. In this format, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates, repayment periods, and collateral preferences through smart contracts. The absence of pooled risk will empower both parties with control and the potential for significantly higher yields, especially for those willing to back less liquid assets. Safety will remain a focal point across both models. Every loan will need to be overcollateralized and backed by a Stability Factor that will determine the health of the collateral. If a borrower’s position weakens, the protocol will initiate liquidation, allowing third-party liquidators to purchase the debt at a discount while maintaining solvency throughout the system. Presale Surge, Institutional-Level Security, and an Imminent Price Hike Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the middle of its presale Phase 6, currently priced at $0.035 per token with 10% of the phase already sold. This price is not expected to last. Once this phase concludes, the token price will rise by 15% to $0.040, marking the final opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at the current discounted rate. With over 12,000 followers on Twitter and increasing traction daily, early adopters are flocking to the project not just for the potential upside, but also for its deep foundation. The platform has undergone an extensive CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00, verifying both its contract integrity and ongoing monitoring standards. For further assurance, a $50,000 bug bounty is in place, with reward tiers going as high as $2,000 for critical issues and scaling down to $200 for low-severity findings. These programs help ensure the protocol is battle-tested before its mainnet goes live. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway is actively rewarding early believers, with ten winners receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. These types of community-centered initiatives are helping to build a loyal holder base and generate organic growth. Notably, users who swapped their BTC, SOL, or ETH in Phase 1 when the price was just $0.01 have already achieved 250% gains at the current rate—well before the token even lists publicly at its projected launch price of $0.06. The post-listing outlook targets exponential growth, with expectations bolstered by the upcoming beta release and potential listings on top-tier exchanges such as Binance, MEXC, and Coinbase. This momentum mirrors what LINK lacked in its early days—structured infrastructure, user utility, and measurable adoption. With more users interacting with the platform once it launches, and growing interest from centralized exchanges, market demand is expected to surge rapidly. For anyone who missed Chainlink (LINK)’s launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to present a rare second chance—one that is still early, still affordable, and, perhaps most importantly, already far more developed.

Grok Reveals Why August Looks Bullish: Buying $Hyper Could Help You Ride This Surge August 6, 2025 • 10:00 UTC After a sweltering July, the latest dip at the start of August has left many experts perplexed about what to expect this month. Grok, however, used its expert analysis and insights, along with its integration with X, which is a hub for both big and small crypto updates, to connect the dots. And the larger picture? Still undeniably bullish. According to Grok, there are several reasons to remain optimistic not just for August, but potentially for all of 2025. These include: The US passing the GENIUS Act in July , which provides regulatory clarity around crypto. Large corporations like SharpLink (now holding $2B worth of $ETH ), Metaplanet (which announced plans to buy 200K $BTC by 2028 ), and Cango ( mined 450 BTC in July ) rapidly increasing their crypto holdings. Emerging economies like Brazil exploring crypto integration by laying the groundwork for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Now, if you want to make the most of this momentum, we recommend checking out a presale crypto, specifically Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . $HYPER is perfectly positioned to ride the broader market’s upside, as it aims to supercharge Bitcoin itself, aka the granddaddy of all cryptos. It’s building a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and use a canonical bridge to bring lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to Bitcoin.

August 6, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is trading at $114K today, down some 7% from its mid-July peak of $123K, but still nearly 5% up over the month. Even so, price action has flattened, with resistance near $116K and support holding around $112K. Fading momentum and low trading volume suggest investors are waiting for a decisive move. Wider economic uncertainty is also weighing heavily on sentiment. With mixed macro signals and cautious rate outlooks, Bitcoin’s retraction reflects the broader market indecision. Still, $BTC remains in a rising channel , hinting at potential upside if bulls regain control. Analysts note that similar quiet climbs have historically led to stronger Q3 rallies. A rising channel indicates accumulation and confidence, even if price action feels slow. It’s a setup that often attracts speculative capital into altcoins and presales, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . One of the best new meme coins on presale , Bitcoin Hyper intends to scale $BTC for the next breakout. Presales like Bitcoin Hyper, with their preset price increases, could see a rise in interest as traders look for guaranteed short-term returns as Bitcoin stabilizes.

Investors have been selling for weeks, but the market is seeing signs of seller exhaustion. However, on-chain research firm Glassnode says the market structure of the leading cryptocurrency is still fragile, and this makes BTC vulnerable to further declines. Sellers Are Getting Exhausted The momentum pause is evident in data across Bitcoin’s spot, futures, options, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) markets. These sectors show that investor risk appetite is moderating, there is cautious positioning, and liquidity is thinning after a period of euphoria. Analyzing the spot market, Glassnode found weakened conditions, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling from 47.4 to 35.8. The RSI is now below its low band, signaling oversold territory. Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) reflects intensifying selling pressure and has declined sharply from -$107.1 million to -$220 million. Additionally, spot volume levels reflect declining liquidity and softer investor participation, plunging from $8.4 billion to $7.5 billion. For the futures market, Bitcoin open interest has slipped from $45.6 billion to $44.9 billion, highlighting a mild position unwinding. Glassnode found that long-side funding fell 33% to $3.1 million, while perpetual CVD declined from -$1.2 billion to -$1.8 billion. This dynamic underscores a pullback in leveraged bullish demand, distribution, and disengagement among market participants. Bitcoin ETFs on Outflow Streak Furthermore, the options market shows Bitcoin open interest tumbling 8.4% to $39.8 billion, with the volatility spread narrowing from 23.84% to 16.26%. There is reduced speculative activity among investors, and less risk is being priced in. Notably, there is high demand for downside protection and rising hedging sentiment, as seen in the 25 Delta Skew rising above its high band to 5.51%. Bitcoin ETFs have been on an outflow streak for the past four trading days. Their net inflows have sunk 25% to less than $270 million, a figure below the low band. This signals weak institutional demand. “On-chain fundamentals were mixed: active addresses rose 3.6% to 729k, while transfer volume dropped 13.9% to $9.4B and fees declined 14.4% to $483.2K, signaling quieter network activity,” Glassnode added. While momentum continues to cool off, the Bitcoin market is retesting the low-liquidity range below the $114,000 threshold. Oversold conditions and seller exhaustion suggest a bounce may be on the way; however, growing fragility may give room for negative triggers and delayed recovery.

This comes as Bitcoin retreated further from the $120,000 resistance level amid a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. Looking at the price outlook, the asset’s weekly Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has dropped below the 14-week Simple Moving Average ( SMA ), a pattern that has historically signaled downturns in Bitcoin’s price, according to an analysis by cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez posted on August 6. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView Notably, in June 2024, a similar RSI breakdown preceded a nearly 23% decline, while another instance in December 2024 saw Bitcoin fall more than 25%. The same signal has now reappeared in early August 2025, with Bitcoin trading around $113,000. According to Martinez, if history repeats, Bitcoin could fall between 20% and 30% from its recent highs, placing a potential downside target near $95,000. The possibility of a further plunge is reinforced by broader market weakness, as Bitcoin failed to hold the $115,000 level. On-chain data also supports the idea that Bitcoin may have topped out. On August 5, whales dormant for 7–10 years moved 3,000 BTC, a behavior that has historically signaled local tops. This pattern suggests investors should brace for possible losses.

However, the 14-day RSI stands at 46.56, pointing to weakening momentum and a lack of bullish strength. While the price remains well above the 200-day SMA of $91,911, indicating a longer-term uptrend, the neutral sentiment and RSI levels suggest potential consolidation ahead.

49635611,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/claude-ai-predicts-solana-breaking-500-sooner-than-you-think-2025-price-targets-revealed,1754480217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/49635611.jpeg,Claude AI Predicts Solana Breaking $500 Sooner Than You Think — 2025 Price Targets Revealed,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/claude-ai-predicts-solana-breaking-500-sooner-than-you-think-2025-price-targets-revealed,"Solana has spent much of 2025 doing the quiet work that markets tend to notice late: processing hundreds of millions of transactions per day with 99.99% uptime, scaling developer adoption, and pulling real economic activity on-chain. Meanwhile, price has been range-bound. In August 2025, SOL is rotating between $164–$168, still capped by a familiar $180–$188 ceiling. The disconnect is striking enough to ask a simple question: is the market underpricing Solana’s execution? Cryptona.co forecasts that this consolidation phase could resolve to the upside if SOL breaks through $188 with volume, opening the path to $200–$206 in the short term and potentially much higher levels in 2025 if catalysts align. The network continues to post leadership metrics—throughput, stability, and growing DeFi share—while the institutional plumbing (custody, liquidity, and potential ETF access) comes into focus. What the Tape Says (August 2025) Technically, SOL remains constructive despite a soft near-term momentum profile. RSI in the low-to-mid 40s points to neutral conditions, MACD leans mildly bearish, and yet price holds above its 200-day moving average near $162, preserving the longer-term uptrend structure. Spot volumes in the mid-single-billions and a summer peak in futures activity suggest ongoing accumulation during consolidation. For traders, the map is straightforward: acceptance above $188 puts $200–$206 in play; lose $160–$162, and the $155–$157 area becomes the line to defend. Key Levels (Aug 2025) Support Pivot Resistance $155–$157 $164–$168 $180–$188 → $200–$206 Under the Hood: Why Fundamentals Still Lead Solana’s throughput now regularly clears 550M+ daily transactions, backed by 15+ months of stable operation. Developer momentum remains a tailwind, with the platform attracting more new builders than any competing smart-contract ecosystem through 2024 and into 2025. On the demand side, DeFi traction has pushed TVL into the multi-billion range, decentralized exchange activity is disproportionately concentrated on Solana, and stablecoin flows continue to deepen on-chain liquidity. Corporate and institutional footprints—from tokenized funds to enterprise integrations—are broadening utility and lowering the perceived operational risk of building on Solana. The upgrade path matters just as much. Firedancer, a C++ validator client engineered for massive parallelism, targets a step-function increase in capacity (well into the million-TPS realm in testing). Smooth mainnet rollout could be a decisive catalyst for repricing, shifting Solana from “fast enough” to “structural advantage” in the eyes of institutional allocators. The Institutional Channel ETF odds remain elevated in prevailing models, and large-cap issuers are positioned to go live quickly once approvals drop. Internal estimates on the Street point to potential $3–$6B of net new assets in the first 6–12 months post-approval, a scale that would open discretionary and advisory channels still gated today. Put simply, regulatory clarity unlocks participation—not just from funds, but from corporate treasuries, market-making desks, and risk-managed allocators who require rule-of-law guardrails. Analysts at Cryptona anticipate that ETF-driven demand will broaden the holder base, reduce funding volatility, and deepen derivatives markets—conditions that could raise Solana’s valuation floor even without immediate retail mania. Claude’s Price Scenarios for SOL Analysts from Cryptona.co asked Claude for detailed projections on Solana’s potential price trajectory over the next two market cycles. The discussion focused on how network adoption, technological milestones like the Firedancer upgrade, and institutional market entry could interact to influence valuation. Claude noted that price targets are not certainties but probability-weighted outcomes based on current data and assumptions. In the conservative view, Solana grows steadily with moderate adoption, while the base case envisions significant capital inflows following ETF approval and continued DeFi dominance. The bullish case assumes accelerated adoption from both retail and institutional channels, while the extreme bull scenario models a best-case alignment of macro conditions, technology scaling, and global regulatory clarity. Year Conservative Base Bullish Extreme Bull 2025 $300–$400 $500–$800 $1,000+ — 2030 $800–$1,200 $1,500–$2,000 $2,500+ $3,211 According to Claude, these figures represent guide rails rather than fixed destinations. The actual path Solana takes will depend on how quickly the network converts technical capacity into sustained economic activity, how effectively institutional demand materializes, and whether the broader crypto market enters a new multi-year growth phase. Putting It Together This market has been content to wait for evidence. Solana is now supplying it: throughput without fragility, developers without subsidies, DeFi depth without artificial incentives, and a credible path to institutional participation. If $180–$188 is convincingly reclaimed, momentum systems will likely recalibrate higher; if price retests $160–$162, the longer-term setup remains intact so long as fundamentals keep compounding. Cryptona.co forecasts that patient accumulation in this range could position holders for significant upside if key catalysts—ETF approval, Firedancer launch, and sustained DeFi leadership—materialize in the next 12–18 months.

This stagnation poses a crucial question: is the market undervaluing Solana's true potential? According to Cryptona.co , a breakout above the $188 resistance could set the stage for reaching higher thresholds around $200-$206 in the near term. This scenario hinges on maintaining key technical levels and positive market conditions. Technical Analysis and Future Outlook Currently, Solana's technical indicators suggest a balanced momentum. Despite a mild bearish tilt in MACD and an RSI reflecting neutrality, Solana's price resilience above its 200-day moving average suggests underlying strength. Traders should watch for a successful breach above $188, which could potentially lead to higher valuations in line with increased market acceptance. Key Technical and Price Levels as of August 2025 Support Pivot Resistance $155–$157 $164–$168 $180–$188 → $200–$206 The Catalysts Behind Solana's Future Growth Solana's impressive transaction volume, consistent operational stability, and increasing dominance in the DeFi space are pivotal for its growth. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade promises massive scalability improvements that could significantly enhance Solana's network capacity and efficiency. The Impact of Institutional Involvement and ETF Approvals The likelihood of ETF approval remains high, with significant implications for Solana's market access and stability. Analysts at Cryptona project that ETF approvals could attract billions in new assets, thereby stabilizing and potentially elevating Solana's market valuation. Comprehensive Price Projections for Solana (2025 - 2030) Year Conservative Base Bullish Extreme Bull 2025 $300–$400 $500–$800 $1,000+ — 2030 $800–$1,200 $1,500–$2,000 $2,500+ $3,211 Market Dynamics and External Factors Influencing SOL's Price Trajectory The projected price points for Solana are not set in stone but represent potential outcomes influenced by market dynamics, technological advancements, and regulatory developments. In conclusion, Solana's path to achieving and possibly exceeding these price targets will largely depend on its ability to maintain operational excellence and adapt to evolving market conditions. A sustained effort towards technological upgrades and securing regulatory approvals will be crucial for Solana's long-term success. Cryptona.co emphasizes that these insights should guide potential investors about Solana's capabilities and market prospects. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Cardano news revolves around upgrades to scalability, developer tools and interoperability, Remittix is catching the attention of investors looking for a quicker, more accessible growth opportunity. Cardano’s Upgrade Sparks Concerns Amid Growing Competition Cardano’s decision to invest $71 million into a year-long upgrade has been a topic of hot debate in the community. Although this will enhance the scalability of ADA, provide developers with more resources and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, not every holder of Cardano is convinced. There has been a question of transparency of how the money will be spent and people wonder whether the upgrade is the correct way to make Cardano remain competitive against other competitors such as Solana and Ethereum. Despite the community’s backing of the upgrade in theory, many ADA holders are expressing frustration over the lack of clear updates and the significant cost involved. Could this be an indication that ADA price growth has plateaued and that Cardano news isn’t enough to keep pace with the rapidly evolving blockchain space? Remittix Gaining Traction as Investors Look for Real Utility While Cardano’s upgrade remains uncertain, Remittix is quietly taking off. Investors are flocking to Remittix, recognizing it as a low-priced token with major growth potential, offering the real-world utility that many ADA holders crave. Having raised over $18.1 million and sold over 582 million tokens at just $0.0895, Remittix is showing impressive signs of growth. Set to release its wallet beta on September 15, Remittix is on track to become the next big player in the cross-border payments space, offering users a simple, fast and secure way to transfer assets globally, something Cardano has yet to deliver in the same way. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum Over ADA $18.1M+ Raised , with strong community backing Full Wallet Beta Launching Sept 15 — ready for global use 40% Token Bonus for early investors Real-World Use Cases in global remittances and payments With Remittix offering actual utility and ADA holders concerned about the long-term impact of Cardano’s hefty upgrade, the future looks bright for Remittix as the new go-to altcoin for 2025. Why Investors Are Shifting Their Focus to Remittix While Cardano’s $71 million upgrade sounds promising, it has left many investors frustrated by the lack of transparency. Remittix, on the other hand, is seeing real-time growth, offering an easy-to-use wallet and growing use cases in the cross-border crypto payments market. As ADA holders begin to rethink their position, Remittix is the top altcoin they’re increasingly flocking to, ready to take advantage of the real-world utility that ADA price changes cannot deliver immediately.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits TRON’s Spotlight: A Stage Where Creators Keep the Mic (and the Money) TRON (TRX) is a digital highway built in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It first lived on the Ethereum road but soon got its own track. The plan is clear: give artists, gamers and writers full control of their work. Fans can tip them straight away, with no gatekeepers like YouTube or Apple eating the pie. Each thank-you travels in TRX coins, reaching the maker in seconds. The network runs quick code, lets anyone build apps, and keeps every move on a public book. Fees sit near zero, so even tiny payments make sense. This has lured game studios, music hubs and finance fans who want a cheaper place than Ethereum. TRX has held firm while some coins sank, helped by steady use and high daily trade. If the next market upswing rewards busy networks, this coin may shine brighter. As more people seek fair pay online, TRON’s stage could get crowded—and that can lift its token too. LUNC Rises Again: Why Terra Classic Still Turns Heads Terra began in 2018 with one bold goal: make digital money feel like cash. Its network links coins to real-world currencies, so prices stay steady while transfers stay quick. In 2019 the chain went live, serving dollar, won, tugrik, and IMF basket pairs. A hard split in May 2022 created a fresh Terra (now called LUNA) and left the first chain as Terra Classic, powered by the renamed LUNA Classic, or LUNC. Many see the “Classic” tag as a nod to Ethereum’s famous fork. Today LUNC runs on the same fast rails, yet it is steered by a lively community, not big firms. Fees stay tiny, blocks settle in seconds, and regular token burns aim to trim supply. That mix of speed, low cost, and a shrinking coin count gives LUNC a story that traders watch closely, especially while newer chains fight high gas and slow finality. Bitcoin may set the tone and Ethereum may host the apps, but Terra Classic hopes to win users who simply want cheap, stable, everyday payments. Stellar Lumens: The Friendly Bridge for Global Money Moves Stellar is a world money highway. It is open to all and run by many computers, not one boss. People can send dollars, euros, or even Bitcoin across it in a few seconds. The fee is a tiny slice of a cent. The network’s own coin is called Stellar Lumens, or XLM. Born in 2014 with help from Stripe, it has already moved billions of payments and teamed up with big names. Users only need a phone app to join. The next market wave is hunting for coins that do useful work, not just buzz. XLM fits that idea. It acts like oil for a bridge that links banks, wallets, and new apps such as NFTs or small smart deals. Energy use is low, and the supply is fixed, unlike many coins that grow forever. XLM still trades well below its old peak, so some see a value window before the wider crowd returns. If cash moves keep rising on Stellar and more firms plug in, the coin could shine brighter in this cycle. Kaspa's Lightning Blocks: Why KAS Could Outrun The Crowd Kaspa, ticker KAS, is a proof-of-work coin built for speed. It runs on a fresh idea called the GHOSTDAG protocol. When many miners find blocks at once, most chains throw the extra blocks away. Kaspa keeps them all and lines them up in order. This makes a woven web, not a single chain. Thanks to this trick, the network already makes one block per second and hopes to hit ten or even one hundred. Confirmations feel almost instant, limited only by how fast the internet moves. Under the hood, Kaspa packs handy extras like Reachability for map-like searches, smart pruning that trims old data, and light SPV proofs for phones. Future subnetworks could let builders launch layer-two apps with ease. In a market that rewards speed, low fees, and real proof-of-work security, KAS checks many boxes. Bitcoin is slow; Ethereum is busy; Solana is not PoW at all. Kaspa sits in a sweet spot and still has a small value compared with the giants. Many traders now watch it as a possible next-cycle star. Conclusion TRX, LUNC, XLM, and KAS all show strong growth potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by merging sports passion and meme excitement. Early entry offers unique upside as the project targets lasting impact and impressive gains.

While many investors focus on well-known assets like XRP, several less prominent coins offer significant growth prospects, often at a lower entry cost. A Closer Look at XYZVerse's Rising Popularity The cryptocurrency $XYZ, part of XYZVerse, has recently made headlines by hitting a significant $15M in capitalization, reflecting its growing acceptance and investor interest. The project distinguishes itself by integrating sports excitement with meme culture, supported by a solid utility framework and partnerships, such as its recent collaboration with bookmaker.XYZ. This partnership underscores its innovative approach by merging betting with token benefits. TRON: Empowering Creators on Its Unique Platform Since its inception, TRON has aimed to revolutionize how creators receive compensation for their work, offering a direct earnings platform without intermediaries, utilizing its native TRX token. The Resilience of Terra Classic (LUNC) Despite setbacks, Terra Classic continues to attract attention with its robust infrastructure and community-led governance, proving its persistence in the competitive crypto market. Stellar Lumens: Facilitating Efficient Cross-Border Transactions Stellar Lumens stands out with its low-cost transaction model and scalability, making it an attractive option for users needing efficient international money transfers. Kaspa: Innovating with Speed and Scalability Kaspa's use of the GHOSTDAG protocol allows it to handle transactions at an unprecedented speed, making it a noteworthy contender in the market for its technical innovations. Conclusion While XRP is a staple in many crypto portfolios, the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market means that newer and less-known coins like TRX, LUNC, XLM, and KAS also hold considerable promise, with XYZVerse particularly standing out due to its unique market positioning and potential for high returns.

The investors include institutional participation from Singapore’s GreenVision Fund, Jkapital Ltd., and Bearcat, alongside a prominent U.S. public company chairman. This diverse investor group shares a unified conviction: prediction markets represent a transformational shift in how society generates, exchanges, and values information. These funds will accelerate Bayes Market’s product development, regional expansion, and user growth—particularly across Asia , where social and cultural dynamics align naturally with prediction markets. According to the CEO of GreenVision, “Prediction markets are not just a trend—they are the future of how societies find a shared-reality in complex world. Bayes team has the right vision to scale this movement.” Mass Adoption Underway The year 2025 marks a turning point for the prediction market industry. Polymarket’s integration with X and Kalshi’s $2B valuation signal that the industry is moving towards the mainstream. As trust in centralized narratives erode, prediction markets offer a credible, participatory alternative—surfacing diverse viewpoints and aligning incentives for individual expression. Prediction markets were never by nature solely for crypto-native users. Human beings are inherently driven to predict. Whether guessing the outcome of a reality show or speculating on political developments, people engage in informal forecasting daily. Prediction markets formalize this instinct, offering structure, visibility, and rewards. They are not tools for speculators alone—they are an evolution of how people interact with real-world uncertainty. Bayes Market distinguishes itself by focusing on intuitive design, culturally relevant markets across Asia and a strong emphasis on user empowerment. These features enable a familiar, social, and gamified experience—they are social signals embedded in daily life. A New Intelligence Infrastructure for a Decentralized Future As demand grows for open, transparent, and decentralized systems, prediction markets are poised to become a core infrastructure of the information economy. Bayes Market is not just building a product—it is building a public good: a participatory framework for decentralized intelligence. In an age defined by uncertainty, Bayes Market innovates prediction markets holding the belief that they are not an anomaly of crypto—they are the natural evolution of how society as a whole engages with the future.

As whispers of large gains swirl, more investors are taking notice. Talk of a possible price explosion adds to the excitement. What is driving this surge, and could the next big rally be just ahead? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million.

The token still sits 7.15% higher than a month ago, yet it lags 22.07% over six months. Short-term traders see a tug-of-war near the upper edge of the current band. The 10-day average at 0.00001241 hovers just above the 100-day line at 0.00001218, hinting at mild upward bias. RSI at 44.82 is neutral-to-soft, but a 15.65 stochastic signals oversold conditions. MACD edges into positive territory, suggesting momentum could flip bullish if volume picks up. If buyers clear 0.00001384, the first ceiling at 0.00001549 lies 12% higher. A decisive break might stretch toward 0.00001826, adding roughly 32% from the top of the current range. Failure to hold 0.00001107 risks a slide to 0.00000995, a 28% drop, with deeper support at 0.000007183, about 48% below. Indicators lean toward a cautious recovery, but the chart still demands a clean push above resistance to confirm an uptrend. Conclusion SHIB has shown impressive gains and strong communities.

According to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, Marius Marian stole $507,916 in Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) funds from those who rely on the money to cover basic expenses. He also pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States following an aggravated felony conviction and making false statements on his asylum application. Beginning in March 2024, Marian fraudulently obtained EBT funds by using over 601 unique victim EBT account identifiers. EBT benefits are federal funds distributed through the California Department of Social Services to low-income individuals to use for such things as food, rent, childcare and medical expenses. Marian used skimmer devices on ATM and point-of-sale machines to capture the victims’ EBT card numbers when the victims used the cards. He then encoded the stolen EBT account information on counterfeit bank cards and used them to fraudulently withdraw EBT funds from ATMs in Northern California. “As a result of his scheme, Marian withdrew $507,916 in cash and intended to withdraw $611,845 in EBT funds. Marian further admitted that his conduct involved sophisticated means and caused substantial financial hardship to at least 25 victims. Additionally, Marian admitted that on or around April 27, 2023, he knowingly submitted false statements on an application for asylum to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Specifically, Marian knowingly failed to disclose in his asylum application that he had been previously deported from the United States and that he had previously been convicted in 2019 of bank fraud. Finally, Marian acknowledged that he had been previously deported after his 2019 conviction for bank fraud and that he thereafter illegally reentered and was found in the United States.” For theft of the EBT funds, Marian pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. The illegal entry into the US charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, while the asylum fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Marian is due back in court for sentencing on October 20th.

Despite the dip, sentiment remains constructive as the macro picture settles: the Federal Reserve chose to keep rates steady this week, and a sweeping new U.S. crypto strategy was unveiled, offering regulatory clarity many companies have been waiting for. The largest cryptocurrency hit a low of $111,903 before recovering. At the time of writing, it trades around $113,430. While that’s down from its recent local high near $119,000, Bitcoin still shows year-to-date gains of nearly 25%, comfortably outperforming major U.S. stock indices and retaining strong institutional support. At the July meeting, the Federal Reserve opted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it’s held since December. Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious tone suggested rates could stay elevated longer than markets had hoped, despite rising political pressure for cuts. Notably, two Fed governors, Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller, dissented from the decision, advocating for a 25 basis point cut. It was the first such split since 1993. “The Fed is clearly in wait-and-see mode,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital. “Mentions of tariffs pushing up goods prices show they’re still watching inflation closely. For crypto, that likely means sideways price action until we get a clearer signal on cuts.” Still, crypto investors aren’t waiting on the Fed alone. Analysts say this cycle’s momentum appears more durable than previous rallies, driven less by retail speculation and more by institutional inflows, including record volumes into spot Bitcoin ETFs and a wave of corporate adoption of crypto as a treasury asset. Adding to the macro narrative: On Wednesday, the White House released a 163-page national digital asset strategy – the most comprehensive federal crypto framework to date. The report outlines regulatory objectives for stablecoin oversight, tax policy, and the use of enforcement powers by the SEC and CFTC. It also backs legislative proposals like the Clarity Act, which could standardize how tokens are classified and traded in the U.S. While the document largely reaffirms priorities already voiced by the Trump administration, industry observers welcomed the increased visibility. One White House official called it “the most comprehensive piece of work on digital assets that’s ever been produced.” Importantly, the report urges companies to begin preparing now, even in the absence of new legislation. The message is clear: regulatory clarity is approaching, and those waiting on the sidelines may soon be left behind. Projects looking to attract institutional capital or pursue public listings have started to respond. Many are restructuring their legal entities, auditing token models, and aligning with U.S. market disclosure standards (often behind the scenes). For these teams, compliance isn’t a reaction to enforcement risk but a signal of maturity, a way to build trust with investors before the next wave of capital fully arrives. Experts across global legal and financial circles have begun weighing in on what this moment means for companies operating at the intersection of crypto and capital markets. Among them is Lionel Iruk Esq., a seasoned blockchain and fintech attorney who leads legal and regulatory strategy at NAVmarkets . With deep experience navigating both U.S. securities law and international compliance frameworks, Iruk advises teams preparing for token-to-equity transitions, public listings, and global treasury alignment. “The Fed holding rates steady keeps the macro landscape predictable for now, but the real shift is regulatory,” Iruk said. “Clearer policy signals, especially from the White House, are prompting serious teams to lock in legal frameworks, structure their asset strategies, and prepare for broader market participation across jurisdictions.” At NAVMarkets, Iruk leads legal and regulatory strategy for both crypto-native and traditional companies seeking to align their asset models with capital market requirements, often as part of a broader transition toward public-market readiness or strategic crypto integration. NAVMarkets Helps Both Sides of the Market Prepare for Real Adoption NAVMarkets guides both Web2 and Web3 companies through the tricky parts of crypto, like regulation, fundraising, and going public, so they can focus on growth. With U.S. crypto policy starting to take shape and the Federal Reserve signaling steady interest rates, companies on both sides of the aisle are rethinking how they approach structure, compliance, and capital strategy. For traditional businesses, many of which are exploring blockchain integration for the first time, NAV helps build the legal and financial foundations to enter crypto markets responsibly. That could mean launching a tokenized product, onboarding Bitcoin as part of a treasury strategy, or creating a compliant blockchain subsidiary without exposing the core business. The focus is on long-term flexibility and regulatory alignment, especially as global scrutiny of digital assets increases. NAV also works with crypto-native teams looking to mature their operations and access traditional capital markets. Their support ranges from corporate restructuring to public listings via reverse mergers, SPACs, or uplistings, often through dual-asset structures that combine a company’s token ecosystem with a traditional equity layer. This hybrid approach can make regulators and institutional investors more comfortable, particularly when combined with clear governance and disclosure practices. Bitcoin treasury strategies have also become part of NAV’s playbook, especially as more companies look for ways to hedge inflation and align with investor expectations. With corporate Bitcoin allocations hitting record highs this year, there’s growing interest in doing it the right way – from custody and legal structuring to audit-ready reporting across jurisdictions. Market Outlook The next few months could prove decisive for crypto’s long-term relationship with traditional finance. With the Fed holding rates steady and regulatory guidance beginning to take shape, investors and operators alike are preparing for a market where compliance and clarity matter more than ever. Bitcoin’s dip below $112,000 may have rattled some short-term traders, but many see it as a natural correction after a strong multi-month rally. As spot ETFs continue to evolve and global regulation firms up, the long-term case for Bitcoin as both a treasury asset and capital markets gateway remains intact. While macro headlines may continue to swing sentiment in the short term, the deeper shift is structural: crypto is slowly being absorbed into the frameworks of public markets, regulated funds, and institutional portfolios. This means companies, whether they started in Web2 or Web3, need a way to participate without getting caught offside. “We’re entering a phase where strong legal footing and real-world alignment matter just as much as tech innovation,” said Lionel. “The companies that prepare early, on both the crypto and traditional side, will have more options when the next wave of capital hits.” As policy frameworks continue to solidify and investor expectations rise, firms that took the time to build real infrastructure may be best positioned – not just to list, but to lead in the next chapter of digital finance.

49635994,549272,1754481088,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49635994.jpeg,Philippines to Solidify Its Web3 Stance at ASEAN 2026 – New Cryptos to Watch Before Global Hype,https://bitcoinist.com/new-cryptos-to-buy-before-phillipines-asean-2026/,"As the Philippines gears up to host the 44th ASEAN Summit in 2026, the Philippines’ Trade Secretary Cristina Roque and President Marcos Jr. are pushing to showcase the country’s strides in tech and innovation. With its growing reputation as one of Southeast Asia’s most crypto-friendly nations, and Donald Trump possibly joining the summit, now could be a favorable time to check out new crypto projects to watch – before they likely gain more global traction following the newfound hype. Philippine President Invites Trump to ASEAN Summit ASEAN Summit is more than just another tech event; it’s the Philippines’ opportunity to showcase itself as a forward-thinking nation that embraces cutting-edge technologies in the Web3 sector. The Philippines is one of Southeast Asia’s most progressive nations in embracing digital assets and ranks 20th globally in crypto wealth . So, it’s no wonder that Roque wants to spotlight it as a digital leader at the upcoming ASEAN Summit. Her vision closely aligns with Marcos Jr’s broader agenda to modernize infrastructure, drive economic growth, and strengthen regional ties. Interestingly, ASEAN 2026 will mark 80 years of US-Philippine ties and 75 years of the Mutual Defense Treaty. In preparation, Marcos has formed a National Organizing Council and invited US President Donald Trump to attend the summit. ‘I look forward to hosting President Trump next year to attend the ASEAN meetings under the Philippines’ chair, which also coincides with the commemoration of our 80th year of diplomatic ties and 75 years of the Mutual Defense Treaty,’ said Marcos . Trump is extremely pro-crypto, as evidenced by his Working Group on Digital Assets recently dropping a report on improving US crypto access and regulation. So, his presence would highlight the Philippines’ commitment to decentralized technologies. All of this is big news for the crypto space. With the Philippines set to showcase its digital asset leadership and Trump possibly drawing in even more attention, there’s a strong chance investor interest will spike. Suppose Marcos JR gets his way and Trump attends, there might not be any better time to invest in top cryptos – like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , TOKEN6900 ($T6900) , and OpenServ ($SERV) – before they possibly attract more mainstream investors and skyrocket. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram Trading Bot to Offer Secure Swaps & Copy Trading Snorter Token ($SNORT) has a compelling offer for those eyeing early-stage crypto with strong profit potential. That’s because it serves as an access token for the Snorter Bot – an upcoming Telegram trading bot that finds top trending tokens, letting you potentially snag the next crypto to explode . Once launched this quarter, the bot will assist your trades with MEV-protected , sub-second swaps, as well as automated profit taking through limit orders. It’ll first launch on the Solana, promising the lowest fees (just 0.85%) and the fastest execution on the network compared to other trading bots. Just look at Maestro, Trojan, and Banana Gun, for instance: It’ll then expand to Ethereum and BNB Chain, followed by Polygon and Base. As such, it’ll give you seamless access to top networks and expand your reach when searching for high-potential tokens. And you need not worry about scams. Snorter Bot will have honeypot and rugpull detection, helping you to avoid common crypto traps. You can get involved by purchasing $SNORT on presale for just $0.1005. Be sure to hold the coin for extra perks, like early access to new features and bot upgrades. When the bot becomes fully functional and expands across multiple chains in early 2026, $SNORT could potentially surge to $1.92 . No better time to visit the $SNORT presale for +1,800% potential. 2. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – Vibes-Only Meme Coin That’s ‘1X Better Than $SPX’ TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is an ERC-20 meme coin that proudly rebels against typical TradFi and DeFi ethos alike. Instead of offering clear guidelines and roadmaps, it embraces its lack of fundamentals and utility, thriving on degen humor and social media hype instead. Its ultimate aim is to out-meme and out-pump its predecessor, SPX6900 ($SPX), another ‘shitcoin’ that currently sits on an eye-boggling $1.56B market cap . TOKEN6900, however, sets itself apart from $SPX through pure pettiness, adding exactly one extra token to its supply. According to its whitepaper , this makes $T6900 ‘1x better’ – an ironic jab, but one that perfectly showcases this meme coin’s energy. Despite its degenerate attitude, you can rest assured $T6900 isn’t a rug. Its smart contract audits by Coinsult and SolidProof confirm this, classifying the project as low risk. The token creators can’t set hidden fees or block holders from trading. No honeypot risks, no shady minting behind the scenes. The contract ownership is also renounced, making $T6900 decentralized. To say it simply, it’s a great option if you’re chasing the next big hype coin that embraces chaos and community sentiment. This is especially true when taking into account that it has already scooped up over $1.6M on presale, despite one coin currently only costing $0.00685. Check the TOKEN6900 presale to experience the chaos for yourself. 3. OpenServ ($SERV) – AI Token Surges 63% Ahead of OpenServ’s Mainnet Launch $SERV is the linchpin of the OpenServ Network, a cutting-edge AI ecosystem built to power agent-driven automation across Web2 and Web3 workflows. In a nutshell, it aims to use the intelligence of agents to transform how organizations operate, for example through automating tasks to accelerate workflows. As the native utility token that powers OpenServ’s decentralized AI infrastructure, $SERV is used to: Access AI agents, Pay for compute and storage resources, Reward network contributors. To further create long-term value and encourage active participation, $SERV has built deflationary mechanisms. Every time someone uses the AI agent on OpenServ, a portion of $SERV is used as payment. Part of that is then permanently burned to make the token scarcer and thus support its price. Because $SERV is essential for all interactions within OpenServ, when network activity grows, so does the token’s demand. Backing this, OpenServ’s user base surged by 30% last month in anticipation of its mainnet launch. During the same time frame, the $SERV token jumped over 63% . Once the OpenServ network officially goes live on mainnet, $SERV is bound to propel. Its recent price history already signals potential. Now’s an opportune moment to buy the token at its current $0.05948 price tag. $SERV is up for grabs on some of the best crypto exchanges , including MEXC . Verdict – ASEAN 2026 to Spark Global Crypto Surge As the Philippines prepares to solidify its stance as a global Web3 leader at the upcoming ASEAN 2026, more international attention on crypto is on the horizon, especially if Donald Trump shows his face at the summit. In turn, this building momentum makes a great time to invest in low-key crypto coins like $SNORT , $T6900 , and $SERC. A surge in investor enthusiasm could soon follow as bullish crypto news rally the broader market. Whether you want to take advantage of new trading tools, AI agents, or join a crypto degen community, there are digital assets out there that cater to all tastes. This isn’t investment advice.

49636195,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=186292,1754481310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49636195.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial Resistance at $117K Poses Threat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-analysis-resistance/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial Resistance at $117K Poses Threat The cryptocurrency market constantly presents new challenges and opportunities. Currently, a significant point of interest for many investors is the latest Bitcoin price analysis . A prominent crypto analyst has highlighted some critical levels that could define BTC’s near-term trajectory. Understanding these levels is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Understanding Bitcoin’s Crucial Resistance According to cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, speaking on X, Bitcoin (BTC) is encountering substantial resistance. This formidable barrier sits at the $117,000 mark . This level acts as a ceiling, where selling pressure often increases, making it difficult for the price to move higher. Overcoming such strong BTC resistance requires significant buying volume. Martinez’s observations stem from Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data. This specific metric provides insights into the average price at which unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) were last moved on the blockchain. It helps identify strong accumulation zones and potential resistance areas based on investor behavior. The Air Gap: Weak Bitcoin Support Levels Beyond the resistance, the analyst also pointed out a concerning “air gap” in Bitcoin’s support structure. This gap represents a zone of weak support for Bitcoin support between $113,000 and $108,000. An “air gap” suggests there are not many buyers willing to step in at these price points, making a potential fall through this range more likely and potentially faster. What does this mean for traders and investors? If Bitcoin fails to hold above $113,000, it could experience a relatively swift descent towards the $108,000 level. Such a drop could trigger further selling pressure as stop-loss orders are activated, intensifying the downward movement. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends These specific price levels are critical indicators within the broader crypto market trends . Bitcoin’s performance often influences the entire digital asset ecosystem. When BTC faces significant hurdles, altcoins tend to follow suit, experiencing their own price fluctuations. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s movements is paramount for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading or investment. Investors should remain vigilant. Market dynamics can shift rapidly, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, or sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Staying informed about these overarching trends helps in making more calculated decisions. Actionable Insights from UTXO Realized Price Data The reliance on UTXO realized price data by analysts like Ali Martinez provides a deeper layer of understanding. Unlike simple chart patterns, this on-chain metric offers a view into the actual cost basis of Bitcoin holders. It helps identify areas where a large volume of coins last moved, signaling strong psychological and technical levels. Key takeaways for investors: Monitor $117,000: This is a crucial ceiling. A decisive break above it could signal bullish momentum. Watch $113,000 – $108,000: This range is a potential danger zone. A fall into this gap could lead to further declines. Risk Management: Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect capital, especially if Bitcoin enters the weak support zone. Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. Summary: What’s Next for Bitcoin? In conclusion, the current Bitcoin price analysis paints a clear picture: significant resistance at $117,000 and a vulnerable support structure between $113,000 and $108,000. These levels are not merely numbers; they represent critical junctures for Bitcoin’s immediate future. The market awaits a decisive move, either a breakthrough of resistance or a retest of lower support levels. Staying informed and prepared is key for navigating these dynamic market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘resistance at $117,000’ mean for Bitcoin? A1: Resistance at $117,000 means that Bitcoin’s price faces strong selling pressure at this level, making it difficult for the price to move higher. It acts as a ceiling that buyers need to overcome with significant volume. Q2: What is an ‘air gap’ in Bitcoin support levels? A2: An ‘air gap’ refers to a range where there is weak buying interest or few active bids. For Bitcoin, the $113,000 to $108,000 range is identified as an air gap, suggesting that if the price falls into this zone, it could drop quickly due to a lack of strong support. Q3: Who is Ali Martinez and what is Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data? A3: Ali Martinez is a cryptocurrency analyst who shares insights on market trends. Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data is an on-chain metric that shows the average price at which Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) last moved, helping identify key support and resistance levels based on the cost basis of holders. Q4: How do current Bitcoin price levels affect the broader crypto market trends? A4: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the wider cryptocurrency market. Its significant price movements, especially encountering strong resistance or weak support, can influence the sentiment and price action of altcoins and overall crypto market trends . Q5: What should investors do given this Bitcoin price analysis? A5: Investors should monitor the $117,000 resistance and the $113,000-$108,000 support range closely. Implementing risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, and considering portfolio diversification are prudent steps.

The move will begin during the next championship in Aberdeen from 7th to 10th August 2025. The base prize is set at $10,000; if it is unclaimed, it is rolled over to the next tournament. DP World Tour revealed today a new performance-based prize initiative named Course Record in collaboration with Nexo. The prize initiative will commence tomorrow, 7th August, and run through to 10th August in Aberdeen, Scotland. Trump International Golf Links, inaugurated by President Donald Trump with Nexo’s co-founders on July 29, will host the championship . According to Nexo, a digital asset wealth management firm, the Course Record will grant $10,000 for top record holders in the tournament maintained throughout the event period. An additional $50,000 will be issued in Nexo tokens to players who break the course records during the championship. Jamieson & Carry handcrafts the Nexo Championship Trophy Nexo revealed that the Course Record prize is conditioned to be issued if a record is broken; however, if no record is broken, the prize will be rolled over to the next eligible event. The Course Record prize would be incremented by $10,000 in the subsequent event. The prize will be eligible for tournament participants only, plus atleast 36 holes closed for weather-affected events. The championship winner will be awarded the Nexo Championship Trophy, which has been exquisitely handcrafted by the local jewellers Jamieson and Carry, signaling a bespoke symbol of heritage and Scottish craftsmanship. The previous records hold ten records achieved in 2024 and six in 2025. Antoni Trenchev, Nexo Co-Founder, noted the Course Record prize as the first one-of-a-kind award set to recur annually. He added that it combines athlete performance-driven incentives with digital asset innovation, which forms the DP World Tour and Nexo’s shared vision for innovation in the professional golf arena. Ben Cowen, Chief Tournament and Operations Officer at the DP World Tour, also commented that the prize was created to reward top performance and increase awareness. He acknowledged Nexo for supporting the initiative and extended his best wishes to the participating players. Aberdeen hosts the $400 million Nexo Golf Championship The course opened on July 29, in a gala celebration hosted by President Donald Trump, and Nexo’s co-founders were in attendance. The organizing committee believes the tournament would benefit Aberdeen economically through tourist attractions and the golf season. The Golf season reportedly generates more than $400 million annually for Scotland’s economy. The Golf Course Record initiative will run until the end of the season for the DP World Tour Championship and begin again in 2026. Last month, Nexo was named the Official Marketing Partner and Official Digital Wealth Platform of the DP World Tour until 2027. A U.S.-based Working Group developed a national vision for crypto adoption, which sees technology as the next revolution in American innovations. The group cites America’s success in the railroad and the internet, and the potential for blockchain transformation. The group also acknowledged American entrepreneurs for driving technological advancements and believes digital assets could change the system of ownership and governance across the economy. The Working Group recognized Trump as the first U.S. president to acknowledge the cryptocurrency movement publicly. They urged the Federal government to help move forward with Trump’s pledge of making America a crypto capital for the world by advocating for pro-innovation policies on digital assets and blockchain.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-06 11:56:34

And yes, some are starting to wonder, could this be the protocol that actually delivers? A Smarter System That Pays You to Participate Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) isn’t just another blockchain with big talk. It’s a decentralized financial operating system built to reward users from the moment they join. The heart of it? Proof-of-Yield, a dynamic, AI-enhanced model that automatically adjusts rewards based on network activity, energy use, and governance behavior. In simple terms: the more active, clean, and aligned the ecosystem becomes, the more participants can earn. But it’s not just about rewards. BTC3 is designed for performance, privacy, and longevity: AI Energy Efficiency: Federated oracles analyze how much energy nodes are using. Those operating with greener setups earn more. On-Chain Privacy: BTC3 uses zk-SNARK cryptography and decentralized identity, so users can prove compliance without exposing personal data. Smart Contracts with AI Agents: These aren’t static. BTC3’s contracts evolve, learn, and react to real usage patterns to maximize value. The Presale That’s Turning Heads Across Crypto While most projects talk about long-term potential, Bitcoin Swift is delivering results now. We are in Stage 3 of the presale. The price is $3, with a launch target of $15. During this phase, participants earn 121% APY through automated PoY rewards distributed at the end of every stage. With only 1 day left before Stage 3 ends and the presale closing on September 18, 2025, the momentum is undeniable. Over 1600 users have already joined. This isn’t just one of the most talked-about launches, it’s one of the fastest-moving. That reward clock doesn’t wait. Neither does Bitcoin Swift. Crypto Analysts Are Talking, and They’re Not Holding Back It’s not just early adopters watching BTC3 explode. Major influencers and analysts have released deep dives explaining why Bitcoin Swift is attracting serious attention in 2025: Crypto Show explains how BTC3 blends programmable incentives with real-world compliance and privacy. Bull Run Angel breaks down the PoY reward system and why it stands out from anything on the market. Token Galaxy highlights BTC3’s potential to become a top income-generating protocol. Crypto Sister covers how BTC3 creates a balance between privacy and programmable earnings. These aren’t empty reviews. These are full breakdowns by people who’ve seen what works and what doesn’t in this space. Backed by Trust, Built for Growth Security and legitimacy matter, and BTC3 isn’t cutting corners: Audit Solidproof confirmed the smart contract logic and risk resistance. Audit Spywolf adds another level of technical assurance. KYC verification confirms the project team’s identity and legitimacy. X is where the community tracks updates, stage progress, and ongoing news. No hype without receipts. Bitcoin Swift is proving it on-chain and off-chain. Tokenomics That Keep Paying for Decades Unlike projects that dump rewards early and fade, BTC3 was designed for long-term wealth creation. Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) has a total supply of 45 million tokens , carefully allocated to support rewards, liquidity, and strategic growth. Half of the supply, 22.5 million BTC3, is reserved for Proof-of-Yield rewards distributed over 30 years. Another 30% (13.5 million BTC3) is allocated to presale participants, who also gain early governance access. The remaining 15% is set aside for liquidity provisioning, while 5% covers additional reserves and the project team. This allocation prioritizes long-term decentralization and rewards sustainability over speculative hype. This model isn’t about short-term gains. It’s about creating wealth that lasts. Conclusion: Can Bitcoin Swift Make You Rich? If you define rich by fast pumps, BTC3 might surprise you. It’s not selling hope. It’s delivering programmable income, privacy, and AI-backed incentives that start working from day one. The market has seen hype before. Bitcoin Swift is something else entirely. It’s structured, it’s proven, and it’s paying. For those asking if Bitcoin Swift can make them rich, how long can you afford to ignore it?

Hearing Date Revealed,https://bitcoinist.com/will-brazil-make-bitcoin-history-hearing-date-revealed/,"Brazil is gearing up for a major debate on adding Bitcoin to its national coffers. Reports have disclosed that the Chamber of Deputies will hold its first public hearing on August 20, 2025. Lawmakers have set the stage for a discussion on Bill 4.501/2024, which was introduced in November 2024 by Federal Deputy Eros Biondini. The move would allow Brazil to diversify its reserve assets beyond traditional US Treasuries. Chamber Moves To Debate Bitcoin Reserve According to the Economic Development Commission, the session will begin at 4 p.m. in Plenary 5, Annex II of the Chamber of Deputies in Brasília. Federal Deputy Luiz Philippe de Orleans Bragança pressed for this hearing, signaling strong support within the legislature. Bill 4.501/2024 calls for the government to buy Bitcoin and other secure crypto assets, aiming to modernize how Brazil protects its savings. Over a dozen institutions and experts have been invited. Diego Kolling, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Méliuz, will explain how crypto fits into long-term planning. Rubens Sardenberg from Febraban will discuss banking rules. Invitations have also gone to Abcripto, the Central Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce, and Services. Their insights should cover how holding Bitcoin might affect inflation, fiscal policy, and industry growth. Brazil Strategic Bitcoin Reserve comes up for its first public hearing August 20th – $18.5b reserves could be allocated to #Bitcoin . Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies is set to hold its first public hearing on August 20, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. in Brasília to discuss Bill 4.501/2024,… — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) August 5, 2025 Experts Weigh In On Risks And Rewards Based on reports, advocates argue that Bitcoin could hedge against swings in the real and rising inflation. Critics worry about the currency’s wild price swings—Bitcoin has seen up to 30% moves in a single day. Auditors will need clear guidelines on how to record crypto on the nation’s balance sheet. Opponents will likely point to the risk of buying high and then watching prices fall. Brazil won’t be alone if it approves this plan. Texas has already set aside 10 million dollars of public money to buy BTC, after Governor Greg Abbott signed a law in June. Arizona and New Hampshire passed similar measures, though they have not yet funded any purchases. US President Donald Trump has recently signed an executive order related to crypto reserves, giving more weight to the idea of sovereign Bitcoin holdings. Future Of Sovereign Crypto Holdings France is also exploring state-run Bitcoin mining at nuclear plants to turn unused power into a revenue stream. Officials estimate that one gigawatt of extra capacity could generate up to 150 million dollars each year. Brazil has its own mix of hydropower and solar farms with seasonal overflow. If the government backs a Bitcoin reserve and also explores pairing mining operations with clean-energy plants, it could turn wasted power into a revenue stream.

Analyst Shows Game Plan For BTC",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-100000-or-122000/,"Crypto analyst Mark Cullen has laid out the game plan for the Bitcoin price amid the flagship crypto’s choppy price action. Based on his analysis, BTC could either crash to $100,000 or rally to $122,000, close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $123,000. The Game Plan For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Mark Cullen shared what he described as the ‘Bitcoin game plan.’ He noted that BTC is filling out the inefficient area between the two previous weekly ranges. The analyst further remarked that the next move will be determined by how the Bitcoin price breaks out or breaks down from this range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Completes Inverted Head & Shoulders Pattern Above $110,000, What This Means Cullen stated that a break above $116,000 and holding above the previous range low could help the Bitcoin price build a bullish structure for a bigger squeeze to new ATHs later this month. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could first rally to around $122,000, close to its current ATH, before it breaks above to new highs. On the other hand, there is also the possibility of the Bitcoin price declining further. The analyst stated BTC is likely to crash to $100,000 if it loses the weekend low at around $111,000 and fails to attempt a reclaim of $112,000. Cullen declared that critical weeks’ price action is ahead for the flagship crypto, seeing as it is at a crossroads. It is worth mentioning that BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is one of those who believe that the Bitcoin price could still crash to $100,000. Hayes recently predicted that BTC will retest this level while ETH retests $3,000. He alluded to the tariffs as one of the reasons crypto prices would drop this low. The crypto founder also suggests that there is currently no available liquidity to boost the prices of these assets. The last time that Bitcoin was at $100,000 was towards the end of June, before it then went on to reach new all-time highs in July. BTC Could Still Drop To As Low As $95k Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as 95,000. In an X post, he noted that the last two times the weekly RSI dropped below the 14 SMA, BTC corrected by 20% to 30%. Therefore, he remarked that the flagship crypto could fall to $95,000 if history repeats itself.

What Does He Know?,https://timestabloid.com/a-whale-drops-396k-502k-xrp-limit-orders-back-to-back-what-does-he-know/,"A massive XRP accumulation move is raising eyebrows across the crypto market. As shared by crypto analyst Xaif, an anonymous whale recently executed two consecutive limit buy orders, 396,000 XRP followed swiftly by 502,000 XRP, injecting over $1.7 million into the asset. This strategic move came just days after the same trader reportedly secured $275,000 in profits. The timing and size of the trade have sparked one pressing question: What does he know? XRP Price Action: Hovering at a Critical Level As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $2.94, reflecting a mild daily pullback from intraday highs of $3.08 and lows of $2.91. Over the past week, the token has ranged between $2.83 and $3.11, battling resistance at the upper band while maintaining relatively firm support around $2.90–$2.95. Whale Watch Alert > a whale just dropped 396K & 502K $XRP LIMIT orders back-to-back $1.7M+ in buys after already bagging $275K profit a few days ago. what does he know ? pic.twitter.com/EypBH6Ax5j — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 6, 2025 Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. Short-term signals show slight bearish momentum, while long-term trends suggest underlying strength. The 14-day RSI hovers in the neutral zone, and moving averages offer no clear directional bias. A break above the $3.05–$3.10 resistance zone could open the door to further upside, but failure to hold above $2.90 risks a pullback to deeper support. Whale Strategy: Establishing Strong Support? The timing and size of the whale’s limit orders suggest calculated accumulation rather than reactive buying. Placing nearly a million XRP in buy orders just below $3.00 indicates confidence that this price zone will act as a solid base, possibly ahead of an anticipated rally. This strategy mirrors behavior seen in previous bull cycles where whales begin absorbing liquidity at key levels, positioning themselves before retail demand accelerates. Xaif’s update suggests this whale may be front-running a major move or acting on knowledge not yet priced in by the broader market. What Could Be Driving This Confidence? Several key developments may be fueling this optimism. Most notably, the August 15 SEC status update on Ripple’s legal battle looms large. If positive, the resolution could significantly clear XRP’s regulatory overhang, unlocking broader institutional participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Ripple’s growing ecosystem, bolstered by the rollout of RLUSD, tokenized treasury initiatives, and the XRPL EVM sidechain , continues to add real-world utility to the XRP Ledger. There’s also speculation surrounding an XRP spot ETF approval, with deadlines like October 17 drawing closer. Large inflows into XRP-focused investment products, alongside record accumulation by wallets holding over 1 million XRP, further support the bullish narrative. Whale wallet activity has surged recently, indicating growing conviction among major holders. Risks Remain: Can XRP Hold the Line? Despite bullish signs, XRP isn’t without risks. Should price fail to hold above the $2.90 threshold, bears could regain control, pushing price toward $2.87 or lower. Technical indicators such as the MACD and ADX on the daily chart show signs of weakening momentum. A breakdown here could shake short-term confidence and invalidate the whale’s positioning, at least temporarily. A High-Stakes Bet Worth Watching The back-to-back whale orders of 396K and 502K XRP, especially after realizing hefty profits, indicate a calculated bet that this is not the top but the foundation for another leg up. Whether based on legal, technical, or fundamental expectations, the move has placed a spotlight on the $2.90–$3.00 range as XRP’s current battleground. For traders and long-term holders alike, the message is clear: something significant may be unfolding beneath the surface. If the whale is right, these orders could mark the beginning of XRP’s next major breakout. If not, they may signal misplaced optimism ahead of incoming volatility. Either way, the market is watching.

While some analysts predict a price pump to $0.50 for the meme coin, others warn of a bearish scenario in the short term. The Whales Go Wild After its impressive performance towards the end of July, Dogecoin’s price headed south lately and currently trades at around $0.20 (per CoinGecko’s data). However, the recent actions of the large investors (known as whales) signal that another resurgence could be incoming. The popular analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X that such market participants have accumulated one billion DOGE in the past 24 hours. The stash equals roughly $200 million, and this cohort of investors now collectively holds 72.64 billion tokens (almost 50% of the meme coin’s circulating supply). Purchases of that type reduce the amount of coins in the open market and may trigger a price rally (assuming demand doesn’t decline). Additionally, small players might take this as an encouraging sign and follow suit. It is a common theory that whales have access to insider information about key events that could influence the market, which may explain their sudden buying or selling efforts. One potential development that might have a positive impact on Dogecoin’s valuation is the approval of the first spot DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Some of the companies willing to introduce such an investment vehicle include Bitwise, 21Shares, and Rex Shares. The odds of a green light before the end of 2025 stood at 56% on August 3, but in the following days they sharply increased to the current 74%. DOGE ETF Probability, Source: Polymarket The question now is whether the whales have filled their bags in anticipation of a final “yes” from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or if there’s another motive behind their move. The Next Targets DOGE remains one of the most talked-about topics in the crypto community, with many envisioning major gains in the near future . X user Marcus Corvinus described the meme coin as “the real silent killer,” claiming it is “way undervalued” compared to its peak levels from 2024 and its ATH in 2021. The analyst cited Dogecoin’s bullish structure and certain chart patterns to predict a rise to almost $0.50 in the coming months. Others made more bearish forecasts. The X user Astekz argued that DOGE’s current condition looks “horrendous.” They assumed that bulls might get lucky with a 20% move to the upside, but after that, the price might plunge substantially.

What has been driving ETH price action? We believe it is the combination of tokenization and stablecoins interacting with ETH price ascension, to drive buying activity. HBAR climbed +70% in July on a wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization. Crypto markets rebounded in July as regulatory momentum in Washington accelerated, Ethereum surged on tokenization and stablecoin demand, and exchanges filed for broad new crypto ETP approvals. Regulatory momentum in Washington accelerated in July, with a string of major crypto announcements this week following the earlier passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts. Major Crypto Announcements This Past Week July 29, 2025 – SEC clears in‑kind ETP transactions : Spot bitcoin and ether funds can now issue and redeem shares directly in crypto rather than cash, a shift expected to boost liquidity and align them with commodity ETFs. July 30, 2025 – White House publishes 160‑page digital‑asset report : The President’s Working Group outlined a unified regulatory framework, signaling federal support for innovation alongside new guardrails. July 30, 2025 – Cboe, Nasdaq, NYSE seek generic ETP standards : The exchanges proposed rules allowing faster approval of crypto funds without case‑by‑case SEC sign‑offs, potentially opening the door to dozens of new products. July 31, 2025 – SEC unveils “Project Crypto” : Chair Paul Atkins proposed a broad overhaul of U.S. crypto oversight aimed at enabling tokenization of traditional assets and integrating on‑chain markets into existing financial rules. Collectively, these steps mark a shift toward institutionalization, with U.S. policymakers laying the groundwork for a more mature and accessible digital‑asset market.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. BTC volatility dropped to 33%, the lowest since summer 2024. This was partly seasonal but also reflects structural demand: ETPs bought 42K BTC in June and BTC treasury firms added another 68K, more than offsetting June’s 13.5K BTC mined. This steady absorption suppresses volatility by providing a consistent bid. July was a strong month for crypto with BTC ( BTC-USD ) (+9%) and many altcoins exceeding BTC’s returns as exemplified by MVSCLE’s (+34%) performance in July. While XRP ( XRP-USD ) (+38%), ADA ( ADA-USD ) (+33%), and Sui ( SUI-USD ) (+35%) were big winners, the most notable performer was ETH ( ETH-USD ) (+50%). After many agonizing months of ETH’s weakness relative to BTC and ETH/BTC breaking 5 yr lows, ETH rallied (+50%) in dollar terms in July and (+38%) relative to BTC. Besides the technical rebound, ETH’s price performance was catalyzed by strong ETP inflows. In July, spot ETH ETP net flows were $4.7B which is just over half all-time, cumulative inflows of $9.2B. Bitcoin net inflows remained strong with $5.9B in total, helping support positive BTC price action. On a relative basis, ETH inflows absorbed 1% of total ETH spot market capitalization while BTC’s were only 25bps.

We believe it is the combination of tokenization and stablecoins interacting with ETH price ascension, to drive buying activity. Many who have missed out on BTC’s run are drawn to ETH’s positive price action, noticing that it is below its all-time highs as BTC establishes new peak prices. Others are encouraged by the monstrous returns offered by CRCL ( CRCL ), (+500%), since its IPO in June. In July, news emerged that several important financial institutions were taking an active interest in stablecoins and tokenization in the Ethereum ecosystem. These included Robinhood launching 200+ tokenized stocks and ETFs on an Arbitrum L2, eToro’s ( ETOR ) announcing the upcoming rollout of 100 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs on Ethereum L1, and Kraken unveiling 24/5 tokenized equity trading. Some of this jubilance spilled over into ETH’s price action. As Ethereum ecosystem is responsible for 62% of all stablecoin value transfer thus far in 2025 and holds 71% of all assets locked in DeFi, it appears to be the target blockchain for the tokenization and stablecoin efforts of major financial institutions. Ethereum’s revenue also had a strong July (+23% MtM) as DEX Volumes climbed (+8% MtM) and TVL jumped (+39% MtM). As a consequence, Ethereum overtook Solana to jump into third place amongst the top revenue producing blockchains.

Currently, we track eight significant ETH Digital Asset Treasuries (DATS) that hold roughly 1.46M ETH. The largest, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, owns 625K ETH valued at about $2.4B, almost half the DAT total. When corporates that simply keep ETH on their balance sheets are added, institutional treasury reserves reach 2.3M ETH. Combining DATs, treasuries, and exchange‑traded products (ETPs), institutions control 8.2M ETH, or 6.8% of circulating supply. By contrast, Bitcoin’s institutional share is 15.6% and to match it, ETH treasuries would have to expand 4.5x and ETH ETPs 1.4x. For Solana, treasuries and ETPs hold Despite the positive price action for ETH as ETH DATs multiply and mature, several potentially bearish catalysts materialized on Ethereum’s blockchain in July. Over the past few weeks, the exit queue for validators has 24x’d its normal amount to reach 24.2k validators holding 774k in ETH. This is the largest figure in the history of Ethereum and has created a backlog that will last just under 12 days. Realistically, this exit line represents a small portion of total staked ETH, just 2%, but has coincided with other interesting on-chain developments. The Ethereum whale, Justin Sun, also withdrew about $600M worth of ETH from AAVE which corresponds to ~5% of supply and caused ETH borrow rates to spike to above 9% several times.

While some suppose the validator unwind presages sell pressure, many contend that those unwinding their validators may not be selling their ETH positions. Instead, many validator companies may be reducing their validator count to consolidate operations and reduce overhead expenses. The catalyst for this consolidation can be traced to Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade in May which increased the maximum ETH per validator from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Additionally, the outflow of staked ETH is somewhat offset by an inflow of 390K ETH that backs validators seeking to join the Ethereum network. In fact, as of July 14, just before the mass withdrawals of ETH, staked ETH reached a record 36.4M ETH. Going forward, we see positive developments persisting for Ethereum as the community appears aligned in increasing Ethereum’s throughput. For example, in July, 47% of the validators backed a proposal to increase Ethereum’s gas limit from 36M to 45M which increases transaction capacity by 25%. Even with the increase in throughput, Ethereum’s average transaction price, in USD, was (+14%) higher than it was in May and reached the highest average, $1.04, since February 2025. ETH Volatility at its Lowest Levels Since Fall 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 7/31/2029. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. July’s positive crypto price action has sucked the wind out of volatility’s sails. While a summer decline in volatility is typical across all risk assets, July is noteworthy for the persistence of BTC’s volatility drop. BTC and ETH dropped to their lowest volatility levels since fall 2024. In fact, BTC’s volatility has been hovering near its lowest reading ever. We attribute this development to the net buying from both ETPs and Digital Asset Treasuries (DATS) buying both BTC and ETH. However, we believe this volatility vacation is short-lived and believe the fall will bring greater levels of uncertainty, which will translate into price variance. Over the medium term, we suspect that the DATs have the potential to add substantial volatility if there is a sustained digital asset sell off. HBAR Rallies on Momentum HBAR ( HBAR-USD ) climbed +70% in July on a wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre chose Hedera for Project Acacia, a six‑month pilot that tests how tokenized assets and a wholesale CBDC could settle on distributed ledgers. Nineteen live pilots and five proofs of concept will cover assets such as fixed income, carbon credits, and private‑market securities. Hedera’s new private‑network product, HashSphere, lets institutions trial tokenization, AI, and digital‑asset workflows in a compliant environment while staying interoperable with the public chain. At the same time, Hedera became core infrastructure in EQTY Lab’s secure‑AI initiative with Nvidia ([[NVDA]], [[NVDA:CA]]), SCAN UK, and Accenture Public Sector. The project uses NVIDIA Blackwell confidential computing to govern autonomous AI agents; Hedera records cryptographic proofs of agent actions and verifies compliance with legal and geographic policies. Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money‑market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still pre‑launch interest in real‑world‑asset tokenization on the network. Network Activity and DeFi Growth Hedera’s onchain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.

DeFi TVL and Stablecoins Up: The total value locked in Hedera DeFi protocols jumped ~50% in July, reaching ~$146 million, +82% MoM.

July saw the launch of the Hello Future: Origins global hackathon, a three-part saga offering a total of $550,000 in prizes to Hedera builders. The first stage in late July attracted participants worldwide to innovate on Hedera for $150,000 in prizes. Expanding Access and Legitimacy Grayscale Inclusion: In early July, Grayscale added HBAR to its Smart Contract Platform Select Fund, assigning it a 5.8% weight. Robinhood U.S. Listing: HBAR gained broader retail access when Robinhood enabled trading for U.S. users in late July (following its earlier EU listing).

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Solana’s Outperformed Bitcoin in July, But Awaits Catalysts In January 2025 SOL price spiked to an all-time high of $262.50 as memecoin speculation blossomed and many considered Solana the epicenter of on-chain trading. In January 2025, despite being a “low-cost blockchain,” Solana was producing more revenue from transactions fees than the next four largest blockchains combined. If we count MEV, or maximal extracted value, Solana was likely producing at least 4x the total revenue of all other chains put together. However, since it’s the start of the year, SOL (-8%) has underperformed BTC (+26%), ETH (+13%), XRP (+48%) and even XLM (+23%). While this is partly due to SOL price reliance on expectations of unsustainable levels of memecoin trading, Solana’s status as the king of on-chain trading has been usurped by Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid was able to capture much of Solana’s momentum, and likely Solana’s market capitalization, because it offers a simple, highly functional product. Thus, Hyperliquid has poached high value users from Solana and has retained them. For a long time, the bull case on Solana was that it boasted a strong ecosystem of builders who could utilize Solana’s best in class transaction processing capabilities. As a result, trading would continue to thrive on Solana. However, Solana has not delivered meaningful improvements to boost its user experience, specifically in perpetual futures trading (perps), and Hyperliquid stepped up with a better product. The Firedancer developer team, tasked with making revolutionary improvements in Solana’s capabilities, could not meet production deadlines for upgrades to Solana’s core software. Firedancer was not only supposed to expand Solana’s throughput, but also make it provably reliable. Neither goal has been accomplished. At the same time, some of the most important developers left Firedancer and disputes over the quality of Firedancer’s codebase boiled over into public disputes. Some would even argue that the team chosen to improve Solana’s architecture, crack software engineers from the HFT hegemon Jump Trading, were ill-suited to improve Solana. While the Anza team has picked up the slack, the failure of Firedancer has manifested a market poltergeist who is suppressing SOL’s price. Solana’s key differentiating factor compared to Ethereum is its ability to handle more transaction bandwidth. But this advantage only matters if Solana can capture the activity driving current excitement around blockchain. This enthusiasm revolves around financial institutions deploying to blockchain, but many are hesitant to deploy to Solana due to its reliability issues. Thus far, Solana has not been able to make a strong case that it will be important to either the businesses with blockchain plans or to investors who want to profit from the blockchain revolution. Luckily, nothing is set in stone, but we are rapidly approaching the event horizon point for blockchain deployment decisions. Most major financial players still refer to blockchain in the abstract and committed their efforts to one blockchain ecosystem. It is generally assumed that there will be a mix of private ledgers and public ledgers operating in unison. The Ethereum community believes that by default, these banks will choose Ethereum for public exchange of value and L2s for internal remittances. Since this issue is not settled, Solana has a chance to make its case for why it should be the preferred chain of choice. To accomplish this, its community and development team should focus on messaging not only around its capabilities, but also its long-term stability. Ethereum Could Still Emerge as a Better Store of Value Than Bitcoin Alternative digital asset treasuries are growing rapidly, and the most common assets chosen are BTC and ETH. Initially, entities opted to choose BTC because of its strong store of value properties created through its ossified economic policies. The lynchpin of this policy structure is BTC’s predictable issuance that results in a finite total supply. More recently, DATs have emerged that focus on Ethereum. These upstart DATs believe ETH is a better asset for running a digital treasury because savvy firms can engage in exotic financial activities to accumulate ETH at a faster rate than they could BTC. While BTC treasuries can increase their BTC holdings by financing additional purchases, conducting sophisticated options strategies, or lending out their BTC, ETH treasuries have greater flexibility. ETH DATs can replicate BTC DAT financial strategies and also stake their Ethereum to receive Ethereum network revenues and inflationary issuance. Additionally, they can participate in DeFi to achieve additional income. Lost in the discussion, however, are the basic principles that govern Ethereum vs Bitcoin. Paradoxically, Ethereum may arrive at an economic system that favors its tokenholders more than Bitcoin’s. Ethereum, who turned 10 years old on July 30th, 2025, began with much higher inflation than BTC’s, 14.4% vs. 9.3%. However, Ethereum made two major economic policy changes that set it upon the path towards a lower inflation rate than that of Bitcoin. The first adjustment was EIP 1559 which was instituted in August 2021 and created the “burn” of ETH base transaction fees. The consequence of this change is that increases in Ethereum activity cause the total amount of ETH supply to decrease. The second, substantial policy change was the transition of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). Called “the Merge,” the transition occurred in September 2022. The Merge allowed Ethereum to reduce its inflation issuance from ~13,000 ETH/day to ~1,700 ETH/day because it no longer needed to compensate the miners who secured its network. The result was that by March 8,2023, Ethereum’s inflation rate dropped below that of BTC’s. Since that date, ETH’s supply has grown only (+0.2%) while BTC’s has grown (+3%). In fact, the combination of these two monetary upgrades led to temporary reductions in Ethereum’s ETH supply. Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). ETH Inflation Dropped Below BTC's on March 8, 2023 Source: Glassnode as of 7/31/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein However, the superiority of ETH’s inflationary policy may be short lived. Bitcoin’s halving in April 2024 predictably dropped its inflation rate by (-50%). Currently, ETH’s annual inflation over the last year is (+0.38%) vs BTC’s at (+0.84%). Over the course of the next few halvings, BTC’s inflation rate will approach (+0%). Conversely, Ethereum’s rate is hard to predict and may be as high as (+0.5%) or it may be negative. Even if ETH’s current inflationary trajectory remains unchanged, BTC’s will not be lower until 2028. One very underappreciated dynamic is the issue of the Bitcoin’s security budget. Bitcoin maintains inflationary issuance as an incentive to miners and without it, would have to rely upon network transaction fees. In the last year, miners made $278M from transaction fees and $14.64B in network inflation. Clearly, the economics of miners would have to radically adjust if they had to rely upon transaction fees alone. As the halvings occur, BTC’s price must increase to make up for the difference of reduced network inflation to keep miners economically viable. If this price trajectory does not occur, the network’s security may have to adopt a different economic model. There are many potential solutions to this problem and any change will not have a terminal impact on Bitcoin. But the economic policy adjustment will have winners and losers. For example, one option to traverse the security budget dilemma would be for Bitcoin to introduce inflation through a hard fork. Regardless of its implementation, it would undercut one of its community’s core critiques of Ethereum which is that Ethereum’s economic policy is too malleable. More importantly, it would subject BTC holders to a taxation that would favor miners. These political-economic decisions are not zero-sum games and Bitcoin’s system centered around miners favors their interests over token holders. In proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum, token ownership dictates which fork the validators will follow because stake will migrate to validators who choose the preferred forks. By contrast, Bitcoin’s fork choice rule is ultimately decided by the miners and nodes who secure the network. By identity, there is a substantial conflict of interest which favors people whose interest lies in selling BTC to fund their operations. Ethereum, under PoS, lacks this dynamic. While there are inherent economic tradeoffs with each system, ETH’s set of tradeoffs favor the holders of ETH because they ultimately decide network direction. Though BTC holders do have sway on Bitcoin’s network, their ability to influence the progression of the network is far limited compared to ETH holders’ domestic sway. As such, ETH may yet prove to be a better asset than BTC. Disclosures Index Definitions S&P 500 Index: is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.

For those deeply invested in the principles of decentralization and user sovereignty, akin to the ethos found in the cryptocurrency world, the emergence of a new European Search Index presents an exciting development. Qwant and Ecosia, two prominent European search engines, have joined forces to launch Staan, a groundbreaking initiative designed to challenge the long-standing reign of Big Tech giants like Google and Bing. This collaborative effort aims to provide a search experience that is not only more affordable but, crucially, more aligned with user privacy and European values. Unveiling Staan: A Bold European Search Index On a recent Wednesday, the digital world witnessed the official debut of Staan, the fruit of a joint venture between France’s privacy-focused search engine, Qwant, and Germany’s non-profit, environmentally conscious search engine, Ecosia. This collaboration, officially known as European Search Perspective (EUSP), marks a pivotal moment in the quest for digital independence. The core mission of Staan is straightforward: to offer a viable, cheaper, and privacy-centric alternative to the dominant search infrastructures. The ambition is substantial, with EUSP aiming to power approximately 50% of French search queries and 33% of German queries by the close of the year. This isn’t merely about creating another search engine; it’s about building a foundational digital infrastructure that champions user rights and regional autonomy. The development of Staan represents a concerted effort to foster a truly European digital ecosystem, reducing reliance on external technologies that may not always align with the continent’s stringent privacy regulations or strategic interests. By developing their own index, Qwant and Ecosia are taking a concrete step towards diversifying the global search market and offering consumers and businesses a meaningful choice. This move is particularly resonant in an era where data privacy and digital sovereignty are increasingly becoming global concerns. Privacy at the Core: A New Standard for the Privacy Search Engine At the heart of Staan’s proposition lies an unwavering commitment to privacy. In an age where personal data is often commodified and tracked, the concept of a truly Privacy Search Engine is more vital than ever. Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, emphasized this commitment, stating that Staan, combined with Europe’s robust privacy laws, can offer a significantly more privacy-friendly search solution compared to its U.S. counterparts. This isn’t just a marketing slogan; it’s a fundamental architectural principle embedded within the index’s design. Here’s how Staan aims to redefine privacy in search: No User Tracking: Unlike many mainstream search engines that build extensive user profiles based on search history and online behavior, Staan is designed to minimize or eliminate such tracking. Data Minimization: The index aims to collect only the essential data required to deliver search results, adhering strictly to the principle of data minimization. European Data Sovereignty: By hosting and processing data within Europe, Staan ensures that user information is subject to European Union’s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), providing a higher level of protection. Transparency: The joint venture is committed to greater transparency regarding how its index operates and how user data (or lack thereof) is handled. For users, this means a search experience free from targeted ads based on their queries, a reduction in the digital footprint they leave behind, and greater peace of mind regarding their online activities. For businesses and developers, it means the ability to integrate search functionalities that respect their users’ privacy, building trust and fostering stronger relationships. Economical Edge: Powering AI and Search at a Fraction of the Cost Beyond privacy, Staan offers a compelling economic advantage, particularly relevant in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. As AI Search Technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, the underlying data and search infrastructure required to power it can be prohibitively expensive. This is where Staan truly shines, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative for various applications, especially AI chatbots. Kroll highlighted the significant cost disparity, noting, “If you’re using ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, they all do knowledge grounding with web search our index can power deep research and AI summary features. Google and Bing’s solutions are also pricey, and our index can offer power search features at a tenth of the cost.” This remarkable cost efficiency could be a game-changer for startups, developers, and even larger enterprises looking to integrate robust search capabilities into their AI models without incurring exorbitant expenses. Consider the financial implications: Reduced Operational Costs: For companies developing AI applications that rely on real-time web data, switching to Staan could drastically cut their infrastructure expenses. Democratizing AI Development: Lower costs mean that smaller teams and individual developers can access high-quality search indexing, fostering innovation and reducing barriers to entry in the AI space. Competitive Advantage: Businesses adopting Staan for their AI solutions could gain a significant cost advantage over competitors still reliant on more expensive traditional providers. This economic benefit extends beyond AI, making Staan an attractive option for any application requiring a robust and affordable search backbone. Beyond Traditional Search: Staan’s Vision for AI Search Technology The ambitions for Staan extend far beyond merely serving standard web queries. Both Qwant and Ecosia are already leveraging, or planning to leverage, Staan to enhance their AI Search Technology features. Qwant is currently using the new index to power some of its innovative functionalities, such as AI summaries for search results, providing users with quick, concise overviews of complex topics. Ecosia also has plans to integrate similar AI-driven features into its platform in the near future. Furthermore, EUSP is actively engaging in discussions with companies to promote the adoption of its index for enabling search within various applications. A key target market for this expansion is AI chatbots. By offering Staan as a cheaper and more private alternative to established search providers, EUSP aims to become the go-to knowledge grounding source for these conversational AI systems. This means that when you ask an AI chatbot a question, its answer could soon be powered by the Staan index, ensuring a more private and potentially more diverse range of information sources. The integration with AI chatbots signifies a strategic move to position Staan not just as a consumer-facing search engine but as a fundamental component of the broader AI infrastructure, providing the raw data and context necessary for AI models to deliver accurate and relevant responses. Building a Resilient European Tech Stack: Challenging Big Tech Alternatives The launch of Staan is deeply rooted in a broader vision: the development of a resilient European tech stack that reduces dependence on technology originating from the U.S. or China. This strategic imperative is gaining increasing urgency, especially in light of recent geopolitical events. The companies articulated this sentiment clearly in a statement: “The timing could not be more urgent. The outcome of the 2024 U.S. election has reminded European policymakers and innovators just how exposed Europe remains when it comes to core digital infrastructure. Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, putting entire sectors – from journalism to climate tech – at the mercy of political or commercial agendas.” This push for digital sovereignty aligns with efforts by other European entities, such as Proton, to build independent technological foundations. Staan represents a significant step towards creating genuine Big Tech Alternatives that are not only technologically robust but also ethically aligned with European values of privacy, open standards, and fair competition. The goal is to ensure that critical digital infrastructure remains within European control, safeguarding against potential external influences or disruptions that could impact vital sectors. The implications of this strategy are far-reaching: Enhanced Cybersecurity: Reducing reliance on foreign infrastructure can bolster Europe’s digital security posture. Economic Resilience: Fostering homegrown tech solutions creates jobs, stimulates innovation, and keeps digital value creation within the continent. Policy Alignment: A European tech stack ensures that digital services and data processing adhere to European laws and societal norms. This initiative is not just about search; it’s about laying the groundwork for a more independent and robust digital future for Europe. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities for Staan While the launch of Staan is a monumental achievement, the path ahead for Qwant Ecosia Staan will undoubtedly present both challenges and immense opportunities. Competing with entrenched giants that have decades of market dominance and vast resources is no small feat. However, Staan’s unique value proposition provides a strong foundation. Comparison: Staan vs. Traditional Search Engines Feature Staan (Qwant & Ecosia) Traditional Search Engines (e.g., Google, Bing) Data Privacy High (No user tracking, GDPR compliant, European data hosting) Variable (Extensive user profiling, global data centers, different regulatory frameworks) Cost for API/AI Integration Low (Reported 1/10th the cost for AI grounding) High (Premium pricing for extensive API usage) Data Sovereignty European-controlled infrastructure Primarily U.S.-controlled infrastructure Focus Privacy, sustainability, European independence, cost-effectiveness Market share, ad revenue, broad ecosystem integration AI Integration Designed for cost-effective AI grounding and summaries Extensive AI capabilities, but potentially higher cost for external use Benefits for Users and Developers The advent of Qwant Ecosia Staan offers distinct advantages: For Users: A more private and secure search experience, reduced digital footprint, and potentially less biased search results due to a focus away from ad revenue models. For Developers: Access to a cost-effective, privacy-respecting search index for integrating into applications, especially AI chatbots. This enables innovation without prohibitive licensing fees. For Businesses: The opportunity to build services that align with growing consumer demand for privacy and data protection, potentially opening new market segments. For Europe: Strengthened digital infrastructure, reduced reliance on external powers, and a boost to the continent’s tech sovereignty. The primary challenge will be achieving widespread adoption. Building a superior index is one thing; convincing millions of users and thousands of developers to switch from established habits and ecosystems is another. However, the increasing global awareness of privacy issues and the growing need for cost-effective AI solutions provide a strong tailwind for Staan’s success. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the European Search Perspective? The immediate goals for EUSP are clear: to expand their market share in France and Germany and to continue refining the Staan index. Beyond that, the potential for Staan is vast. As the digital economy increasingly relies on sophisticated search and data grounding for AI, Staan could become a crucial backend provider for a multitude of applications across various industries. Discussions with companies to spur adoption for in-app search and chatbot integration are already underway, indicating a proactive approach to market penetration. The success of Staan will not only validate the vision of a truly independent European tech stack but also serve as a powerful example of how collaboration and a focus on core values like privacy and cost-efficiency can challenge even the most dominant players in the global tech arena. The journey of Staan will be closely watched by innovators and policymakers alike, as it represents a significant step towards a more diverse and resilient global digital infrastructure. Conclusion: A Landmark Step Towards a Decentralized Digital Future The launch of Staan by Qwant and Ecosia is more than just the debut of a new search index; it’s a bold declaration of independence in the digital realm. By prioritizing privacy, offering significant cost advantages, and strategically positioning itself within the burgeoning AI landscape, Staan is set to become a formidable force.

Bitcoin — An Offer You Can’t Refuse. pic.twitter.com/XEWWt2ZTXu — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 4, 2025 Una frase emblematica, presa in prestito dal celebre film Il Padrino , che per Saylor riassume alla perfezione il valore irrinunciabile di Bitcoin.Il messaggio ha fatto rapidamente il giro dei social, riaccendendo i riflettori sulle colossali operazioni crypto della società e sulle previsioni audaci di Saylor per il futuro del re delle criptovalute. Acquisti aggressivi di Bitcoin Secondo quanto riportato, Strategy ha appena acquistato 21.021 BTC per un valore complessivo di circa 2,46 miliardi di dollari, a un prezzo medio di 117.256 dollari per coin. Con questa operazione, il patrimonio in Bitcoin della società è salito a 628.791 BTC . Agli attuali livelli di mercato, queste riserve valgono circa 71,4 miliardi di dollari , una cifra che rafforza ulteriormente il ruolo dominante di Strategy nel panorama degli investitori istituzionali in Bitcoin. Dall’inizio dell’anno, grazie alla costante ascesa dei prezzi, la società ha registrato un rendimento del 25% sulle proprie riserve in BTC. Bitcoin come “un’offerta troppo allettante”: Saylor torna a far parlare di sé Michael Saylor non è mai stato timido quando si tratta di usare parole forti. Ha definito Bitcoin come “uno sciame di calabroni cibernetici al servizio della dea della saggezza, che si nutrono del fuoco della verità”. Parole che non sembrano uscite da un white paper tecnico, ma da un poema mistico. L’obiettivo è chiaro: per Saylor, Bitcoin non è solo codice o denaro digitale. È una forza destinata a cambiare radicalmente il modo in cui le persone risparmiano e spendono. Holding istituzionali in ascesa Strategy non è l’unica società quotata a costruirsi un maxi-portafoglio crypto. Giganti come iShares ETF di BlackRock e i trust di Grayscale detengono anch’essi porzioni significative dell’offerta totale di BTC. Nel complesso, questi attori istituzionali controllano circa un quarto di tutti i Bitcoin in circolazione – un livello di concentrazione mai visto prima. Solo pochi anni fa, nessuna istituzione arrivava a possedere più che una piccola frazione. Oggi, invece, tesorerie aziendali e fondi d’investimento sono diventati protagonisti assoluti. Prezzo stabile, ma rischio elevato L’interesse istituzionale ha contribuito a smorzare la volatilità di Bitcoin. I grandi acquirenti tendono a mantenere le posizioni anche nei momenti turbolenti, e i loro ordini costanti aiutano a colmare i vuoti lasciati dai trader più piccoli. Ma concentrare così tanto capitale su un singolo asset non è privo di rischi. Un improvviso calo del prezzo potrebbe avere un impatto enorme sul bilancio di Strategy. I guadagni su carta possono svanire in poche ore se cambia il sentiment del mercato – ma questa è un’altra storia. Per Saylor, citare Il Padrino non è solo una trovata scenica. È una dichiarazione d’intenti. Con un’offerta fissa e una domanda in costante aumento, Bitcoin rappresenta – ai suoi occhi – un’offerta troppo buona per essere rifiutata.",Uncategorized|bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 12:11:48

This move represents a marked shift in Ripple’s operational structure, focusing not on traditional banking services but on positioning itself at the core of next-generation financial infrastructure. According to Diana, the filing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reveals that the trust bank will not provide consumer-facing services like checking accounts, mortgages, or branch locations. Instead, its mission is specific and targeted—to operate the new rails of money through technologies powered by XRP and RLUSD. The bank’s design centers around institutional liquidity, real-time global settlement, and direct engagement with U.S. financial systems. RIPPLE IS BUILDING A BANK — AND IT’S NOTHING LIKE WALL STREET EXPECTED Inside Ripple’s National Trust Bank Play & What It Means for XRP, RLUSD, and the Future of Global Finance #XRP #Ripple #RLUSD #Crypto pic.twitter.com/dOKqykkmHt — Diana (@InvestWithD) August 5, 2025 Understanding the National Trust Bank Structure Diana elaborates on the nature of a national trust bank, emphasizing that it is a federally regulated institution that holds full fiduciary powers. However, unlike conventional banks, it does not engage in retail deposits or loans. Ripple’s trust bank is being structured not to compete with legacy financial institutions on their terms, but to serve as a compliant, tech-forward alternative geared toward enterprise-grade asset management and payment operations. The bank is expected to manage digital asset reserves, particularly XRP and the RLUSD stablecoin. Through its federal charter, Ripple gains potential access to critical U.S. financial networks such as FedWire and ACH, allowing it to bypass traditional intermediaries in the settlement process. The underlying architecture will enable fast and final settlement of institutional payments, aiming to remove delays and costs often imposed by legacy systems. Strategic Implications for XRP, RLUSD, and Institutional Finance The creation of Ripple National Trust Bank appears to be a foundational step in Ripple’s broader financial strategy. Diana outlines several operational goals Ripple aims to achieve through this initiative. These include establishing institutional liquidity pools for XRP, maintaining stable RLUSD reserves, enabling real-time bank-to-bank payments without traditional banks, and supporting a 24/7 global settlement framework. If approved, Ripple would gain the ability to directly convert fiat currencies into RLUSD, eliminating reliance on correspondent banks and enabling cost-efficient transfers with transaction finality. This would strengthen XRP’s role as a bridge asset and enhance RLUSD’s utility in settlements. According to Diana, this charter could also enable Ripple to set new standards in custody, compliance, and risk management, offering institutional-grade safeguards for digital asset operations. The confidential section of Ripple’s filing is expected to include strategic plans related to liquidity partnerships, Fed system integrations, and long-term expansion in digital finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Broader Timing and Regulatory Landscape The timing of Ripple’s application coincides with its recent launch of RLUSD and the evolving regulatory framework for crypto within the United States. Diana notes that Ripple is strategically aligning its operations with emerging U.S. legislation that supports on-chain banking innovations. By acting early, Ripple aims to secure a leading role in modern financial services before traditional institutions adapt or new entrants attempt to do so. The public filing with the OCC includes details such as the bank’s legal structure, board of directors, and NYC headquarters. However, the most critical operational plans remain confidential, possibly due to competitive sensitivities and regulatory constraints. Diana emphasizes that this level of secrecy is likely due to the depth and complexity of Ripple’s infrastructure ambitions. Control Over Infrastructure, Not Participation Diana concludes by asserting that Ripple’s application is not merely about entering the traditional banking space. Instead, it represents an effort to control the infrastructure underlying modern finance. Through the Ripple National Trust Bank, the company seeks to build and manage the digital rails that could underpin future global money movement. By combining the use of XRP for settlement and RLUSD for stable value transfers, Ripple is preparing to operate as a crypto-native institution with direct integration into the core of the U.S. financial system. This approach positions Ripple to deliver a frictionless model for institutional finance, possibly reducing reliance on legacy players while enhancing speed, transparency, and efficiency.

While these numbers are strong, other benchmarks suggest that user activity may be dwindling. Significant Dominance Data analytics firm CryptoQuant shared a report from a community analyst, @JA_Maartun, showcasing how the largest centralized exchange (CEX) is currently well ahead in futures trading volume. The $2.55 trillion in futures volume was reached last month and is the highest level recorded for Binance this year, according to CQ’s graph. The previous peaks were in January, when it hit $2.43T, and May, which recorded $2.26 trillion. This jump followed a month of volatility and price records for both Bitcoin and a few altcoins, which likely brought in more traders. OKX and Bybit also reported marginal volumes, with $929 billion and $1.09 trillion, respectively, and these figures have remained relatively similar throughout the year so far. The Changpeng Zhao-founded exchange remained the leader, by a wide margin, accounting for over half of the total volume across other major exchanges, including Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, and others. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoPotato reported that Binance was leading the charge in the derivatives market in April, and it’s evident that the momentum has remained strong. The increased levels of trading suggest that more users are participating in these markets, leveraging riskier strategies. “The increase in trading suggests more users are active again, possibly due to the recent price breakout,” – noted Maartun. What About Other Metrics? Futures volume may be booming, but other key metrics point in a different direction. As CryptoPotato outlined on Monday, a Bitcoin sell-off resulted in $1.5 billion in liquidations, and the funding rates, a fee exchanged periodically between long and short positions in a perpetual futures contract, turned negative. Negative funding rates indicate that there are more shorts than longs, which can be interpreted as more people betting on prices to fall rather than rise, which is more “risk off” sentiment. Data collected at print time from the Token Terminal also suggests a decline in interaction with Binance, with active monthly addresses dropping from approximately 800,000 at the start of June to around 340,000 at the beginning of August, representing a 57.5% decrease. Source: Token Terminal This clash of positives in negatives seems to be in line with current market sentiment, which is in a “neutral” state. It has been a mixed bag of ups and downs for cryptocurrency prices as well, with the overall crypto market cap dropping to $3.7 trillion, from the $4T it reached in July , according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This shift has sparked a mix of concern and opportunity among investors. In this article, we delve into the dynamics behind these movements and the strategic viewpoint offered by Outset PR, a firm that specializes in crypto market analytics. While some see these dips as cautionary signals, others interpret them as perfect 'buy the dip' opportunities possibly heralding the onset of a new bull market phase. This dual perspective is supported by data and insights from Outset PR , which keeps a close tab on market trends and crypto performance. Understanding XRP's Recent Market Performance Source: TradingView XRP, designed by Ripple Labs, is known for its quick and cost-effective transaction capabilities, particularly in cross-border money transfers.

Its increasing role as a bridge currency in international finance positions it as a viable contender for significant growth in upcoming market cycles. Examining Solana's Position in Current Market Trends Source: TradingView Solana, often lauded as a direct competitor to Ethereum due to its impressive transaction speeds and scalability, has also experienced a significant pullback. However, like XRP, the patterns and market behavior of Solana suggest potential for recovery and profitability. Known for its robust technology and growing adoption, particularly in decentralized applications, Solana remains a strong player in the altcoin market.

This massive cash-out, as reported by Coinglass data, indicates a notable shift in market behavior. It’s crucial for anyone following crypto market trends to understand what this means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset landscape. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Profit-Taking Surge? Recent data from Coinglass highlights a remarkable surge in realized profits among BTC holders . This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a substantial movement of capital. Specifically, the data reveals that approximately $1.01 billion in profits were taken off the table, signaling active participation in the current market dynamics . A staggering $362 million, or 35.8% of the total, came from coins held for 7 to 10 years. This particular group of long-term Bitcoin holders rarely moves their assets, making this activity particularly noteworthy. Another significant portion, around $93 million, was realized by holders who had kept their Bitcoin for 1 to 2 years. This group often includes investors who entered the market during previous bull cycles or significant dips. Understanding these different cohorts helps us decipher the motivations behind the recent Bitcoin profit-taking and its potential implications. Are Long-Term BTC Holders Signaling a Market Shift? The movement of 7-10 year old Bitcoin coins is especially intriguing. Typically, these are considered ""HODLers"" – investors committed to holding their assets for the very long term, often through multiple market cycles. When such a substantial amount from this cohort moves, it raises important questions about crypto market trends : Internal Transfers: Could these be large institutional holders rebalancing their portfolios or moving funds between different wallets? Such transfers might not signify an actual exit from the market, but rather strategic asset management. Actual Exits: Alternatively, these long-term investors might be capitalizing on current price levels, perhaps viewing them as a peak or a favorable point to de-risk. This would imply a genuine sale into fiat or other assets, potentially influencing short-term supply. This unusual activity from long-term Bitcoin holders suggests a moment of strategic decision-making, impacting overall market dynamics and investor sentiment. Understanding the Impact on Broader Crypto Market Trends When significant Bitcoin profit-taking occurs, it naturally influences broader crypto market trends . While profit realization is a healthy part of any market cycle, a large-scale event like this can have several effects: Increase Selling Pressure: More supply entering the market from long-held coins can potentially create downward price pressure, at least in the short term. This is a common reaction to large sell-offs. Indicate Market Sentiment: It can reflect a shift in sentiment, where some long-term investors believe current prices offer a good exit point. This doesn’t necessarily mean a bear market is imminent, but it signals caution among a seasoned group of investors. Provide Liquidity: On the flip side, these sales provide crucial liquidity for new investors or those looking to accumulate Bitcoin at current levels, potentially absorbing the selling pressure. Analyzing these movements helps investors gauge the overall health and direction of the market, offering valuable insights into current market dynamics . Navigating the Current Market Dynamics for BTC Holders For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these market dynamics is key. The fact that long-term BTC holders are taking profits doesn’t automatically spell doom, but it does call for informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and expert analysis to understand the nuances of these large movements. Reliable data sources are your best friend. Diversify: Consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Spreading your investments can help cushion potential impacts. Long-Term View: Remember that Bitcoin has a history of volatility. Focus on your personal investment goals rather than reacting to every short-term price swing. Patience often yields better results. This period of significant Bitcoin profit-taking offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of digital assets. It reminds us that even the most dedicated holders respond to market conditions. In conclusion, the recent realization of over $1 billion in profits by Bitcoin holders , especially from those holding for 7-10 years, marks a notable event in the crypto space. While the exact motivations behind these movements remain a subject of analysis—whether internal transfers or actual market exits—they undoubtedly contribute to the current market dynamics and influence overall crypto market trends . Staying vigilant and informed is essential for navigating these exciting yet complex times in the world of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ""Bitcoin profit-taking"" mean? A1: Bitcoin profit-taking refers to the act of selling Bitcoin (BTC) that has appreciated in value, converting it into fiat currency or other assets to realize the financial gains. It’s a common strategy for investors to lock in profits. Q2: Why is it significant that long-term BTC holders are selling? A2: Long-term BTC holders, often called ""HODLers,"" are typically less reactive to short-term price movements. Their decision to sell can indicate a belief that current prices are highly favorable, or it might be part of a larger portfolio rebalancing strategy. It’s an unusual event that draws market attention. Q3: Does this massive profit-taking mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? A3: Not necessarily. While large profit-taking can create short-term selling pressure, the market’s ability to absorb these sales without a significant price drop can indicate underlying strength. It provides liquidity for new buyers and can be a healthy part of market cycles. However, it’s wise to observe subsequent market reactions. Q4: How can I stay informed about these crypto market trends? A4: To stay informed, regularly check reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, analyze on-chain data (like that from Coinglass), follow expert market analysts, and consider subscribing to newsletters that provide deep dives into market behavior and market dynamics . Q5: What defines ""long-term Bitcoin"" holders in this context? A5: In this context, ""long-term Bitcoin"" holders specifically refers to those who have held their BTC for 7 to 10 years, as highlighted by the Coinglass data. These are typically early adopters or investors with a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Did you find this analysis of Bitcoin profit-taking insightful?

In July, the exchange’s futures trading volume soared to $2.55 trillion — the highest it’s been since January — marking a resurgence in market activity after a volatile summer for cryptocurrencies. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartun, this spike came in the wake of major price swings across both Bitcoin and altcoins, following the crypto market’s historic $4 trillion capitalization peak earlier in the month. The subsequent pullback did little to dampen trading enthusiasm, as increased volatility drew traders back to derivatives platforms in large numbers. Binance Not the Only One Binance wasn’t the only exchange to see action. Competitors Bybit and OKX reported significant volumes as well — $929 billion and $1.09 trillion, respectively — yet Binance remained the clear frontrunner, accounting for more than half of all derivatives trading volume across major exchanges. Binance currently supports 568 trading pairs and boasts the industry’s highest liquidity, with a daily trading volume of $82 billion. On July 18 alone, the platform recorded a four-month high of $134 billion in daily volume, according to CoinGecko. The surge in futures volume may be more than just a blip. It suggests a broader re-engagement from institutional traders and retail users alike, especially as crypto prices look to stabilize post-correction. “The increase in trading suggests more users are active again, possibly due to the recent price breakout,” Maartun said. Futures Activity Signals Institutional Engagement Futures contracts — which allow investors to bet on the future prices of assets like Bitcoin and Ether without owning them — are essential tools in price discovery. Higher volume in these markets often correlates with key trend shifts or uncertainty, as more traders express directional views. More participation in futures also hints at rising leverage, which can lead to sharper moves in spot markets when positions get liquidated. Open Interest (OI) remains elevated at around $79 billion for Bitcoin futures, per CoinGlass. While this is slightly down from its mid-July peak of $88 billion, it still represents a high level of market exposure. Should OI continue to climb unchecked , analysts warn of a potential leverage flushout — a rapid unwinding of leveraged positions — that could trigger sharp corrections in Bitcoin and altcoin prices.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binances-former-ceo-cz-files-new-request-in-ftx-case-details-here/,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has filed a motion with a US bankruptcy court to dismiss a $1.76 billion debt claim filed by the FTX bankruptcy estate. Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Requests Dismissal of FTX's $1.76 Billion Lawsuit In the court petition, Zhao argued that his residence in the United Arab Emirates meant he was outside the jurisdiction of Delaware. The petition also emphasized the international nature of the transactions, stating that US law does not apply to such cross-border situations. “The plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent transfers unlawfully seek the application of bankruptcy law abroad,” it said. Zhao isn't the first Binance-affiliated figure to question the court's authority in this complex legal process. In July, former Binance executives Samuel Wenjun Lim and Dinghua Xiao also filed similar motions to dismiss the lawsuits. The lawsuit in question was filed by FTX Trust and FTX Digital Markets Ltd. in November 2024. The lawsuit is based on Sam Bankman-Fried's July 2021 share buyback transactions from Binance, alleging that Binance and certain executives improperly transferred funds as a result of these transactions. Bankman-Fried was later convicted on fraud charges that rocked the crypto market. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Binance's Former CEO CZ Files New Request in FTX Case!

Projects and users don't need to register liquid staking transactions. The move boosts institutional confidence but faces some internal dissent. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a position statement on liquid staking, clarifying that these activities and the tokens issued by such protocols do not constitute a securities offering. According to this guidance, both projects issuing liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and users who hold or trade these assets are not required to register these transactions. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) in liquid staking protocols across multiple networks is nearly $67 billion: The SEC has previously issued similar guidance on staking, noting that while these recommendations are not binding in enforcement actions, they reflect the regulator’s overall stance. The move has been welcomed by many in the industry. Alluvial CEO Mara Schmidt told Cointelegraph, “Institutions can now confidently integrate LSTs into their products which is sure to drive new revenue streams, expand customer bases, and enable the creation of secondary markets for staked assets.” However, not all SEC Commissioners agreed with the new guidance. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw argued the recommendations were based on ”shaky facts,” said they ”only muddy the waters,” and included legal conclusions that might not be applicable in practice. Additionally, the SEC's decision comes as global regulators continue to scrutinize decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, with several countries proposing new rules on staking services. The popularity of liquid staking has surged alongside Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, increasing institutional interest in compliant DeFi solutions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 12:26:19

He thinks Ethereum has a strong chance of flipping Bitcoin in network value, driven by the rapid growth of ETH treasury companies. Bitmine, which already holds nearly 1% of all ETH, aims to secure 5% of the supply, moving much faster than Bitcoin treasury giants like MicroStrategy. According to Lee, ETH treasuries are not just asset holders. By staking their ETH, these companies become critical infrastructure for Ethereum , earning native yields and actively supporting the network. Unlike ETFs, treasury companies can accumulate ETH faster, create supply scarcity, and benefit from Ethereum's growing ecosystem of tokenized assets and real-world financial applications. Lee compared Ethereum’s current state to Bitcoin’s 2017 breakout moment, emphasizing that Wall Street hasn’t fully grasped Ethereum’s role as the backbone of tokenization, AI, and decentralized finance (DeFi) . He expects Ethereum to revisit $4,000 soon and sees potential for a price surge to $7,000–$15,000 by year-end. Long term, Lee believes Ethereum could reach 100x its current value, mirroring Bitcoin’s trajectory. While some investors worry about a potential bubble in crypto treasuries, Lee argues that as long as these companies avoid exotic debt structures and leverage, their value will grow sustainably. He dismisses rigid spreadsheet models, stating that ETH’s price will be driven by broader adoption, velocity of ETH accumulation, and the liquidity of these treasury firms. For traditional investors seeking exposure to Ethereum, treasury companies like Bitmine offer a unique route, especially for institutions unable to buy ETH directly or through ETFs. Lee points out that Bitmine’s strategy of accumulating ETH at scale, while remaining fully compliant with US regulations, positions it as a key player in Ethereum’s future. In his view, Ethereum’s undervaluation today presents a rare opportunity. As Wall Street and global institutions pivot towards blockchain, Ethereum treasuries could become the new “Exxon Mobiles” of the digital economy—valued not just for their assets, but for their role in securing and scaling blockchain infrastructure.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|ZRX|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-08-06 12:29:01
