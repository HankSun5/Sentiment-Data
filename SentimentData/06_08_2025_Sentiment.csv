This alignment establishes a robust technical foundation, indicating a potential breakout as buyers step in at this critical level. Key Support Level Near Aligning With VWAP Average In a post on X, CryptoPulse drew attention to SUI’s recent price action, noting that the token has pulled back into what is described as a “sweet spot” for potential buying opportunities. The price recently touched the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and is currently sitting directly on a critical structural support level around $3.50. Related Reading: SUI MACD Signals Massive Rally Ahead — 400% Price Surge Possible This zone has been a key area of interest for the analyst, who has been patiently waiting for SUI to reach this level before stepping in. The convergence of the VWAP and structural support creates a favorable setup that often precedes strong upward moves. Fundamentally, SUI is also gaining increasing recognition and traction within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The project’s growing presence, combined with solid chart structure, reinforces the possibility of substantial upside potential over the coming weeks and months. Currently, the analyst is actively averaging into their position, setting an initial target at $5. However, they remain optimistic that this setup can extend much further if momentum continues to build and key technical levels are broken. With both technical and fundamental factors converging, CryptoPulse views SUI as a project worth watching closely for possible significant gains ahead. SUI Chart Shows Promise, But Setup Needs Confirmation Sharing additional insights in a separate post, AlgoCats highlighted that SUI is currently showing a very promising chart setup. The analyst noted that while the structure looks favorable, they are waiting for a more defined formation to develop, which would offer a clearer signal for a long position before considering an entry point. Their target is a key resistance zone that has seen multiple wicks and a previous fake breakout, marking it as a critical level where price action could accelerate.

However, AlgoCats emphasized that patience is key, and they intend to wait for confirmation before making any move. Until that confirmation arrives, the focus remains on observing how SUI behaves around current levels. AlgoCats is prepared to act, but only when the chart provides a clean and confident signal for entry. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $3.54, demonstrating a nearly 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased significantly by more than 33% in the past day.

From presales that give you hands-on access before launch, to established names delivering consistent performance, the current market offers a mix of innovation and reliability. Whether it’s a coin redefining the presale experience, a blockchain built for speed and scalability, a community-powered token blending culture with finance, or an ecosystem mainstay that never loses relevance, each has its own story. Here’s a closer look at four standout picks making waves in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Where You Don’t Just Buy, You Feel the Trade BlockDAG is redefining what a presale can be. With its Dashboard V4, users aren’t left waiting to find out how it all works. Instead, they can log in right now and experience a fully interactive BDAG Exchange simulator. From watching the BDAG/USD price fluctuate in real time, to clicking “Buy” and seeing wallet balances update, the feeling is immediate. It’s no longer abstract. The simulation includes full BUY/SELL panels, live order books, price charts, and a market feed. This isn’t a teaser; it’s a hands-on demo that turns crypto from concept to contact. And the numbers? They match the energy. BlockDAG has already raised $363 million, sold over 24.7 billion BDAG, and is currently in batch 29 at $0.0276. That’s a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Right now, a limited window is open to buy in at $0.0016, allowing new users to secure significantly more upside. Among the top crypto coins 2025 has introduced, BlockDAG is the only one giving its users something they can feel now , not months down the line. 2. Avax: Smart Contracts with Speed and Scale Avax has carved out its position through a combination of speed, scalability, and multi-chain functionality. What users love most is how the platform balances advanced features with a relatively user-friendly experience. Transactions are confirmed in seconds, which gives it a real-world responsiveness that many platforms still struggle to match. Its ongoing development into subnets allows customized chains to run under the Avalanche umbrella, creating a network of networks. This adds utility for developers, but also gives investors confidence that the tech can scale. As we move through 2025, Avax continues to attract attention not just for performance, but for its approach to interoperability and speed. It’s earned its place on the list of top crypto coins 2025 by offering a blend of tech and usability that’s rare to find at scale. 3. Pengu: Where Culture Meets Coin Pengu isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement. Inspired by online culture and driven by a strong community, it has grown fast by doing what most coins can’t: staying lighthearted while building serious momentum. What sets Pengu apart is how emotionally connected its holders feel. The memes, the inside jokes, the vibe, it’s all part of the value. But it’s not just fluff. Pengu has rolled out staking, community rewards, and unique NFT integrations that make it feel like more than a meme coin. The roadmap includes utility-focused tools and cross-chain expansion, showing it’s aiming beyond just virality. In a market where people want both identity and opportunity, Pengu has become one of the top crypto coins 2025 by making crypto feel personal again. It’s a reminder that sometimes, fun and finance don’t have to be separate. 4. BNB: Consistency in a Volatile Market BNB has long been a staple in the portfolios of serious crypto holders. Tied to one of the largest ecosystems in the industry, it powers transactions, fuels smart contracts, and unlocks utility across a wide range of products. Even as trends shift and new coins make noise, BNB continues to show resilience. It’s used, held, and traded at volume, making it a practical choice for both experienced traders and those just entering the space. What’s powerful about BNB is its staying power. It’s not built on hype cycles or single-use cases. It’s functional, familiar, and constantly updated. For those looking for a grounded asset in their search for the top crypto coins 2025, BNB remains one of the most reliable options. Final Thoughts In 2025, the top crypto coins 2025 are defined by more than market cap or short-term gains, they’re shaped by the experience and value they deliver. BlockDAG stands out for giving users real trading interaction before launch. Avax offers a technical foundation of speed and interoperability. Pengu proves that community and culture can fuel serious growth. And BNB remains a pillar of stability in a fast-changing market. Whether you’re seeking innovation, engagement, or consistency, these coins represent strong candidates for long-term consideration. As the year unfolds, each will continue to play a unique role in shaping the crypto landscape.

With a U.S. national trust bank charter and RLUSD stablecoin integration on the horizon, institutional momentum around XRP and Litecoin is growing. These updates are sending price predictions higher for both coins. Yet it’s not just legacy assets in the spotlight—MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines, with analysts projecting a 22,400% ROI this quarter as it emerges as a new high-upside contender for investors seeking the next breakout. Ripple Bank Move Gains Traction Ripple’s bank strategy is now gaining serious momentum. With its OCC charter application for the Ripple National Trust Bank, a Federal Reserve master account pursuit, and a full suite of custodial partnerships, Ripple is placing itself at the center of institutional banking and XRP growth. The RLUSD stablecoin rollout is also primed to boost real-world payments and bank adoption of Ripple XRP. Analyst XRP price prediction calls remain positive, despite short-term pullbacks. The average forecast for August sits near $3.14, with a bullish scenario of $3.36. Fibonacci extension analysis targets $5.50 for 2025, while longer-term projections suggest a range between $4.50 and $9.00—assuming more regulatory clarity and continued institutional adoption. Ripple OCC charter news and Ripple bank partnership news are driving renewed market optimism and could set the stage for a major XRP price rally. Litecoin Price Bullish Prediction Litecoin is riding a fresh wave of optimism in the wake of Ripple news today. The current Litecoin price prediction 2025 averages $137, with a projected peak at $146.80. Institutional banking trends and the 80% odds of a Litecoin ETF approval are fueling a strong narrative for a Litecoin price boost. Analysts are watching closely for a Litecoin price rally after Ripple news, as the two coins often see correlated moves during periods of positive market sentiment. Ripple’s impact on Litecoin price is being felt through both direct institutional flows and broader altcoin performance after big ecosystem updates. For those looking at utility-focused crypto coins and cross-chain payment solutions, both XRP and Litecoin are high on the watchlist for the rest of 2025. Ripple’s Bank Strategy Sparks MAGACOIN FINANCE Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top story among traders scanning for Q3’s biggest opportunities. As Ripple’s bank strategy shakes up institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its combination of community-driven momentum and aggressive growth. Wallet growth, social chatter, and presale hype all point to explosive interest, with some analysts now calling for a staggering 22,400% ROI this quarter. This project’s appeal comes from its unique blend of real-world narrative, transparent governance, and volatility-friendly trading conditions. With the market focused on Ripple banking partnerships 2025 and the effect of bank adoption on XRP price, traders are looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for an early entry before mainstream attention hits. In a market hungry for utility-focused crypto coins and new narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is staking its claim as the next major contender for altcoin leadership in 2025. Next Moves: What to Watch as Bank News Lifts Crypto Institutional adoption and bank partnerships are reshaping the outlook for XRP and Litecoin, while Ripple ecosystem updates keep both coins near the top of analyst forecasts. Ripple’s ongoing bank strategy is boosting institutional confidence, translating to bullish calls for both price and adoption across the board. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 22,400% ROI projection, is stepping into the spotlight as the bold new pick for investors wanting high upside in a shifting market.

The company released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on Tuesday, offering two fully downloadable, customizable large language models that don’t require a license fee or API gate. Both models are text-only and are being shared under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning anyone can download the model weights from platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face. They also work on LM Studio and Ollama, and can run on everything from laptops to cloud servers. OpenAI said the models are optimized to function across a range of hardware, including consumer devices and chips from Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras, and Groq. OpenAI trained models to block malicious fine-tuning OpenAI said it delayed releasing the models to complete safety evaluations. During pre-training, the company filtered out sensitive material, specifically chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear data. It also tested scenarios where bad actors might try to fine-tune the models for malicious tasks. The company reported that none of those experiments led to models reaching its internal “high capability” threshold, a classification outlined in its Preparedness Framework, which it uses to assess harm potential. Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, told reporters, “It’s been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there.” gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!) (and a smaller one that runs on a phone). super proud of the team; big triumph of technology. — Sam Altman (@sama) August 5, 2025 He added that the company also included three external expert groups to audit and comment on the fine-tuning of safety tests. These models aren’t open-source in the traditional sense. OpenAI is only providing the model weights, not the full training code or datasets. But they are still open enough to allow users to test, fine-tune, and deploy them however they see fit. The company framed this as a middle ground between full transparency and maintaining some control. Amazon, Microsoft, and Anthropic expand AI marketplace The models will also be available through cloud platforms. Amazon , Microsoft , and Baseten are offering gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b directly to customers. This is the first time Amazon Web Services (AWS) will host OpenAI models, and they will be accessible through both Bedrock and Sagemaker. Amazon said these models will help customers build AI agents capable of advanced reasoning and step-by-step thinking. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, has positioned AWS as a marketplace where companies can pick from multiple AI providers, not just Amazon’s in-house tools. In addition to OpenAI, Amazon has also partnered with Anthropic, putting $8 billion into the AI startup. That deal lets AWS clients access Anthropic’s Claude models. On Tuesday, Anthropic said it would release a new Claude model, which it claims is better at coding, research, and data analysis than its previous versions. The release puts OpenAI in the same lane as other companies offering open-weight models, like Meta, Mistral AI (which is backed by Microsoft), and DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that previously gained attention for building an AI model with human-like reasoning. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, “OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they’re advancing innovation in open-source software.” Nvidia partnered with OpenAI to make sure the models perform well across its hardware. So did AMD, Cerebras, and Groq, giving users more flexibility when choosing where to run the models. Both gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b support chain-of-thought processing, tool usage, and tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Users can run them locally or in the cloud without needing to call an API or rely on a paid plan. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, fueled by media attention and the asset’s performance.

Often, Bitcoin’s strong performance acts as a catalyst for the entire cryptocurrency market , pulling altcoins along with it.

This significant move for BTC $114,000 underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its position at the forefront of the digital economy.

In after-hours trading, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell about 4%, as the forecast failed to meet some investor expectations, according to Reuters . Year to date, AMD shares have jumped over 40%, far outpacing a roughly 12% gain in the benchmark chip index, as investors wager on its role in the AI boom. Companies such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI rely on AMD’s advanced processors to run AI tasks. Cloud providers are increasing their spending plans to build out data-centre capacity for AI workloads. Meta recently lifted the low end of its annual capital spending range by $2 billion—to between $66 billion and $72 billion. Likewise, Microsoft projected a record $30 billion in capital outlays for the first quarter of its fiscal year to keep pace with surging AI demand. No China sales yet as licenses are still pending For the third quarter, AMD anticipates about $8.7 billion in revenue, give or take $300 million. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had an average forecast of $8.30 billion. That outlook excludes any sales from shipments of its MI308 AI chip to China, since export licenses are still under review by the U.S. government. In April, Washington imposed curbs requiring a licence to send advanced AI processors to China. The Commerce Department is now assessing AMD’s applications, and the company said it will resume those exports once approval is granted. In mid-July, the administration quietly reversed the prohibition on specially tailored, “China-compliant” chips. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Nvidia filed applications to resume H20 GPU sales , and AMD plans to seek licences for its MI308 accelerators, but approvals are still pending Over the past ten years, under CEO Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD has transformed into a major technology supplier across computing, capitalizing on Intel’s missteps to turn its own fortunes around. As a result, AMD’s market capitalization now exceeds Intel’s by about $200 billion. But Nvidia’s growth is far ahead of both companies as its dominance in AI accelerators has made it the world’s most valuable company. AMD remains the second‐largest producer of graphics chips, the foundation for data‐center AI accelerators, and its CPUs go head‐to‐head with Intel in both PC and server markets. AMD moves more manufacturing to the U.S. In May, Su described China as a “large opportunity” for semiconductors and AI, even amid tightening export rules and shifting tariff plans. “There should be a balance between export controls for national security as well as ensuring that we get the widest possible adoption of our technology,” Su told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “That’s a good thing for U.S. jobs in the U.S. economy.” She added that U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and widespread adoption “is the primary objective and a really great position for us to be in.” Su said there is a “balance to be played between” restricting chip exports and providing access to them. Meanwhile, CNBC reported Super Micro Computer Inc. shares fell 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the server maker reported disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued cautious guidance for the coming quarter. In the period ended June 30, revenue rose 7.5% year-over-year. The company projects adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.52 per share on $6 billion to $7 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated $0.59 per share on $6.6 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2026, Super Micro forecasts at least $33 billion in revenue, topping the $29.94 billion consensus. After a surge in demand during 2023 for Nvidia-equipped data-center servers used in artificial intelligence, growth has since moderated. The company dodged a Nasdaq delisting after delays in its financial filings and the departure of its auditor. As of Tuesday’s close, shares had climbed about 88% this year, while the S&P 500 gained 7%.

Now, the U.S. is turning up the scrutiny on Chinese AI startups and the people helping them on American soil. Following the arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting advanced Nvidia AI chips to China, a group of U.S. lawmakers and federal agencies has increased their scrutiny of Chinese AI activity. Separately, a group of Republican senators is also pressing the Commerce Department to evaluate the potential data security risks posed by open-source Chinese AI models like DeepSeek. U.S. senators call for an investigation into Chinese AI models On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, both 28, for allegedly violating export controls by shipping tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H100 processors, to China without the required government licenses. The chips are subject to strict export controls due to their strategic value in the development of AI technologies with potential military applications. The pair faces up to 20 years in prison under the Export Control Reform Act. According to prosecutors, Geng and Yang operated ALX Solutions Inc., a company based in El Monte, California, which they founded in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department began imposing tighter licensing requirements on AI chip exports. Investigators seized mobile phones and discovered communications that show the pair were fully aware that the company was used as a front to bypass export restrictions, routing shipments through Malaysia to disguise their final destination in China. The Justice Department noted that Yang had overstayed her visa, while Geng is a legal permanent U.S. resident. A federal judge in Los Angeles released Geng on a $250,000 bond, while a detention hearing for Yang is scheduled for August 12. No pleas have been entered in the case yet. The FBI and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security are leading the investigation . Senators target DeepSeek Seven Republican U.S. senators are urging the Commerce Department to probe DeepSeek , a Chinese open-source AI firm, for potential data security and export control violations. In a letter sent Tuesday , the senators, Todd Young, John Cornyn, John Curtis, Bill Cassidy, Marsha Blackburn, and Jon Husted, led by Sen. Ted Budd, called on the Commerce Department to assess whether Chinese AI models may be collecting data from American users and funneling it to the Chinese government or military. The letter raises several key concerns, like whether DeepSeek’s software could be transmitting U.S. personal or enterprise data back to Chinese servers, whether it has gained unauthorized access to export-controlled semiconductors, and whether it has violated terms of use for U.S.-based models to improve its own systems. The senators also referenced concerns that DeepSeek may have misappropriated U.S. AI technology, reiterating a previous statement made in January by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who vowed to impose restrictions if such violations were confirmed. U.S. officials remain skeptical of DeepSeek’s claims that its AI reasoning models were on par with, or superior to, leading U.S. models at a fraction of the cost. They still believe that the company’s success came from skimming off U.S. technologies. The Commerce Department has yet to comment on the senators’ letter or the latest criminal charges.

In a new YouTube video, Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers that if the S&P 500 (SPX) breaks out past a key resistance level, it may trigger FOMO (fear of missing out), driving Bitcoin and stocks even higher as people with cash on the sidelines rush in. “If the S&P is able to break out of this zone, break past the logarithmic resistance that spans back from the peak of 2007 – and 2009 being that low – I think we could go on a pretty significant run to the upside. And I could even say it’s severe for the bears or anyone sitting on the sideline with too much cash… Institutions, retail, no matter who it is… if they have too much still sitting on the sidelines, I think that’s where the FOMO would really kick in if we’re able to break out of this high that’s just been put in at around 6,400 points on the S&P 500.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Pizzino also shares a weekly chart showing Bitcoin’s historical price correlation with the S&P 500, suggesting the flagship crypto asset will likely print new all-time highs if the SPX logarithmic resistance level is breached. “If that occurs, Bitcoin’s price … would probably follow suit into that period.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube As of Monday’s close, the SPX is trading for 6,329. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $115,026 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours.

Traders are now targeting newer tokens with higher upside as XRP and DOGE lose momentum in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names starting to trend as funds rotate. The wider crypto market has seen a steady shake-up in recent weeks. The ETF-driven excitement of XRP is fading with declining odds as investors shift to other tokens. Meanwhile, DOGE has struggled to gain major fresh developments despite having a strong social media presence. Although altcoin rotation is nothing new, the pace of movement this time has surprised analysts. Investors are now more focused on narrative, token utility, and community strength. These shifts have helped spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE among a short list of coins that are set to explode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Steam as Traders Eye Gains XRP and DOGE funds are flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE as momentum grows around its presale. Interest in the coin is rising fast and early buyers are expecting up to 27x returns on initial investment. Traders say the timing is right—XRP hype is cooling, and DOGE lacks a clear path to new highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh narrative that ties political energy with meme coin appeal. Its capped supply model and strong branding makes it stand out in the presale market. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself to attract both crypto natives and new investors unlike other tokens that launch without structure. The project blends cultural relevance with smart economics. Its presale is already drawing in whales and retail holders. Wallet data shows presence of large flows from existing large-cap tokens into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The flow could mirror early SHIB cycles when capital moved quickly into high-upside opportunities. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to sell out ahead of schedule. Meme Coins Lose Momentum as Traders Search for the Next Big Run DOGE and SHIB kicked off the last meme cycle in late 2024. However, the coins are now trading sideways with low volatility. Even major news fails to bring meaningful movement. The lack of driving factors is pushing retail and mid-level traders to seek out smaller tokens with bigger potential. Newer tokens have the advantage of surprise. They attract early momentum with less overhead and fresh excitement. This has made the space competitive but also wide open for the right token at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be fitting that profile well. It combines cultural timing, simple access, and a strong hook—elements that made earlier meme tokens break out in past cycles. Final Thoughts Crypto is fast and unforgiving for investors who invest late. Crypto investors who catch trends early often see the biggest rewards. Right now, the trend is clear: large holders are trimming positions in older tokens and moving into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is receiving growing attention as this shift continues. If the presale closes as expected and demand holds, the coin may lead the next breakout wave in the crypto market.

Based in Daegu, Shin was found guilty of manipulating trading data and misleading customers. He is already serving a seven-year sentence for misappropriating ₩10 billion (about $7.5 million) in deposits, and now faces more jail time over a smaller but still serious scheme. Inflated Trading Volume And Misleading Announcements According to the Daegu District Court, Shin used false trading figures to pump up the crypto market price of Bitsonic Coin (BSC). He lured customers with fake announcements and boosted “KRW points” through sham buybacks. Those points then funded actual purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum from platform users. Once Shin converted the crypto into cash, he poured money into unrelated firms. The court found that this cycle netted him roughly ₩160 million ($115,000) in ill-gotten gains. Investigators noted that Shin also gave investors a lock-up period guarantee. In reality, neither the investments nor the promised interest could be returned. When victims pressed for their funds, they discovered the promise was hollow. Earlier Price Manipulation Conviction In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, known only by the surname Bae, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison for a separate fraud involving price manipulation. Reports said that this earlier verdict stemmed from a Seoul District Court finding that both executives deceptively profited by inflating trade volumes. At that time, Shin settled with the two biggest victims, which the judge said helped merit a lighter sentence. The February ruling emphasized that neither Shin nor Bae had prior convictions for similar crimes. Judge Seong Gi-jun noted that their lack of a criminal record and Shin’s partial restitution with major victims weighed in favor of a “lenient” approach under South Korean law. Yet the sizable sums involved—₩10 billion in deposits and the recent ₩160 million—underscore the scale of trust these executives betrayed. Questions Over Exchange Oversight According to Digital Asset reports , professionals indicate that the crypto exchange Bitsonic situation points to loopholes in real-time observation of exchange operations. Swollen volumes and unverified lock-up assurances are likely to go undetected without more robust on-chain analytics. Customer trust suffers every time a high-profile exchange scandal erupts. Some traders are already demanding mandatory proof-of-reserves audits and transparent order books to help deter such abuses.

49608228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799285,1754438454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49608228.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holds Steady At $115,000, But Realized Price Data Warns Of Fragility",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-115000-realized-price-data-warns/,"Following another rejection from the $120,000 region on July 21, Bitcoin (BTC) is now holding steady around the $115,000 level. However, realized price data suggests that BTC’s surface-level calm may be nearing its end. Old Bitcoin Whales Stop Realizing Gains According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin whale behavior indicates that the asset may be walking a tightrope. While “old whales” have stopped realizing profits, newer whales remain slightly in the green – though only marginally. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Market Flashes Warning: IBIT Outflows Paired With Drop In Tron USDT Transfers Here, old whales refer to large BTC holders who have held the digital asset for more than a year. New whales – including institutional players – are those who entered the market within the past year. Kripto Mevsimi notes that the current balance between old capital and newly invested capital may not hold much longer. A decisive break in either direction could push BTC into a new price range. The chart below illustrates the rising realized cap of old whales from 2022 to 2024, confirming that this cohort steadily realized profits during that period. Notably, this quiet distribution phase coincided with mid-cycle market conditions. However, since early 2025, the realized cap for old whales has flattened – signalling a pause in profit-taking. Their average cost basis of $39,400 puts them well in profit, suggesting they are likely waiting for higher prices before re-entering the market. In contrast, the average cost basis for newer whales is approximately $105,300 – a level that now serves as their psychological breakeven. As long as BTC remains above this threshold, these newer investors are unlikely to sell in large numbers. That said, a drop below this critical level could trigger risk-off behavior among new whales. Kripto Mevsimi suggests that such a move could escalate current conditions from moderate profit-taking to panic selling, potentially triggering a wave of leverage unwinds. Keep An Eye On Realized Price It’s worth noting that recent activity has been minimal across both BTC investor cohorts – old whales and new whales alike. As the CryptoQuant analyst puts it: Old whales are idle. New whales are exposed. Neither is pressing the market – yet. But once the range breaks, the reaction could be sharp. In short, Bitcoin holders should closely monitor realized price levels. If BTC maintains a price above $105,000, newer capital is likely to remain stable. However, a drop below that could weaken the floor and invite downside pressure.

That said, a few warning signs point to potential short-term weakness. For instance, BTC deposits to Binance have been rising steadily after months of decline, indicating that selling pressure may increase in the near future. At press time, BTC trades at $113,500, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

With speculation mounting that the SEC may withdraw its appeal, investors are recalibrating their expectations—some now targeting 20x returns , with prices potentially climbing past $40 if institutional inflows ignite post-ETF approval. On-chain data shows consistent whale accumulation despite short-term pullbacks like the recent –6.5% dip on August 2, reinforcing the view that smart money is preparing for a decisive breakout. The prospect of a U.S.-listed XRP spot ETF has reenergized the community, and analysts argue that legal clarity could finally unlock the long-stalled upside. At the same time, many retail traders are hunting for newer opportunities with similar potential but fewer regulatory hurdles – sparking fresh interest in high-traction presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional cues align with ETF optimism Multiple market analysts agree that XRP’s trajectory hinges on one factor: regulation. A spot ETF would require the SEC to cease its legal pursuit, a move that would not only enable relisting on U.S. exchanges but also pave the way for institutional exposure via regulated channels. If this scenario unfolds, capital could pour in similarly to what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF approvals. Reports indicate that whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP are already repositioning in anticipation, a strong sign of conviction. Still, some investors see faster ROI potential outside legacy altcoins, especially as timing and entry costs become crucial considerations in a maturing bull cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A presale play attracting serious attention Amid the growing buzz surrounding XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as one of the most trustworthy early-stage crypto plays on the market today. Its smart contracts recently passed multiple security audits , reinforcing its reputation as a safe and credible investment vehicle. With community growth accelerating and early-stages allocations rapidly disappearing , the project has also topped several crypto media watchlists in recent days. Compared to legacy assets like XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean-slate narrative, free from legal entanglements but packed with breakout potential . For risk-tolerant investors, it represents a calculated entry point into what some analysts call “t he next big story in crypto ”. Risk appetite shifts as breakout bets intensify XRP remains a compelling hold for long-term investors betting on regulation-driven rallies. But as the broader market recovers and sentiment tilts bullish , traders are expanding their exposure to include high-momentum, low-barrier presales with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this thesis perfectly – pairing real community growth with strategic development and audit-backed trust signals . Its rising profile across crypto Twitter and Telegram groups suggests that investor buzz is peaking at just the right moment. Conclusion: From legal win to breakout bets XRP’s legal clarity could catalyze a 20x surge , but for those looking to enter earlier, faster-growing narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s ongoing presale may offer a sharper edge. With trust confirmed via recent audits and rising demand threatening to close allocations, it’s one of the few altcoin stories keeping pace with XRP’s bullish momentum.

On-chain data analytics firm, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), disclosed this in an X post. According to Sentora , the stablecoin volume for July was over $1.5 trillion, surpassing previous highs, including May 2025, when it was $1.39 trillion, and April, when it was $1.44 trillion. Based on the chart, the new high continues a positive trend in on-chain stablecoin settlement since the start of 2025. While the volume was just $950 billion at the start of the year, it has been over $1.2 trillion in every other month of the year, apart from January and February. Stablecoins monthly on-chain volume (Source: Sentora) Interestingly, August has already recorded almost $200 billion in on-chain volume across the first five days and is now on track to finish above $1.2 trillion by the end of the month. Meanwhile, experts have attributed the surge in on-chain volume for stablecoins to increased DeFi activity. According to Defillama, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours to reach $137.33 billion. This is mostly due to Ethereum performance, with the network performance and ETH resurgence driving renewed interest in DeFi activity. Sentora data also backs this up with the data analytics firm noting that DeFi has reached a three-year high of $179 billion this week, thanks to inflows into liquid staking protocols and ETH ascent towards $4,000. USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin transactions The new milestone reflects stablecoins’ growing adoption and increasing use for on-chain transactions. With the US finally passing the GENIUS Act stablecoin law, the fiat-pegged tokens have seen their role in the financial system cemented. Interestingly, Circle USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin volume throughout 2025, accounting for between 48% to 40% of all DeFi transactions involving stablecoins. In comparison, Tether USDT usually accounts for around 27% – 20% of the total volume each, while MakerDAO DAI also records between 33% and 17% depending on the months. This highlights USDC dominance on-chain, especially in recent years, with USDT and DAI now taking the backseat, although they had commanded more volume at different times. Still, these three stablecoins account for over 90% of the on-chain monthly stablecoin volume, with only Ethena USDe coming close at around 3%. Meanwhile, USDT usage for on-chain transactions is growing again. The stablecoin has seen sizable growth on DeFi protocols this year, with the amount of USDT supplied on Aave increasing by 123% year to date and now close to $7.5 billion. Stablecoin supply inches close to $370 billion While USDC might dominate on-chain transactions, it is USDT that remains the biggest stablecoin by supply. With a market cap of $164.70 billion, the stablecoin, which has seen its supply increase by 3.28% in the past month, now has 61.41% dominance. By comparison, USDC supply is only $63.85 billion. With a similar growth trajectory over the past month, it looks unlikely to match the USDT level in supply at this rate. Meanwhile, Ethena USDe, Sky Dollar USDS, and Dai have $9.517 billion, $4.87 billion, and $4.33 billion. USDe has been one of the best-performing stablecoins in the past month, with 79.47% growth, a performance only bested by Falcon USD (USDf), which has seen a 102% increase in that period, going from $552 million to $1.09 billion. Overall, the stablecoin market cap has reached $268.20 billion after adding $13.2 billion in the past month. At the current market cap, stablecoin supply has already doubled in the past year, and it looks set for more growth, especially as clarity continues to develop. In a sign of regulatory clarity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued guidance allowing some fully backed redeemable USD stablecoins to be classified as cash equivalents. This is expected to provide some clarity in the meantime before the broader regulations arrive. Get seen where it counts.

The meme coin market is no longer a joke – it’s an evolving space where strategic early access often leads to life-changing profits. With new ecosystems rising and retail investor interest soaring, meme coins have transformed into serious contenders in the digital asset class. From secret staking pools to deflationary tokenomics, today’s meme coins are offering more than laughs – they’re delivering utility, hype, and substantial upside potential. Among the best-positioned tokens of 2025 is MoonBull ($MOBU), whose Whitelist is live now. Alongside promising projects like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF), MoonBull is emerging as a clear standout for investors seeking the next 100x opportunity. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) The MoonBull Whitelist is officially open – and it’s already being hailed as one of the most thrilling early access opportunities in the meme coin universe. What sets this apart is its razor-sharp exclusivity. Joining the whitelist gives you a front-row seat to the $MOBU revolution, packed with perks designed to reward early believers. Here’s what whitelist members get access to: Bonus Token Allocations : More $MOBU for the same investment, giving early birds a major edge. Hidden Staking Rewards : Passive income boosters not available to the general public. Early Roadmap Access : Get insider updates before they hit the streets. And here’s the kicker: this is strictly first-come, first-served. The faster you act, the more you stand to gain. All it takes is a simple email submission to lock in your whitelist spot. As launch inches closer, whitelisted users will be the first to receive exclusive notifications about the exact presale date – well before the public even sniffs it. This isn’t theoretical potential. It’s a real-world shot at being part of the next crypto breakout, and it’s unfolding now. Reference Past Whitelist Wins: A Proven Formula for Early Success In early 2024, Layer 2 meme coins like $TOSHI on Base offered early investors exclusive airdrops that were never made available to the general public. Similarly, $WEN – launched via Solana’s memecoin incubator – rewarded whitelist holders with 10x gains in under a month. Whitelisted wallets for $WEN also received free NFTs and pre-market access to its companion dApp. MoonBull ($MOBU) builds on these proven success models with an evolved approach specifically tailored to the meme coin generation of 2025. Its whitelist isn’t just an early bird ticket – it’s a launchpad for maximized gain. Those on the hunt for the best new coin launch in 2025 will find Moon Bull leading the charge with Ethereum-based security, real staking mechanics, and reward systems inspired by the biggest meme coin wins of the last bull cycle. 2. Test ($TST) Test ($TST) is a controlled experiment turned market phenomenon. Originally designed as a limited-release meme project, Test now leads in transparency, dev commitment, and organic virality. With no pre-mines and a locked liquidity strategy, it avoids many common pitfalls associated with rug pulls. It recently introduced a liquidity farming initiative allowing users to earn native rewards simply by holding the coin and participating in the community’s governance decisions. The buzz surrounding Test accelerated after several analysts began tracking its wallet activity and saw consistent accumulation across long-term holders. Smart money seems to be betting heavily on Test’s scalability. Test made it to this list because it defied initial skepticism and evolved into a case study for what successful meme coin experimentation looks like. 3. Coq Inu ($COQ) Coq Inu ($COQ) is more than a humorous reference – it’s a cultural movement backed by real-world engagement. Designed for maximum virality, Coq Inu’s meme architecture is coupled with robust marketing mechanics, including influencer collaborations and viral trend hijacking. Built on Avalanche, it leverages fast finality and low gas fees, enabling frictionless transactions. Its growing NFT partnership wing recently announced a drop themed around early crypto memes, aimed at further increasing its community footprint. What distinguishes Coq Inu is its consistent volume and multi-language support that has fueled international adoption. Coq Inu earns its spot here by combining viral branding with real-world functionality, paving the way as a leading example of meme coin globalization. 4. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Cheems ($CHEEMS) has become synonymous with meme coin nostalgia. Initially a tribute to one of the most beloved doge memes, it has transitioned into a smart-contract-driven meme ecosystem that rewards staking and participation. What elevates Cheems from copycats is its novel burn-and-earn mechanism. Tokens are permanently burned in proportion to user staking milestones, helping reduce total supply while rewarding committed holders. Cheems is also launching a comic-themed P2E game featuring community-voted storyline arcs. This adds a gamified layer to its token utility. Cheems is included in this list for its ability to retain cultural relevance while integrating innovative token mechanics that appeal to long-term holders. 5. Sudeng ($HIPPO) Sudeng ($HIPPO) is a quiet disruptor. Operating on a low-noise, high-delivery framework, HIPPO has seen consistent wallet growth and strategic exchange listings. Unlike many coins that rely solely on hype, HIPPO focuses on value-added features like LP auto-refill mechanisms and AI-generated meme campaigns. It recently launched HIPPO DEX, a decentralized trading platform aimed at meme tokens and microcaps, offering zero-slippage swaps during peak market activity. HIPPO has gained popularity in Southeast Asian and Latin American markets thanks to its community-centric strategy. Sudeng belongs on this list because it’s quietly building an infrastructure that positions it for breakout growth in the next meme cycle. 6. Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) holds a foundational position in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Functioning as the governance token of ShibaSwap, it allows users to vote on platform proposals and yield farming configurations. Recent upgrades to the ShibaSwap interface, coupled with BONE’s integration into upcoming Shibarium Layer 2 updates, are expected to multiply its utility. Its listing on major exchanges further affirms growing institutional interest. BONE has also partnered with decentralized identity projects to create wallets that integrate meme culture and serious DeFi protocols. BONE is featured in this list because it successfully bridges meme popularity with serious governance roles in a top-tier ecosystem. 7. AI Companions ($AIC) AI Companions ($AIC) merges two of the most innovative verticals: AI and crypto. Designed as a meme coin with a mind, AIC allows holders to interact with decentralized AI bots that evolve based on community training data. With a roadmap that includes AI-driven staking pools, voice-enabled wallet interactions, and NFT-based personality upgrades, AIC offers more than just meme value – it delivers tech utility. AIC recently released a teaser of its AI Meme Engine that generates viral memes using blockchain oracle data, a tool already gaining traction across social platforms. AI Companions made this list because it is redefining what meme coins can do in a Web3-AI integrated future. 8. Comedian ($BAN) Comedian ($BAN) brings a laughter-first philosophy with serious crypto fundamentals. Known for its censorship-resistant joke NFTs, BAN has built a fully decentralized meme publishing protocol. Its DAO structure votes on weekly joke contests, rewarding participants in BAN tokens. Its P2E comedy dungeon game is scheduled to launch Q2 2025 and features token-powered performance slots and improv challenges judged by the community. BAN made this list due to its novel integration of decentralized content creation and meme tokenomics, offering a blend of fun and functionality. 9. SLERF ($SLERF) SLERF ($SLERF) might just be the meme coin wildcard of the year. With a stealth launch that attracted 20,000 holders in under 48 hours, SLERF relies on zero marketing and 100 percent organic traction. The dev team claims no central leadership, no VCs, and no paid influencers. Its gamified airdrop mechanism locks rewards behind puzzle challenges, driving community engagement. Upcoming plans include the release of an animated meme film funded entirely by the community treasury. SLERF is included in this list because it proved that meme virality and utility can coexist even in the absence of traditional promotional channels. Conclusion: Secure the Next Big Wave Before It Leaves the Shore Based on the latest research, the new coin launch in 2025 includes MoonBull. Alongside MoonBull ($MOBU), other standout meme coins like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF) are drawing serious attention for their blend of utility and community impact. MoonBull whitelist offers a low-entry path into high-potential projects. With limited whitelist spots and early access incentives, getting in early could be the smartest crypto move of the year. As more countries adopt Bitcoin reserves and regulation adapts to support innovation, these tokens could define a new era of community-driven value creation.

This week we interviewed Eric Dresdale, President and Co-Founder of Entrokey Labs. White Hat (WH): What was the genesis for Entrokey Labs? Eric Dresdale (ED): Entrokey began with a patented innovation from KNWN Technologies, using cosmic radiation to generate quantum-resistant digital identities. After key conversations between myself and my co-founder David Harding, we realized this breakthrough could be a perfect response to the rising threats from AI and quantum computing. We set to work to evolve it from space-based to hardware-based, and ultimately into a software-only solution powered by generative AI trained on natural entropic phenomena. WH: What is Entrokey’s competitive edge? ED: EntroKey is rebuilding the cryptographic foundation for the post-quantum era, fixing entropy at the source to secure the world’s most critical digital systems. In crypto, blockchain, and Web3, we ensure the integrity of key generation and synchronization, enabling resilient wallets, trustless protocols, and quantum-safe infrastructure without hardware dependence. Our lightweight, stateless random number and key generator safeguards everything digital — from individual privacy to global enterprise systems — enabling organizations to scale trust and security without friction. WH: Who would best benefit from Entrokey’s security protocol? ED: Entrokey is a dual-use technology, making it ideal for governments, defense, and national security agencies where cryptographic integrity is mission-critical. In parallel, we are targeting regulated industries such as cloud providers, financial services including crypto and stablecoins, healthcare, and aviation where trust, compliance, and AI and post-quantum resilience are essential. WH: Crypto trading platform WOO X was hacked recently, how could have Entrokey prevented this? ED: Phishing happens. But with Entrokey, access alone is not enough. Our keys are bound to high-quality entropy and the environment they were created in. So even if an attacker gets in, they cannot use or move anything. No static keys to steal, no way to spoof the system. That is how we contain damage before it starts WH: What advice do you have for everyday crypto users to protect themselves? ED: Use an MPC or hardware wallet — These eliminate single points of failure. No seed phrase, no static key to steal. Watch for phishing — Most hacks start with a fake link. Never connect your wallet unless you're 100 percent sure. Keep your funds off exchanges — Centralized platforms are honeypots. If you're not trading, withdraw and hold on a cold wallet.

One of the most popular tools for gauging this mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital indicator recently shifted, moving from “Greed” to a “Neutral” reading of 54 as of August 6. This change reflects a cooling of intense optimism and suggests a more balanced, yet cautious, crypto market sentiment among participants. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies whether investors are feeling overly greedy (potentially leading to a market correction) or excessively fearful (which might signal a buying opportunity). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, often selling assets in panic. 25-49: Fear – General apprehension and uncertainty prevail. 50-54: Neutral – The current zone, indicating a balanced outlook without strong emotional biases. 55-74: Greed – Enthusiasm is growing, and prices might be rising. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often a sign of market tops. Understanding this scale helps you interpret the current investor sentiment and consider how it might influence market movements. How Does the Index Measure Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture of the market’s mood. These factors collectively capture various aspects of market volatility and activity, giving us a holistic view. Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Assesses current market volume and momentum. Strong buying volume usually points to greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various social media platforms, looking at crypto-related discussions. Surveys (15%): Historically involved polls about market outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors move from altcoins to Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like “Bitcoin price manipulation.” Each of these elements contributes to the final score, offering a nuanced perspective on prevailing crypto market sentiment . What Does “Neutral” Sentiment Really Mean for Investors? The recent shift to a “Neutral” reading of 54 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of equilibrium. It means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed dominates the market. For investors, this balanced state can imply several things: Uncertainty: A neutral reading often reflects a wait-and-see approach, where investors are not rushing into major decisions. Consolidation: Prices might move sideways, consolidating recent gains or losses as the market digests new information. Opportunity for Analysis: This phase provides an excellent opportunity to conduct thorough research rather than acting on impulse. It’s a time to evaluate fundamentals and technical indicators without the noise of extreme emotions. While some might view “Neutral” as uneventful, it is a crucial period for strategic planning. It suggests the market is taking a breath, potentially preparing for its next significant move, influenced by upcoming news or broader economic factors. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively? It serves as a valuable sentiment tool, but it’s important not to rely on it in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Historically, extreme fear has often presented buying opportunities, while extreme greed has preceded market corrections. A neutral phase prompts careful consideration. Combine with Other Indicators: Always pair the index with technical analysis (e.g., support/resistance levels, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (e.g., project developments, adoption rates). Risk Management: A neutral reading doesn’t eliminate risk. Maintain a diversified portfolio and stick to your risk management strategy, especially given ongoing market volatility . Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates, as these can quickly shift investor sentiment from neutral to either extreme. The index is a powerful indicator of human emotion in the market. Use it to understand the crowd’s psychology, but always make decisions based on your own research and financial goals. The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 54, settling into the “Neutral” zone, signifies a momentary pause in the intense emotional swings of the crypto market. This balanced state provides a valuable opportunity for investors to assess their positions without the pressure of extreme panic or euphoria. While not a definitive trading signal, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment empowers you to make more rational, data-driven decisions. Always remember that successful investing combines sentiment analysis with thorough research and a disciplined approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. 2. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. 3. What does a “Neutral” reading on the index mean? A “Neutral” reading, like the current 54, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market. It suggests a period of balance, uncertainty, or consolidation. 4. Should I make investment decisions based solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the index is a sentiment tool and should not be used in isolation. Always combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and your own risk management strategy for informed decisions. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The original content states that the survey component is currently paused, though the specific reason for the pause is not detailed within the index’s public information.

The guidance declares that liquid staking activities do not constitute securities transactions. This means participants would not be required to register such activities with the SEC. This move could ease regulatory pressure on blockchain networks and DeFi platforms offering these services. However, Crenshaw believes this interpretation is dangerously misleading. Crenshaw said the Liquid Staking Statement builds one assumption on top of another, creating what she described as a shaky wall of facts disconnected from the realities of the industry. She added that the guidance provides little clarity, lacks a legal foundation, and merely reflects the SEC staff’s views—not the Commission’s official position. Crenshaw criticized the guidance for drawing “definitive declarations about how liquid staking works” without providing evidence or addressing the diversity of staking mechanisms across blockchain ecosystems. She warned that the guidance fails to offer meaningful direction for companies trying to stay compliant. SEC’s liquid staking guidance sparks division Earlier in the day, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a legal interpretation stating that liquid staking—a system that allows users to earn staking rewards while still being able to trade or move their staked tokens—is not a securities offering. This clarification means platforms offering liquid staking services may not have to register with the SEC under current securities laws, potentially opening the door for broader innovation and user adoption. The stance represents a continuation of the pro-innovation regulatory steps rolled out under the Trump-era Project Crypto, which promoted hands-off regulatory approaches in certain aspects of the crypto economy. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also made a statement after the release from the agency, claiming that liquid staking is similar to a popular practice of leaving goods with an agent who gives receipts in return . Peirce wrote that the Division’s statement makes it clear that, in its view, liquid staking activities tied to protocol staking do not constitute the offer and sale of securities. But Crenshaw was quick to distance the full Commission from this interpretation. Crenshaw stated that the guidance holds no binding authority and does not represent the consensus of the Commission, either presently or in the future. She argued that the legal conclusions within the document rest entirely on narrow, hypothetical assumptions. If a liquid staking product differs significantly from the outlined assumptions, the exemption likely wouldn’t apply. Commissioner urges caution among liquid stakers Crenshaw’s warning was stark: don’t rely on this guidance as a free pass. She noted that any entity whose liquid staking program differs in any way from the long list of assumptions in the Liquid Staking Statement should take caution, emphasizing “caveat liquid staker”—a Latin phrase meaning “let the liquid staker beware.” She emphasized that entities operating in the liquid staking space are still at risk of enforcement, especially as the SEC continues its broader crackdown on crypto-related securities violations. Crenshaw has long voiced concerns that certain crypto products and platforms are sidestepping investor protections. Her comments mirror a broader fissure at the Commission on how to approach fast-changing digital money systems. Some staffers and commissioners argue that the existing regime only needs to be tinkered with to suit itself to crypto; Crenshaw is advocating a stricter, more data-informed approach. She argued that the rule cannot create regulatory certainty on unsupported assumptions. Some in the crypto world voiced a sense of hopefulness, however guarded. Perhaps most encouraging from a regulatory perspective, those in liquid staking saw enough in this statement to help them innovate without immediately worrying about regulatory hammer fallout. Still, Crenshaw’s dissent raised red flags with legal experts, who said the dissent, read literally, means any departure from those assumptions in staff guidance could lead to an enforcement action.

A prominent investor, known as @qwatio, faces the imminent threat of a substantial Bitcoin liquidation . This isn’t just any trade; it’s a staggering $115 million BTC short position , putting immense pressure on the market and the trader. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s High-Stakes Bet What exactly is happening? According to observations shared by @EmberCN on X, this particular Hyperliquid whale has placed a colossal bet against Bitcoin’s price. Their short position, valued at an eye-watering $115 million, is dangerously close to its liquidation point. The critical price level where this massive position could be forcibly closed is $114,491. For those new to the space, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market movements. A “short position” is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. If the price rises instead, the trader incurs losses, and if it hits the liquidation price, their position is automatically closed to prevent further losses, often leading to significant capital loss for the trader. The Perilous Dance of a $115M BTC Short Position The situation became even more dramatic earlier today. To avoid the dreaded Bitcoin liquidation of their massive BTC short position , the investor made a desperate move. They reportedly closed an Ethereum (ETH) short position at a loss. This action was a strategic, albeit costly, attempt to increase the margin for their Bitcoin bet, giving it more breathing room against the rising price. This maneuver highlights the extreme crypto trading risk inherent in highly leveraged positions. Traders often use leverage to amplify potential returns, but it also magnifies potential losses, making liquidation a constant threat if the market moves against their bet. The sheer scale of this particular position makes its potential liquidation a point of intense focus for market observers. What Does Imminent Bitcoin Liquidation Mean for the Market? When a large position like this faces Bitcoin liquidation , it can have ripple effects. The automated selling that occurs during liquidation can add selling pressure to the market, potentially causing further price drops, especially in illiquid conditions. While the overall market might absorb a $115 million liquidation, it still represents a significant event that traders and analysts closely monitor. The ability to track such events is largely due to the transparency offered by on-chain data . Analysts like @EmberCN can observe large movements and positions on decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, providing crucial insights into market sentiment and potential volatility. This transparency, while beneficial for market analysis, also puts a spotlight on individual traders’ high-stakes endeavors. Lessons from High-Leverage Crypto Trading Risk This unfolding scenario offers valuable lessons for all participants in the crypto market, especially those considering leveraged trading. The immense pressure on the Hyperliquid whale underscores the critical importance of risk management. Even experienced traders can find themselves in precarious positions if they misjudge market movements or overextend their leverage. Understand Liquidation Levels: Always know the exact price at which your position will be liquidated. Manage Your Margin: Proactively add margin or reduce position size before it becomes a desperate last-minute scramble. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged bet. Monitor On-Chain Data: While not a crystal ball, it provides valuable insights into large market movements and potential risks. The Power of On-Chain Data in Crypto Monitoring The role of on-chain data cannot be overstated in today’s transparent blockchain ecosystem. It allows for a level of market insight previously unavailable in traditional finance. By analyzing public ledger information, researchers and traders can identify significant positions, track whale movements, and anticipate potential market volatility. This real-time data empowers market participants to make more informed decisions, mitigating some of the inherent crypto trading risk . The dramatic plight of the Hyperliquid whale and their $115 million BTC short position serves as a potent reminder of the volatile and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. While the outcome remains uncertain, the situation vividly illustrates the power of market forces and the ever-present threat of Bitcoin liquidation for those who venture into leveraged positions without robust risk management. It’s a testament to the fact that even the largest players can find themselves on the brink. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a short position in cryptocurrency trading? A short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like Bitcoin) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later and return it, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the trader incurs losses. 2. What does it mean for a crypto position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a required maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial margin. 3. Who are @qwatio and @EmberCN? @qwatio is the pseudonymous trader holding the large Bitcoin short position on Hyperliquid. @EmberCN is an on-chain data analyst who brought attention to this specific high-risk trade, highlighting significant market activity. 4. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. It operates on a blockchain, offering high performance and transparency for its users. 5. How can crypto traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, setting stop-loss orders, and actively monitoring their positions to add margin or reduce exposure if the market moves against them.

According to analysts, the approval may follow the milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, investors are actively looking for other coins that may deliver massive returns before XRP gets to traditional finance. Five crypto presales already stand out due to their unique roadmaps and presale features. Investors are already accumulating the coins at a fast speed in the presale, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the forefront. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Leading with 33x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved to become the leading crypto presale before the anticipated approval of the XRP ETF. Its path is compared to the early years of Ripple in terms of ecosystem and community. Based on the Binance Smart Chain, MAGACOIN will offer staking benefits, meme potential, and a governance solution that attracts DeFi users and retail traders. The aggressive roadmap and the viral traction being made on social channels is what helps make MAGACOIN stand out. According to experts, the token has the potential for a 33x rise before the XRP ETFsurges, particularly as political meme tokens once again start to trend. The presale is currently active, and it is one of the remaining few ground-floor opportunities before the broader market catalysts step in. 2. Ozak AI – AI Meets Decentralized Analytics Ozak AI is blending artificial intelligence with decentralized analytics to revolutionize how businesses use data. The platform operates without intermediaries and offers real-time insights for sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. Its machine learning capabilities combined with blockchain security create a flexible and scalable ecosystem. Ozak AI is currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.005 per token. Over 40 million tokens have already been sold out of 200 million. 3. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – Meme Power with Real Momentum Little Pepe is one of the fastest-growing meme coins to pay attention to in 2025. The Ethereum-based project sold out Stage 8 of its presale two months earlier, raising $13.775 million. Its low token price and clear roadmap are attracting investors to rush in. Stage 9 will raise the price to $0.0018, and the present phase is a crucial entry point for investors. 4. BlockDAG – The Biggest Presale in Seven Years BlockDAG is rewriting the rules with over $361 million raised and 2.5 million users mining via its X1 app. The project is entering its final phase with only days left before its global launch on August 11. The confirmed listing price is 30 times higher than the current rate. Investors are swarming in for features like a 10 BTC auction pool and a no-vesting token release. 5. Maxi Doge – High-Yield Meme Coin Action Maxi Doge has already raised more than $315,000 in several days. The memecoin is gaining traction because of the staking rewards of more than 1,400% APY and viral branding. It provides a Web3-facilitated buying procedure and does not make any exclusive allocations but keeps all things clear and community-based. A new price increase is looming. After the presale, early investors will be able to stake or hold their tokens. Conclusion The launch of the XRP ETF has kindled new enthusiasm in the crypto industry. Retail investors are also in search of high-potential investments as institutions appear in the market. MAGACOIN is one of the most prominent presale tokens with an ambitious story. As these five coins become more popular, the opportunity to buy early could resemble the trajectory of XRP.

Investors are increasingly optimistic ahead of the SEC’s expected status report on August 15, which may finally end Ripple’s multi-year lawsuit. This outcome could unlock a flood of institutional adoption and pave the way for XRP spot ETF approvals. With whale wallets scooping up over $60 million in the token recently, market sentiment is turning decisively bullish. Whale Activity and ETF Buzz Signal Institutional Confidence XRP isn’t rallying alone as Institutional capital has flowed heavily into Ethereum and XRP over the past few weeks, according to CoinShares. XRP-related investment products saw $31.26 million in inflows, while whale trackers confirmed large transactions, including a single 20 million transfer from Upbit worth over $60 million. Additionally, anticipation is mounting over potential XRP ETF approvals. The SEC has set an October 17 deadline to rule on several XRP spot ETFs, and a recent policy shift enabling in-kind redemptions has eliminated key logistical barriers. If approved, these ETFs could dramatically reduce the token’s circulating supply and fuel further price appreciation. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

Its recent integration of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain opens the door for DeFi developers to launch dApps on the XRP Ledger using XRP for fees. Moreover, the XRPL now hosts one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury bill products, signaling its growing role in asset tokenization. Related Reading: Crash Incoming?

The cryptocurrency world constantly shifts, and understanding its dynamics is key to navigating its opportunities. Currently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 42. This figure, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), signals a clear shift: we are in a Bitcoin Season . What does this mean for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Let’s dive in. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market . As reported by CoinMarketCap, the index recently registered 42, a slight dip from the previous day. This specific number is crucial because it indicates that Bitcoin is currently outperforming the majority of altcoins. Index Range: The index scores from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, this phase begins when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 42 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season , highlighting a period where the leading cryptocurrency dominates market gains. Why Are We Seeing a Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors contribute to the current Bitcoin Season , influencing altcoin performance . Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, especially during periods of uncertainty or when institutional interest grows. Investors might gravitate towards Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” asset within the volatile crypto space. Key drivers often include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic shifts can push investors towards less speculative assets, and within crypto, Bitcoin often fills this role. Halving Narratives: Anticipation around Bitcoin’s halving events can drive significant pre-halving rallies, drawing capital away from altcoins. Spot ETF Approvals: Recent developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, have channeled substantial institutional capital directly into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and dominance. This increased focus on Bitcoin naturally impacts the Altcoin Season Index , pushing it lower as altcoins struggle to keep pace. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed investment decisions. During a Bitcoin Season , it is common for altcoins to either consolidate or see declines against Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but their gains may be less pronounced or even negative compared to Bitcoin’s. Consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Portfolio: Assess your exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. You might consider rebalancing if your portfolio is heavily skewed towards underperforming altcoins. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, projects with robust technology, strong communities, and clear use cases may still perform well in the long term. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those bullish on specific altcoins, DCA can be an effective strategy to accumulate assets at potentially lower prices. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a valuable tool to gauge shifts in market sentiment and identify potential turning points. When Might Altcoin Performance Rebound? The question on many investors’ minds is: when will the pendulum swing back, and when can we expect a strong Altcoin Season ? Historically, after periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This typically happens once Bitcoin’s rally cools down or consolidates at new highs. Watch for these signs: Bitcoin Price Stability: A period of consolidation for Bitcoin after a significant rally can free up capital for altcoin speculation. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Track Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A clear downtrend here often precedes an altcoin surge. Increased Volume in Altcoins: A significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins can signal renewed interest. The Altcoin Season Index will be your go-to metric, showing a sustained move above 75 as altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 42 clearly indicates we are in a Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to the broader altcoin market. While challenging for some altcoin holders, it presents opportunities for strategic rebalancing and focusing on long-term potential. Staying informed about crypto market trends and understanding the dynamics of altcoin performance are crucial for navigating these cycles effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, often tracked by CoinMarketCap, that measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin are performing better over a 90-day period. It indicates whether the market is in an “Altcoin Season” or a “Bitcoin Season.” Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season is determined when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index typically falls below 75 during this period. Q3: Should I sell all my altcoins during a Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While altcoins may underperform Bitcoin during a Bitcoin Season, selling all holdings might lead to missing out on future rallies. It’s often recommended to re-evaluate your portfolio, consider dollar-cost averaging, and focus on projects with strong fundamentals for long-term potential. Q4: What are the key indicators that an Altcoin Season might be approaching? Key indicators include Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, a declining Bitcoin dominance chart, and a significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index moving above 75 would confirm its arrival. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index include all cryptocurrencies? No, the Altcoin Season Index typically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to focus purely on the performance of native altcoins against Bitcoin within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

49610545,548510,1754442023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49610545.jpeg,Coinbase Plans $2 Billion Private Convertible Note Offering Following Q2 Results,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-plans-2b-private-convertible-offering/,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private convertible note offering following a weaker-than-expected second-quarter performance. The move comes as COIN shares recorded a 15% decline on August 4, reflecting market reactions to the company’s reported drop in revenue and increased operational costs. Details of the Convertible Note Offering According to the announcement, the proposed fundraising will be conducted through a private placement targeting qualified institutional buyers. The offering will consist of two tranches of senior unsecured notes, each worth $1 billion, set to mature in 2029 and 2032 respectively. Coinbase stated that the proceeds would be allocated toward capped call transactions to limit dilution risks, with the remaining funds earmarked for general corporate purposes , including working capital, acquisitions, and potential debt repurchases. The $2 billion offering is structured as two separate note issues, one due October 1, 2029, and the other due October 1, 2032. Both instruments are convertible into cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of the two, at Coinbase’s discretion. The company also provided an option for initial buyers to purchase up to an additional $300 million in notes across both series, depending on investor demand at the time of pricing. Convertible notes are often used by companies seeking to access liquidity while managing potential shareholder dilution. Coinbase plans to enter into capped call transactions on each tranche, which can offset future conversion costs if its stock trades above a predetermined level. These hedging activities may involve trading Coinbase’s shares or related derivatives during and after the pricing period. The final interest rates and conversion terms will be determined upon completion of the offering. At the time of writing, COIN shares is down over 3%, dropping to $307 levels. Market Context and Investor Reactions Coinbase’s fundraising initiative follows a broader trend among cryptocurrency firms turning to convertible debt as a financing tool amid volatile market conditions. Other companies in the sector, including Marathon Digital (MARA), have recently issued similar instruments to promote balance sheet flexibility. Analyst sentiment on Coinbase remains mixed following its Q2 earnings release. While research firm Benchmark maintained a “Buy” rating, citing long-term growth opportunities, other analysts, including Mizuho, highlighted pressure on revenue streams such as USDC-related interest income from issuer partner Circle. Mizuho’s note suggested that shrinking margins from Circle’s reserves could affect Coinbase’s subscription and services revenue mix in upcoming quarters. The planned $2 billion raise is seen as part of Coinbase’s strategy to secure capital ahead of potential market shifts while maintaining options for managing existing debt obligations, such as the company’s outstanding 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2031 convertible and senior notes.

With tens of millions poured into bearish bets, both tokens were pushed into volatile territory, leaving traders scrambling. But while the pressure mounted across much of the altcoin landscape, Dogecoin quietly posted another win—defying gravity with solid support and new gains. And beneath the surface of this volatility, another altcoin has started generating real buzz: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early investors are paying close attention to its momentum, as it rides market chaos with surprising resilience. XRP Faces Aggressive Whale Shorts XRP became the target of large short positions in early August, with at least one major whale placing a $3.33 million bet against it using 20x leverage around the $2.93 level. Cumulatively, shorts across XRP and Solana topped $17 million—applying strong sell-side pressure that briefly knocked XRP below $3. Despite the dip, not all shorts ended profitably. XRP quickly rebounded, triggering liquidations for over-leveraged traders. Still, sentiment remains conflicted. Some analysts forecast further declines toward $2.76, while others point to whale accumulation as a sign of long-term confidence. As Ripple pushes ahead with its Trust Bank initiative, XRP walks a fine line between bullish structural changes and looming short-term resistance. Solana Slips Amid Heavy Dumps Solana didn’t fare much better. One whale reportedly sold $17 million in SOL, aligning with a sharp 12% price decline over the past week. Technical charts now reflect a “rounding top” pattern—commonly seen before extended downtrends. If SOL fails to maintain its current support, analysts suggest a possible slide toward $120. Still, other large players continue to buy the dip, with some institutional wallets slowly building positions. This split sentiment underscores the broader theme: whales are using volatility to play both sides, long and short. Dogecoin Proves Surprisingly Resilient While other altcoins wobbled, Dogecoin showed strength. DOGE briefly climbed past $0.20 before consolidating just below it around $0.198. Strong volume spikes accompanied breakout attempts through $0.194 and $0.198—signals that traders haven’t lost interest. For August 2025, DOGE’s forecast range sits between $0.192 and $0.259, with upside potential toward $0.30 if momentum holds. Meme coin sentiment remains one of crypto’s most unpredictable forces—and Dogecoin appears to still be riding the wave. New Money Eyes Emerging Altcoin Contender As Whales are Shorting XRP and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture 24,800% ROI Before the Market Rebounds. That’s the claim making the rounds among crypto analysts tracking capital rotation into early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has recently seen a surge in whale-led inflows, even as larger-cap altcoins face heavy downside. This mirrors the kind of early activity seen in SHIBA and DOGE before their meteoric rises.With a capped token supply, a strong community, and a developer-backed roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a credible contender for the next big altcoin breakout. Investors who missed DOGE’s rise are watching closely – and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Volatility Rewards the Prepared Whether it’s XRP’s short-fueled swings, Solana’s uncertain footing, or Dogecoin’s steady grind upward, one thing is clear—whales are moving the market. For traders and investors watching from the sidelines, this volatility isn’t just noise—it’s opportunity. And with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining ground with every cycle shift, early positioning could unlock outsized rewards before the next bull leg begins.

Recently, the Base network outage caused a temporary halt, sparking discussions across the crypto community. This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the intricate technicalities that underpin our decentralized future. What Caused the Coinbase Base Network Outage? On a recent Tuesday, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, experienced an unexpected 33-minute halt in its block production. This disruption wasn’t due to a malicious attack but rather a critical internal system failure. The active sequencer, a vital component responsible for ordering transactions, began to lag. An automated internal system, designed to maintain stability, promptly initiated a switch to a backup sequencer. However, this crucial transition failed. The primary reason for this failure was an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup system. Consequently, the network found itself unable to process new transactions or produce new blocks, leading to the brief but significant outage. This incident highlighted the delicate balance required for continuous operation within a complex Layer-2 blockchain environment. Understanding Layer-2 Blockchain Challenges and Network Stability What exactly is a Layer-2 network like Coinbase Base network , and why are sequencers so important? A Layer-2 blockchain is built on top of a main blockchain (like Ethereum) to increase its transaction throughput and reduce costs. It processes transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. Sequencers play a pivotal role in these networks. They are responsible for: Ordering Transactions: Ensuring transactions are processed in the correct sequence. Batching: Grouping multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch for efficient settlement on the main chain. Submitting Data: Posting the batched transaction data back to the Layer-1 blockchain. When a sequencer fails, as happened with Base, the entire process grinds to a halt. This directly impacts network stability and user experience, demonstrating the need for robust redundancy and flawless backup systems. Even a short outage can undermine trust and disrupt ongoing operations for users and decentralized applications alike. Lessons from the Base Network Outage: Ensuring Resilience The recent Base network outage provides valuable lessons for the broader blockchain ecosystem.
