This alignment establishes a robust technical foundation, indicating a potential breakout as buyers step in at this critical level. Key Support Level Near Aligning With VWAP Average In a post on X, CryptoPulse drew attention to SUI’s recent price action, noting that the token has pulled back into what is described as a “sweet spot” for potential buying opportunities. The price recently touched the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and is currently sitting directly on a critical structural support level around $3.50. Related Reading: SUI MACD Signals Massive Rally Ahead — 400% Price Surge Possible This zone has been a key area of interest for the analyst, who has been patiently waiting for SUI to reach this level before stepping in. The convergence of the VWAP and structural support creates a favorable setup that often precedes strong upward moves. Fundamentally, SUI is also gaining increasing recognition and traction within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The project’s growing presence, combined with solid chart structure, reinforces the possibility of substantial upside potential over the coming weeks and months. Currently, the analyst is actively averaging into their position, setting an initial target at $5. However, they remain optimistic that this setup can extend much further if momentum continues to build and key technical levels are broken. With both technical and fundamental factors converging, CryptoPulse views SUI as a project worth watching closely for possible significant gains ahead. SUI Chart Shows Promise, But Setup Needs Confirmation Sharing additional insights in a separate post, AlgoCats highlighted that SUI is currently showing a very promising chart setup. The analyst noted that while the structure looks favorable, they are waiting for a more defined formation to develop, which would offer a clearer signal for a long position before considering an entry point. Their target is a key resistance zone that has seen multiple wicks and a previous fake breakout, marking it as a critical level where price action could accelerate.

However, AlgoCats emphasized that patience is key, and they intend to wait for confirmation before making any move. Until that confirmation arrives, the focus remains on observing how SUI behaves around current levels. AlgoCats is prepared to act, but only when the chart provides a clean and confident signal for entry. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $3.54, demonstrating a nearly 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased significantly by more than 33% in the past day.

From presales that give you hands-on access before launch, to established names delivering consistent performance, the current market offers a mix of innovation and reliability. Whether it’s a coin redefining the presale experience, a blockchain built for speed and scalability, a community-powered token blending culture with finance, or an ecosystem mainstay that never loses relevance, each has its own story. Here’s a closer look at four standout picks making waves in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Where You Don’t Just Buy, You Feel the Trade BlockDAG is redefining what a presale can be. With its Dashboard V4, users aren’t left waiting to find out how it all works. Instead, they can log in right now and experience a fully interactive BDAG Exchange simulator. From watching the BDAG/USD price fluctuate in real time, to clicking “Buy” and seeing wallet balances update, the feeling is immediate. It’s no longer abstract. The simulation includes full BUY/SELL panels, live order books, price charts, and a market feed. This isn’t a teaser; it’s a hands-on demo that turns crypto from concept to contact. And the numbers? They match the energy. BlockDAG has already raised $363 million, sold over 24.7 billion BDAG, and is currently in batch 29 at $0.0276. That’s a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Right now, a limited window is open to buy in at $0.0016, allowing new users to secure significantly more upside. Among the top crypto coins 2025 has introduced, BlockDAG is the only one giving its users something they can feel now , not months down the line. 2. Avax: Smart Contracts with Speed and Scale Avax has carved out its position through a combination of speed, scalability, and multi-chain functionality. What users love most is how the platform balances advanced features with a relatively user-friendly experience. Transactions are confirmed in seconds, which gives it a real-world responsiveness that many platforms still struggle to match. Its ongoing development into subnets allows customized chains to run under the Avalanche umbrella, creating a network of networks. This adds utility for developers, but also gives investors confidence that the tech can scale. As we move through 2025, Avax continues to attract attention not just for performance, but for its approach to interoperability and speed. It’s earned its place on the list of top crypto coins 2025 by offering a blend of tech and usability that’s rare to find at scale. 3. Pengu: Where Culture Meets Coin Pengu isn’t just a coin, it’s a movement. Inspired by online culture and driven by a strong community, it has grown fast by doing what most coins can’t: staying lighthearted while building serious momentum. What sets Pengu apart is how emotionally connected its holders feel. The memes, the inside jokes, the vibe, it’s all part of the value. But it’s not just fluff. Pengu has rolled out staking, community rewards, and unique NFT integrations that make it feel like more than a meme coin. The roadmap includes utility-focused tools and cross-chain expansion, showing it’s aiming beyond just virality. In a market where people want both identity and opportunity, Pengu has become one of the top crypto coins 2025 by making crypto feel personal again. It’s a reminder that sometimes, fun and finance don’t have to be separate. 4. BNB: Consistency in a Volatile Market BNB has long been a staple in the portfolios of serious crypto holders. Tied to one of the largest ecosystems in the industry, it powers transactions, fuels smart contracts, and unlocks utility across a wide range of products. Even as trends shift and new coins make noise, BNB continues to show resilience. It’s used, held, and traded at volume, making it a practical choice for both experienced traders and those just entering the space. What’s powerful about BNB is its staying power. It’s not built on hype cycles or single-use cases. It’s functional, familiar, and constantly updated. For those looking for a grounded asset in their search for the top crypto coins 2025, BNB remains one of the most reliable options. Final Thoughts In 2025, the top crypto coins 2025 are defined by more than market cap or short-term gains, they’re shaped by the experience and value they deliver. BlockDAG stands out for giving users real trading interaction before launch. Avax offers a technical foundation of speed and interoperability. Pengu proves that community and culture can fuel serious growth. And BNB remains a pillar of stability in a fast-changing market. Whether you’re seeking innovation, engagement, or consistency, these coins represent strong candidates for long-term consideration. As the year unfolds, each will continue to play a unique role in shaping the crypto landscape.

With a U.S. national trust bank charter and RLUSD stablecoin integration on the horizon, institutional momentum around XRP and Litecoin is growing. These updates are sending price predictions higher for both coins. Yet it’s not just legacy assets in the spotlight—MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines, with analysts projecting a 22,400% ROI this quarter as it emerges as a new high-upside contender for investors seeking the next breakout. Ripple Bank Move Gains Traction Ripple’s bank strategy is now gaining serious momentum. With its OCC charter application for the Ripple National Trust Bank, a Federal Reserve master account pursuit, and a full suite of custodial partnerships, Ripple is placing itself at the center of institutional banking and XRP growth. The RLUSD stablecoin rollout is also primed to boost real-world payments and bank adoption of Ripple XRP. Analyst XRP price prediction calls remain positive, despite short-term pullbacks. The average forecast for August sits near $3.14, with a bullish scenario of $3.36. Fibonacci extension analysis targets $5.50 for 2025, while longer-term projections suggest a range between $4.50 and $9.00—assuming more regulatory clarity and continued institutional adoption. Ripple OCC charter news and Ripple bank partnership news are driving renewed market optimism and could set the stage for a major XRP price rally. Litecoin Price Bullish Prediction Litecoin is riding a fresh wave of optimism in the wake of Ripple news today. The current Litecoin price prediction 2025 averages $137, with a projected peak at $146.80. Institutional banking trends and the 80% odds of a Litecoin ETF approval are fueling a strong narrative for a Litecoin price boost. Analysts are watching closely for a Litecoin price rally after Ripple news, as the two coins often see correlated moves during periods of positive market sentiment. Ripple’s impact on Litecoin price is being felt through both direct institutional flows and broader altcoin performance after big ecosystem updates. For those looking at utility-focused crypto coins and cross-chain payment solutions, both XRP and Litecoin are high on the watchlist for the rest of 2025. Ripple’s Bank Strategy Sparks MAGACOIN FINANCE Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a top story among traders scanning for Q3’s biggest opportunities. As Ripple’s bank strategy shakes up institutional flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its combination of community-driven momentum and aggressive growth. Wallet growth, social chatter, and presale hype all point to explosive interest, with some analysts now calling for a staggering 22,400% ROI this quarter. This project’s appeal comes from its unique blend of real-world narrative, transparent governance, and volatility-friendly trading conditions. With the market focused on Ripple banking partnerships 2025 and the effect of bank adoption on XRP price, traders are looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for an early entry before mainstream attention hits. In a market hungry for utility-focused crypto coins and new narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is staking its claim as the next major contender for altcoin leadership in 2025. Next Moves: What to Watch as Bank News Lifts Crypto Institutional adoption and bank partnerships are reshaping the outlook for XRP and Litecoin, while Ripple ecosystem updates keep both coins near the top of analyst forecasts. Ripple’s ongoing bank strategy is boosting institutional confidence, translating to bullish calls for both price and adoption across the board. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 22,400% ROI projection, is stepping into the spotlight as the bold new pick for investors wanting high upside in a shifting market.

The company released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on Tuesday, offering two fully downloadable, customizable large language models that don’t require a license fee or API gate. Both models are text-only and are being shared under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning anyone can download the model weights from platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face. They also work on LM Studio and Ollama, and can run on everything from laptops to cloud servers. OpenAI said the models are optimized to function across a range of hardware, including consumer devices and chips from Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras, and Groq. OpenAI trained models to block malicious fine-tuning OpenAI said it delayed releasing the models to complete safety evaluations. During pre-training, the company filtered out sensitive material, specifically chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear data. It also tested scenarios where bad actors might try to fine-tune the models for malicious tasks. The company reported that none of those experiments led to models reaching its internal “high capability” threshold, a classification outlined in its Preparedness Framework, which it uses to assess harm potential. Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, told reporters, “It’s been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there.” gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!) (and a smaller one that runs on a phone). super proud of the team; big triumph of technology. — Sam Altman (@sama) August 5, 2025 He added that the company also included three external expert groups to audit and comment on the fine-tuning of safety tests. These models aren’t open-source in the traditional sense. OpenAI is only providing the model weights, not the full training code or datasets. But they are still open enough to allow users to test, fine-tune, and deploy them however they see fit. The company framed this as a middle ground between full transparency and maintaining some control. Amazon, Microsoft, and Anthropic expand AI marketplace The models will also be available through cloud platforms. Amazon , Microsoft , and Baseten are offering gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b directly to customers. This is the first time Amazon Web Services (AWS) will host OpenAI models, and they will be accessible through both Bedrock and Sagemaker. Amazon said these models will help customers build AI agents capable of advanced reasoning and step-by-step thinking. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, has positioned AWS as a marketplace where companies can pick from multiple AI providers, not just Amazon’s in-house tools. In addition to OpenAI, Amazon has also partnered with Anthropic, putting $8 billion into the AI startup. That deal lets AWS clients access Anthropic’s Claude models. On Tuesday, Anthropic said it would release a new Claude model, which it claims is better at coding, research, and data analysis than its previous versions. The release puts OpenAI in the same lane as other companies offering open-weight models, like Meta, Mistral AI (which is backed by Microsoft), and DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that previously gained attention for building an AI model with human-like reasoning. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said, “OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they’re advancing innovation in open-source software.” Nvidia partnered with OpenAI to make sure the models perform well across its hardware. So did AMD, Cerebras, and Groq, giving users more flexibility when choosing where to run the models. Both gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b support chain-of-thought processing, tool usage, and tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Users can run them locally or in the cloud without needing to call an API or rely on a paid plan. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, fueled by media attention and the asset’s performance.

Often, Bitcoin’s strong performance acts as a catalyst for the entire cryptocurrency market , pulling altcoins along with it.

This significant move for BTC $114,000 underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its position at the forefront of the digital economy.

In after-hours trading, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell about 4%, as the forecast failed to meet some investor expectations, according to Reuters . Year to date, AMD shares have jumped over 40%, far outpacing a roughly 12% gain in the benchmark chip index, as investors wager on its role in the AI boom. Companies such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI rely on AMD’s advanced processors to run AI tasks. Cloud providers are increasing their spending plans to build out data-centre capacity for AI workloads. Meta recently lifted the low end of its annual capital spending range by $2 billion—to between $66 billion and $72 billion. Likewise, Microsoft projected a record $30 billion in capital outlays for the first quarter of its fiscal year to keep pace with surging AI demand. No China sales yet as licenses are still pending For the third quarter, AMD anticipates about $8.7 billion in revenue, give or take $300 million. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had an average forecast of $8.30 billion. That outlook excludes any sales from shipments of its MI308 AI chip to China, since export licenses are still under review by the U.S. government. In April, Washington imposed curbs requiring a licence to send advanced AI processors to China. The Commerce Department is now assessing AMD’s applications, and the company said it will resume those exports once approval is granted. In mid-July, the administration quietly reversed the prohibition on specially tailored, “China-compliant” chips. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Nvidia filed applications to resume H20 GPU sales , and AMD plans to seek licences for its MI308 accelerators, but approvals are still pending Over the past ten years, under CEO Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD has transformed into a major technology supplier across computing, capitalizing on Intel’s missteps to turn its own fortunes around. As a result, AMD’s market capitalization now exceeds Intel’s by about $200 billion. But Nvidia’s growth is far ahead of both companies as its dominance in AI accelerators has made it the world’s most valuable company. AMD remains the second‐largest producer of graphics chips, the foundation for data‐center AI accelerators, and its CPUs go head‐to‐head with Intel in both PC and server markets. AMD moves more manufacturing to the U.S. In May, Su described China as a “large opportunity” for semiconductors and AI, even amid tightening export rules and shifting tariff plans. “There should be a balance between export controls for national security as well as ensuring that we get the widest possible adoption of our technology,” Su told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Wednesday. “That’s a good thing for U.S. jobs in the U.S. economy.” She added that U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and widespread adoption “is the primary objective and a really great position for us to be in.” Su said there is a “balance to be played between” restricting chip exports and providing access to them. Meanwhile, CNBC reported Super Micro Computer Inc. shares fell 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the server maker reported disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued cautious guidance for the coming quarter. In the period ended June 30, revenue rose 7.5% year-over-year. The company projects adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.52 per share on $6 billion to $7 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated $0.59 per share on $6.6 billion in revenue. For fiscal 2026, Super Micro forecasts at least $33 billion in revenue, topping the $29.94 billion consensus. After a surge in demand during 2023 for Nvidia-equipped data-center servers used in artificial intelligence, growth has since moderated. The company dodged a Nasdaq delisting after delays in its financial filings and the departure of its auditor. As of Tuesday’s close, shares had climbed about 88% this year, while the S&P 500 gained 7%.

Now, the U.S. is turning up the scrutiny on Chinese AI startups and the people helping them on American soil. Following the arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting advanced Nvidia AI chips to China, a group of U.S. lawmakers and federal agencies has increased their scrutiny of Chinese AI activity. Separately, a group of Republican senators is also pressing the Commerce Department to evaluate the potential data security risks posed by open-source Chinese AI models like DeepSeek. U.S. senators call for an investigation into Chinese AI models On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, both 28, for allegedly violating export controls by shipping tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia’s H100 processors, to China without the required government licenses. The chips are subject to strict export controls due to their strategic value in the development of AI technologies with potential military applications. The pair faces up to 20 years in prison under the Export Control Reform Act. According to prosecutors, Geng and Yang operated ALX Solutions Inc., a company based in El Monte, California, which they founded in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department began imposing tighter licensing requirements on AI chip exports. Investigators seized mobile phones and discovered communications that show the pair were fully aware that the company was used as a front to bypass export restrictions, routing shipments through Malaysia to disguise their final destination in China. The Justice Department noted that Yang had overstayed her visa, while Geng is a legal permanent U.S. resident. A federal judge in Los Angeles released Geng on a $250,000 bond, while a detention hearing for Yang is scheduled for August 12. No pleas have been entered in the case yet. The FBI and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security are leading the investigation . Senators target DeepSeek Seven Republican U.S. senators are urging the Commerce Department to probe DeepSeek , a Chinese open-source AI firm, for potential data security and export control violations. In a letter sent Tuesday , the senators, Todd Young, John Cornyn, John Curtis, Bill Cassidy, Marsha Blackburn, and Jon Husted, led by Sen. Ted Budd, called on the Commerce Department to assess whether Chinese AI models may be collecting data from American users and funneling it to the Chinese government or military. The letter raises several key concerns, like whether DeepSeek’s software could be transmitting U.S. personal or enterprise data back to Chinese servers, whether it has gained unauthorized access to export-controlled semiconductors, and whether it has violated terms of use for U.S.-based models to improve its own systems. The senators also referenced concerns that DeepSeek may have misappropriated U.S. AI technology, reiterating a previous statement made in January by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who vowed to impose restrictions if such violations were confirmed. U.S. officials remain skeptical of DeepSeek’s claims that its AI reasoning models were on par with, or superior to, leading U.S. models at a fraction of the cost. They still believe that the company’s success came from skimming off U.S. technologies. The Commerce Department has yet to comment on the senators’ letter or the latest criminal charges.

In a new YouTube video, Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers that if the S&P 500 (SPX) breaks out past a key resistance level, it may trigger FOMO (fear of missing out), driving Bitcoin and stocks even higher as people with cash on the sidelines rush in. “If the S&P is able to break out of this zone, break past the logarithmic resistance that spans back from the peak of 2007 – and 2009 being that low – I think we could go on a pretty significant run to the upside. And I could even say it’s severe for the bears or anyone sitting on the sideline with too much cash… Institutions, retail, no matter who it is… if they have too much still sitting on the sidelines, I think that’s where the FOMO would really kick in if we’re able to break out of this high that’s just been put in at around 6,400 points on the S&P 500.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Pizzino also shares a weekly chart showing Bitcoin’s historical price correlation with the S&P 500, suggesting the flagship crypto asset will likely print new all-time highs if the SPX logarithmic resistance level is breached. “If that occurs, Bitcoin’s price … would probably follow suit into that period.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube As of Monday’s close, the SPX is trading for 6,329. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $115,026 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours.

Traders are now targeting newer tokens with higher upside as XRP and DOGE lose momentum in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names starting to trend as funds rotate. The wider crypto market has seen a steady shake-up in recent weeks. The ETF-driven excitement of XRP is fading with declining odds as investors shift to other tokens. Meanwhile, DOGE has struggled to gain major fresh developments despite having a strong social media presence. Although altcoin rotation is nothing new, the pace of movement this time has surprised analysts. Investors are now more focused on narrative, token utility, and community strength. These shifts have helped spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE among a short list of coins that are set to explode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Steam as Traders Eye Gains XRP and DOGE funds are flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE as momentum grows around its presale. Interest in the coin is rising fast and early buyers are expecting up to 27x returns on initial investment. Traders say the timing is right—XRP hype is cooling, and DOGE lacks a clear path to new highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh narrative that ties political energy with meme coin appeal. Its capped supply model and strong branding makes it stand out in the presale market. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself to attract both crypto natives and new investors unlike other tokens that launch without structure. The project blends cultural relevance with smart economics. Its presale is already drawing in whales and retail holders. Wallet data shows presence of large flows from existing large-cap tokens into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The flow could mirror early SHIB cycles when capital moved quickly into high-upside opportunities. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to sell out ahead of schedule. Meme Coins Lose Momentum as Traders Search for the Next Big Run DOGE and SHIB kicked off the last meme cycle in late 2024. However, the coins are now trading sideways with low volatility. Even major news fails to bring meaningful movement. The lack of driving factors is pushing retail and mid-level traders to seek out smaller tokens with bigger potential. Newer tokens have the advantage of surprise. They attract early momentum with less overhead and fresh excitement. This has made the space competitive but also wide open for the right token at the right time. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be fitting that profile well. It combines cultural timing, simple access, and a strong hook—elements that made earlier meme tokens break out in past cycles. Final Thoughts Crypto is fast and unforgiving for investors who invest late. Crypto investors who catch trends early often see the biggest rewards. Right now, the trend is clear: large holders are trimming positions in older tokens and moving into new altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is receiving growing attention as this shift continues. If the presale closes as expected and demand holds, the coin may lead the next breakout wave in the crypto market.

Based in Daegu, Shin was found guilty of manipulating trading data and misleading customers. He is already serving a seven-year sentence for misappropriating ₩10 billion (about $7.5 million) in deposits, and now faces more jail time over a smaller but still serious scheme. Inflated Trading Volume And Misleading Announcements According to the Daegu District Court, Shin used false trading figures to pump up the crypto market price of Bitsonic Coin (BSC). He lured customers with fake announcements and boosted “KRW points” through sham buybacks. Those points then funded actual purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum from platform users. Once Shin converted the crypto into cash, he poured money into unrelated firms. The court found that this cycle netted him roughly ₩160 million ($115,000) in ill-gotten gains. Investigators noted that Shin also gave investors a lock-up period guarantee. In reality, neither the investments nor the promised interest could be returned. When victims pressed for their funds, they discovered the promise was hollow. Earlier Price Manipulation Conviction In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic’s chief technology officer, known only by the surname Bae, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison for a separate fraud involving price manipulation. Reports said that this earlier verdict stemmed from a Seoul District Court finding that both executives deceptively profited by inflating trade volumes. At that time, Shin settled with the two biggest victims, which the judge said helped merit a lighter sentence. The February ruling emphasized that neither Shin nor Bae had prior convictions for similar crimes. Judge Seong Gi-jun noted that their lack of a criminal record and Shin’s partial restitution with major victims weighed in favor of a “lenient” approach under South Korean law. Yet the sizable sums involved—₩10 billion in deposits and the recent ₩160 million—underscore the scale of trust these executives betrayed. Questions Over Exchange Oversight According to Digital Asset reports , professionals indicate that the crypto exchange Bitsonic situation points to loopholes in real-time observation of exchange operations. Swollen volumes and unverified lock-up assurances are likely to go undetected without more robust on-chain analytics. Customer trust suffers every time a high-profile exchange scandal erupts. Some traders are already demanding mandatory proof-of-reserves audits and transparent order books to help deter such abuses.

49608228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799285,1754438454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49608228.jpeg,"Bitcoin Holds Steady At $115,000, But Realized Price Data Warns Of Fragility",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-115000-realized-price-data-warns/,"Following another rejection from the $120,000 region on July 21, Bitcoin (BTC) is now holding steady around the $115,000 level. However, realized price data suggests that BTC’s surface-level calm may be nearing its end. Old Bitcoin Whales Stop Realizing Gains According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin whale behavior indicates that the asset may be walking a tightrope. While “old whales” have stopped realizing profits, newer whales remain slightly in the green – though only marginally. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Market Flashes Warning: IBIT Outflows Paired With Drop In Tron USDT Transfers Here, old whales refer to large BTC holders who have held the digital asset for more than a year. New whales – including institutional players – are those who entered the market within the past year. Kripto Mevsimi notes that the current balance between old capital and newly invested capital may not hold much longer. A decisive break in either direction could push BTC into a new price range. The chart below illustrates the rising realized cap of old whales from 2022 to 2024, confirming that this cohort steadily realized profits during that period. Notably, this quiet distribution phase coincided with mid-cycle market conditions. However, since early 2025, the realized cap for old whales has flattened – signalling a pause in profit-taking. Their average cost basis of $39,400 puts them well in profit, suggesting they are likely waiting for higher prices before re-entering the market. In contrast, the average cost basis for newer whales is approximately $105,300 – a level that now serves as their psychological breakeven. As long as BTC remains above this threshold, these newer investors are unlikely to sell in large numbers. That said, a drop below this critical level could trigger risk-off behavior among new whales. Kripto Mevsimi suggests that such a move could escalate current conditions from moderate profit-taking to panic selling, potentially triggering a wave of leverage unwinds. Keep An Eye On Realized Price It’s worth noting that recent activity has been minimal across both BTC investor cohorts – old whales and new whales alike. As the CryptoQuant analyst puts it: Old whales are idle. New whales are exposed. Neither is pressing the market – yet. But once the range breaks, the reaction could be sharp. In short, Bitcoin holders should closely monitor realized price levels. If BTC maintains a price above $105,000, newer capital is likely to remain stable. However, a drop below that could weaken the floor and invite downside pressure.

That said, a few warning signs point to potential short-term weakness. For instance, BTC deposits to Binance have been rising steadily after months of decline, indicating that selling pressure may increase in the near future. At press time, BTC trades at $113,500, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

With speculation mounting that the SEC may withdraw its appeal, investors are recalibrating their expectations—some now targeting 20x returns , with prices potentially climbing past $40 if institutional inflows ignite post-ETF approval. On-chain data shows consistent whale accumulation despite short-term pullbacks like the recent –6.5% dip on August 2, reinforcing the view that smart money is preparing for a decisive breakout. The prospect of a U.S.-listed XRP spot ETF has reenergized the community, and analysts argue that legal clarity could finally unlock the long-stalled upside. At the same time, many retail traders are hunting for newer opportunities with similar potential but fewer regulatory hurdles – sparking fresh interest in high-traction presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional cues align with ETF optimism Multiple market analysts agree that XRP’s trajectory hinges on one factor: regulation. A spot ETF would require the SEC to cease its legal pursuit, a move that would not only enable relisting on U.S. exchanges but also pave the way for institutional exposure via regulated channels. If this scenario unfolds, capital could pour in similarly to what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF approvals. Reports indicate that whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP are already repositioning in anticipation, a strong sign of conviction. Still, some investors see faster ROI potential outside legacy altcoins, especially as timing and entry costs become crucial considerations in a maturing bull cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A presale play attracting serious attention Amid the growing buzz surrounding XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as one of the most trustworthy early-stage crypto plays on the market today. Its smart contracts recently passed multiple security audits , reinforcing its reputation as a safe and credible investment vehicle. With community growth accelerating and early-stages allocations rapidly disappearing , the project has also topped several crypto media watchlists in recent days. Compared to legacy assets like XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean-slate narrative, free from legal entanglements but packed with breakout potential . For risk-tolerant investors, it represents a calculated entry point into what some analysts call “t he next big story in crypto ”. Risk appetite shifts as breakout bets intensify XRP remains a compelling hold for long-term investors betting on regulation-driven rallies. But as the broader market recovers and sentiment tilts bullish , traders are expanding their exposure to include high-momentum, low-barrier presales with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this thesis perfectly – pairing real community growth with strategic development and audit-backed trust signals . Its rising profile across crypto Twitter and Telegram groups suggests that investor buzz is peaking at just the right moment. Conclusion: From legal win to breakout bets XRP’s legal clarity could catalyze a 20x surge , but for those looking to enter earlier, faster-growing narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s ongoing presale may offer a sharper edge. With trust confirmed via recent audits and rising demand threatening to close allocations, it’s one of the few altcoin stories keeping pace with XRP’s bullish momentum.

On-chain data analytics firm, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), disclosed this in an X post. According to Sentora , the stablecoin volume for July was over $1.5 trillion, surpassing previous highs, including May 2025, when it was $1.39 trillion, and April, when it was $1.44 trillion. Based on the chart, the new high continues a positive trend in on-chain stablecoin settlement since the start of 2025. While the volume was just $950 billion at the start of the year, it has been over $1.2 trillion in every other month of the year, apart from January and February. Stablecoins monthly on-chain volume (Source: Sentora) Interestingly, August has already recorded almost $200 billion in on-chain volume across the first five days and is now on track to finish above $1.2 trillion by the end of the month. Meanwhile, experts have attributed the surge in on-chain volume for stablecoins to increased DeFi activity. According to Defillama, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours to reach $137.33 billion. This is mostly due to Ethereum performance, with the network performance and ETH resurgence driving renewed interest in DeFi activity. Sentora data also backs this up with the data analytics firm noting that DeFi has reached a three-year high of $179 billion this week, thanks to inflows into liquid staking protocols and ETH ascent towards $4,000. USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin transactions The new milestone reflects stablecoins’ growing adoption and increasing use for on-chain transactions. With the US finally passing the GENIUS Act stablecoin law, the fiat-pegged tokens have seen their role in the financial system cemented. Interestingly, Circle USDC dominates on-chain stablecoin volume throughout 2025, accounting for between 48% to 40% of all DeFi transactions involving stablecoins. In comparison, Tether USDT usually accounts for around 27% – 20% of the total volume each, while MakerDAO DAI also records between 33% and 17% depending on the months. This highlights USDC dominance on-chain, especially in recent years, with USDT and DAI now taking the backseat, although they had commanded more volume at different times. Still, these three stablecoins account for over 90% of the on-chain monthly stablecoin volume, with only Ethena USDe coming close at around 3%. Meanwhile, USDT usage for on-chain transactions is growing again. The stablecoin has seen sizable growth on DeFi protocols this year, with the amount of USDT supplied on Aave increasing by 123% year to date and now close to $7.5 billion. Stablecoin supply inches close to $370 billion While USDC might dominate on-chain transactions, it is USDT that remains the biggest stablecoin by supply. With a market cap of $164.70 billion, the stablecoin, which has seen its supply increase by 3.28% in the past month, now has 61.41% dominance. By comparison, USDC supply is only $63.85 billion. With a similar growth trajectory over the past month, it looks unlikely to match the USDT level in supply at this rate. Meanwhile, Ethena USDe, Sky Dollar USDS, and Dai have $9.517 billion, $4.87 billion, and $4.33 billion. USDe has been one of the best-performing stablecoins in the past month, with 79.47% growth, a performance only bested by Falcon USD (USDf), which has seen a 102% increase in that period, going from $552 million to $1.09 billion. Overall, the stablecoin market cap has reached $268.20 billion after adding $13.2 billion in the past month. At the current market cap, stablecoin supply has already doubled in the past year, and it looks set for more growth, especially as clarity continues to develop. In a sign of regulatory clarity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued guidance allowing some fully backed redeemable USD stablecoins to be classified as cash equivalents. This is expected to provide some clarity in the meantime before the broader regulations arrive. Get seen where it counts.

The meme coin market is no longer a joke – it’s an evolving space where strategic early access often leads to life-changing profits. With new ecosystems rising and retail investor interest soaring, meme coins have transformed into serious contenders in the digital asset class. From secret staking pools to deflationary tokenomics, today’s meme coins are offering more than laughs – they’re delivering utility, hype, and substantial upside potential. Among the best-positioned tokens of 2025 is MoonBull ($MOBU), whose Whitelist is live now. Alongside promising projects like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF), MoonBull is emerging as a clear standout for investors seeking the next 100x opportunity. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) The MoonBull Whitelist is officially open – and it’s already being hailed as one of the most thrilling early access opportunities in the meme coin universe. What sets this apart is its razor-sharp exclusivity. Joining the whitelist gives you a front-row seat to the $MOBU revolution, packed with perks designed to reward early believers. Here’s what whitelist members get access to: Bonus Token Allocations : More $MOBU for the same investment, giving early birds a major edge. Hidden Staking Rewards : Passive income boosters not available to the general public. Early Roadmap Access : Get insider updates before they hit the streets. And here’s the kicker: this is strictly first-come, first-served. The faster you act, the more you stand to gain. All it takes is a simple email submission to lock in your whitelist spot. As launch inches closer, whitelisted users will be the first to receive exclusive notifications about the exact presale date – well before the public even sniffs it. This isn’t theoretical potential. It’s a real-world shot at being part of the next crypto breakout, and it’s unfolding now. Reference Past Whitelist Wins: A Proven Formula for Early Success In early 2024, Layer 2 meme coins like $TOSHI on Base offered early investors exclusive airdrops that were never made available to the general public. Similarly, $WEN – launched via Solana’s memecoin incubator – rewarded whitelist holders with 10x gains in under a month. Whitelisted wallets for $WEN also received free NFTs and pre-market access to its companion dApp. MoonBull ($MOBU) builds on these proven success models with an evolved approach specifically tailored to the meme coin generation of 2025. Its whitelist isn’t just an early bird ticket – it’s a launchpad for maximized gain. Those on the hunt for the best new coin launch in 2025 will find Moon Bull leading the charge with Ethereum-based security, real staking mechanics, and reward systems inspired by the biggest meme coin wins of the last bull cycle. 2. Test ($TST) Test ($TST) is a controlled experiment turned market phenomenon. Originally designed as a limited-release meme project, Test now leads in transparency, dev commitment, and organic virality. With no pre-mines and a locked liquidity strategy, it avoids many common pitfalls associated with rug pulls. It recently introduced a liquidity farming initiative allowing users to earn native rewards simply by holding the coin and participating in the community’s governance decisions. The buzz surrounding Test accelerated after several analysts began tracking its wallet activity and saw consistent accumulation across long-term holders. Smart money seems to be betting heavily on Test’s scalability. Test made it to this list because it defied initial skepticism and evolved into a case study for what successful meme coin experimentation looks like. 3. Coq Inu ($COQ) Coq Inu ($COQ) is more than a humorous reference – it’s a cultural movement backed by real-world engagement. Designed for maximum virality, Coq Inu’s meme architecture is coupled with robust marketing mechanics, including influencer collaborations and viral trend hijacking. Built on Avalanche, it leverages fast finality and low gas fees, enabling frictionless transactions. Its growing NFT partnership wing recently announced a drop themed around early crypto memes, aimed at further increasing its community footprint. What distinguishes Coq Inu is its consistent volume and multi-language support that has fueled international adoption. Coq Inu earns its spot here by combining viral branding with real-world functionality, paving the way as a leading example of meme coin globalization. 4. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Cheems ($CHEEMS) has become synonymous with meme coin nostalgia. Initially a tribute to one of the most beloved doge memes, it has transitioned into a smart-contract-driven meme ecosystem that rewards staking and participation. What elevates Cheems from copycats is its novel burn-and-earn mechanism. Tokens are permanently burned in proportion to user staking milestones, helping reduce total supply while rewarding committed holders. Cheems is also launching a comic-themed P2E game featuring community-voted storyline arcs. This adds a gamified layer to its token utility. Cheems is included in this list for its ability to retain cultural relevance while integrating innovative token mechanics that appeal to long-term holders. 5. Sudeng ($HIPPO) Sudeng ($HIPPO) is a quiet disruptor. Operating on a low-noise, high-delivery framework, HIPPO has seen consistent wallet growth and strategic exchange listings. Unlike many coins that rely solely on hype, HIPPO focuses on value-added features like LP auto-refill mechanisms and AI-generated meme campaigns. It recently launched HIPPO DEX, a decentralized trading platform aimed at meme tokens and microcaps, offering zero-slippage swaps during peak market activity. HIPPO has gained popularity in Southeast Asian and Latin American markets thanks to its community-centric strategy. Sudeng belongs on this list because it’s quietly building an infrastructure that positions it for breakout growth in the next meme cycle. 6. Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) holds a foundational position in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Functioning as the governance token of ShibaSwap, it allows users to vote on platform proposals and yield farming configurations. Recent upgrades to the ShibaSwap interface, coupled with BONE’s integration into upcoming Shibarium Layer 2 updates, are expected to multiply its utility. Its listing on major exchanges further affirms growing institutional interest. BONE has also partnered with decentralized identity projects to create wallets that integrate meme culture and serious DeFi protocols. BONE is featured in this list because it successfully bridges meme popularity with serious governance roles in a top-tier ecosystem. 7. AI Companions ($AIC) AI Companions ($AIC) merges two of the most innovative verticals: AI and crypto. Designed as a meme coin with a mind, AIC allows holders to interact with decentralized AI bots that evolve based on community training data. With a roadmap that includes AI-driven staking pools, voice-enabled wallet interactions, and NFT-based personality upgrades, AIC offers more than just meme value – it delivers tech utility. AIC recently released a teaser of its AI Meme Engine that generates viral memes using blockchain oracle data, a tool already gaining traction across social platforms. AI Companions made this list because it is redefining what meme coins can do in a Web3-AI integrated future. 8. Comedian ($BAN) Comedian ($BAN) brings a laughter-first philosophy with serious crypto fundamentals. Known for its censorship-resistant joke NFTs, BAN has built a fully decentralized meme publishing protocol. Its DAO structure votes on weekly joke contests, rewarding participants in BAN tokens. Its P2E comedy dungeon game is scheduled to launch Q2 2025 and features token-powered performance slots and improv challenges judged by the community. BAN made this list due to its novel integration of decentralized content creation and meme tokenomics, offering a blend of fun and functionality. 9. SLERF ($SLERF) SLERF ($SLERF) might just be the meme coin wildcard of the year. With a stealth launch that attracted 20,000 holders in under 48 hours, SLERF relies on zero marketing and 100 percent organic traction. The dev team claims no central leadership, no VCs, and no paid influencers. Its gamified airdrop mechanism locks rewards behind puzzle challenges, driving community engagement. Upcoming plans include the release of an animated meme film funded entirely by the community treasury. SLERF is included in this list because it proved that meme virality and utility can coexist even in the absence of traditional promotional channels. Conclusion: Secure the Next Big Wave Before It Leaves the Shore Based on the latest research, the new coin launch in 2025 includes MoonBull. Alongside MoonBull ($MOBU), other standout meme coins like Test ($TST), Coq Inu ($COQ), Cheems ($CHEEMS), Sudeng ($HIPPO), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), AI Companions ($AIC), Comedian ($BAN), and SLERF ($SLERF) are drawing serious attention for their blend of utility and community impact. MoonBull whitelist offers a low-entry path into high-potential projects. With limited whitelist spots and early access incentives, getting in early could be the smartest crypto move of the year. As more countries adopt Bitcoin reserves and regulation adapts to support innovation, these tokens could define a new era of community-driven value creation.

This week we interviewed Eric Dresdale, President and Co-Founder of Entrokey Labs. White Hat (WH): What was the genesis for Entrokey Labs? Eric Dresdale (ED): Entrokey began with a patented innovation from KNWN Technologies, using cosmic radiation to generate quantum-resistant digital identities. After key conversations between myself and my co-founder David Harding, we realized this breakthrough could be a perfect response to the rising threats from AI and quantum computing. We set to work to evolve it from space-based to hardware-based, and ultimately into a software-only solution powered by generative AI trained on natural entropic phenomena. WH: What is Entrokey’s competitive edge? ED: EntroKey is rebuilding the cryptographic foundation for the post-quantum era, fixing entropy at the source to secure the world’s most critical digital systems. In crypto, blockchain, and Web3, we ensure the integrity of key generation and synchronization, enabling resilient wallets, trustless protocols, and quantum-safe infrastructure without hardware dependence. Our lightweight, stateless random number and key generator safeguards everything digital — from individual privacy to global enterprise systems — enabling organizations to scale trust and security without friction. WH: Who would best benefit from Entrokey’s security protocol? ED: Entrokey is a dual-use technology, making it ideal for governments, defense, and national security agencies where cryptographic integrity is mission-critical. In parallel, we are targeting regulated industries such as cloud providers, financial services including crypto and stablecoins, healthcare, and aviation where trust, compliance, and AI and post-quantum resilience are essential. WH: Crypto trading platform WOO X was hacked recently, how could have Entrokey prevented this? ED: Phishing happens. But with Entrokey, access alone is not enough. Our keys are bound to high-quality entropy and the environment they were created in. So even if an attacker gets in, they cannot use or move anything. No static keys to steal, no way to spoof the system. That is how we contain damage before it starts WH: What advice do you have for everyday crypto users to protect themselves? ED: Use an MPC or hardware wallet — These eliminate single points of failure. No seed phrase, no static key to steal. Watch for phishing — Most hacks start with a fake link. Never connect your wallet unless you're 100 percent sure. Keep your funds off exchanges — Centralized platforms are honeypots. If you're not trading, withdraw and hold on a cold wallet.

One of the most popular tools for gauging this mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This vital indicator recently shifted, moving from “Greed” to a “Neutral” reading of 54 as of August 6. This change reflects a cooling of intense optimism and suggests a more balanced, yet cautious, crypto market sentiment among participants. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies whether investors are feeling overly greedy (potentially leading to a market correction) or excessively fearful (which might signal a buying opportunity). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, often selling assets in panic. 25-49: Fear – General apprehension and uncertainty prevail. 50-54: Neutral – The current zone, indicating a balanced outlook without strong emotional biases. 55-74: Greed – Enthusiasm is growing, and prices might be rising. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often a sign of market tops. Understanding this scale helps you interpret the current investor sentiment and consider how it might influence market movements. How Does the Index Measure Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture of the market’s mood. These factors collectively capture various aspects of market volatility and activity, giving us a holistic view. Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Assesses current market volume and momentum. Strong buying volume usually points to greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various social media platforms, looking at crypto-related discussions. Surveys (15%): Historically involved polls about market outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors move from altcoins to Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like “Bitcoin price manipulation.” Each of these elements contributes to the final score, offering a nuanced perspective on prevailing crypto market sentiment . What Does “Neutral” Sentiment Really Mean for Investors? The recent shift to a “Neutral” reading of 54 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals a period of equilibrium. It means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed dominates the market. For investors, this balanced state can imply several things: Uncertainty: A neutral reading often reflects a wait-and-see approach, where investors are not rushing into major decisions. Consolidation: Prices might move sideways, consolidating recent gains or losses as the market digests new information. Opportunity for Analysis: This phase provides an excellent opportunity to conduct thorough research rather than acting on impulse. It’s a time to evaluate fundamentals and technical indicators without the noise of extreme emotions. While some might view “Neutral” as uneventful, it is a crucial period for strategic planning. It suggests the market is taking a breath, potentially preparing for its next significant move, influenced by upcoming news or broader economic factors. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively? It serves as a valuable sentiment tool, but it’s important not to rely on it in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Historically, extreme fear has often presented buying opportunities, while extreme greed has preceded market corrections. A neutral phase prompts careful consideration. Combine with Other Indicators: Always pair the index with technical analysis (e.g., support/resistance levels, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (e.g., project developments, adoption rates). Risk Management: A neutral reading doesn’t eliminate risk. Maintain a diversified portfolio and stick to your risk management strategy, especially given ongoing market volatility . Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates, as these can quickly shift investor sentiment from neutral to either extreme. The index is a powerful indicator of human emotion in the market. Use it to understand the crowd’s psychology, but always make decisions based on your own research and financial goals. The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 54, settling into the “Neutral” zone, signifies a momentary pause in the intense emotional swings of the crypto market. This balanced state provides a valuable opportunity for investors to assess their positions without the pressure of extreme panic or euphoria. While not a definitive trading signal, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment empowers you to make more rational, data-driven decisions. Always remember that successful investing combines sentiment analysis with thorough research and a disciplined approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. 2. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. 3. What does a “Neutral” reading on the index mean? A “Neutral” reading, like the current 54, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market. It suggests a period of balance, uncertainty, or consolidation. 4. Should I make investment decisions based solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the index is a sentiment tool and should not be used in isolation. Always combine it with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and your own risk management strategy for informed decisions. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The original content states that the survey component is currently paused, though the specific reason for the pause is not detailed within the index’s public information.

The guidance declares that liquid staking activities do not constitute securities transactions. This means participants would not be required to register such activities with the SEC. This move could ease regulatory pressure on blockchain networks and DeFi platforms offering these services. However, Crenshaw believes this interpretation is dangerously misleading. Crenshaw said the Liquid Staking Statement builds one assumption on top of another, creating what she described as a shaky wall of facts disconnected from the realities of the industry. She added that the guidance provides little clarity, lacks a legal foundation, and merely reflects the SEC staff’s views—not the Commission’s official position. Crenshaw criticized the guidance for drawing “definitive declarations about how liquid staking works” without providing evidence or addressing the diversity of staking mechanisms across blockchain ecosystems. She warned that the guidance fails to offer meaningful direction for companies trying to stay compliant. SEC’s liquid staking guidance sparks division Earlier in the day, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a legal interpretation stating that liquid staking—a system that allows users to earn staking rewards while still being able to trade or move their staked tokens—is not a securities offering. This clarification means platforms offering liquid staking services may not have to register with the SEC under current securities laws, potentially opening the door for broader innovation and user adoption. The stance represents a continuation of the pro-innovation regulatory steps rolled out under the Trump-era Project Crypto, which promoted hands-off regulatory approaches in certain aspects of the crypto economy. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also made a statement after the release from the agency, claiming that liquid staking is similar to a popular practice of leaving goods with an agent who gives receipts in return . Peirce wrote that the Division’s statement makes it clear that, in its view, liquid staking activities tied to protocol staking do not constitute the offer and sale of securities. But Crenshaw was quick to distance the full Commission from this interpretation. Crenshaw stated that the guidance holds no binding authority and does not represent the consensus of the Commission, either presently or in the future. She argued that the legal conclusions within the document rest entirely on narrow, hypothetical assumptions. If a liquid staking product differs significantly from the outlined assumptions, the exemption likely wouldn’t apply. Commissioner urges caution among liquid stakers Crenshaw’s warning was stark: don’t rely on this guidance as a free pass. She noted that any entity whose liquid staking program differs in any way from the long list of assumptions in the Liquid Staking Statement should take caution, emphasizing “caveat liquid staker”—a Latin phrase meaning “let the liquid staker beware.” She emphasized that entities operating in the liquid staking space are still at risk of enforcement, especially as the SEC continues its broader crackdown on crypto-related securities violations. Crenshaw has long voiced concerns that certain crypto products and platforms are sidestepping investor protections. Her comments mirror a broader fissure at the Commission on how to approach fast-changing digital money systems. Some staffers and commissioners argue that the existing regime only needs to be tinkered with to suit itself to crypto; Crenshaw is advocating a stricter, more data-informed approach. She argued that the rule cannot create regulatory certainty on unsupported assumptions. Some in the crypto world voiced a sense of hopefulness, however guarded. Perhaps most encouraging from a regulatory perspective, those in liquid staking saw enough in this statement to help them innovate without immediately worrying about regulatory hammer fallout. Still, Crenshaw’s dissent raised red flags with legal experts, who said the dissent, read literally, means any departure from those assumptions in staff guidance could lead to an enforcement action.

A prominent investor, known as @qwatio, faces the imminent threat of a substantial Bitcoin liquidation . This isn’t just any trade; it’s a staggering $115 million BTC short position , putting immense pressure on the market and the trader. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s High-Stakes Bet What exactly is happening? According to observations shared by @EmberCN on X, this particular Hyperliquid whale has placed a colossal bet against Bitcoin’s price. Their short position, valued at an eye-watering $115 million, is dangerously close to its liquidation point. The critical price level where this massive position could be forcibly closed is $114,491. For those new to the space, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market movements. A “short position” is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. If the price rises instead, the trader incurs losses, and if it hits the liquidation price, their position is automatically closed to prevent further losses, often leading to significant capital loss for the trader. The Perilous Dance of a $115M BTC Short Position The situation became even more dramatic earlier today. To avoid the dreaded Bitcoin liquidation of their massive BTC short position , the investor made a desperate move. They reportedly closed an Ethereum (ETH) short position at a loss. This action was a strategic, albeit costly, attempt to increase the margin for their Bitcoin bet, giving it more breathing room against the rising price. This maneuver highlights the extreme crypto trading risk inherent in highly leveraged positions. Traders often use leverage to amplify potential returns, but it also magnifies potential losses, making liquidation a constant threat if the market moves against their bet. The sheer scale of this particular position makes its potential liquidation a point of intense focus for market observers. What Does Imminent Bitcoin Liquidation Mean for the Market? When a large position like this faces Bitcoin liquidation , it can have ripple effects. The automated selling that occurs during liquidation can add selling pressure to the market, potentially causing further price drops, especially in illiquid conditions. While the overall market might absorb a $115 million liquidation, it still represents a significant event that traders and analysts closely monitor. The ability to track such events is largely due to the transparency offered by on-chain data . Analysts like @EmberCN can observe large movements and positions on decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, providing crucial insights into market sentiment and potential volatility. This transparency, while beneficial for market analysis, also puts a spotlight on individual traders’ high-stakes endeavors. Lessons from High-Leverage Crypto Trading Risk This unfolding scenario offers valuable lessons for all participants in the crypto market, especially those considering leveraged trading. The immense pressure on the Hyperliquid whale underscores the critical importance of risk management. Even experienced traders can find themselves in precarious positions if they misjudge market movements or overextend their leverage. Understand Liquidation Levels: Always know the exact price at which your position will be liquidated. Manage Your Margin: Proactively add margin or reduce position size before it becomes a desperate last-minute scramble. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged bet. Monitor On-Chain Data: While not a crystal ball, it provides valuable insights into large market movements and potential risks. The Power of On-Chain Data in Crypto Monitoring The role of on-chain data cannot be overstated in today’s transparent blockchain ecosystem. It allows for a level of market insight previously unavailable in traditional finance. By analyzing public ledger information, researchers and traders can identify significant positions, track whale movements, and anticipate potential market volatility. This real-time data empowers market participants to make more informed decisions, mitigating some of the inherent crypto trading risk . The dramatic plight of the Hyperliquid whale and their $115 million BTC short position serves as a potent reminder of the volatile and high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency trading. While the outcome remains uncertain, the situation vividly illustrates the power of market forces and the ever-present threat of Bitcoin liquidation for those who venture into leveraged positions without robust risk management. It’s a testament to the fact that even the largest players can find themselves on the brink. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a short position in cryptocurrency trading? A short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like Bitcoin) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later and return it, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the trader incurs losses. 2. What does it mean for a crypto position to be liquidated? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a required maintenance level, usually due to adverse price movements. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial margin. 3. Who are @qwatio and @EmberCN? @qwatio is the pseudonymous trader holding the large Bitcoin short position on Hyperliquid. @EmberCN is an on-chain data analyst who brought attention to this specific high-risk trade, highlighting significant market activity. 4. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. It operates on a blockchain, offering high performance and transparency for its users. 5. How can crypto traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, setting stop-loss orders, and actively monitoring their positions to add margin or reduce exposure if the market moves against them.

According to analysts, the approval may follow the milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, investors are actively looking for other coins that may deliver massive returns before XRP gets to traditional finance. Five crypto presales already stand out due to their unique roadmaps and presale features. Investors are already accumulating the coins at a fast speed in the presale, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the forefront. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Leading with 33x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved to become the leading crypto presale before the anticipated approval of the XRP ETF. Its path is compared to the early years of Ripple in terms of ecosystem and community. Based on the Binance Smart Chain, MAGACOIN will offer staking benefits, meme potential, and a governance solution that attracts DeFi users and retail traders. The aggressive roadmap and the viral traction being made on social channels is what helps make MAGACOIN stand out. According to experts, the token has the potential for a 33x rise before the XRP ETFsurges, particularly as political meme tokens once again start to trend. The presale is currently active, and it is one of the remaining few ground-floor opportunities before the broader market catalysts step in. 2. Ozak AI – AI Meets Decentralized Analytics Ozak AI is blending artificial intelligence with decentralized analytics to revolutionize how businesses use data. The platform operates without intermediaries and offers real-time insights for sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. Its machine learning capabilities combined with blockchain security create a flexible and scalable ecosystem. Ozak AI is currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.005 per token. Over 40 million tokens have already been sold out of 200 million. 3. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – Meme Power with Real Momentum Little Pepe is one of the fastest-growing meme coins to pay attention to in 2025. The Ethereum-based project sold out Stage 8 of its presale two months earlier, raising $13.775 million. Its low token price and clear roadmap are attracting investors to rush in. Stage 9 will raise the price to $0.0018, and the present phase is a crucial entry point for investors. 4. BlockDAG – The Biggest Presale in Seven Years BlockDAG is rewriting the rules with over $361 million raised and 2.5 million users mining via its X1 app. The project is entering its final phase with only days left before its global launch on August 11. The confirmed listing price is 30 times higher than the current rate. Investors are swarming in for features like a 10 BTC auction pool and a no-vesting token release. 5. Maxi Doge – High-Yield Meme Coin Action Maxi Doge has already raised more than $315,000 in several days. The memecoin is gaining traction because of the staking rewards of more than 1,400% APY and viral branding. It provides a Web3-facilitated buying procedure and does not make any exclusive allocations but keeps all things clear and community-based. A new price increase is looming. After the presale, early investors will be able to stake or hold their tokens. Conclusion The launch of the XRP ETF has kindled new enthusiasm in the crypto industry. Retail investors are also in search of high-potential investments as institutions appear in the market. MAGACOIN is one of the most prominent presale tokens with an ambitious story. As these five coins become more popular, the opportunity to buy early could resemble the trajectory of XRP.

Investors are increasingly optimistic ahead of the SEC’s expected status report on August 15, which may finally end Ripple’s multi-year lawsuit. This outcome could unlock a flood of institutional adoption and pave the way for XRP spot ETF approvals. With whale wallets scooping up over $60 million in the token recently, market sentiment is turning decisively bullish. Whale Activity and ETF Buzz Signal Institutional Confidence XRP isn’t rallying alone as Institutional capital has flowed heavily into Ethereum and XRP over the past few weeks, according to CoinShares. XRP-related investment products saw $31.26 million in inflows, while whale trackers confirmed large transactions, including a single 20 million transfer from Upbit worth over $60 million. Additionally, anticipation is mounting over potential XRP ETF approvals. The SEC has set an October 17 deadline to rule on several XRP spot ETFs, and a recent policy shift enabling in-kind redemptions has eliminated key logistical barriers. If approved, these ETFs could dramatically reduce the token’s circulating supply and fuel further price appreciation. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart.

The cryptocurrency world constantly shifts, and understanding its dynamics is key to navigating its opportunities. Currently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 42. This figure, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), signals a clear shift: we are in a Bitcoin Season . What does this mean for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Let’s dive in. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market . As reported by CoinMarketCap, the index recently registered 42, a slight dip from the previous day. This specific number is crucial because it indicates that Bitcoin is currently outperforming the majority of altcoins. Index Range: The index scores from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, this phase begins when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 42 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season , highlighting a period where the leading cryptocurrency dominates market gains. Why Are We Seeing a Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors contribute to the current Bitcoin Season , influencing altcoin performance . Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, especially during periods of uncertainty or when institutional interest grows. Investors might gravitate towards Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” asset within the volatile crypto space. Key drivers often include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic shifts can push investors towards less speculative assets, and within crypto, Bitcoin often fills this role. Halving Narratives: Anticipation around Bitcoin’s halving events can drive significant pre-halving rallies, drawing capital away from altcoins. Spot ETF Approvals: Recent developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, have channeled substantial institutional capital directly into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and dominance. This increased focus on Bitcoin naturally impacts the Altcoin Season Index , pushing it lower as altcoins struggle to keep pace. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed investment decisions. During a Bitcoin Season , it is common for altcoins to either consolidate or see declines against Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without potential, but their gains may be less pronounced or even negative compared to Bitcoin’s. Consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Portfolio: Assess your exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. You might consider rebalancing if your portfolio is heavily skewed towards underperforming altcoins. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, projects with robust technology, strong communities, and clear use cases may still perform well in the long term. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those bullish on specific altcoins, DCA can be an effective strategy to accumulate assets at potentially lower prices. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index will continue to be a valuable tool to gauge shifts in market sentiment and identify potential turning points. When Might Altcoin Performance Rebound? The question on many investors’ minds is: when will the pendulum swing back, and when can we expect a strong Altcoin Season ? Historically, after periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This typically happens once Bitcoin’s rally cools down or consolidates at new highs. Watch for these signs: Bitcoin Price Stability: A period of consolidation for Bitcoin after a significant rally can free up capital for altcoin speculation. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Track Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A clear downtrend here often precedes an altcoin surge. Increased Volume in Altcoins: A significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins can signal renewed interest. The Altcoin Season Index will be your go-to metric, showing a sustained move above 75 as altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 42 clearly indicates we are in a Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to the broader altcoin market. While challenging for some altcoin holders, it presents opportunities for strategic rebalancing and focusing on long-term potential. Staying informed about crypto market trends and understanding the dynamics of altcoin performance are crucial for navigating these cycles effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, often tracked by CoinMarketCap, that measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin are performing better over a 90-day period. It indicates whether the market is in an “Altcoin Season” or a “Bitcoin Season.” Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season is determined when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index typically falls below 75 during this period. Q3: Should I sell all my altcoins during a Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While altcoins may underperform Bitcoin during a Bitcoin Season, selling all holdings might lead to missing out on future rallies. It’s often recommended to re-evaluate your portfolio, consider dollar-cost averaging, and focus on projects with strong fundamentals for long-term potential. Q4: What are the key indicators that an Altcoin Season might be approaching? Key indicators include Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, a declining Bitcoin dominance chart, and a significant increase in trading volume across a broad range of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index moving above 75 would confirm its arrival. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index include all cryptocurrencies? No, the Altcoin Season Index typically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to focus purely on the performance of native altcoins against Bitcoin within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Top-tier users enjoy perks like account managers and custom deals, but Stake’s withdrawal process can slow down, especially with large amounts. Also, the climb through levels may not appeal to users who prefer instant perks right from the start. For those who value structure and don’t mind the wait, Stake is still a strong choice, even if it lacks Spartans’ fluid experience. Roobet: Community-Centered with Personalized Bonuses Roobet earns a place among the best crypto gambling platforms by focusing on community and frequent player perks. It’s a favorite for regular users thanks to cashback, birthday rewards, and offers tailored to personal activity. VIP members also get exclusive gifts and merchandise. That said, Roobet’s payout system still involves reviews for larger sums, making it less suitable for those who want instant crypto access. Its VIP setup adds value but focuses more on engagement and experience rather than offering the raw advantages that big-stakes players seek. BetMGM: Familiar Comforts, Less Crypto Focus BetMGM appeals to those who prefer the feel of a traditional casino. Its VIP club features hotel perks, events access, and personal support for high-tier members. This appeals to users who enjoy combining real-world luxury with online betting. But when measured against the best crypto gambling platforms, BetMGM falls short on crypto compatibility. Its focus is still tied to fiat systems, with limited support for fast crypto withdrawals. That makes it less efficient for users who want frictionless rewards and quick access to their winnings. 1xBet: Massive Markets With Tiered VIP System 1xBet offers an extensive range of betting options, from global sports to niche markets, and pairs this with a multi-level VIP club. Users get cashback and rewards based on points. It’s a good fit for those who like variety and structured bonuses. Still, it doesn’t fully stand with top-tier crypto-native platforms. While crypto options exist, payouts may be slower, and bonuses often come with tight playthrough terms. It serves global high-volume players well, but lacks the speed and direct perks that define the best crypto gambling platforms. Final Thoughts The best crypto gambling platforms in 2025 go beyond loyalty tiers. Serious players want fast service, flexible benefits, and bonuses that reflect their activity. Spartans leads with its crypto-first model, instant payouts, and real-time perks. While Stake.com and Roobet bring organized loyalty systems, and BetMGM and 1xBet offer traditional VIP comfort, Spartans provides a full-service experience shaped around the needs of modern high-stakes users. Those who expect top treatment and quick access to their rewards will find Spartans to be the standout name among the best crypto gambling platforms .

49610545,548510,1754442023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49610545.jpeg,Coinbase Plans $2 Billion Private Convertible Note Offering Following Q2 Results,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-plans-2b-private-convertible-offering/,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to raise $2 billion through a private convertible note offering following a weaker-than-expected second-quarter performance. The move comes as COIN shares recorded a 15% decline on August 4, reflecting market reactions to the company’s reported drop in revenue and increased operational costs. Details of the Convertible Note Offering According to the announcement, the proposed fundraising will be conducted through a private placement targeting qualified institutional buyers. The offering will consist of two tranches of senior unsecured notes, each worth $1 billion, set to mature in 2029 and 2032 respectively. Coinbase stated that the proceeds would be allocated toward capped call transactions to limit dilution risks, with the remaining funds earmarked for general corporate purposes , including working capital, acquisitions, and potential debt repurchases. The $2 billion offering is structured as two separate note issues, one due October 1, 2029, and the other due October 1, 2032. Both instruments are convertible into cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of the two, at Coinbase’s discretion. The company also provided an option for initial buyers to purchase up to an additional $300 million in notes across both series, depending on investor demand at the time of pricing. Convertible notes are often used by companies seeking to access liquidity while managing potential shareholder dilution. Coinbase plans to enter into capped call transactions on each tranche, which can offset future conversion costs if its stock trades above a predetermined level. These hedging activities may involve trading Coinbase’s shares or related derivatives during and after the pricing period. The final interest rates and conversion terms will be determined upon completion of the offering. At the time of writing, COIN shares is down over 3%, dropping to $307 levels. Market Context and Investor Reactions Coinbase’s fundraising initiative follows a broader trend among cryptocurrency firms turning to convertible debt as a financing tool amid volatile market conditions. Other companies in the sector, including Marathon Digital (MARA), have recently issued similar instruments to promote balance sheet flexibility. Analyst sentiment on Coinbase remains mixed following its Q2 earnings release. While research firm Benchmark maintained a “Buy” rating, citing long-term growth opportunities, other analysts, including Mizuho, highlighted pressure on revenue streams such as USDC-related interest income from issuer partner Circle. Mizuho’s note suggested that shrinking margins from Circle’s reserves could affect Coinbase’s subscription and services revenue mix in upcoming quarters. The planned $2 billion raise is seen as part of Coinbase’s strategy to secure capital ahead of potential market shifts while maintaining options for managing existing debt obligations, such as the company’s outstanding 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2031 convertible and senior notes.

The Ethena chart setup is flashing a pattern that could lead to a move toward $1.33, a repeat of a rally traders still remember. Toncoin is feeling the pressure, dropping 3.63 % and moving closer to its $2.93 support level. Both are holding at important price zones, waiting for the next push. The wider market may be uncertain, but one project is moving in the opposite direction. Cold Wallet ($CWT) presale has already pulled in over $5.7M and sold more than 643.72 million coins in just 16 stages. The buys are not random, they are large, focused, and coming in before the next stage price increase. While others hold back, Cold Wallet (CWT) is being actively picked up by whales, pushing it into the spotlight among the best cryptos right now. Ethena Chart Hints At 89% Move Momentum builds in Ethena via a familiar pattern. Technicals echo a past breakout event. In 2024 ENA formed a falling wedge and double‑bottom structure. That led to an 89 % rally. Today’s dip mirrors that cycle. Current price action shows retest of the 200‑day moving average. Resistance lies near $0.70. A clean breakout above this level may push price toward $1.33. If it matches last year’s playbook, the move could be repeatable. Current chart setup remains bullish provided the neckline clears. Toncoin lurks Near $2.93 Support Toncoin sentiment is turning cautious. A 3.63 % daily drop pushed price down to $3.26. At the same time, trading volume jumped by almost 50 %, signaling rising sell‑side pressure. RSI trends toward oversold territory. The critical support at $2.93 is under test. If that level breaks, the price could fall toward $2.50. Some expect a rebound back to $3.43. Macro concerns weigh on market mood. Regulatory uncertainty linked to Telegram integration adds to the unease. Despite over 1,000 dApps supported and strong network speed, the sentiment remains divided. Dilution risk and competitive pressure further cloud the outlook. Bulls remain hopeful of rebound but overall market tone stays cautious. Cold Wallet Presale Attracts Whales With $5.7M Funding Cold Wallet presale has already raised over $5.7M at the current price of $0.00924 in Stage 16. More than 643.72 million coins are sold out of a 150‑stage schedule. Strong whale interest is driving early stage buys in a structured pattern. At the $0.00924 presale stage, large wallets are stacking coins before price moves upward. These purchases are deliberate and high‑value rather than spread‑out small buys. Such activity confirms serious confidence in Cold Wallet as one of the best crypto assets right now. Whale transactions have increased chatter across crypto channels. Big wallets entering at this stage signal rising trust. Over 643.72 million coins are already taken and more than $5.7M is raised. Only 134 stages remain before presale ends. Early holders paying $0.00924 could see a return near 3700 % if the token lists at $0.3517. That potential ROI makes every large wallet move significant. This profit projection stands at about 3,700 % from the entry price of $0.00924 to the launch price of $0.3517. Utility underlies the demand. Cold Wallet presale grants access to platform perks, early feature entry, and higher staking rewards. Participants at this stage secure more than just a coin, they gain privileged access running alongside the system. Whale behaviour reflects early strategic positioning, not speculation only. Wallets are backing Cold Wallet while price remains favorable. This presale shows that Cold Wallet is a platform with rising demand. With $5.7M raised, 643.72M coins sold, and strong whale uptake, it stands out amid broader market uncertainty. The momentum built by early stage participation paints a clear picture: Cold Wallet could deliver hefty gains for those joining now. Conclusion Looking at recent market moves, the gap between these updates is clear. Ethena’s chart hints at another possible rally, repeating a setup that previously took price near $1.33. Toncoin’s path looks tougher, with selling pressure building and sentiment split as it tests its $2.93 support. Cold Wallet tells a very different story. With over $5.7M raised, more than 643.72 million coins sold, and a projected 3,700 % ROI for those buying now at $0.00924, whale activity is building fast during the early stages. This surge in high‑value buys suggests Cold Wallet has become the preferred choice in the current market. Waiting too long could mean missing the most favorable entry point before the next price shift.

49610649,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=173604,1754442041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49610649.jpeg,Whale Shorts XRP & SOL Before Crash—DOGE Profits Revealed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whale-shorts-xrp-sol-before-crash-doge-profits-revealed/,"XRP and Solana just experienced a sharp shake-up, triggered by a wave of high-leverage short positions from crypto whales. With tens of millions poured into bearish bets, both tokens were pushed into volatile territory, leaving traders scrambling. But while the pressure mounted across much of the altcoin landscape, Dogecoin quietly posted another win—defying gravity with solid support and new gains. And beneath the surface of this volatility, another altcoin has started generating real buzz: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early investors are paying close attention to its momentum, as it rides market chaos with surprising resilience. XRP Faces Aggressive Whale Shorts XRP became the target of large short positions in early August, with at least one major whale placing a $3.33 million bet against it using 20x leverage around the $2.93 level. Cumulatively, shorts across XRP and Solana topped $17 million—applying strong sell-side pressure that briefly knocked XRP below $3. Despite the dip, not all shorts ended profitably. XRP quickly rebounded, triggering liquidations for over-leveraged traders. Still, sentiment remains conflicted. Some analysts forecast further declines toward $2.76, while others point to whale accumulation as a sign of long-term confidence. As Ripple pushes ahead with its Trust Bank initiative, XRP walks a fine line between bullish structural changes and looming short-term resistance. Solana Slips Amid Heavy Dumps Solana didn’t fare much better. One whale reportedly sold $17 million in SOL, aligning with a sharp 12% price decline over the past week. Technical charts now reflect a “rounding top” pattern—commonly seen before extended downtrends. If SOL fails to maintain its current support, analysts suggest a possible slide toward $120. Still, other large players continue to buy the dip, with some institutional wallets slowly building positions. This split sentiment underscores the broader theme: whales are using volatility to play both sides, long and short. Dogecoin Proves Surprisingly Resilient While other altcoins wobbled, Dogecoin showed strength. DOGE briefly climbed past $0.20 before consolidating just below it around $0.198. Strong volume spikes accompanied breakout attempts through $0.194 and $0.198—signals that traders haven’t lost interest. For August 2025, DOGE’s forecast range sits between $0.192 and $0.259, with upside potential toward $0.30 if momentum holds. Meme coin sentiment remains one of crypto’s most unpredictable forces—and Dogecoin appears to still be riding the wave. New Money Eyes Emerging Altcoin Contender As Whales are Shorting XRP and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Capture 24,800% ROI Before the Market Rebounds. That’s the claim making the rounds among crypto analysts tracking capital rotation into early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has recently seen a surge in whale-led inflows, even as larger-cap altcoins face heavy downside. This mirrors the kind of early activity seen in SHIBA and DOGE before their meteoric rises.With a capped token supply, a strong community, and a developer-backed roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a credible contender for the next big altcoin breakout. Investors who missed DOGE’s rise are watching closely – and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Volatility Rewards the Prepared Whether it’s XRP’s short-fueled swings, Solana’s uncertain footing, or Dogecoin’s steady grind upward, one thing is clear—whales are moving the market. For traders and investors watching from the sidelines, this volatility isn’t just noise—it’s opportunity. And with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining ground with every cycle shift, early positioning could unlock outsized rewards before the next bull leg begins.

Cardano is holding its bullish setup, managing to stay above key supports despite recent pressure. Ethereum is seeing a spike in open interest, signaling more leveraged trading and speculation around its next move. Both have signs worth tracking, but neither offers hands-on interaction before a launch. BlockDAG (BDAG) is different. It opens up a live trading environment now, giving buyers full access to BUY and SELL features, live BDAG/USD pricing, and instant wallet updates. This makes BlockDAG a standout choice for anyone weighing what crypto to invest in, as it delivers an active experience long before exchange listings. Cardano Bullish Setup Holds Firm Above Support Cardano continues to show strength despite a recent pullback, keeping its position inside a broader upward channel. Its price is holding above the 50-day EMA, a zone that has repeatedly attracted buyers. Sellers briefly pushed the price lower, but steady accumulation around the mid-range kept it from sliding further. Momentum indicators like RSI show that ADA is cooling off but not losing strength, leaving space for a possible rebound. The MACD also remains above its signal line, although the gap is narrowing, hinting that momentum could build again soon. Trading volumes show no major selling spikes, suggesting that this is a pause rather than a reversal. If ADA maintains its current range and reclaims near-term resistance, another upward push could follow. Ethereum Market View Shows High Activity and Rising Leverage Ethereum’s futures market is experiencing record open interest, now above $50 billion. This surge signals a strong rise in speculative and institutional activity. Over the past month, open interest has climbed 64%, showing that traders are heavily engaging in leveraged positions and expecting price movement soon. ETH has reclaimed a key zone between $3,150 and $3,300, turning it into both support and resistance for the current structure. This buildup in derivatives shows confidence, but it also raises risk, as high leverage often leads to sharp moves when sentiment flips. Historically, ETH performs well under these conditions, making this a period to watch closely for breakout potential. From Presale to Live Exchange Simulation: BlockDAG Changes the Game Most presales follow the same script: raise money, promise tools, and keep people waiting. BlockDAG breaks that pattern with its live, interactive trading dashboard. Through its latest version, users can experience a true simulation of exchange trading before the project even goes public. Inside this dashboard, buyers see real-time BDAG/USD price charts, a functioning order book, and instant wallet balance updates after every simulated trade. It’s not just a demo; it feels close to real market action. This changes how early participants view presales, turning a once passive process into active involvement. BlockDAG has already proven strong market traction, raising $362.5 million and selling over 24.7 billion coins. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, marking a 2,660% ROI from the very first batch. But the most exciting part is the special GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer: until August 11, BDAG can be purchased for just $0.0016, a massive discount that could see up to 3,025% returns once it lists at $0.05. This is not just about a low price; it’s a chance to engage with a working product ahead of time, while securing an early position before wider public access pushes prices higher. For anyone deciding what crypto to invest in, BlockDAG stands out by delivering both real utility now and one of the strongest potential ROIs in the market. In a Nutshell Cardano’s solid chart structure and Ethereum’s high market activity offer good reasons to watch both assets. But they still rely only on market speculation. BlockDAG delivers something far more tangible. With a live dashboard that includes real-time price feeds, working BUY and SELL options, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG is already functioning like a full-fledged exchange before its official launch. For those looking at what crypto to invest in right now, BlockDAG offers rare early-stage access, strong numbers, and one of the biggest potential ROIs in the market.

Recently, the Base network outage caused a temporary halt, sparking discussions across the crypto community. This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the intricate technicalities that underpin our decentralized future. What Caused the Coinbase Base Network Outage? On a recent Tuesday, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, experienced an unexpected 33-minute halt in its block production. This disruption wasn’t due to a malicious attack but rather a critical internal system failure. The active sequencer, a vital component responsible for ordering transactions, began to lag. An automated internal system, designed to maintain stability, promptly initiated a switch to a backup sequencer. However, this crucial transition failed. The primary reason for this failure was an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup system. Consequently, the network found itself unable to process new transactions or produce new blocks, leading to the brief but significant outage. This incident highlighted the delicate balance required for continuous operation within a complex Layer-2 blockchain environment. Understanding Layer-2 Blockchain Challenges and Network Stability What exactly is a Layer-2 network like Coinbase Base network , and why are sequencers so important? A Layer-2 blockchain is built on top of a main blockchain (like Ethereum) to increase its transaction throughput and reduce costs. It processes transactions off-chain before settling them on the main chain. Sequencers play a pivotal role in these networks. They are responsible for: Ordering Transactions: Ensuring transactions are processed in the correct sequence. Batching: Grouping multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch for efficient settlement on the main chain. Submitting Data: Posting the batched transaction data back to the Layer-1 blockchain. When a sequencer fails, as happened with Base, the entire process grinds to a halt. This directly impacts network stability and user experience, demonstrating the need for robust redundancy and flawless backup systems. Even a short outage can undermine trust and disrupt ongoing operations for users and decentralized applications alike. Lessons from the Base Network Outage: Ensuring Resilience The recent Base network outage provides valuable lessons for the broader blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the absolute necessity of rigorous testing and meticulous setup for all critical infrastructure components, especially backup systems. Relying on automated failovers is good, but only if those failovers are perfectly configured and ready to take over without a hitch. For users, such incidents emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying technology of the networks they use. While brief, this halt meant transactions could not be processed, potentially delaying operations for businesses and individuals on the network. For developers and network operators, the takeaway is clear: Comprehensive Testing: Continuously test backup systems under various conditions. Complete Configurations: Ensure backup sequencers and other critical components have identical and complete sequencer configuration to the active ones. Redundancy Beyond Basics: Explore multi-sequencer setups or decentralized sequencer models to minimize single points of failure and enhance overall network stability . This incident, though quickly resolved, serves as a powerful reminder that even leading platforms must remain vigilant in their pursuit of uninterrupted service. What Does This Mean for the Future of Base? While the 33-minute halt was inconvenient, it’s important to view it in context. The quick identification and resolution of the issue by the Base team demonstrate their operational capabilities. Incidents like these, while challenging, often lead to stronger, more resilient systems as lessons are learned and improvements are implemented. The commitment to enhancing network stability remains paramount for the continued growth and adoption of the Coinbase Base network . This event will undoubtedly prompt a thorough review of their backup protocols and configuration management, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable Layer-2 solution. The goal for all decentralized networks is to achieve near-perfect uptime, and every incident, big or small, contributes to refining that pursuit. The Base network outage , though brief, highlighted a critical vulnerability in its backup systems. A simple configuration error on a backup sequencer brought the entire network to a standstill for 33 minutes. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of meticulous planning, thorough testing, and robust redundancy in the complex world of Layer-2 blockchains. As the ecosystem matures, ensuring unwavering network stability will be key to fostering wider adoption and trust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Base network? A1: Base is a Layer-2 blockchain developed by Coinbase, built on top of Ethereum to provide faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions. Q2: What caused the recent Base network outage? A2: The outage was caused by an incomplete sequencer configuration on the backup sequencer. When the active sequencer lagged, the automated switch to the backup failed, halting block production.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The maturing digital assets market that has sophisticated market making, capital markets, and decentralized finance, is still lacking one key market infrastructure to compete with traditional finance: an institutional-grade credit agency. Architect aims to change this by launching crypto's first institutional-grade credit ratings service, similar to traditional finance's Moody's – because most TradFi ratings agencies just won't touch crypto. Sure, Moody's has dipped its toes into digital assets , but a full-blown credit agency that operates only in crypto is still missing. This is partly because crypto does not have a trusted intermediary to objectively assess creditworthiness, according to Ruben Amenyogbo, Architect's Managing Partner. The industry's anonymous actors, unconventional data, and opaque risk profiles make traditional underwriters nervous, leaving potential lenders reluctant to provide debt financing, Amenyogbo said. Then there is the ongoing surge of publicly traded companies, including miners and crypto treasury firms. They are all attempting to provide equity investors with exposure to crypto via stocks. But that market is now saturated and overvalued. “Crypto equity is extremely overvalued. Way too much money has been raised chasing equity opportunities in crypto,” said Amenyogbo. This combination of a lack of credit agencies and an exhausted equity market creates the perfect storm for a new opportunity in Web3. “There's a huge opportunity in credit, but no one's provided the missing market structure needed to assess risk properly,"" he said. This is where Architect comes in with plans to utilize its proprietary blockchain-based data to systematically evaluate credit risk and unlock new pools of institutional capital. Amenyogbo believes that the crypto market has now matured enough to support institutional-grade credit analysis. “With equity, you look forward, you assess future growth,” Amenyogbo said. “With credit, you must look backwards and ask, ‘Have these people reliably performed?’ Crypto was too young and unproven for that until recently, but now there’s enough history for meaningful credit analysis.” So who benefits from such service? Bitcoin miners and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) primarily, according to the Architect. In theory, with access to fiat credit, miners could reduce forced selling, allowing them to stake more assets, generate greater on-chain activity, and shift from reactive outflows to productive economic contribution, a “double knock-on effect” that turns liquidity pressure into real value creation. ""If I want to speculate on bitcoin, I would buy bitcoin. But as a credit lender, I can underwrite a bitcoin miner and make a bet on that mining operation and its cashflows outcompeting the market,” he said. Meanwhile, Architect sees Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) as a particularly attractive and underfunded niche for credit, with Amenyogbo explaining that DePIN provides real economic outputs rather than merely betting on digital asset price appreciation. In the end, Architect’s ultimate ambition isn’t just to lend, it’s to rebuild crypto’s capital stack from the ground up. By positioning itself as the first credible risk assessor for decentralized infrastructure and applying TradFi-grade underwriting standards, the firm hopes to unlock a new wave of institutional capital. “Raising a $100 million fund is cool, but it’s just a drop in the ocean,” Amenyogbo said. “What we’re really doing is laying the groundwork for crypto credit to scale the way traditional debt does, bundled, rated, insured, and syndicated into the largest pools of capital in the world.” Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading above $114K. ""Until BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume, the path of least resistance could remain sideways to down. Opportunistic traders may continue to find short-term setups in memecoins and alt-beta, but the broader picture hasn’t flipped,"" market maker Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk. ETH: ETH is trading at $3500, down 2.8% as ETF outflows ramp up. Gold: Gold prices dipped during the U.S. trading day, as a stronger U.S. dollar and falling oil prices weighed on sentiment, while silver saw modest gains and mixed global economic signals, including robust Chinese services data and growing Fed rate cut odds, added complexity to market direction. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday after Wall Street losses, as investors digested weak U.S. economic data and new technology tariff remarks from President Trump, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipping 0.12%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 fell 0.49% Tuesday as weak economic data and fresh Trump tariff remarks fueled concern, though analysts expect the bull market to continue despite near-term volatility.

Meanwhile, emerging meme coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention as it aims for the $5 mark. The project is worth $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The 7th phase will appreciate by 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are expecting a 71.43% return when the token is launched at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $14 million in funding and has received over 14,800 investors. As crypto markets pulse with ETF-driven momentum, Mutuum’s unique infrastructure positions it at the intersection of capital efficiency and trustless innovation, setting a compelling tone for what could be a pivotal quarter. Cardano (ADA) Nears $1 as ETF Optimism Builds Cardano is currently trading around $0.72 supported by a strong technical setup following a breakout above the $0.64 resistance zone. Institutional inflows and rising ETF approval odds, now estimated between 79% and 84%, are boosting sentiment and fueling a rally that analysts expect could target $1.00, with stretch objectives ranging from $1.30 to $1.80+ in 2025. While resistance near $0.77–$0.74 remains crucial, maintaining support above $0.70 could sustain bullish momentum toward key levels. In parallel, some attention is also shifting toward emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance as investors explore next-gen utility narratives. Investors Eye 71% Gains in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale stage 6 due to a presale stage 5 sell-out. Phase 6 investors will enjoy a 71.43% return on investment at token launch. More than $14 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is an increase of 14.23% over Stage 6. Mutuum Finance Boosts Protocol Security with Bug Bounty Supported by CertiK Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with security and transparency partner CertiK. Users will be rewarded 50,000 USDT in value for reporting probable bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four severity classes; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Mass MUTM Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway in which individuals who take part in the contest will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, with each token being worth $10,000. Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending revolution in a product that offers the maximum level of asset control to customers. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform developed by combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to the P2C lending pool comes through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing sentiment of the market, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of lending. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, creating room for direct lending, which is appropriate for volatile assets like meme coins. Cardano may be on track to reclaim $1, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself for much larger gains. Currently priced at $0.035 in phase 6, early investors could lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06, with longer-term upside potentially reaching $5. Backed by a $14M+ raise, 14,800+ investors, a CertiK-audited bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, MUTM is quickly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi plays of 2025.

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Cipher Mining made headlines with its latest operational update. The company announced its July performance, revealing a strategic approach to managing its digital assets. What Does Cipher Mining’s Latest Report Reveal? In an announcement made on August 5th via GlobeNewswire, Cipher Mining confirmed its operational results for July. The company reported a significant Bitcoin mining output while also detailing its sales activity for the month. This balance between mining new coins and selling existing ones offers valuable insights into their financial strategy. Bitcoin Mined: Cipher Mining successfully mined 214 BTC during July. This demonstrates their continued efficiency and operational capacity in the demanding Bitcoin mining sector. Bitcoin Sold: The company strategically sold 52 BTC in July. This decision helps cover operational expenses, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market conditions. Total BTC Holdings: Despite the sales, Cipher Mining’s total Bitcoin holdings grew to an impressive 1,219 BTC. This indicates a net accumulation strategy, strengthening their overall position in the cryptocurrency market . Why Do Bitcoin Miners Engage in BTC Sales? For large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Cipher Mining, selling a portion of their mined Bitcoin is a common and necessary practice. It is not always a sign of distress; rather, it’s often a calculated move essential for sustainable growth. Miners face substantial operational costs that require regular capital injections. Consider these key reasons: Covering Operational Costs: Running a large mining facility demands significant electricity, maintenance, and infrastructure investments. Selling BTC provides the fiat currency needed to cover these ongoing expenses. Liquidity Management: Maintaining a healthy cash flow is crucial for any business. Strategic sales ensure Cipher Mining has sufficient liquidity to adapt to market changes or pursue new opportunities. Market Optimization: Miners may sell BTC when they perceive favorable market prices, allowing them to maximize revenue from their production. This proactive approach is part of a robust digital asset strategy . Analyzing Cipher Mining’s Growing BTC Holdings The fact that Cipher Mining’s total BTC holdings reached 1,219 BTC, even after selling 52 BTC, highlights a key aspect of their business model: accumulation. Many large miners aim to grow their Bitcoin reserves, viewing them as long-term assets. This strategy allows them to benefit from potential future appreciation of Bitcoin’s value. Their growing holdings reflect: Confidence in Bitcoin: Holding a significant amount of BTC signals the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and value proposition. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial Bitcoin reserve enhances the company’s balance sheet, potentially making it more attractive to investors and lenders. Strategic Flexibility: Larger holdings offer more flexibility for future financial maneuvers, whether it’s further sales, collateralization, or other forms of digital asset strategy . What Does This Mean for the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The activities of major miners like Cipher Mining have a ripple effect on the broader cryptocurrency market . When miners sell, it adds supply to the market; when they hold, it reduces potential selling pressure. Their operational updates provide valuable indicators of industry health and sentiment. This report suggests that despite some sales, Cipher Mining remains focused on growth and accumulation. This generally positive sentiment from a significant industry player can contribute to overall market confidence. Investors often watch miner activity closely for clues about market direction and underlying supply dynamics. Cipher Mining’s July report offers a clear picture of a well-managed Bitcoin mining operation. Their strategic decision to sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin while simultaneously increasing their overall BTC holdings showcases a balanced and forward-thinking digital asset strategy . This approach allows them to cover operational costs while continuing to build their long-term asset base in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market . It’s a testament to the complex but often rewarding dance between generating revenue and accumulating valuable digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Cipher Mining? Cipher Mining is a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in Bitcoin mining operations. They utilize advanced infrastructure to mine new Bitcoin, contributing to the network’s security and earning rewards. Q2: Why did Cipher Mining sell 52 BTC in July?

49612432,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780050,1754444451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49612432.jpeg,New Zealand jobless rate hits 5-year high as economic slowdown deepens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-zealand-jobless-rate-hits-5-year-high/,"New Zealand’s job market loses steam, with unemployment rising to a 15-year high of 5.2% in Q2. That is the strongest reading since the first full quarter of recovery following COVID in Q3 2020. In the second quarter , the jobless rate was 5.2%, slightly higher than 5.1% during the first three months of the year. Although the increase was below market expectations (economists predicted 5.3%), it further fuels worry about a wider economic slowdown. Employment also shrank by 0.1% during the quarter, matching analyst expectations. The drop may seem modest, but in context, it marks the latest sign that economic momentum is fading. Abhijit Surya, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the Reserve Bank was unlikely to take comfort in the slight rise in the unemployment rate, noting that a closer look at the data revealed significant slack in the labour market. The weakening labour market is emerging alongside sluggish consumer spending, contracting manufacturing and services sectors, and a languishing housing market — all of which point to a slowing economy. Participation drops as workers step back As previously pointed out, more people were jobless, and fewer people were even looking for work. The labour force participation rate — the working-age population either with a job or actively seeking employment — declined to 70.5%, down from Q1’s 70.7%. That marked the lowest level since early 2021. However, the hit has been even harder on mid-teenagers and young workers when we dig deeper into the data. Whether it was an artificial boom in the few months when workers were hard to come by during the post-pandemic hiring spike, many went into the labour market. Nonetheless, when the economy takes a hit and employers engage in less than whiplash hiring activity, these groups are often the first out of the door. Teenagers, in particular, were leaving the job market, many opting to return to school or study rather than being classed as jobless, said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac in Auckland. Year-on-year, total employment fell by 0.9%, confirming that the slowdown is not just a seasonal blip, but part of a broader cooling in the economy. Workers see slower wage growth amid rising costs Adding to the unease is a continued slowdown in wage growth. According to today’s report, annual wage inflation slowed for the ninth consecutive quarter. Ordinary time wages for non-government workers rose just 2.2% compared to a year earlier — down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. That signals a diminishing bargaining power for workers, even as the cost of living remains high for many households. Despite the year-on-year slowdown, quarterly wage growth grew slightly, rising 0.6%, above economists’ expectations of 0.5%. Meanwhile, average ordinary time hourly earnings for non-government workers jumped 1.9% from the previous quarter — the strongest quarterly rise since Q3 2020. Although the rise in pay growth looked encouraging, some analysts dismissed it as potentially short-lived or a function of different types of workers making up a larger share of employment rather than broad wage inflation. Businesses may be dishing out higher wages to keep on skilled workers while pulling back elsewhere in terms of headcount. That said, real wage growth underperforms for many employees, while inflation remains elevated and still tightens household budgets. The labour market data has added weight to expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will soon resume cutting interest rates. The RBNZ had forecast a 5.2% unemployment rate in May, but it also predicted employment growth of 0.2%, a clearly missed target. With inflation showing signs of easing and economic growth stalling, pressure is mounting on the central bank to support the economy. Most analysts now expect the RBNZ to cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3% at its next meeting on August 20, especially after pausing in July.

49612842,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=799170,1754445604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49612842.jpeg,Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory—Top Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-stuck-macro-purgatory-q4-or-bust/,"In his August 5 “Macro Monday” livestream, crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz delivered a review of the market’s late-summer state, arguing that while Bitcoin’s price action has gone quiet, the broader cycle remains intact. “We’re in this pocket of seasonal weakness for August and September that we typically see most years,” he explained, pointing to seasonality charts showing that historically, Bitcoin underperforms in this time window. “It’s a high likelihood that August and September is a giant nothing burger,” he added. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? At day 978 of the current cycle, the question many investors are asking, Olszewicz noted, is simple but existential: is the cycle already over? Will it end this year? Or is there more upside ahead? His answer leaned cautiously optimistic. “I’m in the ‘probably not over yet, could continue’ camp,” he said. “But we will have to see what happens in Q4. Ultimately, that’s going to determine it.” From a technical standpoint, the analyst sees no reason to declare the top is in. “Technicals still look fine. Price still looks okay. We had a pullback. All that is fine,” he said, emphasizing that Bitcoin has not yet exhibited the typical parabolic advance associated with major tops. Nor have other macro or on-chain metrics shown signs of terminal overheating. “We don’t have other metrics screaming from the rooftop saying it’s time yet.” Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‘Nothing To Do Until October’ However, the short-term setup is underwhelming. After a cup-and-handle breakout that briefly pushed price toward the $122,000–$123,000 region, momentum faded. Olszewicz doubts such levels can be reclaimed soon: “In the next two weeks we’ll know if we can start to creep back towards $120,000, which is asking a lot admittedly for August.” The wildcard, he said, is ETF flows. “Do we see ETF flows for any reason? Then do we see treasury companies continuing to buy? Those are the marginal buyers right now.” He suggested that ETF buyers could return due to a combination of underweight positioning, opportunistic dip-buying, and monthly rebalancing dynamics. Still, he remains neutral overall. “Just a general softening of any bullishness we may have had,” he said. “Now it’d be a different story if this is October and we’re seeing this. That’s not normal.” A further reason for caution is the collapse in futures basis across major assets. “Premium is all the way down to under 7% on BTC. It’s under 8% on ETH. And I think SOL is a little more illiquid, but even SOL is way down—15% from 35%,” he noted. That contraction in futures premiums, typically a sign of speculative demand drying up, reflects a broader risk-off mood. “Not a lot of bullish sentiment, not a lot of craziness,” Olszewicz observed. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Losing Steam? Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support On-chain risk metrics confirm the trend. “There’s a decline here in risk appetite,” he said, referring to metrics like unrealized profit versus MVRV. He added that if Bitcoin were to enter a parabolic advance, “you will see this metric shoot up… But what’s it going to take?” Q4 Or Bust He floated a few possibilities: rate cuts, weakening Fed independence, or perhaps just seasonal strength and macro chaos in Q4. But for now, he advised traders to “take it easy on the 50X leverage,” especially those who’ve already made significant gains this cycle. “Do I need to put risk back on? Do I need to be as risky as I was earlier?” he asked rhetorically. “Or does it make more sense to be less risky here?” From a macroeconomic perspective, the picture is mixed. Inflation data from Trueflation remains low—currently at 1.65%—but Olszewicz warned that new post–August 1 tariffs may raise prices in the months ahead. “We are adding inflationary pressures with tariffs, no doubt about it,” he said, though the effect will take time to appear in the data. Meanwhile, core PCE is headed in the wrong direction, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model is printing 2.1% growth for Q3—hardly recessionary, but not robust either. Labor market data continues to cloud the outlook. “If we account for a non-collapsing labor force participation, we could be as high as 4.9% on the actual unemployment rate,” Olszewicz warned. “And we’re continuing to see a degradation in job availability for manufacturing,” particularly in “Heartland Rust Belt types of jobs.” Liquidity dynamics are also in flux. He drew attention to the draining of the Fed’s reverse repo facility—once a $2 trillion reservoir of sidelined capital—which has supported risk assets through 2023 and 2024. “As this gets drained closer to completion, there’s a potential likelihood for liquidity hiccups and a liquidity intervention by the Fed,” he said. Importantly, this has kept overall US liquidity flat, offsetting quantitative tightening. “Despite QT, the drain of the reverse repo has offset QT, and US liquidity by this metric has been basically flat since 2022.” What changed the game, Olszewicz said, was not liquidity per se, but the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. “That has really been, in my opinion, a big difference maker,” he explained. “We got ETF approvals here, ETF started trading here, and the rest is history as far as flows are concerned.” In conclusion, Olszewicz emphasized that while the broader risk appetite has declined and price action remains dull, there is no evidence yet that the Bitcoin cycle has topped. “The cycle’s probably not over,” he said. “It’s just sleeping—and Q4 will ultimately determine whether it wakes up.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,041.

At the same time, the company has scaled back its exposure to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), signaling a shift in portfolio allocation strategy. Galaxy Digital Increases Bitcoin Holdings, Cuts Back On Ethereum According to the Q2 2025 report, Galaxy Digital posted a net income of $30.7 million for the quarter, reflecting strong financial performance across its core business segments. A key milestone during the quarter was the company’s official listing on Nasdaq under the ticker GLXY, which took place on March 16. Galaxy’s net digital asset holdings now stand at approximately $1.2 billion at current market prices – a 40% increase compared to Q1 2025. The jump in portfolio value was largely driven by the sharp rise in Bitcoin’s price over the past three months. To recap, BTC was trading near $70,500 on March 31. By June 30, it had surged to $108,700, marking a gain of more than 50% in just one quarter. The table below shows that as of June 30, the firm held 17,102 BTC, up from 12,830 BTC at the end of Q1. However, this accumulation came alongside a reduction in the company’s ETH and XRP positions, suggesting a cautious or rebalanced approach toward altcoins. Specifically, Galaxy’s ETH holdings declined from 155,026 ETH on March 31 to 90,521 ETH by the end of June. Other digital assets in the firm’s portfolio include Solana (SOL), Hype (HYP), SUI, and stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC. In addition to changes in crypto holdings, the firm also reported a strong increase in assets under management (AUM), which rose to $8.9 billion – up 27% quarter-over-quarter. Assets under stake also climbed to $3.1 billion, representing a 34% increase. The company anticipates continued strength into Q3, stating: July marked the strongest monthly financial performance for our Digital Assets operating business in the firm’s history, with record results in Global Markets and steady progress in Asset Management & Infrastructure Solutions. Will Galaxy Digital Adjust Its Crypto Strategy? While Galaxy Digital increased its BTC holdings and reduced ETH exposure in Q2, recent developments suggest the firm may adjust its portfolio strategy based on capital rotation and shifting market trends. Last week, a Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallet linked to Galaxy Digital initiated a massive sale of 22,700 BTC. The sell-off weighed on the market, bringing Bitcoin’s net realized profit down to $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently stated that Ethereum is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the near term, citing ETH’s expanding ecosystem and accelerating innovation. At press time, BTC trades at $113,230, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum|Galaxy Digital|solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 02:00:34

This bold prediction is backed by a range of technical models, Fibonacci cycles, and bullish macro trends. As the crypto market digests this news, XRP and ETH analysts are weighing the impact on altcoins, signaling the potential for a major price rally across the sector. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a high-profile altcoin, with analysts calling for even bigger gains and 31x upside before the next cycle peak. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Analysts Are Targeting $175K Bitcoin price news today is dominated by forecasts of $175,000 by September 2025. EGRAG Crypto, known for accurate technical calls, cites the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and 21-week EMA patterns—pointing to historical cycle peaks right at the $175K level. His timeline lines up with other prominent crypto analyst predictions, who reference a clear BTC and ETH price correlation when forecasting tops. Fundstrat’s Sean Farrell, who nailed earlier cycles, also backs the $175K BTC price target, using network inflows and historical trends. Robert Kiyosaki’s call for Bitcoin to reach $175,000–$350,000 in 2025 rounds out a strong consensus that the next phase of institutional adoption could send BTC much higher. The question on everyone’s mind: will Bitcoin hit $175,000, and how will altcoins react if it does? XRP and ETH Analysts React to Bitcoin’s Breakout Target The Bitcoin 2025 price prediction is pushing analysts to revisit their XRP price reaction and ETH analyst reaction calls. Many expect XRP and ETH to track Bitcoin higher, with XRP analyst predictions after Bitcoin surge pointing to potential rallies if BTC breaks out. XRP price prediction 2025 ranges from $5 to $8 if Bitcoin’s momentum continues, but volatility remains. The impact of Bitcoin price on altcoins is also showing up in ETH price prediction 2025 models, with most analysts calling for a new ETH high if BTC holds its gains. Ethereum price forecast after Bitcoin rally is bullish, driven by network upgrades and ETF inflows. Ripple news today and Ethereum market outlook both reflect a bullish sentiment as crypto market sentiment 2025 shifts into risk-on mode. MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Expect Bigger Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating serious hype among traders looking for high-upside altcoin price movement after Bitcoin surge headlines. With Bitcoin’s forecast now at $175K, some MAGACOIN analysts are projecting up to 31x gains for early holders, making it one of the top stories in crypto analyst predictions for Q3 and Q4. Why is MAGACOIN FINANCE getting so much attention? The project’s explosive community growth, active governance, and strong narrative are all driving rapid wallet expansion and increasing daily volume. As the rest of the market focuses on BTC and ETH short-term moves, investors searching for the next big opportunity are positioning ahead of what could be a new cycle leader. The current crypto market sentiment 2025 favors high-upside altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its ability to move independently, drawing both meme coin capital and strategic traders. With a 31x upside still on the table, this emerging project is on every radar. Wrapping Up The Bitcoin forecast raised to $175K has set a bullish tone for the rest of the market.

However, the bears were active near the $115,500 resistance and the price struggled to continue higher.

Consequently, the firm now possesses 480,031 ETH. The total ETH stack is now valued at $1.65 billion. Simultaneously, a specific ETH-based altcoin project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing significant investor attention during its ongoing presale. SharpLink’s strategic Ethereum bet SharpLink Gaming is actively mirroring successful Bitcoin treasury strategies. The company is firmly committed to Ethereum instead. This latest purchase, averaging $3,530 per token, involved using USDC over two days. Moreover, SharpLink appointed Joseph Chalom, formerly of BlackRock’s digital assets division, as Co-CEO in late July. This leadership move signals deep expertise guiding its crypto investment strategy. Consequently, SharpLink has positioned itself among the largest corporate holders of Ethereum globally. Overall, corporate ETH holdings now exceed 2.74 million tokens, worth $9.71 billion, indicating strong institutional crypto investment interest. Despite SharpLink’s stock (SBET) rising 35% monthly and 112% year-to-date, some analysts caution about its premium valuation. They suggest direct ETH exposure or crypto ETF products might offer clearer value propositions for investors monitoring crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum continues accelerating impressively. Phase 6 is currently underway and selling out rapidly. Investors have already contributed over $14,100,000 since the presale began. Furthermore, participants have snapped up more than 665 million MUTM tokens. Total MUTM holders now stand at 14,800. The current price per token in this phase is $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase, or 3.5 times, the opening phase price of $0.01. The opportunity to acquire tokens at this level is diminishing quickly. Phase 7 will commence shortly, introducing a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Purchasing now, therefore, guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment. Future crypto predictions suggest significantly higher potential gains post-launch. Some analysts forecast targets reaching $1.50 or beyond based on platform adoption. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. CertiK awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an outstanding security score of 95.00. This result confirms a solid security posture for the platform. Importantly, auditors found zero vulnerabilities within the examined smart contract code. Furthermore, no security incidents have occurred during the past 90 days. To enhance security further, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK again. They launched an official Bug Bounty Program. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is available for ethical hackers. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: Critical findings: Highest rewards Major, minor, and low findings: Proportionate rewards This proactive approach incentivizes thorough scrutiny and strengthens the protocol continuously. Major giveaway fuels community excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is celebrating its presale progress enthusiastically. The team announced its largest giveaway ever. Participants stand to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of tokens.

This system incentivizes holding and strengthens long-term commitment among major supporters. Final thoughts SharpLink’s massive Ethereum acquisition underscores a strong institutional belief in ETH’s value. Concurrently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a timely presale opportunity within this growing altcoin segment. With its current price at $0.035 in Phase 6, the guaranteed 71% ROI at launch and strong post-launch crypto predictions present a compelling case.

His team is expected to issue an executive order within days. According to a report from The Independent, the order will push regulators to dig into possible breaches of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust rules, and consumer protection laws. It could hit banks with hefty fines, consent decrees, or other penalties. Background Of Banking And Crypto Clash Industry voices say crypto firms have long felt frozen out by big banks. They point to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” under the Biden years, which they claim led to sudden account closures without clear reasons. BREAKING: Trump to prepare executive order that punishes banks that discriminate against conservatives, according to Wall Street Journal report. — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) August 5, 2025 In 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said JPMorgan Chase warned it would shut accounts tied to main crypto income. In November the following year, Elon Musk said as many as 30 tech entrepreneurs lost bank access under that policy. Banks have since pushed back. They say decisions were about anti-money laundering rules. They add that managing reputational risk lets them guard against fraud and legal trouble. Trump To End Banks’ ‘Reputational Risk’ Shield According to The Wall Street Journal , the order will tell federal bank overseers to look for violations of key laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act bans discrimination in lending. Antitrust laws keep competition fair. Consumer protection statutes shield against unfair practices. If banks are found at fault, they face monetary penalties or binding consent orders. The move aims to stop banks from using compliance as an excuse for political bias. It could also strip away so-called reputational risk guidelines that critics blame for “debanking.” Penalties And Enforcement Based on a report by Reuters , the order could be in force as early as this week. It will empower regulators to impose fines or other disciplinary steps. It also asks the Small Business Administration to review banks that guarantee SBA loans. That means any lenders accused of cutting ties with certain customers may face fresh scrutiny. Calls for comment to the White House went unanswered, according to Reuters. The Politics Of Banking Cuts Trump has been outspoken about big banks. In January, he accused the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America of turning away conservative clients. The banks denied the claims. At the same time, Republican politicians and state officials have slammed “woke capitalism,” saying banks are cutting off gun makers, fossil fuel firms, and others that lean right. Those voices helped shape the executive order’s focus.

Analysts Split on What’s Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-gearing-up-for-a-major-move-analysts-split-on-whats-next/,"Ethereum’s price has experienced moderate declines over the past week, dropping around 5% after a period of notable gains in previous months. At the time of writing, ETH is trading near $3,633, fluctuating between the $3,500 and $3,700 range over the past day. This price movement follows a broader market cooling, with many traders engaging in profit-taking after Ethereum’s earlier upward trend. Recent on-chain and derivatives market data suggest that Ethereum may be heading into a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Battles Key Levels – Will Buyers Step Back In? Derivatives Market Data Signals Selling Pressure CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared an outlook indicating increased selling pressure and potential short-term weakness in the ETH futures market. The analyst highlighted that despite several attempts to breach the $4,000 resistance level, Ethereum has yet to break through, indicating possible market hesitancy at current levels. Darkfost emphasized that the behavior of the futures market has shifted notably over the past few weeks. According to data from Binance, Ethereum’s taker buy/sell ratio has dropped to 0.87, one of the lowest levels observed this year. A ratio below 1 typically indicates that sell orders are dominating over buy orders, suggesting that traders are either closing long positions or opening shorts. The analyst noted that this trend began around July 18 and has remained mostly negative since then, limiting upward momentum. Additionally, the seven-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMAs) have started to trend downward, which could be a sign of slowing market momentum. Binance continues to hold the largest share of ETH futures open interest among exchanges, making sentiment on this platform particularly influential. With sellers currently exerting more control, the data suggests a potential continuation of this consolidation phase until buying activity strengthens. Mixed Views on Ethereum’s Longer-Term Outlook While near-term market data points to a challenging period for Ethereum, some analysts maintain a positive longer-term outlook. A recent post by Titan of Crypto, a well-followed market commentator on X, projected a potential price target of $8,000. According to Titan of Crypto, Ethereum’s price structure is forming a large monthly triangle pattern that could eventually lead to a breakout, opening the way toward a significant rally.

The recent approval of the XRP ETF structure by the SEC has triggered fresh optimism among traders. XRP quickly gained momentum, with Ethereum following closely behind. Both are now being watched for breakout price action as ETF-driven demand picks up. Investors see this as a key turning point. The SEC’s greenlight on in-kind crypto ETF redemptions is fueling confidence that the altcoin market is finally entering a new phase of legitimacy. As a result, capital is rotating faster than ever, with early winners already starting to form. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly entered the mix as part of this rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital as ETF Hype Reshapes the Market As XRP gains strength from ETF approval and ETH picks up bullish momentum, traders are expanding their search beyond the top ten. Many are now moving into emerging presale tokens that carry real upside. One name catching serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its presale underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing in traders who believe this cycle still has room for smaller tokens to explode. What stands out is how quickly funds are flowing in—not just from retail wallets but also from mid-sized holders moving capital out of XRP and Ethereum. The token’s appeal lies in more than just hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a clean token model, clear branding, and a cultural edge that taps into real-world sentiment. Its political theme resonates with a wide online community, giving it the viral spark that earlier meme tokens needed to catch fire. Based on current inflows and presale growth, some investors believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver gains of up to 37x. While no token is guaranteed to hit those heights, the early demand suggests it’s becoming one of the stronger contenders in this ETF-fueled rotation. XRP and ETH Set the Stage—But Newcomers Could Ride the Wave Higher XRP’s ETF support is helping rewrite the rules for altcoin legitimacy. Ethereum is positioned to benefit next, with many expecting a spillover effect as institutions embrace a wider range of assets. But while these giants lead the headlines, smart traders are already looking at the next layer down. The presale space is heating up again, and well-positioned tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are standing out. The key isn’t just hype—it’s timing. With ETF narratives dominating, tokens that align with broader trends have a better chance of rapid growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks that box with strong community roots and growing market visibility. Conclusion: The Window for Early Movers Is Open XRP and ETH are reigniting the altcoin cycle thanks to ETF approval momentum. As capital floods back into the market, traders are not only holding the old names—they’re rotating into new ones with greater upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a standout in that shift. Its presale is gaining speed as more investors recognize the potential for strong returns in a fast-changing market.

Investors witnessed a significant downturn today as the MYX token experienced a sharp 58% drop. This dramatic fall coincided directly with a scheduled token unlock, sparking immediate questions about market dynamics and investor behavior. What Triggered the Dramatic MYX Token Unlock Impact? On-chain analysis reveals that the considerable decline in the MYX token price was not random. It directly followed a pre-scheduled token unlock event. Token unlocks release previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply, which can increase selling pressure. In this case, a major investor, Hack VC, played a pivotal role. According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, Hack VC claimed a substantial amount of MYX tokens. Specifically, they received 1,279,890 MYX, valued at approximately $2.16 million at the time. This claim originated from an airdrop contract over a seven-hour period, setting the stage for the subsequent market reaction. Unpacking the Hack VC Sell-Off Following the token claim, Hack VC proceeded with a significant Hack VC sell-off . The firm executed two separate transactions to offload these newly acquired tokens onto the market. Such large-scale selling by a prominent investor can significantly influence a token’s price, especially if market liquidity is thin. Here’s a closer look at the impact of this specific event: Increased Supply: The release of 1.28 million MYX tokens from a locked state instantly increased the circulating supply. Investor Behavior: Hack VC’s decision to sell immediately after claiming suggests a strategy to realize profits or reduce exposure, contributing heavily to the downward pressure. Market Reaction: The sheer volume of the Hack VC sell-off overwhelmed buying demand, leading to the rapid price depreciation of the MYX token. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility After Token Unlocks The incident with MYX highlights a common pattern in the crypto space: the heightened crypto market volatility around token unlock events. When large tranches of tokens held by early investors or project teams become liquid, there’s an inherent risk of increased selling pressure. This can lead to sharp price corrections, even for otherwise promising projects. Understanding the token unlock impact is crucial for any crypto investor. These events are often publicly scheduled, allowing market participants to anticipate potential supply increases. However, the exact timing and scale of selling activity by specific entities, like the recent Hack VC sell-off , can be unpredictable and cause significant price swings. What Does This Mean for MYX Token Holders? For current holders of the MYX token , such a sharp decline can be concerning. It underscores the importance of thorough research into a project’s tokenomics, including its vesting schedules and unlock dates. While some projects mitigate the impact of unlocks with buybacks or strong development news, others may experience significant price discovery downwards. Investors should consider these points: Risk Assessment: Always evaluate the risks associated with token unlocks. Diversification: Avoid over-exposure to any single asset, especially those with significant upcoming unlocks. Long-Term View: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might present buying opportunities, but careful due diligence is paramount. The MYX token’s recent performance serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unforgiving nature of the digital asset market. In conclusion, the dramatic fall in MYX token price following its token unlock and the substantial Hack VC sell-off provides a valuable case study in the complexities of crypto market dynamics. It reinforces the critical need for investors to stay informed about tokenomics, vesting schedules, and the potential for increased crypto market volatility around such events. Understanding the immediate and long-term token unlock impact is key to navigating these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the MYX token price to drop so sharply? The MYX token price dropped significantly due to a large volume of tokens being unlocked and subsequently sold by a major investor, Hack VC, immediately after they claimed their tokens from an airdrop contract. What is a token unlock? A token unlock is a scheduled event where previously locked cryptocurrency tokens, often held by early investors, team members, or advisors, become available for trading. This can increase the circulating supply and potentially lead to selling pressure. Who is Hack VC and what was their role in the MYX token event? Hack VC is an investor in MYX Finance. They claimed 1,279,890 MYX tokens (worth approximately $2.16 million) from an airdrop contract and then sold them in two separate transactions, directly contributing to the MYX token price decline. Is it common for crypto prices to fall after a token unlock? Yes, it is relatively common for cryptocurrency prices to experience downward pressure or increased volatility after a token unlock, especially if large amounts of tokens are released and subsequently sold by major holders. How can investors prepare for potential token unlock impact? Investors can prepare by researching a project’s tokenomics, understanding its vesting schedule and unlock dates, and assessing the potential supply increase. Diversifying portfolios and practicing risk management are also crucial strategies. Did you find this analysis insightful?

One significant indicator of market health and sentiment is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process, often misunderstood, reveals massive shifts in trader positions and can signal impending volatility or corrections. Over the last 24 hours, we’ve witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering critical insights into current market trends. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what futures liquidation means. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. When a trader’s position, whether ‘long’ (betting on price increase) or ‘short’ (betting on price decrease), falls below a certain margin requirement, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This forced closure is called liquidation. It’s a mechanism to manage risk, but it can also amplify market moves, creating cascading effects. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have shown significant activity in the crypto perpetual futures market. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $107.83 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 68.95% of these were ‘long’ positions. This indicates that a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price increase faced forced closures, suggesting a recent downward price movement or a sudden dip caught many off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $56.59 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of ‘long’ positions at 82.67%. This strong bias towards long liquidations for BTC further emphasizes a prevailing bearish sentiment or sharp price corrections that impacted bullish traders. MYX: Interestingly, MYX recorded $15.60 million in liquidations, but here, ‘short’ positions accounted for 69.36%. This means traders who were betting on MYX’s price decrease were liquidated. This could point to a sudden upward price movement for MYX, contrasting with the general trend seen in ETH and BTC. These figures provide a snapshot of the intense pressure and rapid shifts occurring in the market. What Do These Liquidation Trends Tell Us About Crypto Market Analysis? Understanding these liquidation patterns is vital for accurate crypto market analysis . The high percentage of long liquidations for ETH and BTC suggests that these assets experienced notable price declines over the 24-hour period, catching many bullish traders by surprise. Such events often lead to increased selling pressure as liquidated positions add to the supply, potentially causing further price drops. Conversely, the significant short liquidation for MYX indicates an unexpected upward price surge, forcing bearish traders to close their positions. These contrasting movements highlight the diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of individual altcoins compared to market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders must always consider these underlying dynamics. Actionable Trading Insights from Recent Volatility What actionable trading insights can we glean from this data? Firstly, the prevalence of long liquidations for major assets like ETH and BTC underscores the importance of robust risk management. Over-leveraging in a volatile market can quickly lead to devastating losses. Secondly, the contrasting MYX data reminds us that not all assets move in lockstep. Diversification and specific research into individual altcoins are crucial. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. This data serves as a powerful reminder that while perpetual futures offer high leverage, they also come with amplified risks. Staying informed about these liquidation events can help traders anticipate potential price movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. The recent 24-hour market volatility , marked by significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation across ETH, BTC, and MYX, serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent risks and opportunities. These liquidations are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital shifts and illustrate the rapid changes in trader sentiment. By closely monitoring these metrics, market participants gain a deeper understanding of underlying pressures and can make more informed decisions. Always prioritize risk management and continuous learning in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, offering high leverage. 2. What causes a perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below the required margin level, leading the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses. This usually happens due to adverse price movements against the trader’s position. 3. What does a high percentage of “long” liquidations mean? A high percentage of “long” liquidations indicates that many traders who bet on a price increase (going long) were forced to close their positions, typically because the asset’s price decreased significantly. 4. How can traders use liquidation data? Traders can use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand areas of high leverage that might lead to further volatility or cascading liquidations. It highlights where significant capital is being lost or gained. 5. Is trading crypto perpetual futures risky? Yes, trading crypto perpetual futures is highly risky due to the leverage involved. While leverage can amplify gains, it can also significantly amplify losses, leading to rapid liquidations if the market moves against your position.

Toronto-based SOL Strategies recently made headlines with its July performance, reporting a significant surge in its digital asset portfolio. This news offers a fascinating glimpse into the operational success within the blockchain space, especially for those keen on crypto investments . What are SOL Strategies’ Impressive July Holdings? SOL Strategies , a prominent player in the Solana ecosystem, announced a remarkable month-over-month increase in its operations. According to a press release distributed via Newsfile, the company’s financial snapshot for July revealed substantial growth. This growth highlights the increasing interest and activity surrounding the Solana blockchain. Key figures from their July report include: 396,717 SOL held: This substantial amount of Solana’s native token represents a significant portion of their liquid assets. 26,440 JitoSOL held: JitoSOL is a liquid staking token on Solana, indicating SOL Strategies’ engagement with advanced DeFi strategies. 15% month-over-month increase in validator revenue: This impressive jump in earnings underscores their efficient and profitable staking operations. 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation: This figure demonstrates the trust placed in SOL Strategies by other SOL holders, who delegate their tokens to the company for staking purposes. These figures collectively paint a picture of a thriving entity within the Solana landscape, actively contributing to and benefiting from the network’s growth. The substantial SOL holdings reflect a strong commitment to the ecosystem. How Does Validator Revenue Boost Crypto Investments? The concept of validator revenue is central to understanding how companies like SOL Strategies generate income within proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana. Validators are crucial nodes that secure the network by verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. For this vital work, they earn rewards, often in the native cryptocurrency of the network. SOL Strategies’ reported 15% increase in validator revenue for July is a strong indicator of their operational efficiency and the health of the Solana network itself. Higher revenue suggests more successful block validation, potentially more delegated SOL, and overall robust network activity. For investors considering crypto investments , a company consistently growing its validator revenue demonstrates a stable and profitable business model in the volatile crypto market. Why Are SOL Holdings and Assets Under Delegation Significant? The reported SOL holdings of 396,717 SOL directly impact SOL Strategies’ influence and potential within the Solana ecosystem. Holding a large amount of the native token provides liquidity and flexibility for various operations, from staking to participating in governance. Furthermore, the 3,551,797 SOL in assets under delegation is equally, if not more, significant. Assets under delegation (AUD) represent the total amount of tokens that other Solana holders have entrusted to SOL Strategies’ validators. This delegation mechanism is fundamental to the security and decentralization of proof-of-stake networks. A large AUD figure means: Increased Network Security: More delegated SOL strengthens the network’s consensus mechanism. Enhanced Influence: Validators with more delegated SOL have a greater chance of being selected to validate blocks, leading to more rewards. Community Trust: A high AUD indicates strong trust from the Solana community in SOL Strategies’ reliability and performance. Therefore, these figures not only highlight SOL Strategies’ financial strength but also its crucial role in the broader Solana network’s health and development. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana and Crypto Investments? The continued growth of entities like SOL Strategies provides a positive outlook for the Solana blockchain. As more institutional players and specialized companies commit significant resources to validating and participating in the network, it reinforces Solana’s position as a robust and scalable platform. This stability and growth can attract further development, dApps, and users, creating a positive feedback loop. For individuals interested in crypto investments , observing the performance of professional validators like SOL Strategies can offer valuable insights. Their success indicates not just individual company strength but also the underlying potential of the Solana ecosystem as a whole. It underscores the viability of staking as a passive income strategy within the crypto space, provided it’s done through reputable and high-performing entities. In conclusion, SOL Strategies’ impressive July report, showcasing substantial SOL holdings and a significant boost in validator revenue , paints a compelling picture of growth and stability within the Solana ecosystem. Their commitment to the network, demonstrated through their vast assets under delegation, solidifies their position as a key player. This performance not only highlights their operational excellence but also serves as a positive indicator for the broader landscape of crypto investments , particularly for those eyeing the promising future of Solana.

China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) recently issued a stark alert, urging the public to exercise extreme caution. The warning highlights a concerning trend: foreign companies are reportedly attempting to collect sensitive iris information from users, dangling the enticing bait of crypto tokens . Why is China’s Ministry of State Security Issuing This Warning? On August 6, the MSS utilized its official WeChat channel to share this significant advisory. They did not name the specific overseas company involved, maintaining a focus on the broader threat. The core concern revolves around the surreptitious transfer of user biometric data, particularly iris scans, under the guise of distributing digital currencies. The MSS emphasized that such activities pose a direct threat. This isn’t just about individual privacy; it extends to the broader landscape of data security and even national security. When sensitive biometric identifiers like iris scans are compromised, the implications can be profound and far-reaching. Understanding the Threat: What is Iris Information and Why is it Valuable? Your iris is the colored part of your eye, containing a unique pattern that remains stable throughout your life. This makes it an incredibly reliable form of biometric identification, often considered more secure than fingerprints or facial recognition. Uniqueness: Each person’s iris pattern is distinct. Stability: Unlike fingerprints that can be altered, iris patterns remain constant. Irreversibility: Once compromised, you cannot change your iris pattern, unlike a password. Because of these characteristics, iris information is highly coveted by malicious actors. It can be used for identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, or even to create digital clones of individuals. The MSS’s warning underscores the severe risks associated with its unauthorized collection, especially when lured by incentives like crypto tokens . How Do Crypto Tokens Act as Bait for Personal Data? The allure of free or easily obtainable digital assets, such as crypto tokens , can be powerful. Many companies use token issuance, often through airdrops or sign-up bonuses, to attract new users and build their communities. However, this seemingly generous offer can sometimes hide a darker agenda. In this specific case, the MSS suggests that these foreign entities are using token distribution as a ‘bait’ to compel users to provide their biometric data. Users might be asked to scan their iris as part of a ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) process, or as a requirement to receive certain tokens or participate in a new project. Unwittingly, individuals might be trading their invaluable personal data for a speculative digital asset. This tactic highlights a growing concern in the cryptocurrency space: the intersection of digital finance and data security . As more innovative projects emerge, users must remain vigilant about the information they share, particularly highly sensitive biometric identifiers. Protecting Your Personal Data: Actionable Insights The warning from China’s Ministry of State Security serves as a global reminder about the importance of safeguarding your personal data . Here are some actionable steps you can take: Be Skeptical of Freebies: If an offer of crypto tokens seems too good to be true, especially if it requires providing sensitive biometric data, it likely is. Read Terms and Conditions: Always thoroughly review the privacy policies and terms of service before signing up for any new platform or service, particularly those involving digital assets. Understand what data they collect and why. Verify Company Legitimacy: Research the company behind the token issuance. Look for a clear history, reputable founders, and transparent operations. A lack of transparency is a major red flag. Understand Data Risks: Recognize that biometric data, once compromised, cannot be easily changed. Treat your iris information and other unique identifiers with the utmost care. This vigilance is crucial not just for individuals but also for national security, as aggregated biometric data could be exploited for various nefarious purposes. The Broader Implications for Data Security and National Security The MSS’s warning underscores a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity: the escalating value of biometric data. For governments, the collection of such sensitive information by foreign entities raises profound national security concerns. It could potentially lead to: Espionage: Identifying and tracking individuals of interest. Cyberattacks: Using stolen identities to gain access to critical infrastructure. Surveillance: Building comprehensive databases of citizens. While the specific foreign company remains unnamed, the advisory from China’s Ministry of State Security clearly signals a heightened awareness and concern within the Chinese government regarding digital asset activities that could undermine national interests and compromise citizen safety. This incident serves as a stark reminder that the digital frontier, while offering immense opportunities, also harbors significant risks that demand constant vigilance and robust protective measures. Ultimately, this warning is a call to action for everyone engaging with digital currencies. Your personal data is a valuable asset, far more so than any speculative crypto tokens . Protecting your iris information and other biometric data is paramount in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

Analyst Explains How,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/binance-inflows-leading-altcoins-analyst/,"A quant has explained how altcoin inflows into cryptocurrency exchange Binance might act as a leading indicator for the market. Spikes In Binance Altcoin Inflows Tend To Precede Corrections In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend in the altcoin exchange inflows going to Binance. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Inflow Transaction Count,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of deposit transactions that investors are making to a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Buyers Aren’t Selling: $118,000+ Supply Remains Firm Below is a chart for the indicator that shows the trend in the altcoin deposits occurring on the various exchanges. As is visible in the graph, the altcoin Exchange Inflow Transaction Count peaked on all exchanges right before both the 2024 market tops, implying that deposit activity intensified on the platforms. Generally, investors transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so spikes in exchange inflows can lead into bearish price action. This appears to be what happened in these two instances. Interestingly, during the latest market drawdown that has occurred over the past few days, inflows on only one exchange have seen a spike: Binance. There have also been other instances in the past where this pattern developed. “Spikes in Binance inflows (represented by the purple area) frequently precede downward price movements or market corrections,” notes the analyst. The quant has also explained that Binance is not only the largest exchange in the sector in terms of trading volume, but also a hub for altcoin activity from both retail and institutional entities. As such, investor behavior on the platform can be quite relevant for the wider market. Speaking of alts, CryptoQuant has shared a few new indicators that can be used to track smart money. One of these is the Average Order Size, which differentiates between futures buy orders by their scale. The above chart shows the indicator’s data for Hyperliquid (HYPE). It would appear that whale-sized buy orders appeared when the altcoin was trading around $11 earlier in the year. Since then, its price has climbed to $39. Related Reading: Bitcoin Neutral Sentiment Didn’t Last Long: Investors Already Greedy Again Another indicator is the Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency. This one is the opposite: it points out periods of elevated activity from the small hands. From this graph, it’s apparent that overheated periods of retail interest coincided with price highs in Gala (GALA). ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, down more than 4% over the past week.

Dogecoin is climbing higher after bouncing strongly from a proven support zone, showing signs of renewed energy. Tron is also gathering attention as it trades above key levels and builds pressure near $0.50. Both show positive setups on the charts, but BlockDAG (BDAG) takes things to another level. Instead of waiting for an exchange listing, it offers a fully functional trading simulator now. Its live Dashboard V4 lets users interact with real-time BDAG/USD pricing, BUY and SELL panels, and instant wallet balance updates. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG delivers something rare: hands-on experience before public launch, making it one of the few presales that feels alive and active. Tron TRX Breakout Watch Nears as Bulls Target $0.50 Tron is pushing toward the $0.50 mark, drawing strong attention to a potential breakout move. With over 50% of all USDT currently moving through the Tron network, its role in handling stablecoins continues to strengthen, adding weight to its long-term value. Price action shows TRX holding above critical supports with steady trading volume supporting its climb. Technical signals are leaning bullish, and traders are adding Tron to their breakout watch lists as pressure builds. A clean close above $0.50 could mark the start of a stronger upward trend, supported by real network usage and growing confidence in its infrastructure. Dogecoin DOGE Rally Gains Strength as Key Level Holds Dogecoin is regaining bullish momentum after reclaiming a zone that has historically sparked major rallies. The bounce from around $0.22, combined with noticeable accumulation from larger holders, suggests building upward pressure. A possible golden cross is forming, with the 50-day moving average approaching a crossover above the 200-day—a classic sign of trend strength. If Dogecoin maintains this pace and secures $0.26 as firm support, analysts see potential for a run toward $0.46 or beyond. BlockDAG Turns Presale into a Full Trading Experience Before Launch Most early-stage projects only offer a promise: you buy early and wait. BlockDAG changes this approach completely by letting users experience a working trading environment long before exchange listings go live. Its Dashboard V4 is more than a preview; it simulates real market conditions with active tools. Inside the dashboard, users can open trades through functional BUY and SELL buttons, track live BDAG/USD charts, view an up-to-date order book, and see their wallets adjust instantly after each trade. This setup removes the usual guesswork of presales and replaces it with practical use. It allows participants to explore market trends, price shifts, and trade behavior firsthand, making the experience interactive instead of static. BlockDAG’s growth numbers highlight its strong traction. It has already raised $362.5 million, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% ROI from the first batch. But the real game-changer is the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, where, until August 11, buyers can access BDAG at only $0.0016. Based on the listing price of $0.05, this limited price could deliver 3,025% returns. What makes this opportunity stand out is not only the low entry point but also the ability to use a live trading setup before launch day. It builds trust and confidence, letting users practice and prepare ahead of time while securing their position before prices return to normal after August 11. For anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG sets a new standard, combining early access pricing with real-time utility that no other presale is offering. Which Is the Best Crypto to Invest In Now? Tron’s chart structure is showing pressure toward a breakout, and Dogecoin is rebuilding its rally momentum. But both depend on future price confirmations to prove their setups. BlockDAG offers something different: it gives users full access to live trading tools today, before listings go live. With real-time price tracking, functional trade execution, and instant wallet updates, BlockDAG delivers real utility now. For those choosing where to put their focus in this market, this early, hands-on experience sets BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to invest in now, combining active engagement with massive early access potential.

The current market trend is favoring choices that offer true use, actual utility, or potential growth. Instead of chasing trends, people are turning to assets showing long-term value. From cashback wallets changing fee structures to Layer 2s signaling a breakout, there’s real energy behind these names. This list of top-rated cryptos in 2025 includes projects addressing key pain points, like gas costs, privacy, and scaling, and shows why these assets are gaining attention in Q3. Cold Wallet, MNT, XMR, and NEAR each bring specific strengths, making it worth taking a closer look. Here’s why they’re considered top-rated cryptos in 2025. 1. Cold Wallet: Turning Every Fee Into a Reward Cold Wallet redefines how users interact with fees, changing typical charges into chances to earn. Gas fees, bridge costs, and swap charges are turned into cashback rewards through CWT, the core currency of the platform. Whether sending crypto, swapping, or bridging, users earn CWT. And the more CWT you keep in your wallet, the higher your cashback, starting at 10% and going up to 100%. No lock-ins or staking are needed, just hold and earn. This approach brings fairness to crypto use. The presale of CWT began at $0.00942 and follows a 150-stage pricing system where the price increases with each stage. Over $5.7 million has been raised so far, with more than 683 million coins sold. Currently in stage 16, Cold Wallet also gives referral bonuses: 10% for those who share and 5% for the ones they invite, all under a clear vesting plan. What really makes Cold Wallet stand out is not just rewards, but how it changes expectations. It’s built for real usage with zero gas overhead and a simple interface. In a space where most platforms take more than they give, Cold Wallet reverses the flow. That’s why it’s a top-rated crypto in 2025 for those who value practical use and fair returns. 2. MNT: Layer 2 Upgrade With Traction Mantle (MNT) isn’t just another token with price buzz; it’s showing progress with its UR beta utility layer, active until August 8. MNT aims to build a modular Ethereum Layer 2 that supports scalable apps and offers users relief from congestion and high costs. This cleaner setup is already pulling attention. Trading near $0.76 as of July 29, 2025, MNT recently dipped from its earlier high of $0.85. Still, technical indicators suggest a possible continued upward move, especially if it holds above the 200-day EMA. Analysts place year-end predictions between $0.79 and $1.38, based on development speed and adoption. With real structure, dependable tokenomics, and visible developer activity, MNT fits right into any list of top-rated cryptos in 2025. 3. XMR: A Consistent Name in Privacy-Focused Crypto Monero (XMR) continues to lead when it comes to privacy features. As of July 29, XMR is priced near $315 after reaching a recent high of $324. There were some concerns around mining power centralization with Qubic, but the quick release of version 0.18.4.1 “Fluorine Fermi” on July 25 helped address that and reaffirmed Monero’s commitment to decentralization. Outlooks for XMR remain positive. Conservative estimates predict an end-of-year target near $420, while some projections go as high as $670–$688 if the current pace continues. Monero stays relevant by focusing on privacy at a time when digital tracking is a rising concern. For those seeking real protection instead of just trend-driven DeFi plays, XMR still holds its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025. 4. NEAR: Technical Support and User Growth NEAR Protocol has kept steady performance across July with several price movements drawing attention. From July 24 to 25, NEAR jumped 6.9%, rising from $2.61 to $2.79, and has since corrected slightly to around $2.70. Despite the cooldown, trading signals still favor accumulation and a possible breakout. NEAR keeps building tools and attracting outside support, making it one of the few projects with both retail and institutional interest. Forecasts for August suggest a climb to $3.12–$3.27, and extended projections stretch toward $5.22 by 2026 if momentum continues. With new features rolling out and usage growing, NEAR earns its place among the top-rated cryptos in 2025 for those chasing stable growth. Final Thoughts When evaluating top-rated cryptos in 2025, Cold Wallet stands out for turning routine fees into benefits and offering a smoother experience with fair rewards. MNT is proving itself through ongoing network upgrades and staying above key technical support levels. XMR remains unmatched for privacy, backed by strong community action and consistent price action. NEAR shows strength in both price structure and user adoption. Each of these picks has proven itself beyond short-term hype. They offer tools, functions, or structures that align with what today’s crypto user wants. If you’re mapping out your strategy, include these four in your watchlist of top-rated cryptos in 2025 . Not only are they making moves now, but their setups suggest they could still deliver much more ahead.

Solana, XRP Traders Rotate Into MAGACOIN FINANCE",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cardano-to-5-solana-xrp-traders-rotate-into-magacoin-finance/,"As major altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP continue to consolidate near key technical levels, a shift is quietly happening beneath the surface. Traders and analysts alike are watching closely—but not just for a breakout in the usual names. Increasingly, smart money is rotating into lesser-known but high-conviction plays, including a decentralized political memecoin that’s quickly becoming one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With long-term optimism intact for the majors, short-term capital is flowing into projects offering sharper upside and stronger community traction—especially those with built-in cultural appeal and strategic momentum. Cardano’s $5 Ambition Gains Ground—but Momentum Is Slow Cardano has re-entered the spotlight after rebounding from recent lows, now gaining traction thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Its $71 million governance vote—backing enhancements like the Hydra scalability protocol and Acropolis node overhaul—signaled Cardano’s intent to accelerate decentralization. Developer activity is also ramping up, with the Midnight sidechain attracting serious attention ahead of the much-anticipated Glacier airdrop. Analysts say Cardano could test $0.81 resistance soon, and if it clears that threshold, a broader move toward the $5 zone may finally begin taking shape. XRP and Solana Still Bullish—But Risk Rotation Is Real XRP continues to show strength despite regulatory distractions. A brewing falling wedge pattern has technical traders on alert, with price targets pushing above $3.75 if breakout conditions are met. But Ripple’s ongoing licensing roadblocks and banking opposition have added uncertainty to the short-term outlook. Solana is showing clearer momentum. After recovering from a sharp dip, SOL now trades near resistance with analysts watching the $174 breakout level. Institutional interest remains strong, especially as Coinbase expands support for Solana-based DeFi and NFT tools. But even as XRP and SOL build solid bases, they’re starting to feel like slow burners. This has opened the door for capital to chase more agile plays—especially those with social buzz, ideological pull, and long-term infrastructure plans. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshine XRP This Quarter? While Cardano continues its slow march toward the $5 mark, and traders watch XRP and Solana build momentum without clear breakout signals, a new trend is emerging: capital rotation into high-upside altcoins with stronger cultural relevance and community-driven growth. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE—a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin—is gaining attention as the asset of choice for those seeking faster ROI. With sentiment cooling around slower-moving majors, MAGACOIN has become a focal point for traders projecting major upside potential in the next leg of the market cycle. Many early participants believe its unique positioning, combined with growing investor momentum, could support exponential returns—some projecting gains that rival or exceed 16,700%—as interest accelerates ahead of broader access and listings. Final Thoughts: W/hy Strategic Entry Matters Now The broader crypto market is once again showing signs of life—but the next leg of the bull cycle may reward agility over patience. While Cardano, XRP, and Solana remain foundational plays for long-term portfolios, early entrants into high-conviction narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for upside before the rest of the market catches on. The entry window remains open. But the conversation is clearly shifting—and investors looking for what’s next are already watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely.

In a post, the MSS described a case in which a foreign firm offered crypto token rewards to scan users' irises around the world. The company later transferred the biometric data abroad, raising concerns about both personal data privacy and national security. While the company wasn’t named, the description closely matches Worldcoin, the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which exchanges tokens for iris scans in a bid to build a global identity network. The project has already faced regulatory pushback in Germany, France , and Kenya , CoinDesk previously reported, where concerns have been raised over informed consent, data storage, and surveillance potential. Beijing's advisory goes further, citing other cases where stolen facial data has allegedly been used by foreign intelligence services to deepfake identities, allowing spies to infiltrate secure locations. Worldcoin's WLD token is trading for 93 cents, down 4%, according to CoinDesk market data .

The now-bankrupt FTX claims that the funds were “improperly transferred” by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to Bloomberg Law , CZ claimed that he’s a resident of the United Arab Emirates and that the FTX trust can’t claim it is within Delaware’s jurisdiction. “The complaint does not establish general jurisdiction because it does not allege that Mr. Zhao is ‘at home’ in Delaware,” Zhao said in a motion to dismiss filed on Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Further, he emphasized that the claims have minimal relevance to the US and that the regulations involved have no “extraterritorial application.” FTX Wants to Recoup $1.76B From Binance: Here’s Why In November 2024, FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance exchange and its founder CZ. FTX sought to recover $1.76 billion from Binance, claiming it was transferred as part of a fraudulent transaction. FTX has sued @binance and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance for $1.8B, alleging fraudulent dealings that damaged its stability. #FTX #Binance https://t.co/WaIpSYlx4v — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2024 The $1.76 billion transaction was a 2021 share purchase agreement that Binance made with FTX, which the latter claims was fraudulent due to its insolvency at the time. A Binance spokesperson said at the time that the exchange would defend itself against the “meritless” claims. This isn’t the first time Binance has filed a motion to dismiss FTX’s $1.76 billion clawback suit. A similar court paper submitted in May to a Delaware judge noted that the beleaguered company attempted to hold Binance accountable for FTX’s crash, and “shift the blame” away from Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX “Nonsensically Blame” CZ And Binance The Monday motion read that the FTX trust “nonsensically blame” CZ and Binance for Bankman-Fried’s “pervasive malfeasance”. “The claims are in any event legally unfounded, and many are outright incoherent,” it added. Further, Zhao said that the constructive fraud claims don’t meet legal requirements that permit “qualifying transactions” linked to a securities contract under federal law. CZ pled guilty to US anti-money laundering violations and served four months in prison . Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of several offences, including fraud and conspiracy.

The price is now trading below $2.980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $3.060 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to continue higher above the $3.10 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

The Galaxy Digital founder and CEO made the comments Tuesday during the firm’s second-quarter earnings call . “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said. “The question now is which of the existing companies become monsters.” Favorable US Rules Fuel Growth in Crypto Treasury Firms Crypto treasury companies have gained momentum in recent quarters, especially as US regulatory conditions have become more favorable. These firms raise capital in public markets and allocate a portion or all of their reserves into digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain-based tokens. A growing list of public companies has adopted this approach. That includes Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), GameStop, Trump Media & Technology Group, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital. Their holdings span Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Litecoin. Ethereum already has two major corporate treasury holders, Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. Novogratz expects both to keep expanding but warned that new entrants may “have a harder time getting oxygen” as the space becomes more saturated. Novogratz Sees Recurring Revenue From Treasury Partnerships Galaxy Digital manages crypto holdings for more than 20 treasury-focused firms. The company earns fees for overseeing these assets, which now total around $2b on its platform. Novogratz described it as “recurring income that will go on and on.” In May, Galaxy shifted its public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market. It now trades under the ticker symbol GLXY, marking a strategic move to deepen its US footprint. @galaxyhq has explored the tokenization of its $GLXY shares and reported a 43% drop in total assets to $6.3 billion in Q2. #GLXY #Tokenization https://t.co/2go2wQ7tLn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The company also disclosed in a SEC filing that it is exploring tokenization of its publicly traded shares . That initiative forms part of Galaxy’s broader effort to expand into blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Founded in 2018, Galaxy Digital offers a wide range of crypto-focused services, including asset management, trading, investment banking and infrastructure solutions. It targets institutional clients looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Novogratz suggested the market’s attention is turning away from the influx of new treasury players. Instead, focus is shifting to which existing firms will scale meaningfully in the next phase of the cycle.

What to Know Dogecoin fell 5% over the 24-hour session from August 4 at 21:00 to August 5 at 20:00, declining from $0.21 to $0.20. The token traded within a $0.013 range, with lows of $0.198 and highs of $0.211. A key liquidation event occurred during the 14:00 hour on August 5, with volumes reaching 877.9 million — nearly 4x the 24-hour average of 268.85 million — triggering a breakdown below $0.205. DOGE ended the session at $0.1985 after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, signaling continued institutional selling and confirming new downside momentum. The move comes amid broader crypto market weakness triggered by risk-off sentiment across global equities. News Background DOGE’s decline coincided with institutional outflows from crypto-linked ETFs totaling $223 million over the past week, per CoinShares data. Federal Reserve hawkishness and renewed geopolitical concerns — including retaliatory tariffs and commodity flow disruptions — have fueled risk aversion across both traditional and crypto markets. At the same time, the meme coin sector remains under pressure as retail enthusiasm fades and large holders continue to rotate into higher-beta altcoins or cash positions. DOGE had previously shown signs of accumulation last week, but failure to hold the $0.205 level invalidated the setup. Price Action Summary DOGE began the session strong, hitting $0.211 at 01:00, but reversed sharply through the day. The steepest decline occurred at 14:00, when price dropped from $0.205 to $0.199 amid 877.9 million in volume. By 19:51, another flush to $0.1975 occurred on 19.04 million volume — more than 70x the hourly average — before a shallow bounce to $0.1985 into the close. New resistance has formed near $0.205, with price unable to sustain any recovery above that level following the breakdown. The token currently trades near session lows and shows no confirmation of a reversal. Technical Analysis DOGE traded within a 6% range between $0.198 and $0.211 Volume spiked to 877.9 million at 14:00, nearly 4x above daily average Rejection at $0.205 triggered mid-session breakdown Support attempted at $0.198-$0.199, but volume on bounce remained weak Final hour saw 19.04M volume burst at $0.1975 level, creating local resistance at $0.1988 Momentum remains to the downside unless price reclaims $0.205 on convincing volume What Traders Are Watching Traders are closely watching whether DOGE can stabilize above $0.198 or face further downside toward $0.185. Failure to recover above $0.205 may extend liquidations. With volumes spiking on down moves and fading on recoveries, sellers remain in control unless macro risk sentiment improves or ETF outflows reverse.",Markets|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-06 04:24:23

The world of cryptocurrency investment is always buzzing, and recent data has certainly captured attention. On August 5, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a notable combined net outflow of $196.2 million. This marks the fourth consecutive trading day of such outflows, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment within the digital asset space. What Triggered These Significant Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the fourth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 5 paints a clear picture. Investors pulled a substantial amount from these popular investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Let’s look at the specifics of these significant movements: Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows, seeing $99.1 million exit its coffers. BlackRock’s IBIT followed, experiencing $77.4 million in outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed, with $19.7 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, suggesting the outflows were concentrated in a few key players. How Do These Outflows Impact the Crypto Market? These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows naturally raise questions about their broader implications for the crypto market . While a single day or even a few days of outflows don’t necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend, they do reflect immediate investor behavior and market sentiment. Such movements can contribute to short-term price volatility for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Understanding the reasons behind these shifts is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after periods of gains. Macroeconomic concerns: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, including digital asset holdings. Regulatory developments: Any news or speculation regarding cryptocurrency regulation can influence investor confidence. Market volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market itself can prompt some investors to seek safer havens. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Funds and ETF Performance? The recent figures provide a snapshot of current ETF performance for some of the largest digital asset funds . While the overall trend for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs since their inception has been positive, periods of outflows are a natural part of any investment cycle. They serve as a reminder that even established investment vehicles linked to cryptocurrencies are subject to market dynamics. For investors, it’s important to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. These outflows highlight the need for continued monitoring of: Institutional interest: Are large institutions still accumulating or are they pulling back? Retail participation: How are individual investors reacting to market movements? Underlying Bitcoin fundamentals: The strength of Bitcoin’s network and adoption remains a key factor. This data provides valuable insight into how capital is flowing in and out of the regulated crypto investment space. Looking Ahead: Navigating the Crypto Market The recent outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a significant event, but they are just one piece of the larger crypto market puzzle. For investors, the key is to remain informed and adopt a measured approach. While headlines about large outflows can seem daunting, they are often part of a healthy market’s ebb and flow. Consider these actionable insights: Stay informed: Continuously track data from reliable sources like Farside Investors. Diversify: Don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket. Long-term perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of digital assets rather than daily price swings. Risk assessment: Understand your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. These recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a timely reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape. By understanding the underlying factors and maintaining a clear perspective, investors can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to buy, store, or secure the actual cryptocurrency. 2.

The specific causes can be complex, but common reasons for such Bitcoin ETF outflows include investor profit-taking, reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions, shifts in crypto market sentiment, or responses to regulatory news affecting digital asset funds . 3. How do these outflows affect the overall crypto market? While not solely indicative of the entire market’s health, significant outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. They also reflect investor confidence and can influence sentiment across the broader crypto market . 4. Is this a long-term trend for digital asset funds? It is too early to determine if this is a long-term trend. Outflows are a normal part of fund management and ETF performance . Investors should monitor subsequent trading days and broader market conditions to assess whether this represents a sustained shift or a temporary adjustment. 5.

The world of digital assets is always buzzing with activity, and recent developments in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs market have certainly captured attention. On August 5th, these investment vehicles witnessed a significant turnaround, recording a combined net inflow of $73.3 million. This positive shift follows two consecutive days of net outflows, sparking renewed optimism among investors and analysts tracking institutional crypto adoption. What Drove These Impressive Ethereum ETF Inflows? This notable surge in investment highlights a dynamic period for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs . Data from Farside Investors indicates a clear preference for certain funds, even as others experienced outflows. Understanding which ETFs attracted the most capital provides crucial insight into market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the key players and their performance on August 5th: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the charge by a significant margin, attracting a remarkable $88.8 million in new capital. Its strong performance suggests growing confidence in BlackRock’s offerings. VanEck’s ETHV: Adding to the positive momentum, VanEck’s ETF saw $5.2 million in inflows. This indicates broader interest beyond just the largest players. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: With $3.6 million in inflows, ARK 21Shares also contributed positively to the overall net figure. Grayscale’s Funds: In contrast, Grayscale’s mini ETH and ETHE experienced net outflows of $13.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. These outflows suggest some investors may be rebalancing their portfolios or moving to newer, potentially lower-fee products. The remaining ETH ETF products reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining their existing positions. Why Are These U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF Movements Significant for the Crypto Market? The return to net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it reflects evolving institutional crypto adoption and potential shifts in broader crypto market trends .

Market Stability: Increased institutional participation can contribute to greater market stability and liquidity. Future Growth: It sets a precedent for continued growth and further integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios. The fact that major players like BlackRock are seeing such strong interest in their Ethereum ETF inflows is a powerful indicator for the future of digital asset investing.

On-chain data now points to a possible ETH short squeeze if Ether climbs above $4,000, while $5.6 billion in BTC shorts could be liquidated if Bitcoin breaks out above $125,000. These aggressive trades are setting up a critical juncture for the entire market, raising new questions about XRP’s next move and opening the door for high-upside altcoins. As investors brace for crypto market volatility for ETH, BTC, XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new contender, attracting attention for its potential 39x gains in Q3. Massive Short Positions on ETH and BTC ETH and BTC short positions in 2025 are near peak levels. According to CoinGlass, nearly $331 million in short positions on ETH would be wiped out by an ETH short squeeze above $4,000. Most of these positions are stacked just below recent resistance—any breakout could force shorts to cover, fueling rapid price spikes. For Bitcoin, Bitget data shows more than $5.6 billion in short positions on BTC could face liquidation if Bitcoin moves past $125,000. This amount of exposure makes the current market a “ticking time bomb.” A breach of the $120K–$122K resistance could spark a massive BTC short squeeze, forcing shorts to exit and creating a swift upside move. Traders are closely watching what happens if BTC shorts get liquidated, knowing the ripple effects could hit altcoins across the board. Ripple XRP Faces Market Shockwaves Ripple’s XRP price has dropped below $3 in the last 24 hours, impacted by both Bitcoin’s moves and its own surge in futures activity. Binance reports XRP futures open interest at a record $3.9 billion, with 50.77% of positions now short. This heavy shorting leaves XRP vulnerable to rapid swings and makes the next direction hard to predict. If Bitcoin and Ethereum trigger a squeeze, the impact of BTC and ETH shorts on XRP could create outsized moves in XRP’s price. Market watchers are split—will XRP crash if Bitcoin drops, or could it rebound sharply if the shorts unwind? XRP market shockwaves are likely either way, as crypto market volatility (ETH, BTC, and XRP) is fueling wild swings across the sector. The best strategy for XRP during market crash conditions may be to watch resistance levels after a BTC dump and prepare for sharp reversals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is The Coin To Watch Now? MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum among investors seeking returns beyond major cap volatility. As short selling affects XRP and other blue chips, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a new high-upside option for traders seeking Q3 growth. Whale accumulation, social buzz, and trading volume are all surging, with analysts tipping the project for up to 39x gains in the current quarter. Part of the appeal is its community-driven structure and resistance to the wild swings seen in ETH and BTC.

Crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital unstaked a massive 250,000 SOL, valued at an impressive $40.7 million, and promptly moved it to the Binance Exchange. This notable SOL Binance transfer occurred just hours ago, as reported by Lookonchain on X, citing precise data from Solscan. Such a considerable movement of assets from a major player like Galaxy Digital often sparks considerable discussion and speculation within the market. What Does This SOL Binance Transfer Signify? When a firm like Galaxy Digital executes a large SOL transaction of this magnitude, it typically indicates a strategic maneuver. Unstaking assets frees them from locking periods, making them liquid and available for various purposes. These purposes might include preparing for a sale, rebalancing portfolios, or even facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals that bypass immediate market impact. However, a direct deposit to an exchange like Binance often suggests an intention to increase liquidity on the platform, potentially for trading activities. This action by Galaxy Digital is not just a simple transfer; it is a clear signal of their active management of their Solana holdings. It underscores the dynamic nature of institutional participation in the crypto space, where large entities constantly adjust their positions based on market conditions and strategic objectives. Analyzing the Large SOL Transaction and Market Implications The immediate question following such a substantial large SOL transaction is its potential effect on Solana’s price. While a direct deposit to an exchange does not automatically mean a sell-off, it does increase the available supply on the exchange. If these SOL tokens were to be sold, it could create temporary selling pressure on the market. However, it is also possible that Galaxy Digital is using Binance for liquidity provision, derivatives trading, or other strategic financial operations that do not involve immediate liquidation. Observing the market’s reaction in the hours and days following this transfer will provide clearer insights. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring Solana’s price action and overall trading volume on Binance to gauge the true intent behind this significant deposit. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking Solana’s ecosystem. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity and Solana Market Impact This move by Galaxy Digital perfectly exemplifies typical crypto whale activity . Whales, or large holders of cryptocurrency, possess the power to influence market dynamics through their substantial transactions. Their actions are often seen as indicators of broader market sentiment or upcoming trends. When a whale unstakes and deposits assets to an exchange, it creates a ripple effect, prompting other market participants to analyze the potential reasons and consequences. The ultimate Solana market impact from this specific deposit will depend on subsequent actions. If a significant portion of the deposited SOL is sold, we might see downward price pressure. Conversely, if it is held or used for other purposes, the impact could be minimal or even positive, indicating institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term prospects. This event serves as a reminder of how crucial it is to monitor the on-chain movements of major players in the crypto world. What Should Investors Watch For? Price Action: Monitor SOL’s price performance on Binance and other major exchanges. Significant dips could suggest selling. Volume Changes: Look for unusually high trading volumes for SOL, which might accompany large buy or sell orders. Further Transfers: Keep an eye on Solscan for any additional large movements from Galaxy Digital or other institutional wallets. News & Announcements: Stay updated on any official statements from Galaxy Digital that might clarify their intentions. In conclusion, the recent Galaxy Digital SOL deposit of $40.7 million into Binance is a notable development in the Solana ecosystem. While the immediate implications remain speculative, this large SOL transaction highlights the ongoing crypto whale activity and its potential Solana market impact . It underscores the strategic maneuvers of institutional players like Galaxy Digital, reminding us of the importance of vigilance in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Staying informed about such significant transfers is key to navigating the volatile crypto markets effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Galaxy Digital’s role in this SOL transfer? Galaxy Digital is a prominent crypto financial services firm. Their role in this transfer was to unstake 250,000 SOL and deposit it into the Binance Exchange, indicating active management of their crypto assets. Why did Galaxy Digital deposit SOL into Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly stated, depositing to an exchange like Binance typically suggests increasing liquidity for potential trading, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. How does a large SOL transaction affect the Solana market? A large SOL transaction, especially a deposit to an exchange, can increase the available supply. If these tokens are sold, it could create temporary selling pressure. However, if held or used for other purposes, the market impact might be minimal or even positive. What is “crypto whale activity”? “Crypto whale activity” refers to the significant transactions made by individuals or entities holding a large amount of cryptocurrency. These movements are closely watched as they can influence market sentiment and price trends due to their sheer volume. Should investors be concerned about this SOL movement? Investors should remain informed but avoid immediate panic. Such movements are part of institutional asset management. It’s crucial to monitor subsequent market reactions, such as price action and trading volume, rather than assuming an immediate sell-off. Did you find this analysis helpful?

In 2025, these offers are not judged by big numbers alone, but by how fast players can access their winnings and how clear the rules are. Players now prefer sites that give bonuses they can actually use and cash out, without hidden terms. This article ranks the best crypto casino bonus offers this year, focusing on clear rules, payout time, and overall user experience. Spartans ranks highest for giving rewards that are easy to understand and quick to claim. Spartans: Top-Rated Bonus Offers for Fast Crypto Payouts Spartans is the best crypto casino for bonuses in 2025. It gives large welcome rewards, frequent deposit boosts, and quick crypto withdrawals in one easy setup. The biggest difference at Spartans is how simple everything is. First-time users get a 300% bonus on casino and sports betting with only a $5 minimum deposit. Bonus terms are shown clearly, including how wagering works, which games qualify, and any payout rules. There are no confusing limits or hidden rules in the small text. Players know what to expect and how to use each offer. Regular users also benefit from ongoing deposit bonuses. A 25% bonus is available every day on both casino and sports deposits. These offers are simple to activate, process quickly, and lead to real crypto earnings. Whether you play slots or place bets on sports, these bonuses are made to be used, not just advertised. With games that load quickly, many supported cryptos, and a smooth user layout, Spartans gives players a bonus setup that saves time and avoids confusion. Unlike most other sites, winnings from bonuses at Spartans are available for withdrawal right after meeting the rules. This makes Spartans the most trusted and useful crypto bonus program in 2025. Stake.com: Bigger Bonuses, Slower to Unlock Stake.com continues to be a top option for crypto players, and its reward system reflects its strong user base. New users get a matched deposit bonus, while current users can access regular challenges, VIP perks, and prize events. Still, the bonuses on Stake come with higher wagering terms than those on Spartans. Players often have to complete several steps before their rewards are fully released. This setup can reduce the appeal for users who want quick and simple benefits. While Stake stands out among the best crypto casino options, the path to withdrawing bonus winnings is not the fastest. Roobet: Bold Promotions with Some Limits Roobet promotes itself with big signup bonuses and themed offers connected to featured games and events. The site often runs active bonus programs, but how these bonuses work can be unclear. The playthrough rules are sometimes detailed, and bonuses may expire fast or be limited to certain games. Loyal players benefit from cashback and tournaments, but for first-time users, the real value may fall short of what the ads suggest. Roobet may appeal to experienced users who understand the terms, but for those new to crypto casinos, Spartans or Stake may offer a smoother experience among the best crypto casino platforms. BC.Game: Custom Bonus Options with Some Trade-Offs BC.Game provides a large range of promos aimed at crypto users, such as spin-based rewards, tiered bonuses, and offers linked to specific tokens. The site lets users choose how they want their rewards delivered, which adds flexibility. Still, many of the promotions are tied to the platform’s own token. This may not suit users who prefer using well-known cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Bonus withdrawal times also change based on what offer is used. For those who like to personalize their rewards, BC.Game offers variety. But it doesn’t provide the fast, direct bonus experience seen with Spartans, which sets the pace among the best crypto casino choices. Betano: Local Bonus Strength, Global Gaps Remain Betano offers strong bonus deals in selected regions, especially across Europe and Latin America. These include welcome rewards, no-risk bets, and reload offers designed for specific markets. While bonus amounts are solid in those areas, the platform does not offer full crypto support across all locations. Payout times are fair but not fast, with many withdrawals needing manual review. For users looking for faster service and crypto freedom, Betano may feel limited outside its core regions, especially when compared to the best crypto casino options. 888Casino: Well-Known Brand, Classic Bonus Style 888Casino is trusted by many and provides a safe playing space, but its bonus system sticks to a more standard setup. New members can get a matched deposit bonus, and there are rotating daily rewards and VIP benefits for long-term users. Though crypto payment choices are growing, bonus programs are still mainly set around fiat. This brings slower payouts, manual checks for bonus use, and limited ways to take out winnings from bonus rewards. While steady and trusted, 888Casino has not yet built the kind of crypto-first reward system seen on the best crypto casino platforms. Final Thoughts In 2025, bonus offers are judged by how simple and fast they are to use. Players now want rewards they can track, unlock, and withdraw without problems. Spartans stands out for clear terms, easy daily boosts, and fast crypto payouts. Other choices like Stake.com and Roobet still hold value, but include more rules and slower access. For users focused on the best crypto casino reward programs, Spartans offers the strongest and clearest path to real payouts.

Experts Weigh XRP vs Ethereum in Long-Term Outlook,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-100-by-2025-experts-weigh-xrp-vs-ethereum-in-long-term-outlook/,"The XRP community is excited once again, and for good reason. With a string of bullish developments unfolding and mainstream adoption growing, many traders are now asking the big question: Can XRP actually hit $100 in 2025? While it sounds far-fetched, one thing is clear—there’s serious momentum building behind this prediction. As the XRP buzz gets louder, some early traders are already pivoting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new DeFi token that investors are hoping to catch the next big breakout before it goes mainstream. What’s Driving the XRP Hype? XRP’s history has been anything but boring. After years of battling the SEC in court, Ripple’s fortunes appear to be shifting. A possible XRP ETF is now one of the hottest topics in the crypto space. If the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gives it the green light, it could open the floodgates for institutional money—just like what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The most explosive long-term catalyst lies in global bank adoption. XRP’s speed and low fees make it a strong candidate to replace the SWIFT system, which has remained largely unchanged for decades. If financial institutions begin using XRP to process cross-border transactions, trillions could flow through the network, putting enormous upward pressure on price. Ethereum’s Strong Rebound Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the altcoin space. ETH is trading around $3,600. From its June lows, ETH has surged 78%, now boasting a $427.09B market cap with $22.13B in daily volume. Technical indicators show bullish momentum. ETH is pushing past resistance at the current levels. A break above $3,700 could open the path toward $4,500-$7,000 in the coming months. MAGACOIN FINANCE Traders Target Gains While the spotlight shines on XRP and Ethereum, early traders are quietly flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap DeFi project with big ambitions. With its tokenomics designed for exponential growth, many believe it could deliver 20,300% gains—mirroring early-stage breakouts like Shiba Inu or Pepe. The token’s fundamentals include a strong focus on yield generation, decentralized tools, and integration with emerging altcoin ecosystems. As crypto markets rotate into higher-risk, high-reward assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next major breakout. Timing might be everything—and early birds are already circling. Final Thoughts So, can XRP hit $100 by 2025? The odds are steep, but the ingredients are there: institutional demand, real-world use cases, and growing legitimacy. Traders eyeing better returns are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that today’s low-cap DeFi projects might deliver XRP-like gains before the big players catch on.

Over the past week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has declined by nearly 4%, trading at $113,993 at the time of writing. This represents a drop of approximately 7.2% from the peak price of above $123,000 reached in July. The decline has sparked renewed discussion among analysts about the asset’s current price discovery phase and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto Bitcoin Price Discovery and the Potential for Q4 Gains CryptoQuant analyst Oinonen shared his latest assessment of Bitcoin’s market performance, noting that while the recent pullback appears significant, it primarily reflects technical market conditions. In his post on the QuickTake platform, he explained that a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, technical indicators turning bearish, and liquidation events has contributed to the decline. However, he described the ongoing situation as a “technical correction” within Bitcoin’s longer-term bullish structure. Despite the short-term weakness, analysts remain focused on Bitcoin’s price discovery process. This phase, according to Oinonen, is essential in establishing the asset’s fair market value as supply and demand interact in the market. Following the all-time high of $123,400 on July 14, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating, potentially setting the stage for further upward movement later in the year. “Bitcoin has historically performed well in the fourth quarter,” Oinonen noted, suggesting that a return to its previous peak and even a potential move toward $200,000 could be on the horizon if historical patterns hold. Additionally, the analyst pointed to Binance’s high stablecoin reserves as a factor that may influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. These reserves represent capital that could flow into Bitcoin and other digital assets if market sentiment improves. A positive shift in buying activity, combined with Bitcoin’s reflexive market behavior, could support further gains, although the extent to which this would benefit altcoins remains uncertain.

Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support Caution Over Negative Coinbase Premium Signals While some market participants anticipate a possible rebound later this year, other analysts are urging caution. Another CryptoQuant contributor, known as BQYoutube, highlighted a recent change in the Coinbase Premium Index, a metric comparing prices on Coinbase versus other exchanges. Since June 30, the premium has shifted to negative, indicating weaker buying pressure from US-based investors. “Historically, stronger Bitcoin rallies have coincided with a positive Coinbase Premium,” BQYouTube wrote, suggesting that traders may want to wait for signs of renewed spot demand before expecting a sustainable uptrend.

Tron Has Just Seen Its Largest Profit-Taking Wave In Months In a new thread on X, Glassnode has discussed about the profit-taking spree that has just occurred on the Tron network. Over the last 24 hours, the Realized Profit has hit $1.4 billion, which is the second largest amount for 2025 so far. The “Realized Profit” here naturally refers to an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of gain that TRX investors are realizing through their transactions. It works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to check what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value was less than the latest spot price for any token, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a profit realization equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this profit involved in all transfers occurring on the blockchain during a given day. An indicator known as the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. From the above table, it’s visible that this metric’s value has remained low for TRX, suggesting no capitulation has accompanied the profit-taking. While the latest spike in the Realized Profit is massive, it hasn’t come in isolation. As the below chart shows, the metric’s value has been elevated for Tron in the past few days. Since Saturday, the network has been seeing nearly $1 billion in profit-taking every day. “This marks the most sustained wave of realized profit for TRON in months,” notes the analytics firm. Now, the main question is, who are the investors responsible for this profit realization wave? The below chart answers the question, breaking down the Realized Profit for the various holder groups. The cohorts displayed here have been divided based on coin age . For example, investors who have been holding since between 1 week and 1 month ago are put in the 1w-1m band. It would appear that the 3y-5y band, corresponding to addresses holding since at least three years and at most five years ago, have made up for the majority of the recent Realized Profit spike. “This suggests participants from the 2020–2021 cycle are exiting into strength – a notable shift in behavior that could influence short-term market dynamics,” says Glassnode. TRX Price While most of the cryptocurrency sector has taken a hit during the past week, Tron is relatively unscathed as its price is still trading around $0.33.",Altcoins|Glassnode|tron|Tron Profit-Taking|trx|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 05:00:50

Local outlet Global Times reported Wednesday that the ministry outlined the growing risks tied to biometric technologies. It said recent cases have shown foreign intelligence agencies illegally harvesting facial data from targeted individuals to carry out espionage activities inside China. The ministry did not identify specific firms, but the description of the scheme closely mirrors the model used by World, the crypto startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. China's Ministry of State Security has publicly warned that a foreign company is using the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a gimmick to scan and collect user iris information worldwide and transfer the data source, posing a threat to personal information security and even… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 6, 2025 Crypto Token Incentives Used to Collect Iris Data, China Ministry Says World, formerly known as Worldcoin , offers crypto tokens in exchange for users’ iris scans. The company claims the scans help verify a user’s unique identity and enable digital financial access, particularly in underserved markets. However, World was not explicitly named in the MSS advisory. Cryptonews has reached out to World for comment on the matter. The ministry described a case in which a foreign company allegedly used the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens as a pretext to scan and collect iris data from users around the world. This data was then transferred overseas, according to the statement, raising red flags for national and individual security. Officials Link Biometric Data Leaks to National Security Threats Biometric identification technologies, the ministry noted, have gained rapid traction in recent years. Used for their speed and accuracy, these systems collect and process facial features, fingerprints, irises and even body movements. While these tools offer convenience, the ministry warned that the risk of data leaks and misuse has also grown significantly. Officials cited cases in which foreign spies forged biometric information to gain access to classified materials or infiltrate sensitive workplaces. In another example, a fingerprint payment system linked to a corporate database was repeatedly breached due to lax cybersecurity, resulting in major data leaks. Further, the ministry said that iris patterns are especially sensitive. They are highly stable and nearly impossible to replicate, making them valuable for authentication in high-security environments. Their uniqueness, however, also makes them a prime target for malicious actors, the ministry said. China Warns Citizens to Scrutinize Biometric Data Practices The warning comes as biometric systems continue to expand across sectors ranging from finance to border control. In this context, the ministry urged the public to remain cautious when handing over biometric data, especially for services involving facial, fingerprint or iris recognition. Citizens, the statement said, have the right to ask data collectors to explain how personal information will be stored, processed and used. The ministry also advised individuals to review privacy policies carefully and to stay alert for signs of excessive data collection.

Recently, a major crypto market participant made a substantial move, hinting at a bullish outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency. This activity often precedes notable price shifts, catching the attention of investors worldwide and sparking discussions about future market direction. Such large-scale movements by institutional players are closely watched indicators. What Do Recent ETH Withdrawals Signify for the Market? According to precise data from The Data Nerd on X, crypto market maker Cumberland executed a massive ETH withdrawal . Specifically, they moved 36,918 ETH, valued at an impressive $132.86 million, from Coinbase Exchange just hours ago. This kind of large-scale withdrawal from an exchange often indicates an intent to hold or use the assets for other purposes, rather than immediately selling them on the open market. This reduces the readily available supply on exchanges, which can support price stability or even upward pressure. Furthermore, another notable transaction occurred when crypto investment manager Abraxas Capital also withdrew 7,191 ETH, worth $25.97 million, from Binance Exchange. These combined movements are not coincidental; they reflect a strategic positioning by major players in the market. Such actions typically suggest confidence in future price appreciation and a proactive approach to capitalize on anticipated market shifts. These withdrawals are distinct from routine operational transfers, highlighting a deliberate strategy. Are Institutional Crypto Players Gearing Up for Growth? The collective actions of entities like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital highlight a growing trend: institutional crypto players are actively positioning themselves for what they perceive as significant market opportunities. These firms manage substantial capital and their moves often provide crucial insight into broader market sentiment. When they pull significant amounts of assets off exchanges, it can reduce immediate selling pressure and signal accumulation for long-term holding or strategic deployment. This behavior aligns strongly with the expectation that these large investors anticipate an upward price trajectory for Ethereum. They are not merely observing the market from the sidelines; they are actively participating in ways that could influence its direction. This strategic accumulation by well-informed entities is a key indicator for many retail investors looking for cues on where the market might be headed. It underscores a belief in Ethereum’s fundamental strength and its role in the evolving digital economy. The Critical Role of a Crypto Market Maker in Bull Runs Understanding the vital role of a crypto market maker is crucial when analyzing these withdrawals. Firms like Cumberland are essential to market liquidity, facilitating seamless trades between buyers and sellers. When a market maker withdraws such a large amount of ETH, it implies they might be engaging in several strategic actions: Long-Term Holding: Moving funds to an off-exchange cold storage wallet for secure, long-term holding, indicating a belief in sustained value growth. DeFi Deployment: Preparing to deploy these assets into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for yield generation or participation in new projects, which often requires assets to be off-exchange. Inventory Management: Anticipating increased demand and thus reducing their exchange holdings to manage inventory more efficiently, preparing to sell at higher prices rather than dumping. Each of these scenarios points towards a positive outlook for Ethereum’s price. Market makers typically operate with sophisticated analytical models, and their significant moves are rarely arbitrary. Their actions are often a leading indicator of impending market shifts, suggesting that they foresee a significant Ethereum rally . Implications for Coinbase ETH Supply and Beyond The large withdrawal from Coinbase ETH reserves by Cumberland is particularly noteworthy due to Coinbase’s standing. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, frequently favored by institutional clients for its security and compliance. A substantial outflow from such a platform can have ripple effects, potentially reducing the readily available supply on exchanges and thus supporting price increases through basic supply-demand dynamics. This trend, coupled with similar movements from other major exchanges like Binance, paints a clear picture. Institutional investors and market makers appear to be preparing for the next significant upward movement in Ethereum’s price. Their actions suggest a strong belief in the asset’s fundamentals, its growing ecosystem, and its future growth potential. These strategic withdrawals are often a precursor to major market events, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. In conclusion, the recent substantial ETH withdrawals by major market participants like Cumberland and Abraxas Capital are strong indicators of an impending Ethereum rally . These strategic moves by institutional players and market makers suggest a collective anticipation of bullish momentum. As these large entities accumulate ETH and move it off exchanges, the market supply on exchanges decreases, potentially paving the way for upward price action. This is a moment where smart money appears to be making its move, signaling exciting times ahead for Ethereum and its vibrant ecosystem. Keeping an eye on these institutional flows can provide valuable insights for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of large ETH withdrawals from exchanges? Large ETH withdrawals often indicate that major investors or market makers intend to hold the assets for the long term, deploy them in DeFi, or are preparing for future demand. This reduces the supply available for immediate sale on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal for price. Q2: Who is Cumberland, and what is their role in the crypto market? Cumberland is a prominent crypto market maker. Their role is to provide liquidity by facilitating trades between buyers and sellers, helping to ensure smooth market operations. Their large transactions are often seen as indicators of institutional sentiment. Q3: Does institutional ETH withdrawal guarantee a price rally? While large institutional withdrawals are strong indicators of bullish sentiment and often precede price rallies, they do not guarantee a rally. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and price movements can be volatile. Q4: How do these movements affect the overall Ethereum supply? When large amounts of ETH are withdrawn from exchanges, it reduces the circulating supply readily available for trading on those platforms. This decrease in exchange supply, combined with potential increased demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price.

Just as Bitcoin and other digital assets react to global sentiment, so too do traditional currencies. Recently, the Asia FX Outlook has been a subject of keen interest, with many regional currencies experiencing slight weakening, while the Indian Rupee has staged a notable recovery from its recent record lows. This intriguing development is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) strategic decision to hold interest rates steady, providing a much-needed anchor in turbulent waters. But what exactly does this mean for the broader financial landscape, and how does it connect to the overarching themes of economic stability and growth? Decoding the Shifting Tides of Asia FX Outlook The past few weeks have seen a nuanced performance across Asian foreign exchange markets. While some currencies have shown resilience, others have succumbed to external pressures, reflecting the complex interplay of global economic forces. The general sentiment has been one of slight weakening across the board, influenced by factors such as a strong US dollar, rising commodity prices, and persistent inflation concerns. This broader trend sets the stage for understanding the individual performances within the region. External Pressures: A robust US dollar, fueled by expectations of continued hawkishness from the Federal Reserve, often puts downward pressure on emerging market currencies. Commodity Price Volatility: Fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices can significantly impact the trade balances of net importers or exporters in Asia, affecting their currency valuations. Inflationary Concerns: Rising inflation in various Asian economies prompts central banks to consider tighter monetary policies, which can attract or deter foreign investment based on interest rate differentials. Geopolitical Developments: Ongoing global events and geopolitical tensions contribute to uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets, often at the expense of riskier emerging market currencies. Despite these headwinds, the regional Asia FX Outlook remains a critical barometer for global economic health, with each currency’s movement telling a unique story of domestic policy and international influence. Indian Rupee Recovery: A Resilient Comeback Story Amidst the general weakening trend in Asia, the Indian Rupee Recovery stands out as a significant event. After touching a record low against the US dollar, the rupee has demonstrated remarkable resilience, bouncing back in a manner that has surprised many market observers. This recovery is not merely a statistical anomaly but a testament to underlying economic strengths and proactive policy measures. The rupee’s journey from its nadir has been closely watched. Several factors contributed to its initial decline, including a widening trade deficit, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows from Indian equities, and the broad strengthening of the US dollar. However, the recovery phase has been underpinned by: Strong Inflows: A resurgence of foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows, particularly into debt markets, has provided crucial support. Improved Economic Data: Positive domestic economic indicators, such as robust GDP growth figures and declining inflation (even if gradual), have bolstered investor confidence. RBI’s Intervention: The central bank’s strategic interventions in the forex market, including selling dollars from its reserves, have helped stabilize the currency. Export Performance: A healthy performance in key export sectors has helped narrow the trade deficit, reducing pressure on the rupee. This Indian Rupee Recovery highlights the dynamic nature of currency markets and the significant impact of both internal economic health and external market forces. RBI Monetary Policy: The Anchoring Force of Stability At the heart of the Indian Rupee’s recent stability and recovery lies the RBI Monetary Policy . The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% for the eighth consecutive time played a pivotal role in calming market jitters and providing a sense of predictability. This decision, announced after careful consideration of inflationary pressures and growth prospects, signals a cautious yet confident approach by the central bank. The RBI’s approach can be understood through these key points: Inflation Management: While inflation has shown signs of moderation, the RBI remains vigilant, aiming to bring it within its target range sustainably. Holding rates steady allows the central bank to assess the impact of previous rate hikes without stifling nascent economic growth. Growth Support: By not raising rates further, the RBI avoids adding to borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, thereby supporting economic expansion and investment. Exchange Rate Stability: A stable interest rate environment reduces interest rate volatility, which in turn helps stabilize the rupee. Predictable rates make India an attractive destination for foreign capital seeking reasonable returns. Global Cues: The RBI also considers global monetary policy trends, particularly those of major central banks like the US Federal Reserve. Aligning its policy helps prevent excessive capital outflows. The steadfastness of the RBI Monetary Policy demonstrates a commitment to balancing price stability with economic growth, a crucial factor in attracting and retaining foreign investment. Navigating Global Forex Trends and Their Local Impact The performance of Asian currencies, including the Indian Rupee, cannot be viewed in isolation. They are deeply intertwined with Global Forex Trends , which are influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from geopolitical tensions to shifts in major economies’ monetary policies. Understanding these broader trends is essential for grasping the local impact on currencies. Consider the following: Global Factor Impact on Asia FX Specific Effect on Rupee US Dollar Strength Puts downward pressure on most Asian currencies as capital flows to safe-haven assets. Increases import costs, widens trade deficit, puts depreciation pressure. Oil Price Fluctuations Net oil importers (e.g., India, Japan) face currency depreciation; exporters (e.g., Malaysia) see appreciation. Higher oil prices worsen current account deficit, increasing rupee vulnerability. China’s Economic Performance Significant impact on regional trade and investment flows, affecting currencies of trade partners. Slowdown in China can reduce demand for Indian exports, impacting rupee. Geopolitical Events Increases risk aversion, leading to capital flight from emerging markets. Can trigger sudden outflows, leading to sharp depreciation. The intricate dance of Global Forex Trends means that even strong domestic policies must contend with external headwinds. India’s ability to navigate these trends speaks volumes about its economic resilience and policy frameworks. Understanding Currency Market Volatility: What Drives the Swings? The very nature of foreign exchange markets is defined by Currency Market Volatility . Currencies are constantly in motion, responding to an endless stream of economic data, political developments, and market sentiment. For investors, understanding the drivers of this volatility is key to making informed decisions. Key drivers of currency fluctuations include: Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in one country relative to another can attract foreign capital, strengthening its currency. Economic Performance: Strong GDP growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation generally lead to a stronger currency, as the economy is perceived as healthy. Political Stability: Countries with stable political environments are often seen as safer investments, attracting capital and strengthening their currency. Conversely, political instability can lead to rapid depreciation. Trade Balances: A country with a persistent trade surplus (exports exceeding imports) tends to see its currency strengthen due to higher demand for its goods and services. Speculation: Large-scale speculative trading by financial institutions can significantly amplify currency movements, sometimes detached from economic fundamentals. While Currency Market Volatility presents risks, it also creates opportunities for investors who can accurately anticipate or react to these movements. The Indian Rupee’s recent journey is a prime example of how various factors converge to create significant shifts in value. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Landscape The current financial landscape, characterized by both global uncertainties and pockets of resilience, presents a mix of challenges and opportunities for investors and policymakers alike. Challenges: Sustained US Dollar Strength: The persistent strength of the US dollar continues to exert pressure on emerging market currencies, making imports more expensive and potentially fueling inflation. Global Inflationary Pressures: While some countries are seeing inflation cool, the risk of resurgence from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events remains. Capital Outflows: Higher interest rates in developed economies could lead to continued capital outflows from emerging markets, putting pressure on their currencies and equity markets. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing conflicts and trade tensions introduce uncertainty, deterring foreign investment and increasing market volatility. Opportunities: Resilient Domestic Demand: Economies with strong domestic consumption can cushion against global slowdowns, offering attractive investment opportunities. Policy Stability: Central banks like the RBI, demonstrating consistent and predictable monetary policy, enhance investor confidence and attract long-term capital. Diversification: For global investors, the performance of currencies like the Indian Rupee offers diversification benefits, especially if they show decoupling from broader negative trends. Technological Advancements: Digitalization and innovation in various sectors can drive productivity gains and attract investment, strengthening economic fundamentals. Navigating this complex environment requires a nuanced understanding of both macro-economic indicators and specific policy responses. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those looking to make sense of these currency dynamics, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from central banks like the RBI and the Federal Reserve. Their forward guidance on interest rates and inflation targets can provide crucial clues about future currency movements. Track Trade and Current Account Data: A country’s trade balance and current account deficit/surplus are strong indicators of its currency’s health. Improving figures often signal potential appreciation. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the Indian Rupee shows strength, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Consider Long-Term Fundamentals: Short-term volatility can be distracting. Focus on the long-term economic fundamentals of a country, such as GDP growth, fiscal health, and policy stability, when making investment decisions. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Geopolitical events can have swift and significant impacts on currency markets. Staying abreast of global news can help anticipate potential shifts. By applying these insights, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities presented by evolving currency markets. Conclusion: A Remarkable Recovery in a Volatile World The recent performance of the Asia FX Outlook , particularly the compelling Indian Rupee Recovery from its record lows, offers a fascinating case study in economic resilience and strategic central banking. The RBI Monetary Policy , characterized by its steady hand on interest rates, has proven instrumental in providing stability amidst a backdrop of fluctuating Global Forex Trends and persistent Currency Market Volatility . This delicate balance between supporting growth and managing inflation is a tightrope walk that the RBI has managed with notable success, instilling confidence in both domestic and international investors. While the broader Asian currencies faced slight headwinds, India’s economic fundamentals, coupled with timely policy interventions, allowed the rupee to chart a distinct and positive course. This remarkable comeback serves as a reminder that even in an interconnected global economy, strong domestic policies and robust economic indicators can provide a crucial buffer against external shocks. As we move forward, monitoring these trends will be vital for understanding the broader implications for investment, trade, and economic stability across the region.

Experts Split on Altcoin Market’s Next Move,https://cryptopotato.com/altseason-or-another-false-start-experts-split-on-altcoin-markets-next-move/,"Many experts have predicted the return of a long-awaited altcoin season. A declining share of Bitcoin dominance and sporadic outperformance in select altcoins have pointed to a subtle rotation into smaller, higher-risk assets, amidst growing appetite for the market. A recent report, however, casts doubt on the sustainability of an altcoin rally. Altcoin Rally Lacks Support Matrixport warned that it may once again fizzle out. Analyst Markus Thielen noted that, despite recurring calls for a new bull market, only two brief altcoin surges have occurred in recent memory. In fact, the most notable was in Q4 2024. These rallies, which saw temporary spikes in funding rates, lacked underlying fundamental support, which led to rapid reversals. As such, Thielen argued the current move mirrors previous patterns, with declining funding rates indicating that enthusiasm has already faded. The analyst added that the altcoin market remains structurally weak, and investors hoping for steady upside may be disappointed yet again. This comes as Bitcoin’s dominance briefly slipped near 60% which has historically preceded full altcoin seasons, where these tokens outperform BTC significantly. Certain data also pointed toward capital rotation, which further strengthened the narratives of an altseason. Conflicting Signals SwissBlock’s “Altcoin Vector” reported that the altcoin market is transitioning toward a potential breakout zone. It said that “smart capital” is rotating into positions before retail traders notice the shift. They highlighted that while momentum and market structure are improving, this is not yet a breakout; instead, it’s an early stage where informed investors begin pre-positioning for a possible future rally. This phase can offer strategic entry opportunities before broader market sentiment turns bullish and prices accelerate. Another market watcher argued that an altseason may soon begin based on USDT dominance, which has been stuck in a descending triangle pattern for nearly two years and now appears close to breaking down. A decline in USDT dominance typically suggests that traders are moving capital out of stablecoins and into riskier assets like altcoins, thereby fueling broad altcoin rallies. As such, the market action seen so far has only been a warm-up, and a decisive breakdown in USDT dominance would trigger a strong shift of liquidity into altcoins, which could potentially spark a major altcoin bull run.

Recent data reveals a compelling trend: a select group of strategic firms are accumulating vast ETH reserves , signaling growing confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. This accumulation of Ethereum holdings by major players is a development every crypto enthusiast should know about, especially regarding the overall ETH supply . Unpacking the Scale of These ETH Reserves The combined ETH reserves held by 64 prominent firms have now surged past the 3 million ETH mark. Each of these firms holds more than 100 Ethereum, indicating a strategic long-term perspective. Specifically, these substantial holdings currently stand at approximately 3.04 million ETH, an impressive sum valued at over $10.87 billion. This substantial figure represents about 2.52% of the total ETH supply . Such a significant portion held by a relatively small number of entities highlights a concentrated interest in Ethereum’s future. Moreover, this trend suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s potential for continued growth, further solidifying the importance of these strategic Ethereum holdings . Who Leads the Charge in Institutional ETH Holdings? Delving deeper into these impressive figures, we find that nine of these firms individually hold more than 100,000 ETH. This concentration among a few key players is a testament to the scale of their investment strategies. The top three firms leading this charge in accumulating significant institutional ETH are particularly notable: Bitmine: Holding a staggering 833,100 ETH. SharpLink Gaming: Possessing a robust 521,900 ETH. The Ether Machine: With a substantial 345,400 ETH in its portfolio. These entities represent a significant portion of the overall crypto firm ETH on the market, showcasing a clear pattern of large-scale accumulation by strategic investors. Their actions often set a precedent for other market participants. Why Are These Ethereum Holdings So Significant? The accumulation of such large Ethereum holdings by these firms carries significant implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its long-term viability. When major crypto firm ETH allocations increase, it often indicates a bullish outlook and a belief in the future of the ETH supply . Secondly, these substantial ETH reserves can contribute to market stability. Large, long-term holders are less likely to engage in rapid selling, which can reduce volatility. Therefore, their presence helps to anchor the market, providing a foundation for organic growth. This strategic positioning suggests these firms are genuinely invested in the network’s success. What’s Next for Institutional ETH and the Market? The growing concentration of institutional ETH in the hands of a few large entities raises interesting questions about market dynamics. While it can reduce immediate selling pressure, it also means a significant portion of the ETH supply is not actively circulating. This can influence liquidity and price discovery in the long run. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Their decisions regarding these significant ETH reserves could have a ripple effect, impacting everything from network governance to future development initiatives. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the role of these major holders will undoubtedly remain a key area of focus for the entire crypto market. In conclusion, the substantial accumulation of over 3 million ETH by 64 strategic firms underscores a powerful trend of increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum. These significant Ethereum holdings by major players like Bitmine, SharpLink Gaming, and The Ether Machine highlight a long-term investment perspective that could foster greater market stability and signal a robust future for the network. As the crypto landscape matures, the strategic actions of these large holders, and their impact on the overall ETH supply , will continue to shape the trajectory of one of the world’s leading blockchains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are “strategic reserve firms” in this context? A1: Strategic reserve firms are entities, often institutional investors or large corporations, that hold significant amounts of cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, as a long-term investment or part of their treasury. They typically hold more than 100 ETH, indicating a strategic, rather than speculative, approach. Q2: How much ETH do these firms collectively hold? A2: According to Strategic ETH Reserve, 64 firms collectively hold approximately 3.04 million ETH, which is valued at over $10.87 billion. This represents about 2.52% of the total Ethereum supply. Q3: Which firms hold the largest amounts of ETH? A3: The top three firms identified with the largest Ethereum holdings are Bitmine (833,100 ETH), SharpLink Gaming (521,900 ETH), and The Ether Machine (345,400 ETH). Nine firms hold over 100,000 ETH each. Q4: What does this accumulation mean for Ethereum’s price? A4: Large-scale accumulation of ETH reserves by strategic firms often signals a bullish outlook. It indicates strong long-term confidence in Ethereum, which can contribute to market stability by reducing immediate selling pressure and potentially supporting future price appreciation. Q5: How does this affect the overall ETH supply? A5: When a significant portion of the ETH supply is held in strategic reserves, it means less of it is actively circulating in the market. This can impact liquidity and price discovery. However, it also positions these firms as influential stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem. Q6: Is this a bullish or bearish sign for Ethereum? A6: Generally, the accumulation of large Ethereum holdings by strategic firms is considered a bullish sign. It demonstrates strong institutional confidence, long-term commitment, and can contribute to market stability, indicating a belief in Ethereum’s future growth and adoption.

This trend may now slow down, Novogratz said. “We've probably seen the peak in treasury company issuance,” Novogratz said today at Galaxy Digital's second-quarter 2025 earnings call. “The question now is: Which of the existing companies will become giants?” The more friendly regulatory environment in the US has seen a surge in the number of crypto treasury companies in recent months. These companies raise funds through IPOs and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets on their balance sheets. While early-stage companies followed Michael Saylor's Bitcoin-focused model, newer startups have begun adding Ethereum, Solana, and other smaller-cap crypto assets to their portfolios. Novogratz noted that Ethereum already has two major institutional holders, Tom Lee's BitMine and Joe Lubin's SharpLink, and predicted continued growth. However, he added that new entrants may “have trouble breathing.” Galaxy Digital currently works with more than 20 crypto treasury investment firms. The company earns management fees by managing their crypto assets. Novogratz claimed that this collaboration has brought approximately $2 billion in assets to their platform, providing “recurring revenue.” Related News: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Significant Changes to Ethereum: Here's What Will Happen If They Are Accepted According to the company's second-quarter financial results, Galaxy earned net income of $30.7 million this year, compared to a loss of $177 million in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.08, falling short of analyst expectations. Novogratz sees crypto treasury companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way for hedge funds to enter the sector without directly owning tokens. In the long run, he believes traditional financial institutions will also transition to blockchain-based market structures. However, tokenization, the process of transferring traditional assets (such as stocks) to the blockchain, remains an unresolved issue. Novogratz cited the “Project Crypto” initiative spearheaded by SEC Chairman Paul Atkins as an example, noting that US markets are being explored for potential blockchain migration. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal’s main goal is to protect Brazil’s reserves from foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks while also promoting blockchain innovation. So far, it attracted both support and criticism from top officials. This move is also part of the global trend that was started by a US executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Bitcoin is rising, with Michigan’s State Retirement System increasing its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF holdings to $11.3 million and maintaining a strong Ethereum position. Public pension funds, including Wisconsin’s $321 million Bitcoin bet, are helping fuel a surge in crypto ETF inflows, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to new highs. Brazil Considers Bitcoin Reserve Plan Brazil is moving closer to potentially becoming the next nation to embrace Bitcoin. On Aug. 20, the country’s House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing to discuss a bill that proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. The proposal was originally introduced in November of 2024, and its main goal is to allow up to 5% of Brazil’s treasury funds—approximately $15 billion based on the Central Bank's $300 billion reserve —to be allocated to Bitcoin. Scheduled hearing The hearing is expected to include participation from at least six prominent institutions, including the Central Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Finance, representatives from fintech companies, the traditional banking sector, and a crypto advocacy group. According to the bill, the purpose of the reserve is twofold: to safeguard the country’s international reserves against foreign exchange volatility and geopolitical risks, and to encourage the development and adoption of blockchain technologies across both public and private sectors. While the proposal has received some support, it also caused debate. Pedro Giocondo Guerra , chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, voiced strong backing for the initiative earlier this year by calling Bitcoin “the digital gold” and asserting that the debate is crucial to Brazil’s long-term economic prosperity. On the other hand, critics are a bit more cautious. Nilton David , Brazil’s central bank director of monetary policy, argued that including crypto assets in the country’s foreign reserves would be inappropriate. This move by Brazil is part of a global trend that was started by US President Donald Trump’s March executive order to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Since then, countries like Kazakhstan revealed similar plans. Others like India and Sweden are also rumored to be exploring the idea. Currently, the countries with the largest Bitcoin holdings include the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador. Whether Brazil joins their ranks will depend on the outcome of the upcoming legislative process. Michigan Pension Fund Bets Bigger on Bitcoin It is not only countries creating Bitcoin stockpiles. Michigan’s State Retirement System made a big move into the digital asset space by increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal that by the end of Q2 2025, the pension fund owned 300,000 shares of ARKB. This is a large jump from the 110,000 shares it held the previous year. At press time, these shares were valued at approximately $11.3 million based on ARKB’s current trading price of $37.72, assuming no shares have been sold since the last disclosure. State of Michigan Retirement system holdings (Source: SEC ) The ARKB ETF, which is one of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC in January of 2024, provides direct exposure to Bitcoin, simplifying institutional investment into the asset. In addition to its Bitcoin stake, Michigan’s pension fund also holds 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), a position that is worth around $9.6 million. This ETH allocation stayed steady since September of 2024, which indicated that the fund has long-term confidence in both of the leading cryptos. Michigan is also not alone in this trend. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed a much larger Bitcoin investment of $321 million through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale’s GBT. This all suggests that there is a growing appetite among public pension funds for cryptocurrency exposure. This institutional came as Bitcoin ETFs continue to thrive in 2025. In fact, the sector experienced over $1 billion in net inflows on two consecutive days in mid-July. That inflow streak helped propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $123,000. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: BitBo ) Altcoins have not been left behind, as Ethereum ETFs are also gaining good traction. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF became the third-fastest fund to surpass $10 billion in assets under management. On-chain data from Dune Analytics shows that Ether ETF holdings surged by over 40% in the past month alone, which fueled a sharp rally in Ethereum’s price to above $3,800 in July—more than doubling in value since early May.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 05:30:00

This move signals a growing interest in bridging traditional finance with digital assets, especially from established tech companies. It is certainly a moment that captures the attention of anyone keen on the evolution of digital currencies. What is a USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? A USD-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, typically fiat currencies like the USD, or commodities like gold. Stability: Offers predictability in a volatile market. Utility: Facilitates transactions, remittances, and savings. Bridge: Acts as a crucial link between traditional finance and the decentralized world. NHN KCP’s recent actions highlight the increasing demand for reliable digital payment solutions. Their proposed stablecoin, named USDW, aims to serve these needs. NHN KCP’s Strategic Move: Introducing the USDW Stablecoin According to reports from Herald Business, NHN KCP has formally filed trademark applications for USDW. These filings were submitted to the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) on July 17 and July 29. This initiative follows a series of earlier trademark registrations. In June, the company secured 11 related trademarks for won-pegged stablecoins. The addition of a USDW stablecoin signifies a broader ambition to cater to both domestic and international markets. It suggests a comprehensive strategy to embrace the potential of digital currencies fully. Implications for the South Korean Stablecoin Market and Beyond NHN KCP’s foray into a South Korean stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar carries significant implications. It could bolster the country’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation. Furthermore, it might pave the way for wider adoption of digital assets in everyday transactions. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Adoption: A stable, reliable digital currency could encourage more businesses and consumers to use cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: A USD-pegged stablecoin simplifies international transactions, offering lower fees and faster processing. Regulatory Clarity: Such high-profile projects often prompt clearer regulatory frameworks, benefiting the entire industry. This move by NHN KCP, a subsidiary of a major tech firm, reflects a growing trend where established entities explore the practical applications of blockchain technology. It underscores the potential for a new era of digital currency use. The Future of Digital Currency and Stablecoins The global interest in stablecoins continues to surge. Governments and private entities worldwide are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued stablecoins. This trend is driven by the desire for efficient, secure, and transparent financial systems. NHN KCP’s proactive steps with the USD-pegged stablecoin USDW position them at the forefront of this evolution. Their strategy could inspire other traditional financial and tech companies to explore similar ventures. It certainly highlights the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. The future of payments is undeniably digital, and stablecoins are set to play a crucial role. Conclusion: A Landmark Step for Digital Finance NHN KCP’s trademark filings for the USDW stablecoin mark a significant milestone. It’s not just about a new digital asset; it’s about a major South Korean tech firm committing to the future of finance. This development could accelerate the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, offering a stable and efficient medium for digital transactions. As the digital economy continues to expand, such initiatives are vital in shaping its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is NHN KCP? A1: NHN KCP is a subsidiary of NHN, a prominent South Korean tech company. It is known for its payment gateway services and is now expanding into digital assets. Q2: What is the USDW stablecoin? A2: USDW is the proposed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin for which NHN KCP has filed trademark applications. It aims to maintain a stable value against the USD. Q3: Why is NHN KCP developing a USD-pegged stablecoin? A3: The company is likely developing USDW to provide a stable digital asset for transactions, potentially for both domestic and international use, leveraging the stability of the U.S. dollar. Q4: How does this relate to their previous won-pegged stablecoin filings? A4: The USDW filings follow earlier registrations for won-pegged stablecoins. This suggests a broader strategy to offer stable digital currencies pegged to both local (won) and international (USD) currencies, expanding their market reach. Q5: What impact could USDW have on the South Korean market? A5: USDW could enhance the adoption of digital currencies in South Korea by offering a stable and reliable option for payments and remittances, potentially leading to clearer regulatory guidelines for stablecoins.

SOL is moving sideways around the $160 mark, and DOGE is holding near $0.20 but showing little sign of a breakout. For many investors, that’s a cue to start looking beyond the usual names—toward altcoins with more energy, fresh narratives, and potential for meaningful growth. That shift in focus is bringing more attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin. As traders rotate out of DOGE and SOL, many are being drawn to MAGACOIN’s unique positioning—one that combines cultural relevance with a strong community ethos and anti-centralisation values. XRP Rebounds as Traders Look for Clarity and Conviction Interest in XRP isn’t just rising because of market hype—it’s about timing. With growing chatter around a possible breakthrough in the SEC case, some investors see XRP as well-positioned if regulatory clarity finally comes through. The network itself is still active, too—over a million new users joined in July, and transaction volume remains near the top of the charts. Even so, XRP isn’t the only name on traders’ watchlists. As the altcoin landscape shifts, so do portfolio strategies. Investors are paying closer attention to projects that offer more than just price movement—especially those that combine solid fundamentals with a strong community and a story that resonates. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Shift As a meme-powered cryptocurrency and decentralized political memecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the more talked-about newcomers in the space. Its focus on community governance, anti-centralization values, and a distinct ideological identity is resonating with traders—especially those from the SOL and DOGE camps who are starting to reconsider where they put their capital. Momentum around the project has been building. On-chain data shows a clear uptick in wallet activity, accumulation trends, and online engagement. Some are already drawing comparisons to the early growth trajectories of DOGE and SHIBA INU, with bullish forecasts suggesting MAGACOIN could deliver gains of up to 18,900%. It’s still early days, but the project’s appeal goes beyond tech. There’s a growing cultural relevance to what MAGACOIN represents—and in today’s crypto market, that kind of resonance can be just as powerful as the code behind it. Looking Ahead: Traders Want More Than Price Movement Whether or not XRP breaks past $3.12, or Solana and DOGE reclaim their previous highs, one thing is clear—traders are chasing more than just performance. Investors are on the lookout for altcoins with the potential to replicate massive gains and high returns. So far, MAGACOIN FINANCE has benefitted from the capital shift—not as a competitor to the top players, but as an indicator of where the market is headed.

49621457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780079,1754458257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49621457.jpeg,Beijing is still discussing consolidation plans with chip companies.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/beijing-stumbles-in-chip-merger-ivdre/,"Beijing is grappling with setbacks in its plan to turn a disjointed chip industry into a few powerhouse firms that can stand up to global competition. According to sources, the Chinese government has been discussing with key chip equipment manufacturers to consider a state-led merger that would pool their technologies. However, talks have derailed as companies and investors clashed over the proposed ownership setup and valuation. Lee says a merger could help China reduce its dependence on US firms Amid US efforts to limit China’s access to semiconductors, Beijing is pushing to reinforce its domestic chip industry , with the National Development and Reform Commission at the helm of the merger talks. Still, Beijing has a long way to go, especially with corporations and investors clashing over how the merger should be structured and valued. One person familiar with the talks commented, “There were too many split interests. The prospective sellers don’t want to sell at a loss, and the buyers don’t want to pay a premium.” Another insider confirmed that negotiations were still in progress, although he noted that a full-scale consolidation was becoming increasingly improbable. Meanwhile, analysts like Edison Lee, a semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, maintain that consolidation would aid the country in creating its own self-sufficient ecosystem and phase out reliance on US companies such as Applied Materials and Lam Research. Currently, 26 semiconductor acquisitions have been announced in 2025. The highest-profile deal so far is the merger between Hygon, a CPU designer for servers and data centers, and supercomputer maker Sugon. Their deal is valued at over $16 billion and will be completed via a share swap. Analysts are concerned that consolidation may not work to Beijing’s expectations Beijing is also aiming for more targeted financing for firms through mergers. According to Lin Qingyuan, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein, authorities have realized that fragmented investment fails to deliver the scale required for profitability. As a result, they’re focusing on developing a handful of globally competitive national champions. However, there are still concerns about whether consolidation would work to improve the country’s chip industry. An investor even explained that many of the companies up for sale have no true technological moat and thus, without a strategic plan, any acquisition attempt would likely fail. Lin also pointed out that most companies best equipped to acquire underperforming assets are often the first to reject them over concerns about the asset’s weaknesses and high price tag. Nonetheless, a widening range of industries, including real estate and textile equipment manufacturing, are beginning to explore acquisition opportunities in the chip sector. However, despite the growing enthusiasm, not all deals reach completion. Based on Wind data, eight mergers or acquisitions announced this year have collapsed. For instance, the Empyrean Technology, a leading Chinese EDA firm, announced in March its intention to acquire smaller competitor Xpeedic to expand its toolset. But the deal was scrapped last month due to unresolved disagreements over terms. Additionally, Zhejiang Aokang, a leather footwear manufacturer, and Ningbo Cixing, a knitting machinery specialist, have recently withdrawn from proposed semiconductor acquisitions due to valuation disputes. However, analysts have noted that most asset owners are unwilling to accept below-book-value offers even with deteriorating financial metrics, making consolidation and acquisition strategies unfeasible.

This week, the buzz surrounds a major development from BitBridge Capital Strategies , a prominent firm specializing in Bitcoin investment strategies. They are setting their sights on a prestigious Nasdaq listing , a move that could reshape how traditional finance views digital assets. BitBridge Capital Strategies Targets a Groundbreaking Nasdaq Listing BitBridge Capital Strategies, a firm dedicated to creating long-term shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC, recently made headlines with its ambitious plans. The Block reported that the company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This potential Nasdaq listing marks a significant milestone, indicating growing confidence from traditional financial markets in crypto-focused entities. Before their full Nasdaq debut, the company’s shares will commence trading on over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This pre-listing phase is slated for the end of the third quarter, offering early access to interested investors. The move highlights a calculated approach to entering the public market, building momentum and visibility for their unique Bitcoin investment approach. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Crucial for Bitcoin Investment Firms? A Nasdaq listing for a firm like BitBridge Capital Strategies provides immense benefits. It offers enhanced liquidity for shareholders, greater transparency through stringent regulatory oversight, and increased investor confidence. This exposure on a major exchange can attract a broader institutional and retail investor base, validating the firm’s strategic Bitcoin investment focus. Such a listing also elevates the perception of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance. It demonstrates that crypto-centric businesses can operate within established regulatory frameworks, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital to flow into the digital asset space. This move is a testament to the growing maturity of the crypto market. Strategic Focus: Maximizing Shareholder Value with BTC-Collateralized Loans BitBridge Capital Strategies emphasizes its core mission: generating sustained shareholder value through strategic investments in BTC. As part of this effort, the firm plans to introduce an innovative BTC-collateralized loan product. This offering aims to allow clients to borrow traditional currency using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral, providing flexible financial solutions without liquidating their BTC. The introduction of a BTC-collateralized loan product is a smart move in the evolving crypto finance landscape. It addresses a key need for crypto holders seeking liquidity while maintaining their long-term Bitcoin investment positions. This service could become a significant revenue stream and a cornerstone of their value creation strategy, appealing to a diverse set of investors and institutions. Navigating OTC Markets: A Key Step Before the Big Debut The decision to trade on OTC markets initially is a strategic and prudent one. OTC markets facilitate direct trading of securities between two parties, outside of formal exchanges like Nasdaq. This period allows BitBridge Capital Strategies to establish a public trading history, gauge market interest, and comply with various regulatory requirements before a full exchange listing. Trading on OTC markets provides an interim stage for the company to refine its public operations and attract initial investors. It’s a crucial step in their journey towards becoming a publicly traded entity on a major U.S. exchange, building anticipation for the eventual Nasdaq listing . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? The planned Nasdaq listing by BitBridge Capital Strategies signals a broader trend of institutional adoption and integration within the cryptocurrency space. As more crypto-native firms seek public market exposure, it further legitimizes the industry and bridges the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This development could inspire other Bitcoin investment firms to explore similar avenues, fostering greater capital flow and innovation across the sector. The expansion into services like the BTC-collateralized loan also highlights Bitcoin’s evolving utility beyond just a store of value. It showcases how firms are creating practical, yield-generating solutions that can attract traditional investors looking for new financial instruments. This is an exciting time for anyone watching the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, indicating a robust future for institutional crypto engagement. In summary, BitBridge Capital Strategies’ ambitious move towards a Nasdaq listing, preceded by strategic OTC trading and bolstered by its focused Bitcoin investment strategy and innovative loan products, marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market and its undeniable integration into the global financial system. This development is certainly one to watch closely.

Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-to-drop-before-the-real-move-analyst-forecasts-new-highs-in-q3/,"As Solana (SOL) attempts to reclaim a crucial level, a market watcher forecasted a massive rally for this quarter. However, some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency will retest the range lows soon. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer Solana Nears Crucial Level On Tuesday, Solana surged 9.6% from the recent lows, driven by the start of Solana Mobile’s global shipments of the Seeker, its second-generation Web3 smartphone, to over 50 countries. The news propelled the altcoin to a multi-day high of $171, fueling bullish sentiment among investors before its price retraced to the mid-zone of its local range. Notably, SOL has been hovering between the $140-$180 range since the April-May breakout, attempting to reclaim the local high for the past three months. During the June correction, SOL momentarily lost its local range lows, retesting the $120-$130 zone as support. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed its range amid the July rally, briefly breaking out of the upper boundary and hitting a five-month high of $206 two weeks ago. Since then, Solana has seen a 25% correction from the highs to the mid-zone of its local price range, currently trading between the $160-$164 levels. Amid its recent performance, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted SOL’s most crucial levels, based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) indicator. According to the chart, the key support area for the altcoin is around the $165 mark, where the largest supply cluster is with 44.4 million SOL, or 7.42% of the supply. As a result, Solana must reclaim the $165 level soon, or it will risk turning this key level into a key resistance, leading to further downside. Nonetheless, if this level is reclaimed, then the altcoin would have to retest the crucial resistance levels around $177 and $189, where investors have also accumulated 27.6 million and 23.6 million SOL, respectively. SOL Preparing For The ‘Real’ Run? Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted Solana’s recent price action, asserting that SOL is “quietly trending higher” with higher lows and turning resistance levels as support. The market watcher forecasted that Solana would reach a new all-time high this quarter, as he doubts “the train stops anytime soon” once it finally breaks out of the $200 resistance. Meanwhile, Crypto Batman suggested that the altcoin will see another correction soon. To the analyst, Solana could have a 10% drop to its four-month ascending support line, which sits around the $150 level, before “the real move.” Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has bounced from this support line twice, in April and June, before rallying to local highs during the May and July price breakouts. Related Reading: Cardano Marks Historical Milestone With Governance Vote, Hoskinson Reacts Similarly, analyst Ted Pillows asserted that SOL could see a significant rally this year despite the recent underperformance, as network activity remains strong. He predicted a 10%-15% correction, affirming that “a dip towards $140-$150 before reversal is highly likely to happen.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $$163, a 3.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

Affiliates today look for stable systems, clear payouts, and full control of their earnings. Waiting weeks for payments or trying to figure out complex charts no longer works. This guide lists the 7 best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms in 2025, based on what really matters: steady income, easy tracking, and fast withdrawals. Whether you run a small blog or a high-traffic site, picking the right crypto platform can shape your success. Let’s look at who actually delivers and who falls short. Spartans: Easy-to-Track Payouts With Real Speed Spartans ranks highest among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms because it focuses on what matters: results you can see and money you can access. While other sites create multi-level systems or delay approvals, Spartans keeps things clear and fast. It gives you simple choices with CPA, RevShare, or Hybrid deals. There are no extra steps, no hidden conditions. What makes Spartans stand out in the list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms is that it uses its own crypto system to send your affiliate payouts fast. Once you earn, the payment goes straight to your wallet in seconds. You get real-time updates on how many players you referred, what they bet, and how much you made. The dashboard is mobile-ready and easy to read without any extra help. With more than 5,900 games, 43 providers, and a full sportsbook tied to one wallet, every referral is worth more. With regular promotions like a Lamborghini giveaway and strong deposit deals, the conversions stay high. That means more steady commissions. Spartans remains the top pick for affiliates who want simple terms, fast payments, and full control. Stake.com: Strong Traffic, But Complex Payout Rules Stake.com attracts affiliates with its huge traffic, wide crypto coverage, and global brand name. It has a smooth affiliate portal and several commission options. Still, it uses a tier system where your payout depends on hitting set levels, not just activity. It also has longer approval steps and delayed payouts, especially for new users. Stake works well for large affiliates with steady volume, but smaller partners may find it harder to keep pace. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Stake requires more effort to unlock top rewards. BC.Game: Fun Platform With Tracking Challenges BC.Game is well-known for its gamified betting site and wide crypto choices. Its affiliate setup allows both CPA and revenue share, and in-site bonuses can raise your referral earnings. However, its tracking tools are less accurate than what top sites offer. Some affiliates have also faced tracking errors or slow help from support. While it can still work for those familiar with the brand, it takes more time to manage. BC.Game still earns a spot on this list of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms. Roobet: Great Brand, Slower Payout Timing Roobet is a popular name thanks to its fun live games and strong branding. Its affiliate plan pays through revenue share, with rates increasing based on referred player activity. But Roobet’s payments are not instant and follow fixed dates. You often need to send invoices or reach out for updates, which slows your growth. Still, for affiliates with audiences who enjoy Roobet’s style, the site remains useful. As one of the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, Roobet’s main challenge is payout speed. Bet365: Trusted Brand, Limited Crypto Support Bet365 stands out for its strong reputation in online betting. Affiliates in fiat-based markets get good commissions and broad reach. But the site is not built for crypto, and payments go through banks instead of wallets. This might feel slow for those used to digital payouts. Still, Bet365’s brand strength can bring steady returns. Within the group of best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms, it offers reliability even if crypto tools are limited. Betano: Stable Option in Local Markets Betano performs well in some licensed areas, with a loyal user base, especially across Europe. It has a working affiliate system and pays on time, though it lacks in-depth tools and detailed tracking. Affiliates focused on crypto markets may find its fiat-first setup less useful. But for those in allowed regions with sports-focused traffic, it’s still a dependable choice. Betano’s inclusion in the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms list comes from its local strength. Gamdom: Appeals to Streamers, Needs Oversight Gamdom is a modern site that attracts younger players and stream viewers. It supports crypto, has a clean design, and features some rare games. Its affiliate plan is built more around reward codes and engagement than standard CPA or RevShare. Some users report success, while others see tracking problems or slow replies from support. If your audience is into streaming or eSports, it might work, but close tracking is important. Gamdom still finds a place among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms for its niche value. Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Affiliate Platform Crypto affiliates in 2025 want steady income, not just big names. Some sites focus more on brand than real tools. Spartans stands out by offering fast payouts, simple terms, and easy-to-read dashboards. Stake.com and Roobet give reach, but their systems can feel slower or harder to follow. If you want to grow affiliate income with less stress, Spartans offers what’s needed. Among the best affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms , it brings speed, support, and clarity to the front.

With growing adoption of RippleNet and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), combined with increasing anticipation around upcoming U.S. regulatory updates, XRP recently broke through the $3.00 mark, showing its strongest performance in over a year. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is also benefiting from broader institutional interest, as spot ETFs and corporate treasury moves help drive demand. Both XRP and ETH are showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. But while XRP and ETH are drawing in the big money, retail investors and early adopters are shifting their focus to a rising star with even more upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new altcoin gaining major traction in early August 2025. XRP Surges as SEC Decision Looms XRP is currently trading between $3.00 and $3.05, after a sharp surge in early August. In just one minute, XRP recorded a massive $33 million trading volume spike, breaking past the psychological $3 barrier. Multiple factors are fueling this rally. The U.S. SEC is expected to submit a key status update by August 15, which could provide long-awaited regulatory clarity. This legal development is widely seen as a potential game-changer that could propel XRP to the next price tier. Analysts are watching a bullish falling wedge pattern, which historically signals an impending breakout. Price targets for August range from $3.12 to $4.00, with medium-term forecasts stretching as high as $5.53 if the bullish scenario plays out. Ethereum Maintains Strength as Institutions Shift Focus ETH has seen a 49% surge in trading volume over the past 24 hours, reflecting a spike in institutional and corporate interest. Recent developments show that major firms are buying ETH for their treasuries, including SharpLink and others now holding more than $5 billion in Ethereum. This marks a strategic shift, as companies look beyond Bitcoin for long-term blockchain exposure. As the network celebrates its 10th anniversary, mainstream analysts are recognizing Ethereum’s evolution from an experimental blockchain to a core part of global financial technology. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with projections of continued growth if historical August trends hold. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Fresh Capital Ripple’s aggressive push into the global banking sector has reignited interest in XRP, especially as institutional adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves. But while XRP may see solid gains, many early investors are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. This emerging altcoin is gaining momentum fast thanks to its innovative DeFi features, strong community backing, and deflationary tokenomics. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 32x returns in the next bull cycle, especially for those getting in early during the presale phase. It’s quickly becoming a top pick for high-growth altcoin investors. Final Thoughts: A Market on the Move Ripple’s growing presence in global finance and the upcoming SEC report are pushing XRP toward its most bullish setup in years. Ethereum is holding strong with institutional support and ETF inflows. And while the top coins continue to lead, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building momentum in the background—possibly setting the stage for the next breakout success story. With hype building and early momentum on its side, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly being seen as one of the most explosive altcoin opportunities of the year.

He mentioned that the U.S. was preparing federal financing tools to support AI tech exports to approved countries. “The next trailblazing breakthrough will be made with and on American technology, and to fully harness them, you will want America’s AI infrastructure already in place.” – Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. China has always rallied against alleged U.S. surveillance and the administration’s efforts to limit its tech industry. The country’s cyberspace administration summoned Nvidia representatives last week to discuss U.S. efforts towards incorporating location-tracking to its H20 chips. Beijing is also worried about semiconductor sanctions designed to counter the country’s AI companies, such as Huawei Technologies and DeepSeek . The Trump administration plans to remove export restrictions on Nvidia’s chips to China as part of a trade agreement to secure sales of rare-earth minerals to the U.S. Nvidia mentioned on Tuesday that it distances itself from any backdoors or kill switches in its chips, noting that they undermine trust in U.S. technology. The company argued that using backdoors, kill switches, or spyware doesn’t mirror the company’s systems, which are built on trust. Kratsios also championed China’s AI action plan, saying that each country should set its own standards for regulating artificial intelligence. The country’s AI action plan includes forming a global organization to devise governance and technology standards. The White House official also believes the U.S. model will be the most attractive since it puts innovation first. U.S. charges Chinese nationals in Nvidia chip smuggling The FBI arrested two Chinese nationals on Saturday on charges alleging they knowingly exported to China tens of millions of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence ( #AI ) applications, in violation of the Export Control Reform Act. Details: https://t.co/Z05cXhQsg4 pic.twitter.com/Y1yC5aJQwm — FBI Los Angeles (@FBILosAngeles) August 5, 2025 The White House also acknowledged that it’s still working to mitigate the smuggling of chips to China. Kratsios said he’s not yet confirmed from either Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices about the exploration of location-tracking capabilities. The U.S. has also charged two Chinese nationals with smuggling millions of dollars’ worth of advanced Nvidia chips to Beijing. The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang illegally exported Nvidia GPUs to China from October 2022 to July 2025. The DOJ referred to export records, which showed that the duo orchestrated around 21 shipments to companies in Malaysia and Singapore through their California-based company, ALX Solutions. According to the report, the 28-year-olds allegedly exported a shipment of Nvidia H100 chips in December 2024 without the necessary licence from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Prosecutors also found that ALX Solutions received payments from companies in Hong Kong and China. Records showed that the firm received roughly $1 million from a China-based company in January 2024, instead of the company taking delivery. The DOJ also found incriminating evidence last week from ALX Solution’s office and Geng and Yang’s phones, including communications about chip shipments to China through Malaysia. The duo could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if convicted under the Export Control Reform Act.

Despite a minor dip of 0.43%, big money continues flowing in. Galaxy Digital just reported a Q2 profit of $30.7 million, bouncing back from a $295 million Q1 loss. The turnaround was driven by a strategic boost in BTC holdings, now totaling 17,102 BTC (worth roughly $1.95B), up from 13,704.

Trading activity might’ve slowed, but Galaxy’s Global Markets arm still clocked a 28% profit rise. Meanwhile, its Helios data center ramped up capacity, showing bullish infrastructure investment. Most importantly, Galaxy actively accumulated 4,272 BTC in Q2 alone. That kind of accumulation squeezes supply, and that could be a strong long-term tailwind for Bitcoin prices. Cango Mines 650 BTC in July, Up 44% MoM Cango, a Chinese firm formerly in auto loans, is now a full-blown Bitcoin miner—and growing fast. In July, it mined 650.5 BTC, a jump from 450 in June, powered by a $256 million Bitmain rig investment. With a hashrate of 32 EH/s, it’s now one of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin holders globally, sitting on 4,529.7 BTC ($512M).

Since April, Cango has mined over 1,600 BTC, showing both momentum and commitment. Their move reinforces institutional trust and strengthens BTC’s long-term supply absorption, especially noteworthy for a company based in a country known for strict crypto crackdowns. Trump’s Crypto Order Adds Political Tailwind Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order protecting crypto companies and conservative groups from “debanking.” The move targets Operation Chokepoint 2.0—allegedly used to cut off banking access to crypto firms. BREAKING: Trump is getting ready to sign an executive order that will fine banks for debanking crypto companies. No more ""operation chokepoint"" in the US! pic.twitter.com/Yp19BhAmph — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 5, 2025 The order pushes federal agencies to investigate potential violations and calls for reviews of regulations that might’ve enabled discrimination. While legal experts debate its enforceability, the broader message is clear: more political support for crypto access. If successful, this could improve funding and liquidity for the crypto space, opening doors for increased investor confidence, and potentially pushing Bitcoin higher in the long run. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Struggles Below $115K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin remains trapped below the descending trendline and the 50-EMA at $115,440—both acting as dynamic resistance. The recent rejection near $115,400, with small-bodied candles and spinning tops, signals indecision. RSI hovers at 46—bearish bias remains intact. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Unless bulls reclaim the $115,440 zone, BTC risks slipping toward key support levels: Immediate support : $112,178 Next support : $110,663 Deeper support : $109,060 On the upside, breaking above $115,440 could open targets at $116,912 and $118,878. Trade Setup: Entry: $113,800 Stop-loss: $115,600 Target 1: $112,180 Target 2: $110,660 This short setup favors bears unless BTC breaks above the 50-EMA and trendline.

Today, we are diving deep into the BTC perpetual futures market, specifically examining the crucial 24-hour long-short ratios . These ratios offer a powerful lens through which to view current crypto market sentiment , helping traders and investors make more informed decisions. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? When we talk about long-short ratios in BTC perpetual futures , we are referring to the proportion of long positions (bets that the price will rise) versus short positions (bets that the price will fall) on a given exchange over a specific period. This data is derived from open interest and trading volumes, providing a real-time snapshot of trader sentiment. For instance, if the long ratio is higher, it suggests a bullish bias among traders, expecting Bitcoin’s price to increase. Conversely, a higher short ratio indicates a bearish outlook. Monitoring these ratios is a key component of effective Bitcoin futures trading strategy. Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour Data: A Snapshot of Crypto Market Sentiment Let’s examine the recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across major exchanges: Total Market: Long 48.11%, Short 51.89% This overall figure suggests a slight bearish tilt in the market over the past day, with more traders positioned for a downside move in Bitcoin’s price. It indicates a cautious, perhaps even pessimistic, crypto market sentiment . How Do Top Exchanges Compare in Derivatives Data Analysis? Looking at individual exchanges provides a more granular view: Binance: Long 47.86%, Short 52.14% Bybit: Long 48.28%, Short 51.72% Gate.io: Long 48.05%, Short 51.95% Interestingly, all three top exchanges reflect a similar trend, with short positions slightly outweighing long positions. Binance shows the strongest short bias among the three, while Bybit is marginally less bearish. This consistency across major platforms strengthens the indication of prevailing bearish sentiment. Understanding these subtle differences through careful derivatives data analysis can offer insights into the trading behavior dominant on each platform. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Trading Strategy So, what can you do with this information? While long-short ratios are not a standalone trading signal, they are a vital piece of the puzzle. Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Market Direction: A sustained trend in long-short ratios can signal a potential shift in market direction. If shorts continue to dominate, it might suggest further downward pressure. Identify Potential Reversals: Sometimes, an extreme imbalance can precede a reversal. If everyone is short, who is left to sell? This could lead to a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly rise. Confirm Your Bias: Use these ratios to confirm or challenge your own trading bias. If you are bullish but the market’s collective short bias is strong, it might be wise to re-evaluate your position or manage risk more tightly. Incorporating this derivatives data analysis into your overall strategy can significantly enhance your understanding of the market’s pulse. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting Long-Short Ratios While invaluable, interpreting long-short ratios requires caution. They are not foolproof. For example, a high short ratio could mean that many traders are hedging their spot positions, rather than purely speculating on a price drop. Also, liquidity and volume on specific exchanges can influence their individual ratios. Therefore, it is crucial to combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a holistic view of the crypto market sentiment and future price movements. In conclusion, the latest 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios reveal a prevailing cautious, slightly bearish sentiment across major exchanges. By understanding these dynamics and integrating them into your broader analysis, you can sharpen your Bitcoin futures trading decisions and navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. How are long-short ratios calculated? Long-short ratios are typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or by expressing each as a percentage of the total open interest) on a given exchange over a specified period. Why is it important to monitor crypto market sentiment? Monitoring crypto market sentiment, often reflected in long-short ratios, helps traders gauge the collective mood of the market. This insight can indicate potential price trends, identify overbought or oversold conditions, and inform trading strategies. Can long-short ratios predict price movements accurately? No, long-short ratios alone cannot accurately predict price movements. They are an indicator of current sentiment and positioning. Traders should combine this data with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and other on-chain metrics for a more comprehensive market outlook. Are these ratios the same across all exchanges? While general trends might be similar, the exact long-short ratios can vary between exchanges due to differences in trader demographics, liquidity, fee structures, and trading volumes on each platform.

The Tom Lee-chaired firm holds 833,100 ETH worth almost $3 billion, according to EthStrategicReserve. Speaking on the Natalie Brunell podcast on Tuesday, Lee said there was no conflict between Bitcoin treasuries and Ethereum treasuries because they were both scarce (comparing them to Tesla and Palantir stocks). The first “killer app” for crypto has emerged and is seeing widespread adoption, and that is stablecoins, he said. Wall Street is running to tokenize its entire system on the blockchain, and it requires smart contracts, he said before adding: “The biggest and most secure blockchain with no downtime is Ethereum, and it’s legally compliant.” The top three Ethereum treasury firms now hold 1.7 billion ETH, which equates to around 1.4% of the total supply.

Key Takeaways: Indonesian officials are exploring Bitcoin as a potential national reserve asset. Discussions included using local renewable energy for Bitcoin mining to boost economic growth. Bitcoin education was highlighted as a priority for long-term adoption and financial literacy. In an X post shared Monday , the group said it was invited to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country’s long-term financial stability. Among the key proposals discussed was leveraging Bitcoin mining as a tool for building national reserves—a concept rarely entertained at the government level. Indonesia Seriously Weighs Bitcoin to Strengthen Economy “Yes, seriously,” the group emphasized, noting that Indonesia is considering how Bitcoin might strengthen its economy over time. The discussion also touched on expanding mining infrastructure and launching education programs focused on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. With a population exceeding 280 million and a GDP of roughly $1.4 trillion, Indonesia ranks as the fourth most populous nation and the 16th largest economy in the world. Bitcoin Indonesia argued the country could tap into its rich geothermal and hydroelectric resources to power Bitcoin mining operations, pointing to other nations that have successfully turned similar strategies into job creators. The meeting was held with special staff from the office of Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka, and included bullish projections from figures like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. His forecast of Bitcoin potentially reaching $13 million to $49 million by 2045 was part of the pitch to showcase Bitcoin’s long-term value. Bitcoin Indonesia also pushed for education-focused initiatives to build broader public understanding of the asset. BIG NEWS: Indonesia is exploring Bitcoin as a national reserve.

What we discussed could shape the future of Indonesia’s economic strategy. pic.twitter.com/QGKgGRRgEU — Bitcoin Indonesia (@bitcoinindo21) August 5, 2025 One official from the Vice President’s office appeared to echo the importance of financial literacy, reportedly stating that “Indonesia must also continue to educate about Bitcoin in the future.” While the idea of adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset is gaining momentum globally amid fears of inflation and rising debt, Indonesia’s macroeconomic picture may not necessitate such urgency. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at a manageable 39%, and annual inflation as of January 2025 is well contained at 0.76%. MEXC Backs Indonesia’s Crypto Exchange Triv As reported, MEXC Ventures has taken a strategic bet on Indonesia’s growing crypto market, investing in crypto exchange Triv at a $200 million valuation. The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia’s updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. In Indonesia, crypto is permitted for investment but not for payments. The market is growing rapidly. Crypto transactions in 2023 topped 650 trillion rupiah (around $40 billion), and user numbers across licensed platforms have surpassed 20 million, outpacing the country’s stock market participation. Indonesia’s annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023.

This was spurred by profit-taking as the digital asset had risen to levels not seen before back in July 2025. However, this recovery does not mean that Bitcoin is completely out of the water, especially given the fact that it has retraced to a level that would be considered bearish at this point. Bearish FVG Could Send Bitcoin Price Crashing In an analysis, crypto analyst Kamran Asghar revealed that the Bitcoin retrace could only be temporary and short-lived as it has moved back into a bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG). This comes after a small bounce from $112,000 toward $115,000, with this bearish FVG lying between $114,000 and $115,500. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest This fair value gap had been created following the price crash from $118,000, suggesting that the Bitcoin price would be looking to fill it again. Additionally, this level acts as a major supply zone, meaning that bulls would have to turn up the buying if the Bitcoin price is to cross this level without issue. Given the fact that the bearish FVG and the supply zone are riding ahead of the cryptocurrency, it shows that there is a lot of resistance building at this level. Kamran suggests that the next move after hitting this supply zone would be a rejection from this level, leading to a further beating down of the price. How Low Could BTC Go? In the event of a hard rejection, the crypto analyst sees the Bitcoin price tumbling further downward into mid-July levels between $107,500 and $109,000. This would mean another 5% crash for the Bitcoin price before it is able to find support. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The silver lining of this possible crash is the fact that Bitcoin has major support at this level. Thus, Bitcoin bulls could stage a rebound using this level as the next lift-off point for a recovery. Due to this, the crypto analyst warns investors to keep an eye on the digital asset to see how it reacts at this level. Interestingly, at this time, the Bitcoin funding rate is still positive, Coinglass shows. What this means is that traders believe that the digital asset is still in a bull market, and more investors are betting on the price continuing to rise from here. However, the positive funding rate has seen some decline in the month of August, suggesting a slowdown among bulls.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says conditions are now ripe for the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised down the job growth figures for June from 147,000 to 14,000. “I think the data is just catching up to what we already know. The labor market has been soft, so I think it’s a positive setup because now the Fed has more ammunition to make a dovish pivot in the fall, and it’s not too late because we know the thing that they’re going to stimulate is the housing market… So that is what strengthens the economy in 2026. So I think it’s quite a positive setup, we’re just consolidating, and then we make a bigger move higher.” According to Lee, the Fed now needs to shift its focus from inflation to unemployment amid the softness in the labor market. He also notes that if the Fed removes housing market data from its calculations, inflation would be below 2%. “I think when they look at their dual mandate, they’re probably drifting further from the employment metric now because the unemployment rate, if you use the existing participation rate before the [recent] report, it’s almost 5% now. So the Fed now has to be considering the risk of the jobs market going into a cycle of weakening.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The surge in onchain activity pushed stablecoin transactions to $1.5T , which marked a new all-time high for the sector. The total transaction volume went up 19% compared to the previous month. The new legislation provides greater clarity on stablecoins and other digital assets, thus easing institutional and retail fears about the sector and boosting adoption. We can also expect some of the new retail attention to expand to other altcoins on Ethereum. Read on for the full context and the best crypto to buy amid the stablecoin and altcoin boom. Stablecoin Volume Hits New ATH at $1.5T Sentora Research revealed in its latest report that the transaction volume of stablecoins broke the $1.5T mark in July. This surpasses the previous ATH of $1.4T set in August last year, and marks a considerable rebound from the $1.26T recorded in June, 2025. Circle’s $USDC stablecoin led the market in July with over $748B, which accounts for nearly 50% of the total volume during the period. Meanwhile, Tether’s $USDT came in second with $420B, or 28% of the volume. The surge in stablecoin activity can be attributed to the signing of the GENIUS Act into law on July 18. This provided the regulatory framework for stablecoins, which boosted their stability and trust among consumers. But it isn’t just the stablecoin sector that will benefit from added clarity on digital assets. This impacts the crypto market at large as investor confidence grows and crypto onboards more users. As capital rotations could shift from stablecoins to assets with an upside, other top trending cryptocurrencies and even emerging altcoins could get more attention from retail investors. In fact, some emerging altcoins are already booming in pre-market, having raised millions from early adopters. Here are some of the freshest examples. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Trading Bot Project Helping You Flip Crypto the Easy Way Snorter Token ($SNORT) is currently beta-testing a Telegram trading bot that helps users sniff, snipe, and lock in profits with automated commands. Think about it: the crypto market is vast and confusing. Finding new opportunities is notoriously difficult. You also need to do ample research just to avoid getting scammed by the hundreds of rigged tokens coming out every day. The user-friendly Snorter Bot, which will be compatible with the Ethereum, Solana, and Base networks, could take care of it all. It automatically detects and grabs the top new performers, helping you get ahead of other bots and whales. For peace of mind, Snorter Bot also detects and blocks scams like honeypots and rug-pulls. When the project goes live, its native $SNORT token will ensure exclusive holder access and voting rights within the ecosystem. $SNORT is currently on presale for only $0.1003. It also offers dynamic staking rewards, currently at 155% APY, for those who want to multiply their tokens passively. The Snorter fundraiser has already stacked an impressive $2.8M from early buyers, and the price is going to go up again today. If the trading bot sees the expected traction upon release, the $SNORT token could reach $0.94 in late 2025. Visit the official Snorter Token website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility Token Behind the Most User-Friendly Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of an emerging digital crypto wallet. Currently on presale, the token is a fundraising project for the development of Best Wallet . Whether you want to hold Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins, or meme coins, you need a secure place to store them. This is where Best Wallet comes in. It’s a crypto wallet for your iOS and Android device that makes it convenient to store, sell, swap, and trade cryptocurrencies, even as a complete beginner. It also comes with a ‘Token Launchpad,’ where you can find other crypto presales before they hit exchanges. When out and tradable, the $BEST token will give holders exclusive benefits within the wallet ecosystem: Reduced transaction fees, Voting rights on key project decisions, Staking benefits in the upcoming staking aggregator. Priced at $0.025445 and already sitting on $14.5M raised on presale, the $BEST token is one of the early opportunities with a functional project already live. To learn more about $BEST’s growth potential, we suggest reading our Best Wallet Token price prediction . Or visit the Best Wallet Token presale page for more details. 3. Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) – Viral Meme Coin with the Fastest-Growing Flash Presale Bitcoin Penguins ($BPENGU) brings something different. It’s not a flashy tech project like $SNORT or $BEST – just a purely meme-based project, inspired by the famous Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. Its main goal is community building, with a target of 10M holders and over $10B in fully diluted market volume by Q4, 2025. Right now, the $BPENGU token is undergoing a flash presale , having already raised over $2M in just 8 days. The ICO runs from July 28 to August 27, with the first listing scheduled 72 hours after the presale ends. There are also 15 price milestones, with the token’s price increasing by 5% on each stage. $BPENGU is currently priced at $0.00128. Taking a page from Pudgy Penguin’s success, Bitcoin Penguins also has a roadmap that includes toy manufacturer partnerships. This is planned in Q4 2025, after $BPENGU hopefully reaches its price target of $2 and announces its BTC/BPENGU trading pair. The Age of Stablecoins is Here With the stablecoin market volume hitting a new ATH in July, it’s safe to say that things will only go up from here. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, investors and consumers now have more confidence to hold and trade stablecoins. This can also have a positive impact on the altcoin market as a whole, including some of the emerging utility projects on Ethereum, such as Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) .

While the community is excited for what might be the end of the lawsuit, some are spreading misinformation about the current state of the lawsuit and its potential end. Bill Morgan, a well-known community member and attorney closely following the proceedings, has corrected these false assertions, explaining Judge Torres’ current role, the next move the SEC needs to make, and what the XRP army should expect. Morgan Says Judge Torres’ Role Has Ended A recent thread on X suggested that Judge Analisa Torres still has a pending role in resolving the case and that a decision from the court is imminent. Morgan explained that contrary to these claims, Judge Torres has already completed her responsibilities in the matter. However, the appeal itself remains formally unresolved because neither party has yet finalized the necessary joint dismissal. Morgan clarified that both parties had earlier signed a conditional agreement to dismiss their respective appeals. Still, the conditions were not met, as Judge Torres rejected their joint motion for an indicative ruling that would have put that settlement agreement into effect. The contains inaccuracies.

We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 August 15 Is Not a Final Deadline The upcoming August 15 date has been widely referenced as a potential turning point in the case. While it is true that both parties are expected to file a status update with the appellate court by that date, Morgan emphasized that this is not a legal deadline for resolving the appeals themselves. Rather, it is a reporting obligation to inform the court about the current status of the appeals. “Dismissal of the appeals may happen, and is more likely to happen than not, before the 15 August deadline,” Morgan noted. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has also stated that the SEC will likely file its dismissal before that date , but emphasized that it is not a deadline. Morgan also left open the possibility that the parties might request another extension. While Morgan sees an additional extension as unlikely, he acknowledged that the litigation has already defied expectations multiple times. He concluded that nothing should be assumed with certainty until formal steps are taken. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The voting architecture is three-phased: an open nomination round that advances the top ten to a live or recorded debate stage; a follow-up ballot a week later to determine the final three; and a concluding vote one week after debates. “The final vote will be final,” the post states. Candidates must create public profiles, and while anyone can self-nominate, the foundation reserves a veto right; the winner must complete KYC with the foundation and sign an NDA “as you would expect in any state.” Kusama proposes a token-weighted mechanism across the ecosystem, writing that “1 token = 1 vote” for “any and all of the ecosystem tokens,” a design explicitly intended to align outcomes with holders who “have the most skin” in the project’s success. While emphasizing openness, the document asks the community to “rigorously vet, check and learn about all candidates.” The role described for the interim president is sweeping. The office holder would coordinate the transfer of power, steward the “Shib Paper” vision, and stand up the first congress—“consisting of the four Dao councils,” the inter-branch DAO envisaged in prior materials. The post underscores the stakes by putting a number on what’s being overseen, citing responsibility to a community of millions and “the financial responsibility of a 7 billion dollar token.” Governance plumbing also gets a notable tweak. The document proposes shifting the Economic Council under the Shib DAO rather than Treat, freeing Treat “to focus on innovation.” The council would shape how Shib “makes and retains revenue or a treasury system (outside the other daos),” described as “vitally important to the long term success of the project.” In parallel with the procedural outline, Dhairya’s message sought to keep the Shiba Inu community unified around the broader ecosystem rather than splintering initiatives, inviting exploration of new ideas under the Shib umbrella. “Elections are the first step,” he wrote, urging contributors to “think differently and collaboratively.” The team says logistical specifics—dates and precise timings for nominations, debates and balloting—will follow, and stresses that its own role shifts with this handover. “Upon the release of this document, our role will shift,” the post notes, adding that the group will continue building alongside Treat DAO and external initiatives aligned with its vision.

49625931,https://cryptonews.com/?p=404408,1754465823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49625931.jpeg,"Base Network Releases 33-Minute Outage Report, Said Caused by Sequencer Handover Failure",https://cryptonews.com/news/base-network-releases-33-minute-outage-report-said-caused-by-sequencer-handover-failure/,"Base network released a detailed postmortem revealing that its August 5 outage lasted 33 minutes, not the initially reported 19 minutes, caused by a failed sequencer handover in the network’s high-availability cluster. The Coinbase-backed Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain experienced a block production halt from 6:07 UTC to 6:40 UTC when an automated system called Conductor failed to transfer control between sequencer instances properly. Automated Failover System Backfires During High Activity Period The incident began when the active sequencer fell behind due to on-chain activity, triggering Conductor’s automated handoff to a backup sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and couldn’t produce blocks, while Conductor wasn’t fully enabled on the replacement system to initiate another handoff. Base’s monitoring systems detected the issue at 6:09 UTC, leading to a formal incident declaration by 6:12 UTC. @base network suffers 19-minute block production halt before recovery as token creation surge overtakes Solana with 54,000 daily launches testing infrastructure limits. #Base #Solana https://t.co/e3CJPMQE1m — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 The team manually paused Conductor and transferred leadership to a healthy sequencer, taking several minutes to ensure no blockchain reorganization occurred during the recovery process. The outage impacted deposits, withdrawals, block production, and Flashblocks functionality during Base’s unprecedented growth period. The network recently overtook Solana in daily token launches, reaching 54,000 new tokens on July 27, driven by creator coin integration through Zora and Farcaster platforms. Simple Breakdown: When the Traffic Controller Failed Think of Base network like a busy highway system where sequencers are traffic controllers managing the flow of transactions. Source: Mirror To prevent problems, Base operates multiple traffic controllers in a backup system managed by a supervisor called Conductor. When the main traffic controller started falling behind due to heavy traffic, Conductor automatically tried to switch to a backup controller. However, the backup controller wasn’t ready for duty yet and couldn’t manage traffic properly. Typically, if a backup controller can’t handle the job, Conductor would quickly switch to another one. But in this case, Conductor itself wasn’t properly installed on the backup system, so it couldn’t make another switch automatically. This left Base’s highway without a functioning traffic controller for 33 minutes, preventing all transactions from processing. The technical team had to manually step in, pause the automatic system, and carefully switch control to a working traffic controller. The manual process took extra time because engineers needed to ensure switching controllers wouldn’t cause any transactions to be lost or duplicated. Once they confirmed everything was safe, they successfully restored normal operations. Infrastructure Challenges Plague Growing Blockchain Networks Base’s outage joins a pattern of infrastructure failures across major blockchain networks as they scale to accommodate mainstream adoption. Recent incidents included Sui’s hour-long crash , TON’s six-hour disruption during DOGS token demand, and Solana’s repeated five-hour outages throughout 2024. It can be said that the traffic controller failed due to a large volume of traffic, coinciding with Base’s explosive growth in creator economy applications, where social posts automatically generate tradable tokens. Daily token launches surged from 6,649 on July 1 to approximately 50,000 by month-end, with 1.6 million tokens created and nearly 3 million traders participating. Source: Dune Analytics Base’s institutional adoption has also accelerated with JPMorgan’s JPMD digital deposit token launch and Shopify’s USDC payment integration across 34 countries. In fact, with the network’s Flashblocks upgrade, block times have been reduced from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds, processing international transactions under $0.01. This has allowed Base’s creator economy to generate substantial trading volume through automatic token minting from social content. The network has expanded from 6,649 daily token launches to 50,000 within a month. The ZORA token, for instance, achieved $200 million market cap while notable creator coins reached valuations exceeding $485 million. However, security challenges accompanied this rapid growth, including the $2.5 million Arcadia Finance hack on July 15 through smart contract vulnerabilities. As a result, Coinbase responded with a $5 million bug bounty program targeting Base network components. Looking forward, Base has renounced its dedication to infrastructure improvements, ensuring sequencers can consistently perform well even during peak hours. The network will release updates to enhance testing and deploy fixes to strengthen automated system robustness and prevent similar handover failures.

A recent development from India serves as a stark reminder of this reality: Indian authorities have taken decisive action against a major fraudulent operation. They successfully executed a substantial asset freeze , targeting an individual behind a sophisticated Coinbase scam that defrauded countless users of their valuable crypto assets . This move underscores the growing vigilance of global regulators in combating digital financial crimes. What Led to This Crucial Asset Freeze by Indian Authorities? India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently announced a significant breakthrough. In an official press release, the ED confirmed the freezing of approximately $4.8 million in assets. These assets belonged to Chirag Tomar, identified as the mastermind behind a deceptive fake Coinbase website, along with his family members and associated entities. The ED conducted seizures of multiple properties and bank accounts located in Delhi. These actions were carried out under the provisions of the country’s Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA). This legislation empowers authorities to target ill-gotten gains from criminal activities, including those involving digital currencies. This aggressive enforcement highlights the determination of Indian authorities to tackle financial fraud head-on, especially when it involves the complex world of cryptocurrency. Unmasking the Massive Fake Coinbase Scam Chirag Tomar’s operation was not a small-scale endeavor. Reports indicate that he managed to steal an astonishing estimated $20 million in crypto assets over a period spanning from mid-2021 to late 2023. His method was deceptively simple yet highly effective: creating a fraudulent website that mimicked the legitimate Coinbase platform. Scammers often use such tactics, known as phishing, to trick users into divulging their login credentials or directly transferring funds. Victims, believing they were interacting with a trusted exchange, unknowingly handed over their digital wealth. This specific Coinbase scam demonstrates the pervasive nature of online fraud and the constant need for user vigilance. How Does the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) Combat Crypto Crimes? The Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) is a powerful legal tool in India, designed to prevent and control money laundering . In this case, it allowed the ED to trace and freeze assets acquired through the illegal proceeds of the Coinbase scam . The act enables authorities to: Investigate suspected cases of money laundering. Attach or freeze properties derived from criminal activity. Prosecute individuals involved in such illicit financial flows. The successful asset freeze against Tomar and his associates sends a strong message: illicit gains, even those in cryptocurrency, are not beyond the reach of the law. This case serves as a crucial example of how traditional financial laws are being adapted to address the challenges posed by digital currencies and their potential misuse for money laundering . Safeguarding Your Crypto Assets: Lessons from This Case This incident offers vital lessons for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. Protecting your crypto assets requires proactive steps and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Website Authenticity: Always double-check the URL of any cryptocurrency exchange or wallet you use. Scammers often use slight misspellings or different domain extensions. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts even if they have your password. Be Wary of Unsolicited Communications: Legitimate exchanges rarely ask for personal information or private keys via email or text messages. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics, phishing attempts, and social engineering tricks used by fraudsters. The vigilance of Indian authorities is commendable, but individual responsibility remains paramount in the decentralized world of crypto. A Resounding Message Against Crypto Fraud The freezing of $4.8 million in assets by Indian authorities linked to the fake Coinbase scam is a significant victory in the ongoing fight against cryptocurrency fraud. It demonstrates the increasing capability of law enforcement to track and recover illicitly obtained crypto assets , even across complex digital trails. This action not only brings justice closer for the victims of the scam but also serves as a powerful deterrent to other potential fraudsters engaged in money laundering schemes. As the crypto landscape evolves, so too do the methods of protection and enforcement, ensuring a safer environment for legitimate participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the “fake Coinbase scam” mentioned in the article? The fake Coinbase scam involved Chirag Tomar creating a fraudulent website designed to look exactly like the legitimate Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. This tricked users into entering their credentials or sending their crypto assets directly to the scammer. Who is Chirag Tomar, and what was his role? Chirag Tomar is the individual identified by India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) as the mastermind behind the fake Coinbase website. He is accused of stealing approximately $20 million in crypto assets through this elaborate scheme. What is the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA)? The PMLA is an Indian law that empowers authorities like the Enforcement Directorate to investigate, attach, and freeze properties derived from criminal activities, including those involving money laundering and financial fraud like the crypto assets stolen in this case. How much in assets did Indian authorities freeze? Indian authorities, specifically the Enforcement Directorate, froze approximately $4.8 million in assets belonging to Chirag Tomar, his family members, and associated entities as part of their investigation into the fake Coinbase scam. How can I protect my crypto assets from similar scams? To protect your crypto assets, always verify website URLs, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts, be suspicious of unsolicited communications asking for personal details, and continuously educate yourself on common scam tactics. Does this action by Indian authorities mean all stolen crypto assets will be recovered? While the freezing of $4.8 million is a significant step, it represents a portion of the estimated $20 million stolen. Recovery of all stolen crypto assets can be complex and depends on various factors, including the traceability of funds and the legal process. Did you find this article informative?

Pump.fun burns PUMP tokens to boost price Pump.fun has not sent out SOL to exchanges in a few weeks, instead accumulating the fees for a buyback and reward program. To date, Pump.fun has repurchased PUMP for 139,759 SOL, valued at over $23M. In the past few weeks, this helped PUMP inch up from its lows of $0.002 to $0.0034, following a boost from Bybit trading activity. For now, PUMP is still being sold by whales, as it retains a long list of early backers. Some early buyers are even selling at a loss to recoup some liquidity. Pump.fun aims to rebuild its reputation as the leading platform, as it recently recovered its top spot in terms of new tokens created. In the past 24 hours, Pump.fun deployed 15,031 tokens, while LetsBonk.fun stalled at 12,236 tokens. Other contenders are launching a few hundred tokens, with Bags Tokens achieving 2,569 token launches. Get seen where it counts.

Representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia recently met with officials from the Vice President’s office to present a proposal outlining how Bitcoin could contribute to long-term economic growth. In a statement shared on X, Bitcoin Indonesia revealed that their presentation focused on leveraging Bitcoin mining as part of a national reserve strategy. “Yes, seriously. [The country] is looking into how Bitcoin could fuel long-term economic strength,” the group emphasized. Their pitch included potential uses of the country’s rich hydroelectric and geothermal resources to power Bitcoin mining, with the aim of driving job creation and technological advancement. Indonesia, home to over 280 million people and the world’s 16th largest economy, is uniquely positioned to explore such innovations. While the country has maintained a conservative stance on cryptocurrency payments, its openness to reserve diversification suggests a complex but evolving policy landscape. Bitcoin’s Role in Mining and Education During the presentation, Bitcoin Indonesia also discussed the broader implications of embracing Bitcoin, including education and public awareness. A notable highlight was the inclusion of a long-term price prediction by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who forecasts Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045 in a base scenario — and potentially as high as $49 million under bullish conditions. Bitcoin Indonesia emphasized the need for education initiatives to ensure widespread understanding and adoption, a point reportedly supported by Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s office. Though the country’s macroeconomic indicators, such as a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio of 39% and stable inflation of 0.76% (as of January 2025), don’t present the same urgency as in other nations adopting Bitcoin for economic hedging, the proposal reflects growing interest in future-proofing economic reserves. Crypto Taxes Raised in Indonesia In contrast to the pro-Bitcoin reserve strategy, Indonesia’s Finance Ministry recently imposed higher taxes on cryptocurrency activities. Income tax on crypto sales more than doubled — from 0.1% to 0.21% for local exchanges, and from 0.2% to 1% for foreign platforms. Additionally, value-added tax on mining has also risen sharply from 1.1% to 2.2%. While the country has banned crypto payments since 2017, enforcement remains loose. In tourist-heavy areas like Bali, several businesses continue to accept Bitcoin, especially in real estate transactions.

Others include: The United States had around 200,000 Bitcoins in March 2025 Kazakhstan is currently looking to invest in Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain companies Bhutan still held on to $1.4B Bitcoin in reserves as of July 2025 Crypto adoption at the highest levels of power, and globally speaking, means the industry is bigger than ever before. More institutional and retail investors are seeing the appeal. And they’re coming for Bitcoin and altcoins alike. Michaël van de Poppe said August is typically a period of accumulation and dip-buying . And that’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) come into play. An innovative Layer-2 for Bitcoin, the presale has already raised over $7.2M and whales are rushing to buy. Brazil, Indonesia Conduct Stakeholder Meetings on Bitcoin Bitcoin Indonesia, Asia’s largest Bitcoin community, revealed via a post on X yesterday that it met with Indonesia’s Vice-President to discuss the country’s potential Bitcoin strategy. During the meeting, community leaders proposed Bitcoin mining as a national reserve strategy. They shared Michael Saylor’s $BTC price prediction for 2045 ($17.6M by 2045), which will coincide with Indonesia’s 100th year of independence. According to Bitcoin Indonesia’s post, the Vice-President was bullish on the ideas they presented. Even during global volatility, Bitcoin can be a save haven of long-term financial stability, they argued. Let’s also not forget that many US investors and institutions are starting to use Bitcoin as a hedge against the impending inflation in the country. While this is still early stage planning from Indonesia, we’re seeing this trend continue grow as more countries explore this strategy. That includes Brazil, which will meet with citizens on August 20 to discuss the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. It’s the first-ever crypto public hearing in the country after the introduction of a bill in November 2024. The bill called for the diversification of Brazil’s assets to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Several key figures will attend the meeting, including Diego Kolling, CEO of Bitcoin Strategy at Méliuz, and Rudens Sardenberg, Chief Economist at the Brazilian Federation of Banks. This shows crypto is receiving attention from the highest levels of authority in Brazil. And this can only increase hopes for crypto-positive legislation in Brazil in the near future. With so many countries gunning for Bitcoin and crypto, we foresee a bigger influx of investors looking for investment opportunities. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one project that might ride the hype wave due to its unique utility promises. Let’s discuss it below. Bitcoin Hyper: Delivering the Next Phase of the Bitcoin Ecosystem While there’s no toppling Bitcoin’s status as the number one cryptocurrency, the blockchain is currently plagued with issues that hinder its growth. These include slow transaction speeds (7 transactions per second), high fees, and limited scalability. These are understandable, though, since $BTC is the first of its kind, but it’s also true that a lot has changed in the crypto landscape since its launch in 2009. And modern times require modern solutions, as they way. The Bitcoin blockchain is arguably behind the times, especially given its lack of support for dApps and smart contracts. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. It’s a project aiming to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2 that will add Solana-level speeds, low transaction fees, and expanded capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these include support for GameFi, marketplaces, DAOs, and even NFT infrastructures (aside from dApps and smart contracts). The project has gained a lot of traction since its token presale began in May, and has already raised over $7.2M, making it one of the best presales of 2025. To support Bitcoin Hyper, you can buy its native $HYPER tokens via its official website . Each one only costs $0.01255, which makes this one of the best low cap coins in August. Alternatively, you can stake your tokens for 148% APY. When combined with our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction at $0.32 (+2,450%) for the end of 2025, the profit potential is quite high. For more information on how you can buy and/or stake your $HYPER tokens, be sure to read our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . National Bitcoin Reserve: Coming Soon To a Country Near You? With Brazil and Indonesia beginning to explore national Bitcoin reserves, it’s safe to say that this trend will spread like wildfire in the coming years. Thanks to the US government spearheading this initiative, there’s even more pressure for other countries to adapt or risk getting left behind. Bullish news about Bitcoin’s future is naturally beneficial to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and other related projects too. That’s because they’ll help pave the way for the world’s most valuable crypto to become more important than ever before. Remember to do your own research before you invest.

A significant Binance trading update has just hit the wires, directly impacting those involved in derivative markets. Major crypto exchange Binance has officially announced its decision to delist certain perpetual futures contracts, specifically targeting DEFI and MEMEFI tokens. This move is set to take effect on August 11 at 09:00 UTC, prompting traders to re-evaluate their positions. Understanding the Binance Delists Futures Decision Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, made a clear statement on its official website regarding the removal of the DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures contracts. For many traders, perpetual futures are a popular way to gain exposure to crypto assets without owning the underlying coin. They offer leverage and continuous trading without an expiry date, making them a staple in the derivatives market. The specific contracts being delisted are the DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures. This means that after the stated deadline of August 11, 09:00 UTC, users will no longer be able to trade these specific contracts on Binance’s futures platform. This is a direct action that requires immediate attention from anyone holding or planning to open positions in these particular assets. Why the DEFI Futures Delisting and MEMEFI Futures Binance Move? When an exchange like Binance makes such a move, it often signals underlying considerations. While Binance’s official announcement didn’t detail the exact reasons, delistings typically stem from several factors. These can include: Low Liquidity: If trading volume for specific contracts is consistently low, maintaining them can be inefficient for the exchange. Regulatory Compliance: Evolving regulations in various jurisdictions might necessitate changes to offerings. Market Performance: Prolonged poor performance or reduced interest in the underlying assets (DEFI and MEMEFI in this case) can lead to such decisions. Risk Management: Exchanges continually assess the risks associated with certain contracts, especially in volatile markets. Understanding these potential reasons helps traders contextualize the decision, even without an explicit statement from Binance. Navigating the Impact: What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Perpetual Futures? This Binance delists futures announcement has immediate implications for traders. If you currently hold open positions in DEFI or MEMEFI perpetual futures on Binance, you need to act promptly. The primary concern is to manage your risk and avoid potential forced liquidation or unexpected closures by the exchange. Key actions for affected traders include: Closing Positions: It is highly advisable to close any open DEFI or MEMEFI perpetual futures positions before the August 11 deadline. Monitoring Announcements: Stay vigilant for any further announcements from Binance regarding the delisting process or alternative trading options. Re-evaluating Strategy: Consider how this change impacts your overall portfolio and trading strategy. Diversification or exploring other perpetual futures contracts might be prudent. Ignoring this update could lead to unfavorable outcomes for your trades. Proactive management is key. Actionable Steps Before the Deadline: A Binance Trading Update Checklist With the August 11 deadline fast approaching, taking decisive action is critical. Here’s a brief checklist to help you navigate this Binance trading update : Identify Affected Positions: Log into your Binance Futures account and identify all open DEFI and MEMEFI perpetual futures positions. Plan Your Exit: Decide whether to close your positions manually or set stop-loss/take-profit orders to manage your exit automatically. Withdraw Funds (if necessary): After closing positions, consider withdrawing any funds associated with these contracts if you do not wish to reallocate them within Binance. Stay Informed: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements for any last-minute updates or clarifications. Remember, the goal is to manage your risk effectively and ensure a smooth transition away from these specific contracts. The Broader Picture for Crypto Perpetual Futures While this news specifically targets DEFI and MEMEFI, it highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto perpetual futures market. Exchanges frequently review their offerings to ensure market health, compliance, and user safety. Such delistings, while impactful for specific token communities, are part of an exchange’s ongoing operational adjustments. This event serves as a reminder for all crypto traders to always be aware of the terms and conditions of the platforms they use and to keep a close eye on official announcements. The crypto market evolves rapidly, and staying informed is your best defense against unexpected changes.

The company was previously valued at $300B after securing $8.3B for a second tranche of the $40B fundraising round led by SoftBank Group Corp. The stock sale was oversubscribed by nearly five times. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter said the company was targeting billions of dollars from the stock sales. The secondary sale is expected to raise more than last year’s $1.5 billion. OpenAI’s recurring annual revenue has grown to $12 billion since it launched ChatGPT in 2022, and it forecasts an ARR of over $20 billion in 2025. ChatGPT is dropping GPT-5 in August. Existing investors like Thrive Capital reportedly approached the company seeking to buy some of the shares set aside for employees. Preliminary talks with Brookfield Asset Management, JPMorgan, and Apollo Global Management have already taken place. However, none of the discussions have progressed into solid commitments. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently confirmed that SoftBank has committed $30 billion and has already invested $7.5 billion. The rest is due by the year’s end. OpenAI mixes private equity strategies Sources familiar with OpenAI’s private capital funding, who requested anonymity, said the ChatGPT maker was mixing up its fundraising strategy, targeting new and old investors. Dragoneer Investment Group, a San Francisco tech-focused fund, pledged $2 billion in what is allegedly to be the largest cheque written for a startup by one company. Other investors include TPG, T Rowe Price, and Blackstone through the private equity strategies fund it runs for wealthy individuals. Other Venture Capital participating in the last round include Coatue Management, Thrive Capital, Founders Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Fidelity Management, and Altimeter Capital. However, none of these companies has made any official statements or comments regarding the funding round. One AI analyst clarified that the secondary sale meant money was going to staff, not the company’s treasury. The deal would allow employees to cash out as OpenAI geared up for the GPT-5 release. The analyst believes “turning options into liquid cash” for the employees will keep the company’s ChatGPT core architects focused. OpenAI announced earlier this week that ChatGPT was almost hitting 700 million active users every week. Funding edges OpenAI closer to an IPO The money coming in is reportedly bringing OpenAI closer to an IPO. Large financial support is a prerequisite for the company to go public. The company said the funds will be used to expand infrastructure through a partnership with Oracle. SoftBank’s 2.77% stake also reinforces the company’s valuation and position ahead of the IPO. OpenAI’s last funding round was reportedly completed way ahead of schedule. One analyst suggested this was a “stepping stone” towards an IPO. The company’s CEO said the funding round signified confidence in AI’s future. He also mentioned that his company’s ability to achieve such a high valuation would set new enterprise value benchmarks in the tech space. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s CFO, also said the company’s over $13 billion restructuring investment from Microsoft brought it closer to a potential IPO. However, she pointed out that the company would go public “if and when” it wanted to. Friar confirmed that the IPO was not yet cast in stone. The OpenAI CFO added that her company and the market would have to be ready for it to launch on the stock market. “You can show up at the altar all ready to go, and if the market’s not ready for you, yeah, you’re just out of luck.” – Sarah Friar , CFO at OpenAI Friar believes that any company planning to go public should build a sustainable business structure backed by enough funds. She said public companies needed “some sense of predictability,” ambition, and appetite. Friar added that the market could only put up with “a certain level of unpredictability.” Forge data showed that OpenAI had raised over $61.9 billion in 11 funding rounds.

Why XRP Could Face A Deeper Correction In an X thread posted early Wednesday, Martinez opened with: “XRP may be headed for a deeper correction. Here’s why!” and pointed to a Tom DeMark Sequential sell signal on the three-day chart “right at the local top,” which he said “trigger[ed] the ongoing pullback.” His remarks follow a weekend note flagging $2.40 as the “next key support level to watch” after that three-day TD sell signal. Martinez expanded on market structure, arguing that while the $3.00 area has intermittently acted as support, historical accumulation patterns make $2.80 a temporary buffer, with “real support” beginning below $2.48—a zone he has mapped using on-chain positioning. Related Reading: XRP Price May Be ‘Controlled’ By This Market, Says Analyst He reiterated on Aug. 3 that “past accumulation behavior points to $2.80 as a temporary buffer for XRP, but real support begins below $2.48,” adding that the most consequential level on his dashboard remains $2.40. Independent coverage of his analysis echoed those thresholds, framing $2.80 as a light cushion with heavier demand pockets sub-$2.50. Flow data has added to the bearish case in the near term. Martinez said whales have offloaded over 720 million XRP, intensifying sell-side pressure in recent sessions; earlier, on Aug. 2, he specified that “whales have sold over 710 million $XRP in the past 24 hours!” That spike in large-holder distribution has been picked up by multiple market trackers and recaps over the past few days. He also flagged the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) signal turning sharply negative. “The MVRV ratio just flashed a death cross,” Martinez wrote, calling it “another sign that a steeper correction could be underway.” The post underscores the crossover as a warning of rising downside risk if short-term holders’ cost basis begins to overhang market value. While “death cross” language is more commonly associated with moving-average pairs, Martinez uses the term here to describe a momentum break in MVRV curves. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Flashes Death Cross: More Decline Ahead? The TD Sequential—a Tom DeMark-designed exhaustion model often used to anticipate trend reversals—has been central to Martinez’s view since late July, when he tracked a three-day “sell” print near the top of the latest rally leg. He has since framed the path of least resistance as lower unless the market can establish sustained closes back above the high-volume node near $3.00–$3.20, while on-chain profiles continue to privilege $2.48–$2.40 as the area of “real” demand. As he put it on Aug. 3: “The next key support level to watch is $2.40!” For now, Martinez’s roadmap rests on three pillars: an exhaustion sell on the 3-day TD Sequential, large-holder distribution in the hundreds of millions of XRP, and a bearish MVRV crossover, all of which he argues raise the probability of a deeper corrective leg toward the high-$2s and, if momentum deteriorates, the mid-$2s. Whether bulls can defend the shallower buffers near $2.80 may determine if XRP’s decline remains a garden-variety pullback or morphs into a larger reset toward his $2.40 magnet. At press time, XRP traded at $2.93.

Ripple shared news of this acknowledgment on its official X account, noting its inclusion among leading corporate contributors to the local community. Ripple’s Philanthropic Impact In the public statement, Ripple disclosed that the San Francisco Business Times had named it one of the region’s most active corporate philanthropists. This recognition reflects the company’s broad engagement with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, as well as its focus on promoting financial accessibility through technological innovation . Ripple also shared its 2024 Impact Report, which outlines the extent of its charitable initiatives over the past year. According to the report, Ripple supported over 70 universities and nonprofit organizations in 2024. More than half of these beneficiaries received multi-year funding commitments. Ripple’s philanthropic strategy includes allocating a fixed share of 1% of its profits to expanding access to financial services , particularly through blockchain technology. Ripple’s social engagement also extends to crisis response. In 2024, the company assisted communities impacted by natural disasters, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In those instances, Ripple donated XRP to relief organizations such as World Central Kitchen, which delivered aid to affected areas. These contributions are part of Ripple’s broader objective to apply blockchain-based solutions in support of both immediate relief and long-term development.

On the same day as Ripple’s announcement, Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, reported a notable transfer involving 20 million XRP ($60.5 million) from the South Korean exchange Upbit to an unidentified wallet. Large withdrawals from major exchanges are often associated with internal transactions, such as fund redistributions between exchange-managed wallets. Given the size of the transaction and the absence of further details, it has drawn speculation from market watchers, as the XRP ecosystem has recently seen notable whale activity . At the same time, XRP’s price has shown upward movement. After a recent decline to $2.74, the asset recovered most of those losses, briefly regaining the $3 level. The asset has dipped slightly, now trading at $2.93. However, it is still up almost 30% from last month. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In an era where information is both weaponized and walled off, the war over internet freedom is being fought not just in parliaments and courtrooms, but in code. And at the center of this digital battlefield lies a potent alliance: blockchain technology and mirror domains. Together, they’re rewriting the rules of access, permanence, and resistance in the face of rising global censorship. From decentralized file hosting to uncensorable domain systems, these tools offer more than just technical solutions—they represent a radical vision for a freer internet. But this vision is not without its challenges, controversies, and consequences. As governments clamp down harder and the web grows more fragmented, the intersection of blockchain, mirror domains, and censorship raises an urgent question: What’s really at stake? The Censored Web: A Growing Reality Across the world, access to the internet is being curated, filtered, or flat-out denied. Entire websites vanish at the stroke of a key. News portals go offline, independent voices are silenced, and activist platforms are rendered unreachable. In places like China, Iran, India, Turkey, and Russia, national firewalls and blacklists determine what’s seen and what’s not. Even in countries that claim to champion digital freedom, takedown orders, algorithmic suppression, and geo-restrictions are tightening control. What was once a global village now resembles a patchwork of gated communities. Mirror Domains: The First Line of Digital Resistance Mirror domains—replicas of original websites hosted under different URLs or IPs—have long been the first response to censorship. When a site gets blocked, a mirror pops up elsewhere, allowing users to continue accessing the same content. While effective, mirror domains face a cat-and-mouse game: governments blacklist mirrors as fast as they appear. Hosting providers, under legal pressure, pull the plug. DNS providers delist them. And so, the cycle continues. This is where blockchain enters the equation—not just as a technology, but as a philosophy. Enter the Blockchain: Building a Web That Can’t Be Shut Down At its core, blockchain is about decentralization and immutability—two qualities that strike at the heart of censorship. When applied to web hosting and domain management, it offers a fundamentally different architecture: Decentralized Storage : Platforms like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Arweave allow users to store website files across distributed nodes, removing single points of failure. Blockchain-Based Domains : Services such as Unstoppable Domains or ENS (Ethereum Name Service) enable users to create domain names that are stored on the blockchain itself, beyond the reach of traditional domain registrars or DNS authorities. Censorship Resistance : Once a site is hosted on IPFS and linked to a blockchain domain like .crypto or .eth, it’s nearly impossible to take down. There’s no central host to sue, no registrar to pressure, no DNS to hijack. “It’s not just about mirroring anymore,” says Sara Zhang, CTO of a blockchain infrastructure startup. “It’s about building websites that can’t be deleted. Period.” The Stakes: Freedom vs. Abuse Of course, with such power comes deep complexity. A truly uncensorable web can just as easily protect whistleblowers and journalists as it can shield hate groups, pirated content, or extremist propaganda. In a blockchain-powered internet, there is no moderator, no flag button, no authority to appeal to. And that’s where the ethical stakes rise. “The problem isn’t the technology,” argues Dr. Jonas Weir, a digital ethics scholar. “It’s that we haven’t collectively decided how to govern a space where nothing can be undone. The blockchain doesn’t forget. That’s powerful, but also dangerous.” Governments and rights organizations are now grappling with this dilemma. Should blockchain-hosted extremist content be tolerated in the name of digital freedom? Who bears responsibility when illegal material becomes permanently embedded across decentralized networks? Crypto-Anonymity: Fueling the Fire or Defending the Innocent? Anonymity is another double-edged sword. Blockchain transactions and domain registrations, particularly in privacy-centric networks, allow creators to remain untraceable. While this empowers activists under repressive regimes, it also enables bad actors to operate unchecked. The 2021 launch of blockchain-based dark web alternatives raised red flags globally, with many calling for new frameworks to distinguish between ethical resistance and criminal evasion. “We need decentralized accountability, not just decentralized access,” says Nisha Verma, a policy advisor with the Internet Governance Forum. “Otherwise, we’re just trading one form of control for another.” The Web3 Vision: A Censorship-Free Future or a New Wild West? Proponents of Web3—an internet built on blockchain principles—see this as the dawn of a more democratic digital age. Websites no longer hosted on central servers. Identities owned by users, not platforms. Monetization systems that bypass traditional gatekeepers. Yet critics warn that without regulation, Web3 may replicate the very power imbalances it seeks to dismantle—just under different banners. The tension is clear: the more uncensorable the web becomes, the more important it is to define ethical boundaries, technical safeguards, and global norms for its use. Conclusion: A Web Reimagined—But at What Cost? The intersection of blockchain, mirror domains, and censorship is more than a technical convergence—it’s a cultural crossroads. It forces us to rethink control, expression, permanence, and responsibility in an online world that is simultaneously expanding and fracturing. We’re no longer just asking whether we can build an uncensorable internet. We’re asking whether we should —and if we do, who ensures it serves the greater good? In the pursuit of digital freedom, blockchain may very well hold the keys. But the question that remains is: freedom for whom, and freedom at what cost?

BitBridge joins a growing list of public companies building Bitcoin treasuries. The firm also revealed plans to uplist to the NASDAQ, aiming to join the ranks of public companies leveraging Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, according to a Tuesday press release . Unlike many firms in the space, BitBridge emphasizes that it has no legacy operations and is entirely focused on expanding the Bitcoin economy. BitBridge Bets on Bitcoin Reserve and Sound Money Strategy BitBridge’s strategy centers on building a long-term Bitcoin reserve and introducing financial products that align with a sound money philosophy. The company also announced the upcoming launch of Respect Loan, a lending product that uses Bitcoin as collateral. Designed with multi-year terms and low interest rates, the program is intended to generate sustainable returns while avoiding the volatility typically associated with crypto-backed loans. To boost visibility, BitBridge plans to sponsor a high-profile college football team and launch an educational podcast hosted by CEO Paul Jaber. “BitBridge is positioned to bridge the gap between a declining traditional finance system and a thriving Bitcoin standard,” Jaber said in the release. The move follows a growing trend of companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, first popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy.

Novogratz Says Treasury Crypto Boom Has Peaked, Focus Shifts to Survivors Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes the wave of new crypto treasury companies has likely hit its peak , with attention now shifting to which existing firms can scale and dominate. Speaking during Galaxy’s Q2 earnings call, he said, “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” signaling a more competitive phase ahead. The boom in treasury-based crypto firms was fueled by favorable U.S. regulations, with companies like Strategy, GameStop , Trump Media , and SharpLink allocating reserves to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. However, Novogratz warned that saturation could make it harder for newcomers to gain traction, especially as Ethereum-focused treasuries like BitMine and SharpLink continue to expand. Galaxy Digital currently manages around $2 billion in assets for over 20 treasury-focused clients, generating steady fees in the process. The firm recently shifted its listing to Nasdaq and is exploring tokenizing its shares , part of a broader strategy to build blockchain-based financial infrastructure for institutional investors.

Satsuma Technology , a prominent UK-listed AI infrastructure firm, has successfully closed a remarkable funding round, securing an impressive £163.7 million ($217.6 million). This achievement not only significantly surpassed their initial target by a remarkable 64% but also boldly included a substantial Bitcoin investment as a core component of the raise. This strategic decision by Satsuma Technology underscores a rapidly accelerating trend of cryptocurrency adoption by established, forward-thinking companies, especially those operating at the innovative forefront of the artificial intelligence sector. What Makes This Funding Round Unique for Satsuma Technology? This recent funding round for Satsuma Technology stands out as particularly noteworthy in the current financial landscape. The company, which recently rebranded from Tao Alpha, managed to secure over $217 million, a clear testament to the strong investor confidence in its vision and capabilities. The list of prominent backers reads like a who’s who of leading venture capital and crypto-focused funds, including ParaFi, Pantera, DCG, and Kraken. Their involvement highlights the widespread interest in this pioneering AI infrastructure firm and its strategic direction. The most distinctive aspect of this raise is undoubtedly the direct acceptance of 1,097 Bitcoin (BTC) as a portion of the total funding. This significant acquisition boosts Satsuma Technology’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,125.85 BTC. For a UK company funding round of this magnitude to directly integrate a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin on such a substantial scale sends a powerful message. It clearly illustrates the evolving nature of corporate finance and the increasing willingness of public companies to embrace digital currencies as legitimate treasury assets. Why is Bitcoin Investment Gaining Traction Among AI Infrastructure Firms? The strategic choice by Satsuma Technology to make a significant Bitcoin investment is far from coincidental; it reflects a calculated alignment with their core business. AI infrastructure firms are inherently positioned at the vanguard of technological advancement, making the integration of digital assets a natural fit for their progressive ethos. Holding Bitcoin can serve several critical strategic purposes for such entities: Treasury Diversification: Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset class, potentially providing a hedge against traditional market volatility and inflationary pressures. It provides an alternative store of value outside of conventional fiat currencies. Strategic Alignment and Innovation: For companies deeply embedded in technology and innovation, embracing a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin perfectly aligns with their forward-thinking, disruptive culture. It signals a commitment to future financial paradigms. Future-Proofing Business Models: As global cryptocurrency adoption continues to expand and digital economies mature, having direct exposure to Bitcoin positions the company advantageously. It prepares them for a future where digital assets play an even more central role in commerce and finance. Operational Efficiency: In some cases, Bitcoin can facilitate faster, more cost-effective international transactions, which is beneficial for globally-minded tech firms. It is important to note that Satsuma Technology, under its previous name Tao Alpha, had already publicly announced its intentions to invest in Bitcoin. This pre-existing commitment underscores that this was a deliberate, well-considered strategy, not a reactive decision. This proactive approach by an AI infrastructure firm like Satsuma Technology highlights a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the digital future. What Does This Mean for Broader Cryptocurrency Adoption? The actions of a publicly listed and respected entity like Satsuma Technology , particularly its acceptance of Bitcoin as part of its substantial UK company funding , carries significant weight. It can profoundly influence the trajectory of broader cryptocurrency adoption . This move provides a compelling, real-world example for other corporations and institutional investors who may be contemplating similar strategies. This high-profile institutional endorsement not only lends considerable credibility to digital assets but also helps to normalize their inclusion in corporate balance sheets and financial operations. While the opportunities presented by Bitcoin investment are substantial, companies exploring this path must also navigate inherent considerations such as market volatility and the evolving landscape of regulatory clarity. However, the successful execution by Satsuma Technology demonstrates that with a clear vision, robust due diligence, and effective risk management strategies, these challenges are indeed manageable for pioneering firms. This development signifies a crucial shift: innovative companies are no longer merely observing the crypto space from the sidelines; they are actively participating and integrating it into their core financial strategies. This sets a powerful precedent for how future capital raises and corporate treasury management might evolve, increasingly blurring the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world. It’s a clear signal of maturation for the entire crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, Satsuma Technology’s impressive £163.7 million funding round, prominently featuring a significant Bitcoin investment , marks a truly pivotal moment for both the AI and crypto sectors. This event not only reinforces the increasing institutional confidence in digital assets but also paves a clearer path for greater cryptocurrency adoption , especially within the dynamic and rapidly evolving realm of AI infrastructure. This bold move by a leading UK company funding itself partly in Bitcoin is a resounding indicator that the future of corporate finance is undeniably and increasingly intertwined with the digital economy.

A massive USDC transfer , totaling nearly $700 million, occurred from the Binance exchange to an unidentified digital address. This monumental event, flagged by blockchain tracker Whale Alert, immediately raised questions across the crypto community. Unpacking the Recent Binance USDC Transfer Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain transaction tracking service, reported a staggering USDC transfer . Specifically, 698,990,107 USDC, valued at approximately $699 million, moved from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The destination? An unknown wallet address, shrouded in digital anonymity. This single transaction highlights the sheer scale of liquidity and activity within the stablecoin market. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1. This makes it a crucial asset for large-scale transfers, enabling significant value movement without price volatility. The Significance of a Large Crypto Transfer When such a large crypto transfer takes place, it’s natural for market observers to speculate on its implications. Transactions of this magnitude are not everyday occurrences, even on a bustling exchange like Binance. They often signal significant strategic moves by institutional players, high-net-worth individuals, or even exchanges themselves. Several possibilities exist for why such a substantial amount of Binance USDC would move to an unknown wallet: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional trades often happen off-exchange to avoid impacting market prices. Exchange Rebalancing: Binance might be moving funds for internal wallet consolidation or security purposes. Custodial Services: A large client could be moving funds to a personal or institutional cold storage solution. Strategic Investment: A major player could be preparing for a significant investment or acquisition. Decoding the Whale Transaction Phenomenon The term ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of digital assets. This recent movement certainly qualifies as a whale transaction . Crypto whales wield considerable influence due to their ability to move vast sums, which can sometimes impact market sentiment or even liquidity for specific assets. Understanding these large movements helps analysts gauge market sentiment. While the identity of the recipient wallet remains unknown, the sheer size of this particular crypto wallet transfer suggests a calculated and deliberate action rather than a casual one. Monitoring these whale activities provides valuable insights into potential future market trends or strategic shifts. Implications for Crypto Wallet Transfer Security The fact that nearly $700 million can be transferred in a single crypto wallet transfer underscores both the efficiency and the robust security of blockchain technology. Despite the unknown destination, the transaction itself was executed securely on the blockchain network, verifying the integrity of the transfer process. This event also subtly reminds us of the dual nature of crypto: while transactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, the identities behind wallet addresses can remain anonymous. This blend of transparency and privacy is a fundamental aspect of decentralized finance. Conclusion: Monitoring the Digital Tides The recent USDC transfer of nearly $700 million from Binance to an unknown wallet serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Such large-scale movements by crypto whales are always noteworthy, signaling significant activity that could influence future market developments. While the exact purpose of this particular transaction remains a mystery, it certainly keeps the crypto community vigilant and engaged, continuously monitoring these digital tides. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning one USDC is intended to always be redeemable for one U.S. dollar. It is fully backed by cash and short-dated U.S. government treasuries. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. It helps the crypto community monitor significant movements by large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Why are large crypto transfers significant? Large crypto transfers are significant because they often indicate major strategic moves by institutional investors, exchanges, or high-net-worth individuals. These movements can sometimes precede market shifts or reveal insights into market sentiment and liquidity. What does an ‘unknown wallet’ mean? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address whose owner or custodian has not been publicly identified. While the transaction itself is visible on the blockchain, the real-world identity behind the address remains private. Could this transfer impact the price of USDC? As USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, a large transfer of USDC typically does not directly impact its price. Its value is designed to remain stable at $1. However, it can indicate significant liquidity shifts within the broader crypto ecosystem. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Toncoin Hits Key Zone as Big Deal Looms,https://cryptopotato.com/buy-the-dip-toncoin-hits-key-zone-as-big-deal-looms/,"TL;DR Toncoin hits demand zone near $3.20 after 7% drop, signaling a possible short-term bounce. MACD and RSI indicators suggest selling pressure is weakening, hinting at potential price reversal. Verb Technology to rebrand and back TON with $558M, deal closes on August 7, 2025. Toncoin Pulls Back Toward Key Support Toncoin (TON) traded near $3.19 at press time, down around 5% over the past day and roughly 7% weekly. The token recently pulled back from the $3.70 area and is now moving into a support range between $3.30 and $3.20. This zone has acted as a base for past price movements. According to analyst Naveed, the current dip aligns with a key demand area. If the price holds, a short-term recovery could follow. A bounce from this zone may push TON back toward the $3.45 level. Continued strength could open the path toward $3.70 again. $TON is pulling back after reaching the $3.7 area Price is now around $3.3, and we could be heading into a strong support zone between $3.3 – $3.2 Wait for price to hit demand zone and look for signs of a bounce If that happens, it could be a good opportunity for a move HIGHER https://t.co/BZ1myNMROT pic.twitter.com/44YZ3wJACD — Naveed (@navex_eth) August 5, 2025 Indicators Show Early Signs of Support The 4-hour chart shows a previous break in structure near $3.45. The asset is now below this level, but still within range to reclaim it. There’s also a fair value gap between $3.32 and $3.50. If buyers return, this area may attract prices back toward higher levels. On the MACD, the blue line remains under the orange signal line. The histogram shows red bars, but they are shrinking, which suggests that selling pressure may be slowing. If a crossover happens, it could point to a shift in trend. Source: TradingVie w RSI sits at 33. This is close to oversold territory, which starts at 30. While not fully oversold yet, the reading shows that TON is nearing levels where buyers may begin to re-enter the market. A rise above 35 could hint at early buying strength. Verb Technology Shifts Focus to Toncoin Verb Technology, a public company known for its video tech and AI services, is rebranding to TON Strategy Co. (TSC). It has secured $558 million in capital through a private placement of 58.7 million shares at $9.51 each. This funding is allocated to build a reserve primarily made up of Toncoin. Meanwhile, Kingsway Capital is backing the strategy, and the deal is expected to close by August 7, 2025. If finalized, TSC would become the first publicly traded company to hold TON as a treasury asset officially. This shift marks a new approach, with a direct focus on Toncoin rather than more widely adopted tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Price Levels to Watch Moving Forward Analyst Ali Martinez points to $2.87 as a key support level, sitting just above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. Price stability around this area helps maintain the broader upward structure. On the upside, $5.30 is a level to watch, lining up with the 0.786 Fibonacci extension and a previous supply zone. If the existing support at $3.20-$3.30 remains intact, the price may head towards $3.45 level in the short term. A drop under $3.20 can set the stage for a decline to $3.02 or lower levels.

The latest launch represents the first concrete result of their collaboration, which was originally unveiled in February 2024. XRP Goes Live on BDACS In its tweet, BDACS stated that XRP is among the most widely held digital assets in South Korea, and the new custody support opens the door for institutions to engage with it in a secure, compliant manner. Ripple’s Ripple Custody platform, specifically designed for institutional-grade asset management, will underpin the storage and management of both XRP and Ripple’s enterprise-focused stablecoin, RLUSD. The development also follows BDACS’s integrations with Korea’s top crypto exchanges, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, which give institutions seamless access to the crypto asset across the country’s most liquid venues. The custodian had previously said that its collaboration with Ripple aligns with South Korea’s regulatory roadmap for digital assets, as outlined by the Financial Services Commission, which aims to accelerate institutional adoption. BDACS noted that its mission is not only to provide custody services but also to boost innovation on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), particularly in tokenization and stablecoin use cases. The move echoes market research, which predicted that crypto custody could manage up to $16 trillion in assets by 2030, with tokenized assets accounting for 10% of global GDP. Ripple’s Asia-Pacific managing director, Fiona Murray, said the partnership was indicative of a growing institutional demand amid shifting regulations in the region. Meanwhile, BDACS CEO Harry Ryoo had commented, “BDACS will provide a secure and reliable custody service to support Ripple’s pioneering blockchain initiatives. Ultimately, this partnership will enable both companies to enhance and expand the digital asset ecosystem.” Besides XRP, BDACS is already active in Busan’s blockchain regulation-free zone and has partnered with players like Avalanche and Polymesh. “Meme Coin” Label in USA Today Sparks Backlash As institutional infrastructure expands, XRP’s market performance has captured global attention. The asset recently surged over $3.6, and hit a new all-time high after a 500% rally since the US elections. However, a new USA Today article praising XRP’s utility and regulatory outlook has raised concerns. Historically, glowing mainstream coverage, especially from outlets like The Motley Fool, which influenced the article, has coincided with market tops. The article controversially calls XRP a former “meme coin,” a mischaracterization that stirred significant backlash. While media sentiment doesn’t always dictate price trends, such enthusiastic coverage has often preceded corrections. Given this pattern, some market watchers view the positive press as a potential top signal for the token in 2025.

The central bank’s policy rate decision also aligned with expectations from economists polled by Reuters. India’s Reserve Bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points during its previous meeting in June. The Bank’s Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, argued that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the previous 50-basis-point cut. India expects inflation to remain below 4% https://t.co/adYFVZbNQw — ReserveBankOfIndia (@RBI) August 6, 2025 India’s RBI has issued three consecutive rate cuts totaling 100 basis points since February, adding that its latest decision to switch from neutral to accommodative was unanimous. It also mentioned that its stance on monetary policy came due to easing inflation and rising global uncertainties. Analysts at Bank of America argued that New Delhi’s previous rate cuts saved the country’s markets. They believe that the RBI will only pause rates for now, but that could change if there’s a major shift in the macroeconomic outlook. The analysts also expect another rate cut this year – likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 – once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. Malhotra argued that volatile food prices have kept headline inflation much lower than projected earlier. RBI also warned that a 10% surge in crude prices could increase inflation by 20 basis points. India’s inflation reading in June hit a fresh six-year low of 2.1%, suggesting a possible rate cut. The Monetary Policy Committee expects India’s inflation for 2025 to remain significantly below the RBI’s target of 4%. The committee also estimates that food price volatility will cause a rise in inflation in Q4 of 2025. Malhotra said the MPC will determine the future trajectory of monetary policy by assessing the incoming data and economic projections. “On balance, the current macroeconomic conditions, outlook, and uncertainties call for continuation of the policy repo rate of 5.5% and wait for further transmission of the front-loaded rate cut to the credit markets and the broader economy.” – Sanjay Malhotra , Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. The RBI also kept its GDP growth forecast neutral, at 6.5% for the financial year ending March 2026. It also cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous estimates of 3.7%. India saw a surge in its GDP in the quarter ended March at 7.4%, which was higher than the Reuters poll estimates of 6.7%. India’s FY24/25 also registered an overall economic growth of 6.5% in line with the government’s estimate. India faces trade challenges and geopolitical uncertainties Malhotra argued that the central bank’s decision to maintain rate cuts came as New Delhi faces global trade challenges with the U.S. Earlier last week, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs and additional unspecified penalties on the country starting August 7. Trump condemned India for having energy deals with Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The President argued that the purchase of Russian oil helps finance Moscow’s war on Ukraine and that India didn’t care how many lives were lost in the war. He also believed that New Delhi was purchasing Russian oil and selling it on the open market for big profits. Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, Michael Kugelman, believes that Trump is trying to wean India off its autonomy policy by going after its ties with Russia. On Monday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs accused the U.S. and EU of double standards for having trade deals with Moscow. India revealed that its Minister of External Affairs, S Jaishankar, will visit Russia later this month. The country also disclosed that its National Security Adviser Ajit Doval landed in Moscow yesterday and Putin will also visit India later this year for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the majority of members are keeping interest rates steady, citing ongoing uncertainty from tariffs. As interest rate cut hopes continue to intensify in September, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan released his forecast. Speaking to CNBC, the BofA CEO talked about interest rate cuts and the economic situation in the US. The famous CEO stated that it is unlikely that the FED will cut interest rates this year. Moynihan stated that the decline in inflation was slower than expected and predicted that interest rate cuts would only begin next year. “Our economists predict that it will take longer for inflation to decline, and therefore I do not expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. At this point, it seems likely that the Fed will only begin cutting interest rates next year.” Finally, Moynihan added that he does not expect the US to enter a recession. FedWatch data shows a 90% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September. Investors are pricing in an 87.5% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the September FOMC meeting, according to CME FedWatch. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins are back in the red, with substantial price declines from the likes of XRP, SOL, HYPE, XLM, LTC, TON, and others. BTC’s Insecurity Continues The primary cryptocurrency’s troubles began last Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve refused to lower the key interest rates for the fifth consecutive time. BTC retraced by a few grand but bounced to $119,000 on Thursday. However, macro uncertainty, such as new tariffs and nuclear submarine movements, resulted in another, more painful nosedive. In just a few days, the cryptocurrency plunged by several grand and bottomed during the weekend at $112,000. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and started to push the asset north. The gradual ascent culminated yesterday when BTC briefly neared $116,000 but was stopped ahead of that resistance. In the following hours, bitcoin dropped to under $113,000 once again. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $114,000, with a market cap of just under $2.270 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins stands close to 60% on CG. BTCUSD.

BNB, TRX, and BCH are with minor losses, while XRP, SOL, DOGE , HYPE, XLM, and TON have dropped by more substantial percentages of up to 4%. Pi Network’s native token has dropped by 4% as well, and sits close to its all-time low once again, which was recorded at the end of the previous business week. BONK and PENGU have dropped the most from the largest 100 alts, losing 6-7% each. Litecoin’s LTC is down by 5% after yesterday’s impressive surge .

Matt Hougan says the market cap of Uniswap ( UNI ), which is approximately $6 billion, currently “feels too small.” “[Uniswap] would be the 400th largest financial services business in the world – roughly the same size as Storebrand, a savings and insurance business in Norway.” According to Hougan, regulatory uncertainty could be driving Uniswap’s current undervaluation, but that could change amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent initiatives to provide regulatory clarity for crypto assets. Per a Grayscale Research report released in late June, Uniswap is among the top-10 decentralized exchanges. Over six months ending on May 31st, Uniswap ranked third in terms of volumes. Uniswap generated $487 million in fees behind Solana-based decentralized exchanges Raydium, Meteora and Jupiter over that period. UNI is trading at $9.89 at time of writing, up by 36% over the past month and down by around 78% from the all-time high reached in May of 2021. Turning to Ethereum, Hougan notes that spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap recorded $5.4 billion in net inflows in July, the highest monthly net inflows ever. “When you consider Ethereum is 20% the size of Bitcoin, the scale of those flows really hits home. Imagine if Bitcoin ETFs did $27 billion in a month…” According to crypto ETFs tracker SoSoValue, the highest net inflows figure for spot Bitcoin ETFs was the $6.49 billion reached in November of 2024.

According to the ministry, misuse of such data could allow foreign actors to exploit Chinese citizens and conduct surveillance or infiltration activities against state institutions. The MSS pointed to a recent case involving an unnamed overseas company that allegedly scanned iris data worldwide under the guise of issuing cryptocurrency tokens, later transferring the data elsewhere. Authorities said this posed “a threat to personal information security and even national security,” highlighting the potential use of such data in espionage operations or long-term manipulation of digital identities. “Unlike passwords, biometric keys cannot be changed,” the MSS warned, calling for stronger public awareness and caution when engaging with platforms that request biometric input. Facial recognition was also flagged as “threat to national security,” if “improper storage” solutions lead to leaks. Officials cited instances where foreign intelligence services were able to use manipulated facial data in espionage. The MSS called for tighter oversight of how companies store, transmit, and protect collected biometric information, warning that poor safeguards could lead to massive leaks or deliberate misuse. Did China point fingers at Worldcoin? While the bulletin did not name any specific companies, the description appears to align with World (formerly Worldcoin), a project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Worldcoin collects iris data in exchange for its World (WLD) token, promoting what it calls a “proof of personhood” system aimed at distinguishing real humans from bots in a digital economy. Worldcoin has claimed that its operations span over 160 countries, although China is not among them. Its system relies on proprietary hardware called the Orb, which scans users’ irises to create unique digital identities. In exchange, users receive WLD tokens, which they can store or trade. Although Worldcoin promotes itself as a tool for digital inclusion and universal access to income, its use of biometric data has raised red flags among regulators in several countries. Kenya, for instance, suspended Worldcoin’s operations in 2023 after more than 300,000 people had signed up, raising alarms over how the project handled sensitive user data. Spain took similar action the following year, ordering the company to erase all stored biometrics after finding breaches of EU data protection laws. Other countries, including Germany, Portugal, Brazil , South Korea, Colombia, and Hong Kong, also moved to suspend or investigate Worldcoin’s operations, often citing non-compliance with local data protection regulations. Indonesia, one of the latest to intervene, froze Worldcoin’s operations earlier this year for failing to register its local entity as an Electronic System Operator. Authorities there labelled the project’s unlicensed activity a serious violation of domestic digital law. In Singapore, police opened investigations into individuals trading Worldcoin accounts, and have warned that accounts tied to biometric identities could be exploited for terrorism financing or money laundering. While Worldcoin and its parent entity, Tools For Humanity, have maintained that they are working with local regulators and prioritising transparency, critics argue that the project’s approach to consent and data handling remains insufficient given the sensitivity of biometric identifiers. Is there an alternative to Iris scans? As an alternative, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a concept called “pluralistic identity,” which avoids reliance on any single data source or verification method. Instead of enforcing a rigid one-person-one-ID system based on biometric scans, pluralistic models allow identity to emerge from multiple independent attestations, such as from governments, social networks, or even individual communities. Buterin and other supporters of decentralised identity systems argue that a multi-layered approach balances the need for authentication while preserving privacy.

While digital assets often grab headlines, shifts in major currency pairs like GBP/USD can signal broader economic trends, influencing everything from global trade to investor sentiment. Recently, a significant forecast from banking giant UBS has caught the attention of market participants: they anticipate the GBP/USD forecast to reach 1.40 by mid-2026. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential indicator of shifting economic tides between the UK and the US, and understanding its implications can offer valuable insights for diversified portfolio strategies. Understanding the GBP/USD Forecast : UBS’s Bullish Stance The GBP/USD currency pair, often referred to as ‘Cable,’ represents the exchange rate between the British Pound (GBP) and the US Dollar (USD). It’s one of the most actively traded pairs globally, reflecting the economic health and monetary policy divergence between the United Kingdom and the United States. UBS, a leading global financial services company, has put forth a notably optimistic GBP/USD forecast , projecting a rise to 1.40 within the next two and a half years. This target, if realized, would mark a substantial appreciation for the Pound against the Dollar from its current levels, signaling a potential reversal or significant strengthening trend. What’s Fueling the UBS Prediction ? Key Drivers Behind the Pound’s Potential Ascent UBS’s bullish outlook isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s grounded in a meticulous analysis of various macroeconomic factors. Several key drivers are expected to contribute to the Pound’s potential strengthening against the Dollar. Monetary Policy Divergence: A primary factor is the anticipated shift in monetary policy between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). While both central banks have been aggressive in raising interest rates to combat inflation, market expectations suggest the BoE might maintain a relatively tighter policy for longer, or at least be slower to cut rates compared to the Fed. Higher interest rates typically attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the local currency. Inflation Trends: The trajectory of inflation in both economies plays a crucial role. If UK inflation proves more persistent, compelling the BoE to keep rates elevated, while US inflation moderates more rapidly, allowing the Fed to ease policy, this divergence would naturally support the Pound. Economic Resilience: The relative economic performance of the UK versus the US is another consideration. Signs of greater resilience or unexpected growth in the UK economy, especially as it navigates post-Brexit challenges, could bolster investor confidence in the Pound. Conversely, any signs of a significant slowdown or recession in the US could weaken the Dollar. Global Risk Appetite: The US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. If global economic conditions stabilize or improve, leading to increased risk appetite among investors, the demand for safe-haven assets like the Dollar might decrease, allowing riskier currencies like the Pound to gain ground. To illustrate the potential divergence in economic indicators that could underpin this UBS prediction , consider the following hypothetical scenario: Economic Indicator UK Outlook (UBS Perspective) US Outlook (UBS Perspective) Interest Rates (BoE vs. Fed) Higher for Longer / Slower Cuts Earlier / More Aggressive Cuts Inflation Trend Persistent, Gradual Decline Moderating Faster GDP Growth Steady, Gradual Recovery Potential Soft Landing / Mild Slowdown Labour Market Tight, Wage Growth Pressure Cooling, but Resilient Navigating the Forex Market : Opportunities and Challenges for Traders A significant move in GBP/USD, as projected by UBS, presents both opportunities and challenges for participants in the Forex market . Opportunities: Long Positions: Traders who believe in the UBS forecast could take long positions on GBP/USD, aiming to profit from the Pound’s appreciation. Carry Trade Potential: If the interest rate differential between the UK and the US widens in favor of the Pound, carry trades (borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a high-interest currency) could become more attractive. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with exposure to GBP or USD could use this forecast to refine their hedging strategies, potentially reducing currency risk on international transactions. Challenges: Uncertainty and Volatility: The path to 1.40 is unlikely to be linear. Geopolitical events, unexpected economic data, or shifts in central bank rhetoric can introduce significant volatility, leading to sharp price swings. Policy Reversals: Central bank policies are data-dependent. A sudden resurgence of inflation in the US or an unexpected economic downturn in the UK could force policy reversals, invalidating current forecasts. External Shocks: Global events, such as new conflicts, commodity price spikes, or financial crises, can override domestic economic fundamentals and impact currency valuations unpredictably. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone looking to engage with the Forex market effectively, whether through direct trading or managing currency exposure in broader investments. What Does This Mean for the Pound to Dollar Exchange Rate? Broader Implications The potential ascent of the Pound to Dollar exchange rate to 1.40 has far-reaching implications beyond just currency traders. For UK Exporters: A stronger Pound makes UK exports more expensive for international buyers, potentially reducing demand. Conversely, it makes imported goods cheaper, which could help dampen domestic inflation. For US Tourists in the UK: A higher GBP/USD rate means US tourists get fewer Pounds for their Dollars, making holidays in the UK more expensive. For UK tourists in the US, their Pound would buy more Dollars, making US travel more affordable. For Investors with International Portfolios: UK-based investors holding US assets would see the value of those assets decrease in Pound terms as the Pound strengthens. Conversely, US-based investors holding UK assets would see their investments appreciate in Dollar terms. For Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations with significant operations or revenues in either currency will see their reported earnings affected by currency fluctuations. For example, a US company earning in GBP would see its Dollar-denominated earnings increase with a stronger Pound. This movement isn’t just about numbers on a screen; it directly impacts the purchasing power of consumers, the profitability of businesses, and the returns on international investments. The shift in the Pound to Dollar ratio reflects fundamental economic shifts that resonate across various sectors. Crafting Your Strategy: Actionable Insights for the Currency Outlook Given UBS’s intriguing currency outlook for GBP/USD, how can individuals and investors position themselves? While no forecast is guaranteed, prudent planning can help navigate potential market shifts. Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep a close eye on inflation reports, interest rate decisions, GDP figures, and employment data from both the UK and the US. These releases are often the primary catalysts for short-term currency movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on a single currency pair or asset class can be risky. Diversifying across different currencies, asset classes (including traditional equities, bonds, and even cryptocurrencies), and geographies can help mitigate exposure to adverse currency movements. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you have significant exposure to either GBP or USD through international business or investments, explore hedging options like forward contracts or currency options to lock in exchange rates and protect against unfavorable swings. Understand Risk Management: For those directly trading Forex, always employ robust risk management techniques, including setting stop-loss orders, managing position sizes, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Volatility can be high, and even strong forecasts can be subject to unforeseen events. Consult Financial Professionals: For complex financial decisions or significant investments, seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who specializes in currency markets or international investments can provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation and risk tolerance. The journey to 1.40 for GBP/USD, if it materializes, will be influenced by a multitude of factors. Staying informed and adopting a strategic approach to your investments, considering this long-term currency outlook , is paramount. In conclusion, UBS’s forecast of GBP/USD reaching 1.40 by mid-2026 presents a compelling narrative for the coming years. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by expectations of diverging monetary policies, varying inflation trajectories, and relative economic resilience between the UK and the US. While the path ahead will undoubtedly be marked by volatility and external factors, understanding the potential drivers and implications of such a significant move is vital for anyone engaged in the financial markets. Whether you’re a seasoned Forex trader, an international business, or an investor looking to diversify, keeping this GBP/USD forecast in perspective can inform more strategic decision-making and help navigate the evolving global economic landscape.

Typically, news of impending interest rate cuts might signal weakness for a currency. However, in a fascinating twist, analysts are increasingly pointing towards potential gains for the Aussie dollar. This counter-intuitive outlook presents a compelling narrative for investors and currency traders alike, suggesting a strategic opportunity emerging from evolving monetary policy. Understanding the RBA’s Stance on Interest Rates : What’s Driving the Shift? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has recently adopted a more dovish tone, signaling that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon. This shift in monetary policy is primarily influenced by several key factors: Inflationary Pressures Easing: While inflation has remained sticky, the RBA has noted a clear deceleration in price growth, particularly in goods. Services inflation remains a concern, but the overall trend suggests that the aggressive rate hikes implemented previously are having their intended effect. Global Economic Slowdown: Weakening global growth prospects, particularly in major trading partners, put downward pressure on Australia’s export-driven economy. Lowering interest rates can stimulate domestic demand and support economic activity in a challenging external environment. Labor Market Dynamics: Although the Australian labor market has remained resilient, there are signs of some softening. The RBA aims to maintain full employment and can use rate cuts as a tool to prevent a significant downturn in job creation. Balancing Act: The RBA is navigating a delicate balance between bringing inflation back to its target band (2-3%) and avoiding a severe economic recession. Signaling future cuts allows the RBA flexibility and can help manage market expectations. Historically, a central bank easing cycle often weakens a currency as it makes domestic assets less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. However, the current scenario for the Australian Dollar is nuanced. Markets have largely priced in these cuts, and the forward guidance provides clarity, reducing uncertainty. Furthermore, if other major central banks (like the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank) are also expected to cut rates, or even cut more aggressively, the RBA’s moves might not be seen as uniquely dovish. Why is the Australian Dollar Poised for Gains Amidst Rate Cuts? This seems contradictory, doesn’t it? A currency strengthening when its central bank is cutting rates. Yet, several dynamics explain this intriguing forecast for the Australian Dollar : “Sell the Rumor, Buy the News” Phenomenon: A significant portion of the RBA’s expected rate cuts has already been factored into the market. Traders often front-run such announcements, selling the currency in anticipation. Once the cuts are confirmed or clearly signaled, the “news” is out, and the selling pressure can abate, leading to a rebound as speculative positions are unwound. Relative Monetary Policy Divergence: The key lies in comparison. If the RBA is perceived to be cutting rates at a slower pace, or starting later, than other major central banks (e.g., the European Central Bank or Bank of England), then the yield differential might not necessarily widen against the AUD. In some scenarios, if the RBA is seen as being more measured, it could even lead to relative strength. Commodity Price Resilience: Australia is a major exporter of commodities, including iron ore, coal, and natural gas. Strong global demand for these resources, particularly from China, provides a fundamental underpinning for the Australian Dollar . If commodity prices remain robust or even rise, this can offset some of the negative pressure from lower interest rates. Improved Global Risk Sentiment: A more stable global economic outlook, even if it involves slower growth, can boost demand for risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD. As a “pro-cyclical” currency, the Australian Dollar often benefits from improving global risk appetite, especially if concerns about a severe global recession recede. Domestic Economic Resilience: Despite the RBA’s caution, the Australian economy has shown remarkable resilience in certain sectors. If the economy avoids a sharp downturn and unemployment remains relatively low, it provides a stable foundation for the currency, even with easing monetary policy . This complex interplay of factors suggests that while the RBA is signaling a pivot, the market’s interpretation, coupled with underlying economic strengths, could propel the Australian Dollar higher. What Does This Mean for the AUD Forecast ? Predicting currency movements is an intricate art, but the current signals from the RBA offer significant clues for the AUD forecast . Analysts are now adjusting their models to reflect the likelihood of easing, and the consensus is leaning towards a more constructive outlook for the Aussie dollar in the medium term. Key elements influencing the AUD forecast include: Timing and Pace of RBA Cuts: The market will closely watch the RBA’s actual actions. A slower, more measured pace of cuts than initially expected could provide more significant upside for the AUD. Commodity Price Performance: Australia’s strong ties to global commodity markets mean that prices of key exports will continue to play a crucial role. A sustained rally in iron ore or energy prices would be a powerful tailwind for the Australian Dollar . China’s Economic Recovery: As Australia’s largest trading partner, China’s economic health is paramount. Any robust recovery in China, especially in its industrial and construction sectors, directly translates to increased demand for Australian resources and thus strengthens the AUD. Global Interest Rate Environment: The relative positioning of the RBA’s interest rates compared to other major central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ) will be critical. If other central banks cut more aggressively, the AUD’s yield advantage could improve, even with RBA cuts. Many institutional forecasts suggest the Australian Dollar could strengthen against the US Dollar (AUD/USD) in the latter half of the year, potentially moving towards the 0.68-0.70 range or even higher, depending on the factors mentioned above. This positive AUD forecast is a significant shift from earlier predictions of continued weakness. Navigating the Forex Market : Opportunities in Currency Trading For individuals and institutions engaged in currency trading , the anticipated movements of the Australian Dollar present compelling opportunities. Understanding the dynamics at play is crucial for formulating effective trading strategies. Here’s how traders might approach the evolving landscape: Strategy Description Potential Benefit Long AUD Positions Buying the Australian Dollar against currencies where central banks are expected to cut rates more aggressively or maintain lower rates. Capitalize on AUD’s relative strength and potential appreciation. Commodity-Linked Trades Monitoring and reacting to trends in key Australian commodity exports (e.g., iron ore, coal). Strong commodity prices often correlate with a stronger AUD. Leverage fundamental drivers of the Australian economy. Carry Trades (Cautious Approach) While RBA cuts reduce the interest rate differential, if other currencies cut even more, or if risk sentiment improves, cautious carry trades could still be considered. Earn interest rate differential, though less prominent in an easing cycle. Risk-On/Risk-Off Positioning The AUD is often a “risk-on” currency. If global risk appetite improves, buying the AUD can be a strategy. Conversely, during “risk-off” periods, caution is advised. Align with broader market sentiment shifts. However, it’s vital to remember that currency trading involves inherent risks. Volatility can be high, and unexpected global events or shifts in RBA communication could quickly alter the outlook. Effective risk management, including stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing, is paramount. The Broader Impact of Monetary Policy Shifts The RBA’s evolving monetary policy stance has ripple effects beyond just the Australian Dollar . It influences various aspects of the Australian economy and global financial markets: Economic Stimulus: Lower interest rates aim to stimulate borrowing and spending by businesses and consumers, supporting economic growth and potentially boosting employment. Inflation Management: While cutting rates, the RBA must remain vigilant about inflation. If inflationary pressures re-emerge unexpectedly, the RBA might have to reverse course, creating market volatility. Housing Market: Lower interest rates typically make mortgages more affordable, potentially supporting the housing market, which is a significant component of the Australian economy. Equity Markets: Reduced borrowing costs can be positive for corporate earnings, potentially boosting the Australian stock market (ASX). However, a weakening economy (which often precedes rate cuts) can be a drag. Global Capital Flows: Changes in Australian interest rates influence the attractiveness of Australian assets to international investors, impacting capital flows into and out of the country. The RBA’s careful calibration of its monetary policy is a crucial determinant of Australia’s economic health and its standing in the global financial system. The signals of rate cuts are not merely about the currency; they reflect a broader strategy to navigate complex economic currents. Challenges and Considerations for the Australian Dollar ‘s Trajectory While the outlook for the Australian Dollar appears positive, several challenges and uncertainties could impact its trajectory: Global Economic Shocks: Unexpected downturns in major economies, geopolitical tensions, or supply chain disruptions could weigh heavily on commodity prices and global risk sentiment, negatively impacting the AUD. Inflation Persistence: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, the RBA might delay or even reverse rate cuts, potentially disappointing market expectations and putting downward pressure on the currency. Divergence in Central Bank Policies: While relative policy is a factor for strength, a significant divergence where other major central banks cut rates far less than the RBA, or even hike, could reduce the AUD’s attractiveness. Domestic Economic Weakness: Despite current resilience, if the Australian economy experiences a more severe slowdown than forecast, it could undermine confidence in the AUD. Commodity Price Volatility: While currently supportive, commodity prices are inherently volatile. A sharp decline could quickly erode the AUD’s fundamental support. These factors underscore the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies for anyone involved in currency trading or holding AUD-denominated assets. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders Given the nuanced outlook for the Australian Dollar , what should investors and traders consider? Stay Informed on RBA Communications: Closely follow RBA statements, minutes, and speeches. Any shift in language regarding inflation, employment, or global outlook can provide crucial clues about future monetary policy . Monitor Commodity Markets: Keep a keen eye on the prices of iron ore, coal, and other key Australian exports. Strong commodity prices often signal a stronger AUD. Watch Global Risk Sentiment: The AUD is a risk-sensitive currency. During periods of improved global economic outlook and risk appetite, the AUD tends to perform well. Compare Relative Central Bank Policies: Don’t just focus on the RBA. Understand the expected actions of the Fed, ECB, BoE, and BoJ. The relative pace and timing of rate adjustments will significantly impact cross-currency pairs involving the AUD. Diversify and Manage Risk: As with any investment, diversification is key. For currency trading , utilize robust risk management tools like stop-loss orders and consider position sizing carefully to protect capital from unexpected volatility. The current environment presents a unique opportunity for those who can navigate the complexities of central bank signals and global economic interdependencies. The narrative surrounding the Australian Dollar is undergoing a fascinating transformation. What might initially seem like a paradox – a currency strengthening despite anticipated rate cuts – is in fact a testament to the complex interplay of market expectations, relative central bank policies, and fundamental economic drivers. The RBA’s strategic pivot on interest rates , coupled with the “sell the rumor, buy the news” dynamic and resilient commodity markets, paints a remarkably positive AUD forecast . For those engaged in the Forex market , particularly in currency trading , this signals a period ripe with potential. While challenges remain, the prevailing sentiment suggests the Australian Dollar is poised for a significant ascent, making it a crucial currency to watch in the coming months.

Visa has previously taken steps to integrate cryptocurrency usage through direct partnerships and network access. One example provided in the documentation shared by SMQKE shows Visa granting principal membership status to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. This membership enables Coinbase to issue debit cards that allow customers to spend their holdings of bitcoin, ether, and XRP at any merchant that accepts Visa. The arrangement removes intermediaries from the process of converting crypto to fiat at the point of sale.

According to the information presented, Visa envisions the platform as an interoperability layer connecting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), public cryptocurrencies, and legacy financial systems. While the exact countries participating were not specified in the document, Visa was listed as the main organization involved. The analysis highlights three interoperability methods under consideration: APIs, bridges, and other options. Specifically, Visa identified the Universal Payments Channel (UPC), RippleNet, and the Interledger Protocol as examples of frameworks that could enable seamless transfers across different types of digital assets and settlement networks. RippleNet is Ripple’s global payments network designed for faster, lower-cost cross-border transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Interledger Protocol allows for interoperability between disparate ledgers by facilitating the routing of payments without requiring all participants to adopt the same underlying technology. Effect on XRP and the Broader Payments Ecosystem The inclusion of RippleNet and Interledger Protocol in Visa’s exploration of settlement solutions suggests an interest in expanding the ability to settle transactions involving XRP and other digital currencies. While the documentation reviewed by SMQKE does not specify implementation timelines or definitive commitments, the listing of Ripple’s infrastructure alongside Visa’s Universal Payments Channel indicates that Ripple technology is recognized as a viable interoperability option. This approach aligns with Visa’s strategy of positioning itself as a central hub to bridge traditional payment methods with emerging digital assets. The focus on interoperability underscores Visa’s recognition that future payments systems may depend on the ability to route value across multiple networks, including CBDCs , cryptocurrencies, and conventional card rails. Crypto Researcher SMQKE’s tweet, accompanied by the two referenced documents, emphasizes Visa’s strategic efforts to integrate digital currencies into its settlement capabilities.

This particular price drop comes in a rather surprising period, as Ripple and its cryptocurrency have seen some enhanced adoption developments lately. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP’s Price Struggles Looking on a monthly scale, XRP managed to do the unthinkable in mid-July when it broke out of its consolidation range at around $2.2-$2.3 and shot up to a new all-time high at over $3.6 – a moment that its community had waited for over seven years. However, the subsequent correction was almost immediate and culminated last week when the asset plunged to $2.73 (on Bitstamp) as whales were disposing of large token quantities. Nevertheless, XRP bounced off in the following days and jumped to $3.1 yesterday despite some warnings by analysts. As the perma-bullish XRP Army was convinced that the $3 resistance had been conquered and turned into support, the bears reemerged and pushed the asset south. Earlier today, Ripple’s cross-border payments token dumped to $2.9, which represented a 6.5% daily decline. Despite recovering some ground since then, XRP is still 4% down on the day and is well below $3. Why So? Obviously, the most probable reason that can be listed is the overall market condition, as almost all digital assets have failed to post any substantial gains in the past several days. The global macro situation also seems quite uncertain. However, Ripple and its native token have been the subject of quite a few positive developments lately. As reported earlier today, South Korea’s BDACS announced support for XRP. Separately, rumors emerged recently that BlackRock might be joining the XRP ETF race. Last but not least, Japan’s largest banking group, SBI Japan, said in its Q2 report that it had filed to launch ETFs tracking the performance of bitcoin and XRP. Although the report was published on July 31, it reached social media channels and mainstream media in the past day or so, which should, at least in theory, positively impact the underlying asset’s price.

After two weeks of steady declines, XRP is showing signs of life. The digital asset has officially broken its downtrend streak, reclaiming the crucial $3.14 resistance level, according to market analyst Adex Crypt. Meanwhile, the $2.76 mark, previously the upper boundary of a descending channel, has flipped into solid support, indicating a shift in market sentiment. XRP's recent price action is stirring optimism among traders and investors. The asset surged past key resistance after forming a rounded bottom pattern, typically seen as a bullish reversal indicator. Volume has also ticked upward, suggesting growing confidence behind the move. However, caution still lingers in the market. ”XRP has snapped its 2-week downtrend, reclaiming the $3.14 resistance level, while $2.76 continues to hold firm as support,” Adex crypt noted . “Signs of a potential trend reversal are emerging, but is this the bulls' comeback or just a temporary bounce?” For now, XRP remains in a critical juncture as bulls try to invalidate the broader bearish structure. At the time of this writing, XRP was down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2.95, according to CoinGecko data . Corporate XRP Treasury Commitments Big players, such as Trident Digital, Webus International, VivoPower International, Wellgistics Health, Hyperscale Data, and Worksport Ltd. are moving beyond observation, they’re deploying sizable XRP allocations into their corporate treasuries. Together, these four players anchor nearly $986 million in corporate XRP commitments, with overall disclosed corporate XRPs approaching $1 billion. Institutional Commitment with Real Scale Leading the charge is Singapore‑based Nasdaq‑listed fintech firm Trident Digital Tech Holdings, which has announced plans to raise up to US $500 million to build one of the largest corporate XRP treasuries. That allocation will be used for long‑term reserves, staking, and deeper integration into the Ripple ecosystem. Close behind, Webus International is setting aside $300 million via credit lines and financing to build an XRP treasury and operationalize Ripple-based cross‑border payment solutions. Yield and Liquidity: VivoPower & Wellgistics VivoPower International has earmarked about $121 million from a recent private placement toward XRP. The company intends to stake its XRP on the Flare Network to generate yield, reinvesting that income into its treasury strategy. Meanwhile, Wellgistics Health has secured a $50 million credit line to acquire XRP, aimed at facilitating real‑time payments within its pharmaceutical distribution network and creating a strategic liquidity buffer. Data, DeFi, and Broader Use Cases Hyperscale Data Inc., through subsidiary Ault Capital Group, has committed $10 million in XRP. The goal is to support a DeFi lending platform for publicly listed firms, with loans on‑chain and hedged with futures contracts, underscoring XRP’s role as more than a store of value. Worksport Ltd. has quietly allocated around $5 million from operational cash reserves into XRP and Bitcoin with plans to start accepting XRP payments on its online platform underway, a signal of wanting to integrate crypto into both treasury and commercial operations. What It Means for Corporate Treasury Strategy This wave of allocation marks a clear pivotal point that XRP is now treated as a functional financial tool used for payments, loans, staking, and treasury diversification. Collectively, these six firms have committed nearly $1 billion toward XRP treasury programs, spanning sectors from tech and energy to healthcare and data services. Conclusion Trident, Webus, VivoPower, Wellgistics, Hyperscale Data, and Worksport aren’t sitting on the sidelines, they’re building live XRP treasury strategies. For corporations, XRP is increasingly not just an asset, but a strategic lever woven into treasury, payments, and DeFi infrastructure. Meanwhile, the coming days will be telling as XRP battles to prove whether this breakout above $2.76 has real legs, or is merely a pause before the next leg down.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|TREASURY|FLR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 09:33:08

Yet, the actions taken by these financial behemoths to manage national currency values, such as the Swiss Franc strength , create profound ripples across global financial markets. These ripples can indirectly influence everything from traditional forex trading to the broader risk sentiment that shapes the digital asset space. A recent analyst statement has brought the SNB’s proactive stance into sharp focus, suggesting the bank is poised to act, likely to prevent further “excessive CHF strength” in the near term. This isn’t just a technical detail for forex enthusiasts; it’s a critical signal about Switzerland’s economic health, its strategic positioning in the global economy, and the SNB’s unwavering commitment to its monetary policy objectives. But why is the SNB so determined to manage the Swiss Franc’s value, and what does this mean for the intricate currency market dynamics that impact global finance? SNB Intervention: A Proactive Stance Against Unwanted Strength The Swiss National Bank holds a unique position among central banks due to its long and often unconventional history of intervention in the foreign exchange market. While many central banks primarily intervene to prevent currency weakness that could fuel inflation, the SNB frequently steps in to curb excessive Swiss Franc strength . This proactive, almost defensive, approach is a cornerstone of their monetary policy , aiming to stabilize the economy, manage inflationary pressures, and protect the competitiveness of Swiss industries. Historical Context and Past Actions: 2011 Euro Zone Crisis: Faced with massive safe-haven inflows during the European sovereign debt crisis, the SNB implemented a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss Francs per Euro. This was an unprecedented move, effectively pegging the CHF to the EUR to prevent its runaway appreciation. 2015 Unpegging: The abrupt removal of this peg in January 2015 sent shockwaves through global markets, demonstrating the SNB’s willingness to make bold, decisive moves when its policy framework is challenged. The unpegging led to a massive, sudden appreciation of the CHF, highlighting the inherent pressure for its value to rise. Post-2015 Interventions: Following the unpegging, the SNB continued to intervene, primarily through foreign exchange purchases, to counter the franc’s strength, often accumulating vast foreign currency reserves in the process. The SNB’s Toolkit for Intervention: The SNB employs a range of tools to influence the Swiss Franc’s value. While direct market intervention is often the most visible, other policy instruments play a crucial supporting role: Foreign Exchange Sales/Purchases: This is the most direct method. To weaken the CHF, the SNB sells CHF and buys foreign currencies (like EUR or USD) in the open market. This increases the supply of CHF, theoretically reducing its value. Conversely, to strengthen the CHF (less common, but possible), they would buy CHF and sell foreign currency. Interest Rate Adjustments: While interest rates are primarily set to achieve price stability, their impact on the exchange rate is undeniable. Very low or negative interest rates, which the SNB employed for years, make holding CHF less attractive, discouraging capital inflows and thus reducing upward pressure on the currency. Recent rate hikes by the SNB have made the CHF more attractive, creating a new dynamic where direct intervention might become more necessary if appreciation becomes excessive. Verbal Intervention (Jawboning): Often overlooked but highly effective, verbal intervention involves SNB officials making statements or issuing warnings about their discomfort with the CHF’s level. This can influence market expectations and discourage speculative buying, acting as a low-cost, preliminary tool before direct market action. The analyst’s statement suggests that despite recent rate hikes aimed at combating inflation, the SNB perceives a renewed risk of the CHF appreciating too rapidly. This could stem from its persistent safe-haven appeal or a shift in global risk sentiment, prompting the SNB to signal its readiness for further SNB intervention . Why Does Excessive Swiss Franc Strength Pose a Challenge? While a strong national currency might intuitively seem like a sign of economic health and prosperity, for an export-oriented economy like Switzerland, an overly strong Swiss Franc strength can be profoundly detrimental. The SNB’s constant vigilance against it stems from several critical economic impacts: Impact on Exports: Switzerland is renowned for its high-value exports, including pharmaceuticals, machinery, watches, and precision instruments. When the CHF strengthens, Swiss goods become more expensive for international buyers. This reduces demand, erodes profit margins for Swiss exporters, and can lead to reduced production, job losses, and a decline in export revenues, which are vital for the Swiss economy. Tourism Sector Woes: Switzerland is a premier global tourist destination. An overly strong CHF makes holidays, accommodation, and services significantly more expensive for foreign visitors. This deters tourists, leading to lower occupancy rates for hotels, reduced spending in retail and hospitality, and a decline in overall tourism revenue. Deflationary Pressures: A stronger CHF makes imported goods and services cheaper in local currency terms. While this might seem beneficial for consumers in the short term, if persistent, it can contribute to lower inflation or even outright deflation. Deflation can stifle economic growth by discouraging spending and investment, as consumers postpone purchases anticipating even lower prices in the future. The SNB actively combats deflation to maintain price stability. Safe-Haven Dilemma: In times of global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or financial market turmoil, the CHF is often sought after as a safe-haven currency. This leads to massive capital inflows into Switzerland, pushing the CHF’s value up undesirably from the SNB’s perspective. This inherent safe-haven appeal often works against the SNB’s desired currency level, creating a constant battle between market forces and policy objectives. To illustrate the conflicting impacts of a strong CHF, consider the table below: Stakeholder/Perspective Benefits of Strong CHF Challenges of Strong CHF Swiss Consumers Cheaper imports, higher purchasing power abroad for travel and goods. Potential job losses in export and tourism sectors; overall economic slowdown. Swiss Exporters N/A (Generally negative impact on competitiveness and profitability). Reduced competitiveness, lower profits, potential for production cuts and layoffs. Swiss Tourism Industry N/A (Generally negative impact on visitor numbers and revenue). Higher costs for international visitors, deterring tourism and reducing revenue. SNB (Monetary Policy) Helps curb imported inflation; reinforces stability image. Creates deflationary pressure, harms economic growth targets, complicates interest rate policy. Global Investors Safe-haven asset during crises; preservation of capital. Lower yield potential (due to low/negative rates), less attractive for carry trades. What’s the Current CHF Outlook? Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment The current CHF outlook is a subject of intense debate among financial analysts and market participants. While Switzerland’s robust economic fundamentals, low public debt, and political stability inherently support the franc’s value, the market is increasingly pricing in the likelihood of proactive SNB intervention to prevent runaway appreciation. Diverging Views: Some analysts, focusing on Switzerland’s relative economic strength and lower inflation compared to the Eurozone or the US, predict continued modest appreciation for the CHF. They argue that higher interest rates globally might not be enough to offset the franc’s intrinsic safe-haven appeal. However, a growing number of strategists emphasize the SNB’s clear and consistent communication that it stands ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market if deemed necessary. This creates a ceiling for how much the CHF can appreciate without triggering a response. Key Influencers on the CHF Outlook: The trajectory of the Swiss Franc will be heavily influenced by a confluence of factors: Global Risk Sentiment: Escalations in geopolitical tensions (e.g., conflicts, trade wars) or signs of a global economic slowdown will likely increase demand for safe havens, including the CHF. Interest Rate Differentials: The difference in interest rates between Switzerland and major economies like the Eurozone and the US plays a role. If other central banks pause or cut rates while the SNB maintains its stance, it could make the CHF relatively more attractive. Switzerland’s Domestic Inflation Trajectory: If Swiss inflation remains stubbornly low or falls significantly, it gives the SNB more leeway to intervene to weaken the CHF without jeopardizing its price stability mandate. Conversely, if inflation rises, the SNB might be less inclined to intervene to weaken the currency, as it would exacerbate inflationary pressures. The market’s perception of the SNB’s ‘pain threshold’ for CHF strength is crucial. Analysts are constantly trying to decipher at what level the SNB would feel compelled to act more forcefully, whether through direct FX sales or a shift in its interest rate guidance. The SNB’s Monetary Policy: A Balancing Act for Currency Value The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy is inextricably linked to its currency management strategy. The primary overarching goal of the SNB is to ensure price stability, defined as an annual inflation rate between 0% and 2%. Achieving this often involves navigating the complex relationship between interest rates, inflation, and the exchange rate. Interest Rates as a Primary Tool: For years, the SNB maintained negative interest rates to combat deflationary pressures and curb the CHF’s strength. While they have recently shifted away from negative rates, their rate decisions are always made with an acute awareness of their potential impact on the CHF. Higher rates generally make a currency more attractive, supporting its value. However, if the SNB deems the resulting appreciation excessive and detrimental to its price stability or economic growth goals, they might signal a pause in hikes, or even a future cut, or intensify direct foreign exchange interventions. Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate: The exchange rate is a significant channel through which inflation is transmitted to the Swiss economy. A strong CHF makes imports cheaper, directly reducing imported inflation. While this can help the SNB meet its inflation target if domestic prices are rising, an overly strong CHF can lead to deflationary pressures that are harder to combat, especially if domestic demand is weak. The SNB must carefully balance these forces. Communication as a Policy Instrument: The SNB places immense importance on clear and consistent communication. Their monetary policy assessments, press conferences, and speeches by SNB officials are meticulously scrutinized by markets. The SNB often uses ‘verbal intervention’ or ‘jawboning’ to signal its discomfort with the CHF’s level. This communication, even without direct market action, can effectively influence market expectations and discourage speculative buying, acting as a critical, low-cost tool in their arsenal to manage currency market dynamics . The SNB’s commitment to maintaining its policy independence and its focus on domestic price stability means it will continue to use all available tools, including FX interventions, to manage the Swiss Franc strength in line with its overall economic objectives. Navigating Currency Market Dynamics: Ripple Effects and Trader Insights The SNB’s actions, or even just their credible signals of intent, have significant implications for global currency market dynamics . Traders, investors, and businesses operating internationally closely watch the SNB for cues, as its policy decisions can lead to substantial shifts in exchange rates and market sentiment. Direct Impact on Key Currency Pairs: The most immediate impact is seen on CHF-related currency pairs, particularly EUR/CHF and USD/CHF. A strong signal from the SNB about preventing excessive CHF strength would typically lead to a weakening of the CHF against these major currencies, meaning EUR/CHF and USD/CHF would likely move higher. Conversely, if the SNB were to signal comfort with a stronger franc (less likely in the current context), these pairs would likely move lower. Volatility and Trading Opportunities: Periods surrounding SNB monetary policy announcements or analyst statements suggesting intervention can lead to increased volatility in CHF pairs. This presents both heightened risks and potential opportunities for forex traders who can anticipate or react quickly to these shifts. Understanding the SNB’s historical patterns and communication style is key to navigating these periods. Global Spillover Effects: While Switzerland is a relatively small economy, its status as a financial hub and the CHF’s safe-haven role mean that SNB actions can have broader implications. For instance, a weakening CHF (due to SNB intervention) might reduce some of the safe-haven demand that could otherwise flow into other currencies like the Japanese Yen or the US Dollar. Moreover, the SNB’s willingness to use unconventional tools like direct FX intervention can serve as a case study or even a precedent for other central banks facing similar currency appreciation pressures. Indirect Influence on Broader Markets (including Crypto): While not a direct cause-and-effect, central bank actions like SNB intervention influence overall market liquidity, risk appetite, and the cost of capital. When central banks provide clear policy signals, it can reduce uncertainty in traditional markets, potentially leading to a more stable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unexpected central bank moves or increased volatility in major fiat currencies can spill over into crypto markets as investors seek or shed risk. For participants in global finance, understanding the SNB’s likely next steps is not just an academic exercise; it’s a practical necessity for managing exposure and identifying potential trading opportunities in the ever-evolving landscape of currency market dynamics . Challenges and Considerations for the SNB Despite its formidable toolkit, the SNB faces several inherent challenges in its mission to manage Swiss Franc strength effectively: Global Uncertainty and Safe-Haven Flows: Geopolitical events, global economic slowdowns, or financial crises inevitably drive capital towards safe havens. The CHF’s status as a premier safe haven means that these external shocks can trigger massive inflows, making it incredibly difficult for the SNB to contain its appreciation without resorting to large-scale, potentially costly interventions. Policy Space and Reserve Accumulation: While the SNB has ample reserves, there are practical limits to how much it can intervene without distorting domestic markets or accumulating an unsustainably large balance sheet. Large foreign currency holdings also expose the SNB to valuation risks. Communication Credibility: The SNB must maintain its credibility. If markets believe the SNB is bluffing or unwilling to act decisively, its verbal interventions become less effective, forcing it into more costly direct market actions. Inflation vs. Growth Dilemma: The SNB constantly walks a tightrope between achieving its price stability mandate (combating inflation/deflation) and supporting economic growth. Intervening to weaken the CHF can help exporters but might fuel imported inflation, creating a policy conflict. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders For those operating in traditional forex markets, or simply observing broader financial trends that can influence cryptocurrency sentiment, understanding the SNB’s likely actions is crucial: Monitor SNB Statements Closely: Pay meticulous attention to SNB press conferences, quarterly monetary policy assessments, and speeches by SNB officials. Look for any nuanced language or shifts in tone regarding their comfort level with the CHF’s exchange rate. Key phrases indicating overvaluation or readiness to intervene are critical. Watch Key Swiss Economic Data: Swiss inflation figures, GDP growth, and export performance can provide vital clues about the SNB’s likely next moves. Weak economic data or persistent low inflation might give the SNB more justification to intervene against CHF strength. Observe EUR/CHF as a Barometer: The EUR/CHF currency pair is often considered a direct barometer of SNB intervention sentiment. A sustained move below certain levels (e.g., 0.95 or 0.96) might trigger more aggressive SNB action, as this indicates significant CHF strength against its largest trading partner’s currency. Consider Global Risk Appetite: Keep an eye on global risk indicators. If global uncertainty rises, expect renewed safe-haven flows into CHF, potentially prompting an SNB response. Conversely, a ‘risk-on’ environment might naturally ease some of the upward pressure on the franc. Conclusion The analyst’s view regarding the Swiss National Bank’s likely actions underscores the institution’s unwavering commitment to preventing excessive Swiss Franc strength . This proactive approach, deeply embedded in their monetary policy framework, is absolutely crucial for maintaining Switzerland’s economic stability, supporting its vital export and tourism sectors, and managing inflation effectively. While the CHF’s intrinsic safe-haven appeal and Switzerland’s robust economic fundamentals will continue to exert upward pressure, the SNB stands ready to utilize its comprehensive arsenal of tools to navigate the complex currency market dynamics . For investors and traders alike, understanding the SNB’s likely actions and their potential ripple effects is vital for making informed decisions in an interconnected global financial landscape. The SNB’s decisive moves will continue to shape the CHF outlook and influence broader market sentiment, making it a central bank to watch closely in the coming months.

Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy has also confirmed the firm is exploring stablecoin launch options , potentially enabling real-time funding for brokerage accounts. The $110 billion market value company serves nearly 3.9 million customers and already supports crypto trading through partnerships with Paxos and Zero Hash. Payments processor @remitly will soon integrate stablecoins into its global network, aiming to speed up and reduce the cost of international money transfers. #Remitly #Stablecoins https://t.co/VCG75mundR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Most recently, Remitly launched beta testing for its multi-currency digital wallet supporting both fiat and stablecoins , with live deployment scheduled for September. The Seattle-based fintech added stablecoin payout options through Bridge, a Stripe-owned infrastructure provider, while integrating USDC into internal treasury operations. All these corporate adoptions come as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged the significance of stablecoins, noting that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is linked to the US dollar. The federation believed that “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by making it more accessible worldwide. Corporate Giants Defy New Regulations While Adoption Accelerates Coinbase and PayPal continue offering stablecoin yield programs despite the GENIUS Act provisions explicitly banning interest payments from stablecoin issuers. Both companies argue the restrictions don’t apply because they operate as intermediaries rather than direct issuers of the stablecoins they reward. @Coinbase and @PayPal are pushing forward with stablecoin yield programs, despite new US legislation banning such incentives for issuers. #Coinbase #PayPal https://t.co/F4bTmQbl6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated, “We are not the issuer,” while defending the company’s 4.1% APY rewards on USDC holdings. Though Coinbase co-developed USDC with Circle, it ceased formal issuing responsibilities in 2023, with Circle now serving as the sole issuer without offering direct yield. PayPal offers 3.7% annual returns on PYUSD holdings through both PayPal and Venmo platforms. While PYUSD bears PayPal’s name, technical issuance by third-party firm Paxos allows PayPal to claim exemption from GENIUS Act restrictions. Previously, Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that private stablecoin launches could create privacy invasions and systemic risks, predicting companies would “come begging for bailout when it inevitably blows up.” Despite criticism, global corporations, including Amazon, Walmart, JD.com, and Alipay , continue exploring stablecoin integration. The competitive stablecoin space has intensified with approximately 20 million addresses now transacting with stablecoins on public blockchains. MetaMask’s proposed entry would leverage its massive user base and Stripe’s compliance infrastructure to claim its share of the market.

Many investors are observing a peculiar holding pattern in the crypto market. However, a significant shift might be on the horizon, not from internal market dynamics, but from a powerful external force: global liquidity . This vital economic indicator could soon become the primary catalyst for the next major BTC trend , offering a fresh perspective on the crypto market outlook . Let’s dive into how M2 money supply specifically plays a crucial role in this anticipated movement. Why Is Bitcoin Price Experiencing a Holding Pattern? Currently, Bitcoin price is trading sideways, leading to a period of consolidation. According to Negentropic, the insightful X account run by Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel, the market finds itself in a peculiar equilibrium. Sellers, it appears, have exhausted their available ‘ammo,’ while buyers remain largely inactive. This creates a stalemate, preventing any significant upward or downward movement. This observation highlights a crucial point: the market needs an external push. Without new capital flowing in or out, the existing supply and demand dynamics keep prices relatively stable. Therefore, understanding the broader economic picture becomes essential for anticipating the next big move in the BTC trend . How Global Liquidity and M2 Money Supply Drive the Next BTC Trend The key to unlocking Bitcoin’s next direction lies within global liquidity , particularly the M2 money supply. Negentropic emphasizes that only a change in global M2 money supply can truly alter the current market trajectory. This economic metric represents the total amount of money circulating within an economy, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. In the cryptocurrency world, a widely held belief suggests that Bitcoin price movements often lag behind changes in M2 supply. Historically, when M2 liquidity expands, it eventually trickles into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, pushing prices higher. Conversely, a contraction in M2 can lead to downward pressure. Intriguingly, Negentropic forecasts that M2 liquidity is expected to begin rising in approximately four days from their analysis. This projection aligns with the historical correlation, suggesting a potential positive impact on the crypto market outlook soon. What Does the M2 Money Supply Data Reveal for the Crypto Market Outlook? Data from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) provides a clear picture of recent M2 movements. For instance, M2 peaked at 22,055.1 on April 14 and stood at 22,005.4 as of July 30. While these figures represent a slight dip from the peak, the anticipated rise in M2 could reverse this trend, potentially fueling the next leg up for the Bitcoin price . Investors should pay close attention to these liquidity flows. An increase in global liquidity typically signals more capital available for investment, which can boost demand across various asset classes, including digital assets. Monitoring M2 supply data, therefore, becomes a crucial part of any informed investment strategy in the crypto space. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin price is in a consolidation phase due to balanced buying and selling pressure. Global liquidity , specifically M2 money supply, is the critical external factor expected to drive the next market shift. M2 is projected to start rising soon, historically preceding positive movements in Bitcoin price . Monitoring M2 data from sources like FRED is vital for understanding the future crypto market outlook and anticipating the next BTC trend . In conclusion, while the current Bitcoin price action might seem uninspiring, the underlying economic currents are setting the stage for what could be a significant move. The impending rise in global liquidity , particularly the M2 money supply, positions itself as the primary catalyst. By keeping a close eye on these macroeconomic indicators, investors can better navigate the evolving crypto market outlook and prepare for the next definitive BTC trend . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is M2 money supply? A1: M2 money supply is a broad measure of the money circulating in an economy. It includes physical cash, checking accounts, and easily convertible financial assets like savings deposits, money market mutual funds, and small-denomination time deposits. Q2: How does M2 money supply impact Bitcoin price? A2: A common theory in crypto markets suggests that an increase in M2 money supply often leads to more capital seeking investment opportunities. A portion of this capital tends to flow into riskier assets like Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price, often with a slight lag. Q3: Who are Negentropic? A3: Negentropic is the X (formerly Twitter) account of Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel. They provide on-chain and macroeconomic analysis for cryptocurrency markets. Q4: When is M2 liquidity expected to start rising, according to Negentropic? A4: Negentropic’s analysis indicates that M2 liquidity is expected to begin rising in approximately four days from their initial observation, suggesting an imminent change in the liquidity landscape. Q5: What is the current status of the Bitcoin price and BTC trend? A5: The Bitcoin price is currently in a holding pattern, trading sideways. The BTC trend is awaiting a significant external catalyst, primarily from global liquidity flows, to determine its next major direction. Did you find this analysis helpful?

For those of us navigating the exciting, yet volatile, landscape of cryptocurrencies, it’s crucial to remember that macro trends in traditional finance, especially concerning major currencies like the US Dollar (USD), often dictate broader market sentiment and liquidity. Recently, a significant insight from UBS has caught the attention of market watchers: they see compelling opportunities in selling USD upside . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how can you position yourself to potentially benefit? Decoding the USD Upside : Why UBS Sees Opportunity in Selling? When UBS talks about “selling USD upside,” they are not necessarily predicting a catastrophic collapse of the dollar. Instead, they are signaling a belief that the dollar’s recent strength, or its potential for further significant gains, is limited. This perspective suggests that the risk-reward profile for betting on continued dollar appreciation is unfavorable, and that opportunities lie in positioning for either a consolidation, a modest decline, or a slower pace of appreciation against other major currencies. Essentially, it’s about capitalizing on the idea that the dollar’s rally may be running out of steam. Why this shift in outlook? Several factors contribute to UBS’s strategic view: Peak Interest Rates? The US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hiking cycle has been a primary driver of dollar strength. However, as inflation shows signs of cooling and the Fed signals a potential pause or even future cuts, the interest rate differential favoring the USD might narrow. Global Growth Rebalancing: While the US economy has shown resilience, other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, are starting to show signs of recovery or stabilization. This could lead to a rebalancing of global growth expectations, reducing the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. Valuation Concerns: After a period of strong performance, the dollar may be considered overvalued against some currencies, making it ripe for a correction or mean reversion. For investors, this insight is a call to re-evaluate their currency exposures. It’s about recognizing that the easy gains from a relentlessly strong dollar might be behind us, and that a more nuanced approach is now required to find profitable avenues in the currency market. Forex Market Analysis : Unpacking the Drivers of Dollar Dynamics UBS’s stance on the dollar is rooted in a comprehensive Forex market analysis that considers a multitude of economic and geopolitical factors. The currency market, the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, is a complex interplay of interest rates, economic growth, inflation, trade balances, and investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial to interpreting any institutional outlook. Key elements that UBS likely scrutinizes include: Monetary Policy Divergence: The actions of central banks globally are paramount. While the Fed has been hawkish, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have adopted different paces. As these policies converge or diverge, they directly impact currency valuations. UBS is likely forecasting a narrowing gap in policy stances, which would reduce the dollar’s relative attractiveness. Economic Data: Employment figures, GDP growth, retail sales, and manufacturing data from major economies provide a snapshot of economic health. Stronger data from other regions relative to the US could shift capital flows away from the dollar. Geopolitical Stability: In times of global uncertainty, the dollar traditionally acts as a safe haven. If geopolitical tensions ease, or if new areas of stability emerge, the demand for the dollar as a safe asset might diminish. Consider this simplified comparison of key factors influencing major currency pairs: Factor US Dollar (USD) Euro (EUR) Japanese Yen (JPY) Interest Rate Outlook Peak/Potential Cuts Continued Hikes (slower) Ultra-loose (potential shift) Inflation Trend Decelerating Sticky, but decelerating Rising (from low base) Economic Growth Resilient, but slowing Improving, but fragile Modest recovery Safe Haven Appeal High (decreasing) Moderate (increasing) High (traditional) UBS’s analysis likely suggests that the factors that have historically supported dollar strength are either losing momentum or are being counterbalanced by improving conditions elsewhere. This nuanced view is essential for developing effective currency trading strategies . Currency Trading Strategies : Navigating the Waters of Dollar Weakness If UBS sees opportunities in selling USD upside , what practical currency trading strategies can investors consider? It’s not about making reckless bets, but about strategic positioning to benefit from anticipated shifts in currency valuations. Here are some approaches to explore: Shorting the Dollar Against Stronger Counterparts: This is the most direct approach. If the dollar is expected to weaken, one would sell USD and buy a currency expected to appreciate. Common candidates include: EUR/USD: As the European economy potentially strengthens and the ECB continues its tightening cycle (even if at a slower pace), the euro could gain against the dollar. JPY/USD: The Bank of Japan has maintained ultra-loose monetary policy for an extended period. Any shift towards tightening, or even a hint of it, could lead to significant yen appreciation. GBP/USD: While the UK economy faces its own challenges, if inflation proves persistent and the Bank of England maintains a hawkish stance longer than the Fed, the pound could find support. Utilizing Options and Derivatives: For more sophisticated investors, options contracts can offer leveraged exposure with defined risk. Buying put options on the USD or selling call options against it can be ways to express a bearish dollar view. Futures contracts also provide a way to gain exposure to currency movements. Hedging Existing USD Exposure: For businesses or investors with significant assets denominated in USD, a strategy to sell USD upside could involve hedging. This protects against potential losses if the dollar weakens, safeguarding the value of their dollar-denominated assets when converted back to their base currency. Diversifying Portfolios Away from USD-Centric Assets: Beyond direct currency trades, investors can indirectly express a view on dollar weakness by increasing allocations to assets that typically perform well when the dollar is declining. This could include: Commodities (like gold and oil, often priced in USD). Emerging market equities and bonds (which often benefit from a weaker dollar as it eases their dollar-denominated debt burden). Non-US developed market equities. It’s crucial to remember that any trading strategy involves risk. Proper risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and understanding position sizing, is paramount. Always align your strategy with your risk tolerance and investment goals. The Broader UBS Outlook : A Comprehensive Economic Perspective The UBS outlook on the dollar is not an isolated prediction; it’s part of a broader, holistic view of the global economy. Their analysis encompasses everything from inflation trajectories and central bank responses to geopolitical developments and shifts in global trade dynamics. This comprehensive approach is what lends weight to their specific currency calls. What are the underlying pillars of this broader UBS perspective that inform their dollar stance? Inflationary Dynamics: UBS likely anticipates that global inflation, while still elevated, is on a decelerating path. This expectation reduces the urgency for central banks, including the Fed, to maintain ultra-tight monetary policies, thereby diminishing the allure of high-yielding dollar assets. Recessionary Risks: While a hard landing might be avoided, UBS may foresee a period of slower growth or a mild recession in key economies. Such an environment could prompt central banks to ease monetary policy, which typically weighs on a currency’s value. Global Liquidity and Capital Flows: As global growth rebalances, capital flows might diversify away from the US. If other regions offer more attractive investment opportunities or yield prospects, the demand for dollar-denominated assets could wane, contributing to dollar weakness . China’s Reopening and Impact: The reopening of China’s economy has significant implications for global growth and trade. A stronger Chinese economy could boost demand for commodities and other currencies, potentially diverting capital from the dollar. This multi-faceted analysis forms the bedrock of UBS’s confidence in identifying opportunities to sell USD upside . They are not merely looking at interest rates in isolation but considering the complex web of interconnected global economic forces. Dollar Weakness : Implications Across Global Markets and Beyond A period of sustained dollar weakness , as anticipated by UBS’s strategic view, would have profound implications far beyond just currency trading. Its effects would ripple through various asset classes and global economies, indirectly influencing even the cryptocurrency market. Here are some key implications: Commodity Prices: Commodities like oil, gold, and industrial metals are typically priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, thereby increasing demand and potentially pushing up their prices. This could be a boon for commodity-exporting nations and related companies. Emerging Markets (EM): Many emerging market countries and corporations have significant dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar reduces the cost of servicing this debt, freeing up capital and potentially boosting economic growth in these regions. This often leads to increased investor interest in EM equities and bonds. US Corporate Earnings: For US multinational corporations, a weaker dollar means that their earnings generated overseas, when converted back into dollars, are worth more. This can provide a boost to their profitability and stock performance. Global Trade: A weaker dollar makes US exports more competitive on the global stage, potentially boosting American manufacturing and trade balances. Conversely, imports become more expensive. Indirect Impact on Crypto: While not a direct cause-and-effect, a weaker dollar can indirectly benefit risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. When the dollar is strong, it often acts as a safe haven, drawing capital away from more speculative assets. If the dollar weakens, investors might be more inclined to seek higher returns in riskier ventures, potentially channeling funds into the crypto market. Additionally, a weaker dollar could signal a period of greater global liquidity, which has historically been supportive of crypto valuations. Understanding these broader implications is vital for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the shifts predicted by institutions like UBS. It’s about seeing the bigger picture beyond just the immediate currency pair. Potential Challenges and Risks to the UBS Outlook While UBS’s analysis of opportunities in selling USD upside is compelling, it’s crucial for savvy investors to acknowledge that no market prediction is without its risks. The financial landscape is constantly evolving, and unforeseen events can quickly alter even the most well-reasoned outlooks. Here are some potential challenges and risks that could impact the anticipated dollar weakness: Unexpected Fed Hawkishness: Should US inflation prove more persistent than anticipated, or if the US economy continues to outperform global peers, the Federal Reserve might be forced to maintain higher interest rates for longer, or even resume rate hikes. This would provide renewed support for the dollar, defying expectations of significant weakness. Global Economic Slowdown: A severe downturn in the global economy, perhaps triggered by a major geopolitical event or a deeper-than-expected recession in China or Europe, could trigger a flight to safety. In such scenarios, the US dollar traditionally acts as the ultimate safe-haven currency, leading to renewed strength despite other factors. Geopolitical Black Swans: Unforeseen geopolitical conflicts, major political instability, or significant global crises could dramatically increase demand for the dollar as a safe asset, irrespective of economic fundamentals. Investors tend to flock to the perceived safety and liquidity of US treasuries and the dollar during times of extreme uncertainty. Divergent Central Bank Policies: While UBS might anticipate a convergence of central bank policies, a renewed divergence, where other central banks (like the ECB or BoJ) become unexpectedly more dovish or the Fed remains significantly more hawkish, could alter currency dynamics. Data Surprises: Key economic data releases, such as surprisingly strong US jobs reports, higher-than-expected inflation figures, or robust retail sales, could challenge the narrative of impending dollar weakness and lead to a rebound. Investors should continuously monitor these factors and be prepared to adjust their strategies. A flexible approach, rather than rigid adherence to a single forecast, is key to navigating the volatile currency markets. Actionable Insights for Savvy Investors Given UBS’s strategic insights into selling USD upside , how can individual investors and those interested in the broader financial ecosystem take actionable steps? It’s about informed decision-making and strategic positioning: Stay Informed on Macro Trends: Regularly follow economic news, central bank statements, and global geopolitical developments. Understand how these factors influence currency valuations and broader market sentiment. Pay particular attention to inflation data and interest rate expectations. Evaluate Your Currency Exposure: Assess your existing portfolio for direct or indirect dollar exposure. Do you hold a lot of USD-denominated assets? Are your international investments hedged against currency fluctuations? Understanding your current positioning is the first step. Consider Diversification: If your portfolio is heavily concentrated in dollar-denominated assets, explore opportunities to diversify into other major currencies or asset classes that tend to perform well during periods of dollar weakness, such as commodities or certain emerging market assets. Explore Specific FX Strategies: For those comfortable with currency trading, research and consider strategies like shorting the dollar against potentially stronger currencies (e.g., EUR, JPY) or utilizing currency-related ETFs or options for managed exposure. Consult Financial Professionals: If you’re unsure about how to implement these strategies or assess your risk, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Monitor Institutional Outlooks: Keep an eye on reports and analyses from leading financial institutions like UBS. While not infallible, their research can offer valuable insights and help you anticipate market shifts. The opportunity to capitalize on shifts in currency dynamics is not just for institutional traders. With careful research and a strategic mindset, individual investors can also position themselves to potentially benefit from anticipated dollar weakness. Conclusion: Seizing the Strategic Opportunity in a Shifting Dollar Landscape UBS’s insightful perspective on selling USD upside offers a compelling narrative for investors navigating today’s complex financial markets. It signals a potential pivot point for the US Dollar, moving from a period of dominant strength to one where opportunities lie in positioning for consolidation or even decline. This outlook is rooted in a comprehensive Forex market analysis , considering factors like peak interest rates, global growth rebalancing, and valuation concerns. By understanding these dynamics and exploring strategic currency trading strategies , investors can prepare for potential shifts. The broader UBS outlook suggests that the forces that have propelled the dollar are losing momentum, leading to implications such as higher commodity prices, stronger emerging markets, and potentially a more favorable environment for risk assets, including an indirect boost for crypto. While risks always exist, recognizing the potential for dollar weakness allows for proactive portfolio adjustments. For savvy investors, this isn’t a call for panic, but rather an invitation to strategically re-evaluate and optimize their exposure in a constantly evolving global economy.

For those accustomed to the wild swings of Bitcoin and Ethereum, understanding the more measured yet significant movements in the Forex market can offer valuable insights into broader economic trends and even potential hedges or opportunities. Recently, a significant EUR/USD forecast has emerged from global financial giant UBS, predicting a notable strengthening of the Euro against the US Dollar, targeting the 1.20 mark. This development isn’t just a headline for traditional traders; it signals shifts in global economic power dynamics that can indirectly influence sentiment and capital flows across all asset classes, including digital assets. What’s Driving the UBS EUR/USD Forecast? UBS, a leading global financial services company, has put forth a compelling case for the Euro’s appreciation against the US Dollar. Their EUR/USD forecast of 1.20 is not merely an arbitrary number; it is rooted in a comprehensive analysis of macroeconomic factors, central bank policies, and evolving market sentiment. The primary drivers underpinning this optimistic outlook for the Euro include: European Central Bank (ECB) Policy: The ECB has maintained a hawkish stance, indicating a commitment to combat inflation through sustained interest rate hikes. This contrasts with expectations for the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is perceived to be nearing the end of its tightening cycle or even contemplating rate cuts in the near future. Higher interest rates in the Eurozone make Euro-denominated assets more attractive to international investors, increasing demand for the currency. Diverging Economic Performance: While the US economy shows signs of slowing, with concerns about a potential recession lingering, the Eurozone has demonstrated resilience. Despite initial fears, the region has largely navigated the energy crisis and is showing signs of steady, albeit modest, growth. This relative economic stability enhances the Euro’s appeal. Energy Price Normalization: The significant drop in natural gas prices from their 2022 peaks has provided a substantial tailwind for the Eurozone economy. Reduced energy costs alleviate inflationary pressures and improve the region’s terms of trade, boosting the Euro’s fundamental strength. Current Account Balance Improvement: The Eurozone’s current account balance has shown a marked improvement, shifting from deficit to surplus. This positive development indicates stronger external demand for Eurozone goods and services, contributing to capital inflows and supporting the Euro. UBS’s analysis suggests that these factors collectively create a robust environment for the Euro to gain ground. The market’s anticipation of these shifts often precedes the actual economic data, driving currency movements. Understanding the Euro USD Exchange Rate Dynamics The Euro USD exchange rate is a reflection of the economic health, monetary policy, and geopolitical stability of two of the world’s largest economic blocs: the Eurozone and the United States. Its movements are influenced by a complex interplay of forces. Historically, the EUR/USD pair has seen significant fluctuations, reacting to major global events from financial crises to trade wars. Currently, the dynamics are largely shaped by: Factor Impact on Euro (EUR) Impact on US Dollar (USD) Interest Rate Differentials Higher rates attract capital, strengthening EUR. Lower rates or rate cut expectations reduce USD appeal. Economic Growth Stronger growth signals a healthy economy, supporting EUR. Slowing growth or recession fears weaken USD. Inflation Outlook Persistent inflation may lead to more ECB hikes, boosting EUR. Declining inflation may signal Fed pause/cuts, weakening USD. Geopolitical Stability Increased stability in Europe enhances investor confidence in EUR. Global risk-off sentiment often favors USD as a safe haven. The interplay of these factors creates a dynamic environment for the Euro USD exchange rate , making it one of the most actively traded currency pairs globally. Traders and investors constantly monitor economic data releases, central bank speeches, and geopolitical developments to anticipate future movements. A Deeper Dive into Forex Market Analysis: Beyond the Headlines For any serious participant in the Forex market, a superficial understanding of news headlines is insufficient. A thorough Forex market analysis involves both fundamental and technical approaches. Fundamental analysis focuses on economic data, government policies, and geopolitical events that affect currency values. Technical analysis, on the other hand, involves studying price charts and indicators to identify patterns and predict future price movements. Fundamental Factors Driving EUR/USD: Central Bank Divergence: The differing paths of the ECB and the Fed are paramount. The ECB’s continued focus on fighting inflation, even at the risk of slower growth, supports a stronger Euro. Conversely, the Fed’s potential pivot towards easing, driven by concerns about economic slowdown or financial stability, could weigh on the Dollar. Economic Resilience: The Eurozone’s ability to withstand various shocks, including the energy crisis and high inflation, has surprised many analysts. Indicators like Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, industrial production, and consumer confidence surveys are closely watched for signs of sustained recovery. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: A country or bloc with a persistent trade surplus tends to see its currency appreciate as foreign demand for its goods and services translates into demand for its currency. Similarly, robust foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows can strengthen a currency. Technical Considerations: From a technical perspective, the EUR/USD pair has shown a tendency to respect key support and resistance levels. A move towards 1.20 would represent a significant breach of recent trading ranges and could trigger further momentum buying. Traders often look for: Breakouts: A clear break above a resistance level, like the 1.10 or 1.12 marks, often signals strong bullish momentum. Moving Averages: Crossovers of short-term and long-term moving averages can indicate shifts in trend. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator helps identify overbought or oversold conditions, providing potential entry or exit signals. Combining both fundamental and technical Forex market analysis provides a more robust framework for making informed trading decisions. However, the market is also susceptible to sudden shifts based on unexpected news or sentiment changes. The Shifting Sands: What’s Next for the USD Outlook? The other side of the EUR/USD equation is the US Dollar. A strengthening Euro inherently implies a weakening US Dollar, at least in relative terms. The current USD outlook is influenced by several factors that suggest a period of depreciation, especially against major currencies like the Euro. Federal Reserve Policy Pivot: The market widely anticipates that the Fed is either at or very near the end of its tightening cycle. Future rate hikes are likely to be limited, and discussions about potential rate cuts in late 2024 or 2025 are gaining traction. This dovish shift in monetary policy would reduce the yield advantage of US assets, making the Dollar less attractive. Inflation Deceleration: While inflation remains above the Fed’s target, there are clear signs of disinflation across various sectors of the US economy. This reduction in price pressures gives the Fed more room to ease its monetary policy without risking a resurgence of inflation. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Despite a resilient labor market, other economic indicators suggest a slowdown in the US economy. Manufacturing activity has contracted, and consumer spending, while robust, faces headwinds from high interest rates and persistent inflation. A significant slowdown or recession would typically lead to a weaker Dollar. Growing US Debt: The rising US national debt and fiscal deficits are long-term concerns that can weigh on the Dollar. While not an immediate trigger for depreciation, the sheer volume of government borrowing can erode investor confidence over time. Return of Risk Appetite: In times of global uncertainty, the US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. However, if global economic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, investors may shift capital away from safe-haven assets like the Dollar towards higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets elsewhere, including emerging markets or even alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. The confluence of these factors paints a picture of a Dollar that may struggle to maintain its strength, especially against currencies whose central banks are perceived to be more hawkish or whose economies show greater relative resilience. This shifting USD outlook is a critical component of the UBS forecast. Navigating the Waves: Practical Currency Trading Strategy Given the UBS EUR/USD forecast and the broader market dynamics, what does this mean for traders and investors? Developing a robust currency trading strategy is essential for navigating these anticipated movements. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches from ECB and Fed officials, as well as minutes from their policy meetings. Any hints about future rate decisions or changes in economic outlook can trigger significant market reactions. Track Key Economic Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PPI), employment figures (NFP, unemployment rates), GDP growth, and manufacturing/services PMIs for both the Eurozone and the US. These data points provide concrete evidence of economic trends. Consider Interest Rate Differentials: The carry trade, where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency, becomes more attractive as the interest rate differential widens in favor of the Euro. Risk Management is Paramount: Currency markets can be volatile. Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and define your risk-to-reward ratio before entering a trade. Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the EUR/USD forecast is compelling, it’s prudent to diversify across different currency pairs or asset classes to mitigate risk. For crypto investors, understanding these macro Forex trends can inform decisions on stablecoin holdings or the impact of a weaker USD on Bitcoin’s purchasing power for international buyers. Look for Technical Confirmation: Before entering a trade based on fundamental analysis, look for technical signals that confirm the direction. This could include price breaking key resistance levels, bullish candlestick patterns, or indicators signaling momentum. For those looking to capitalize on the anticipated Euro strength, a long position on EUR/USD would be the primary trade. However, always conduct your own due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor. The market can be unpredictable, and forecasts, while informed, are not guarantees. Strategy Element Actionable Insight Entry Point Consider entering long on EUR/USD during pullbacks to strong support levels or on a confirmed breakout above minor resistance. Target Price Initial targets around 1.15-1.18, with the ultimate UBS target of 1.20 as a long-term objective. Stop Loss Place stop loss below recent significant low or strong support to protect capital. Risk Management Allocate a small percentage of trading capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%). Monitoring Regularly review economic calendars, news feeds, and technical charts. The Broader Implications: Benefits and Challenges A strengthening Euro against the USD carries significant implications beyond just currency traders. For the Eurozone, a stronger Euro can make imports cheaper, helping to alleviate inflationary pressures and reducing the cost of raw materials and energy for businesses. It also enhances the purchasing power of Eurozone consumers when traveling abroad. However, it can make Eurozone exports more expensive for international buyers, potentially impacting export-oriented industries. Conversely, for the United States, a weaker Dollar makes US exports more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting manufacturing and trade. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to inflationary pressures and reduce the purchasing power of US consumers when buying foreign goods or traveling abroad. For the cryptocurrency market, a weaker USD can sometimes be seen as a positive for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. If the Dollar loses value, investors seeking to preserve purchasing power might look towards alternative assets. Furthermore, a weaker USD can make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cheaper for international buyers using stronger currencies, potentially increasing demand. However, the correlation is not always direct and depends on a multitude of other factors, including overall market sentiment, regulatory developments, and specific crypto-related news. Conclusion: A Compelling Outlook for the Euro UBS’s confident EUR/USD forecast of 1.20 signals a significant shift in the global currency landscape. Driven by the ECB’s hawkish stance, the Eurozone’s economic resilience, and the anticipated dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve, the Euro appears poised for a period of appreciation against the US Dollar. This outlook is not merely a technical projection but is deeply rooted in fundamental macroeconomic divergences between the two major economies. While the journey to 1.20 may encounter market volatility and unforeseen events, the underlying drivers suggest a compelling case for Euro strength. For investors across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro Forex trends is crucial for informed decision-making and navigating the evolving global financial environment. The ascendant path of the Euro could redefine capital flows and investment strategies in the coming months, making this a development to watch closely.

During Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest price correction, an intriguing pattern emerged: both the largest holders, known as ‘whales’ (entities holding over 10,000 BTC), and the smallest participants, everyday retail investors (those with less than 1 BTC), became net buyers. This widespread strategic move suggests a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, even when prices experience significant dips. Unveiling Strategic BTC Dip Buying: What Does It Mean? Glassnode, a prominent on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted this compelling trend via their X platform. Their data revealed that these two vastly different investor cohorts, despite their varying scales, actively engaged in buying. This isn’t merely coincidental trading; it strongly indicates deliberate BTC dip buying . When the price of Bitcoin falls, instead of succumbing to panic or selling off assets, these market participants perceive it as an invaluable opportunity to acquire more Bitcoin at a reduced cost. It’s akin to a major clearance sale for the digital asset, and smart investors are seizing the moment. Whale Activity: These colossal entities often possess sophisticated market insights, extensive resources, and well-defined long-term investment strategies. Their consistent buying during downturns typically signals robust conviction in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its intrinsic value. Retail Investor Behavior: While individual retail holdings are small, their collective action is incredibly powerful. The sheer number of retail investors participating in this buying spree demonstrates growing mainstream confidence and a shared belief that the current dip is a temporary phase, making their collective retail investor behavior a critical component of broader market sentiment. How Are Crypto Market Trends Influenced by These Groups? The combined force of both large-scale whale activity and widespread retail engagement significantly shapes overall crypto market trends . Glassnode’s analytical approach, which utilizes a 15-day moving average, provides a clear, albeit slightly delayed, snapshot of this persistent accumulation. This metric indicates that a diverse spectrum of market participants is actively involved in Bitcoin accumulation , consistently identifying value at current price levels and positioning themselves for future growth. It is crucial to understand that while insightful, this particular metric functions as a lagging indicator. It reflects buying actions that have occurred over the preceding 15 days, rather than providing real-time insights into immediate market volatility. Nevertheless, its value lies in offering profound insight into the underlying market sentiment and the strategic, long-term positioning adopted by these influential investor groups. This historical perspective can often predict future market directions more reliably than short-term fluctuations. The Astonishing Resilience: Why BTC Dip Buying Matters This coordinated and sustained buying, originating from such disparate investor groups, paints an astonishing picture of market resilience. It strongly suggests that participants are not easily swayed or discouraged by short-term price corrections. Instead, they are proactively strengthening their portfolios, preparing for what they anticipate will be future market upswings. This pattern of aggressive BTC dip buying frequently precedes significant market recoveries, as the influx of demand helps to stabilize prices and eventually propels them higher. Understanding these deep-seated patterns is fundamental for comprehensive Bitcoin market analysis . It reveals that beneath the often-turbulent surface of daily price movements, there exists a strong, unwavering foundational belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. This long-term perspective is absolutely vital for successfully navigating the inherently volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Investors who recognize these underlying trends are often better equipped to make informed decisions and capitalize on opportunities. In summary, the recent data illuminating significant Bitcoin accumulation by both ‘whales’ and everyday retail investors during a market correction serves as a powerful and encouraging signal. It profoundly highlights a widespread and growing belief in Bitcoin’s enduring long-term potential and a remarkably strategic approach to digital asset investment. This collective confidence, sustained even amidst periods of pronounced price volatility, emphatically underscores the increasing maturity and inherent resilience of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. It firmly suggests that a significant portion of the market views price dips not as alarming threats, but rather as exceptional, opportune moments to strategically expand and strengthen their Bitcoin holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin accumulation? Bitcoin accumulation refers to the process where investors steadily increase their holdings of Bitcoin, often by buying during price dips or corrections, with a long-term investment horizon in mind. Q2: Who are ‘whales’ in the crypto market? In the crypto market, ‘whales’ are individual or institutional investors who hold exceptionally large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices with their trades. For Bitcoin, Glassnode defines them as holding over 10,000 BTC. Q3: Why do whales and retail investors buy during a dip? Both whales and retail investors often buy during a dip because they view the price correction as a temporary discount. They believe the asset’s long-term value is higher, making current lower prices an attractive entry or accumulation point. Q4: Is Glassnode’s data on Bitcoin accumulation real-time? No, Glassnode explicitly states that their metric for Bitcoin accumulation is based on a 15-day average. This means it reflects trends over a period, making it a lagging indicator rather than a real-time reflection of immediate market volatility. Q5: How does this trend of accumulation impact Bitcoin’s future? This consistent Bitcoin accumulation by diverse investor groups during dips suggests strong underlying confidence and demand. It can contribute to price stability, potentially setting the stage for future market recoveries and indicating a robust, maturing ecosystem less prone to panic selling.

Despite a minor recovery to $114,000 at the time of writing, several top crypto tokens remain under pressure. Solana dropped by 10% over the past week, while XRP and Dogecoin fell 5.5% and 9.5% respectively, according to data from CoinMarketCap. These declines are particularly notable given conditions such as a decrease in Bitcoin dominance (down 5.5% in the last month). Ether’s 40% rally generally signals the beginning of altcoin rotation. But this time, the market has reacted differently. Weak Altcoin Reaction Sparks Market Caution Bitfinex analysts noted that while Bitcoin’s pullback should have, in theory, spurred a move into altcoins, speculative interest appears to be fading. “Interestingly, this break did not translate into a sustained altcoin bid — quite the opposite,” they said in a market report on Tuesday. This shift suggests investors are not rotating capital into smaller-cap coins, but rather de-risking altogether. They added that the “OTHERS” index — which tracks cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 by market cap — dropped nearly 19% in the past 10 days before seeing a modest rebound. The data, they argue, supports the theory that speculative appetite is cooling across the board. Mixed Signals as Analysts Watch for Next Move While signs point to a broader consolidation phase , optimism still lingers among some market watchers. Bitfinex analysts noted that while the current trend leans toward caution, upcoming macroeconomic news or renewed ETF inflows could quickly shift market sentiment. Some traders believe this pullback is a setup for a bigger move. Crypto analyst Ted wrote on X, “This is your best opportunity to stack utility alts before they go parabolic,” urging long-term investors not to lose sight of the bigger picture. Similarly, Merlijn The Trader highlighted that many altcoins are “coiling for a violent breakout,” drawing comparisons to historic chart patterns. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which read 55 (indicating “Altcoin Season”) on July 21, had slipped back to 40 by Tuesday — officially signaling a return to “Bitcoin Season.” The post Altcoin Market Struggle to Recover as Bitcoin Stumbles, But Hope for Alt Season Remains appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Altcoin News|Altcoin news|altcoin season,EN,0,0,MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-08-06 09:58:25

Why Ethereum Might Be The Biggest Macro Trade Lee argued there is no contradiction between his longstanding Bitcoin optimism and his conviction on Ethereum. Bitcoin, in his telling, remains the monetary primitive and store of value. Ethereum, by contrast, is the execution layer for tokenized finance. “I don’t see this as a conflict,” he said when asked why he champions both assets. Drawing an analogy to equities, he added that investors can sensibly own scarce, category-defining names in parallel: “You know you should own both.” Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Deepens As Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Hits One Of The Lowest Levels This Year The crux of Lee’s Ethereum case is the convergence of Wall Street’s tokenization push with real-world adoption of stablecoins. He described stablecoins as crypto’s first ubiquitous application and the accelerant for institutional on-chain activity. “That is the ChatGPT moment for crypto,” he said. “The first killer app for crypto has emerged… which is stablecoins, and now Wall Street is running to tokenize and maybe even financialize their entire system on the blockchain. But that means they require smart contracts.” In Lee’s assessment, “the biggest and most secure blockchain with no downtime is Ethereum. And it’s legally compliant.” He further contended that “the majority of stablecoins and real-world assets that have been tokenized are taking place on Ethereum,” positioning the network as the default venue for capital-markets infrastructure to migrate on-chain. Brunell pressed on perceived weaknesses introduced since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, including increased complexity, centralization vectors, bridge and Layer-2 attack surfaces. Lee acknowledged those critiques but weighed them against what he views as the incumbent system’s brittleness. “These risks that you describe seem like smaller risks compared to the fragility of the existing financial system,” he said, pointing to legacy “trust vectors” and fraud rates in traditional rails. In other words, even with Ethereum’s trade-offs, the relative security-and-efficiency frontier still tilts in its favor for modern financial plumbing. Related Reading: Why Ethereum to Outperform Bitcoin: $5.4B ETF Inflows, Whale Accumulation, and 2021 Breakout Pattern Lee linked his timeline to the institutional learning curve. When he first wrote about Bitcoin in 2017, he said, the investment community was just beginning to recognize a credible digital-gold thesis. “I think Ethereum is having its 2017 moment now because now is the time that Wall Street will take tokenization seriously and it’s taking place on Ethereum,” he said. That adoption vector—tokenized dollars and securities settling under programmable contracts—underpins his claim that Ethereum is the preeminent macro trade ahead. Asked to choose a single asset for the next decade, Lee resisted the premise but ultimately answered in line with his current mandate. “If I had to choose… because I’m chairman of Bitmine, which is an Ethereum treasury, then I of course would choose Ethereum,” he said. He closed by reiterating that generational shifts in technology and attitudes will keep compounding crypto’s addressable market, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum benefiting. But on the specific question of where institutional financial infrastructure is most likely to land, his stance was unambiguous: “Wall Street will take tokenization seriously and it’s taking place on Ethereum.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,625.

49631613,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77021,1754474455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"August’s Best Undervalued Crypto, Stronger Early Traction Than Chainlink (LINK) in 2018",https://timestabloid.com/augusts-best-undervalued-crypto-stronger-early-traction-than/,"In 2018, Chainlink (LINK) quietly emerged with a promise to revolutionize decentralized data transfer. While the vision was compelling, adoption was slow and utility was still theoretical. Fast forward to today, and a new project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is making waves before even hitting the open market—already attracting over 14,800 holders and securing more than $14.10 million in its presale. Unlike LINK in its infancy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the scene with a functioning dual-model lending framework, a thriving community, and a token still priced at just $0.035 during Phase 6. For those who missed LINK under $1, this may be the best second chance at a foundational crypto opportunity. A Dual Lending Model Built for DeFi’s Future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not trying to reinvent lending; it is redefining its execution. The project is being designed to revolve around two distinct lending mechanisms—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—each designed to serve different market needs while remaining part of the same ecosystem. The P2C model will offer a smart-contract-based experience that prioritizes blue-chip and stable assets. Users will be able to deposit major cryptocurrencies like AVAX, ETH, and USDT into audited smart contract pools and, in return, will receive mtTokens in 1:1, which will track their share and compound interest. For instance, a user who lends $12,000 in AVAX at a 9.6% APY will earn $1,152 per year in passive income. These mtTokens will not only appreciate in value with accrued yield, but will also serve as collateral, giving lenders dual utility for their capital. On the borrowing side, users will unlock stablecoin liquidity without giving up exposure to long-term price growth of their blue-chip holdings. Someone who deposits $4,000 worth of XRP into the protocol will be able to borrow $2,600 in stablecoins, based on a 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This will create a new dynamic where users maintain upside exposure while still accessing liquid capital—ideal for trading, yield farming, or covering real-world expenses. For riskier, more volatile assets such as meme tokens—think DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE—the platform will introduce a separate P2P lending layer. This structure will isolate unstable tokens from the main liquidity pools, protecting P2C participants from unwanted volatility. In this format, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates, repayment periods, and collateral preferences through smart contracts. The absence of pooled risk will empower both parties with control and the potential for significantly higher yields, especially for those willing to back less liquid assets. Safety will remain a focal point across both models. Every loan will need to be overcollateralized and backed by a Stability Factor that will determine the health of the collateral. If a borrower’s position weakens, the protocol will initiate liquidation, allowing third-party liquidators to purchase the debt at a discount while maintaining solvency throughout the system. Presale Surge, Institutional-Level Security, and an Imminent Price Hike Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the middle of its presale Phase 6, currently priced at $0.035 per token with 10% of the phase already sold. This price is not expected to last. Once this phase concludes, the token price will rise by 15% to $0.040, marking the final opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at the current discounted rate. With over 12,000 followers on Twitter and increasing traction daily, early adopters are flocking to the project not just for the potential upside, but also for its deep foundation. The platform has undergone an extensive CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00, verifying both its contract integrity and ongoing monitoring standards. For further assurance, a $50,000 bug bounty is in place, with reward tiers going as high as $2,000 for critical issues and scaling down to $200 for low-severity findings. These programs help ensure the protocol is battle-tested before its mainnet goes live. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway is actively rewarding early believers, with ten winners receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. These types of community-centered initiatives are helping to build a loyal holder base and generate organic growth. Notably, users who swapped their BTC, SOL, or ETH in Phase 1 when the price was just $0.01 have already achieved 250% gains at the current rate—well before the token even lists publicly at its projected launch price of $0.06. The post-listing outlook targets exponential growth, with expectations bolstered by the upcoming beta release and potential listings on top-tier exchanges such as Binance, MEXC, and Coinbase. This momentum mirrors what LINK lacked in its early days—structured infrastructure, user utility, and measurable adoption. With more users interacting with the platform once it launches, and growing interest from centralized exchanges, market demand is expected to surge rapidly. For anyone who missed Chainlink (LINK)’s launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to present a rare second chance—one that is still early, still affordable, and, perhaps most importantly, already far more developed.

Grok Reveals Why August Looks Bullish: Buying $Hyper Could Help You Ride This Surge August 6, 2025 • 10:00 UTC After a sweltering July, the latest dip at the start of August has left many experts perplexed about what to expect this month. Grok, however, used its expert analysis and insights, along with its integration with X, which is a hub for both big and small crypto updates, to connect the dots. And the larger picture? Still undeniably bullish. According to Grok, there are several reasons to remain optimistic not just for August, but potentially for all of 2025. These include: The US passing the GENIUS Act in July , which provides regulatory clarity around crypto. Large corporations like SharpLink (now holding $2B worth of $ETH ), Metaplanet (which announced plans to buy 200K $BTC by 2028 ), and Cango ( mined 450 BTC in July ) rapidly increasing their crypto holdings. Emerging economies like Brazil exploring crypto integration by laying the groundwork for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Now, if you want to make the most of this momentum, we recommend checking out a presale crypto, specifically Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . $HYPER is perfectly positioned to ride the broader market’s upside, as it aims to supercharge Bitcoin itself, aka the granddaddy of all cryptos. It’s building a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and use a canonical bridge to bring lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to Bitcoin.

August 6, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is trading at $114K today, down some 7% from its mid-July peak of $123K, but still nearly 5% up over the month. Even so, price action has flattened, with resistance near $116K and support holding around $112K. Fading momentum and low trading volume suggest investors are waiting for a decisive move. Wider economic uncertainty is also weighing heavily on sentiment. With mixed macro signals and cautious rate outlooks, Bitcoin’s retraction reflects the broader market indecision. Still, $BTC remains in a rising channel , hinting at potential upside if bulls regain control. Analysts note that similar quiet climbs have historically led to stronger Q3 rallies. A rising channel indicates accumulation and confidence, even if price action feels slow. It’s a setup that often attracts speculative capital into altcoins and presales, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . One of the best new meme coins on presale , Bitcoin Hyper intends to scale $BTC for the next breakout. Presales like Bitcoin Hyper, with their preset price increases, could see a rise in interest as traders look for guaranteed short-term returns as Bitcoin stabilizes.

Investors have been selling for weeks, but the market is seeing signs of seller exhaustion. However, on-chain research firm Glassnode says the market structure of the leading cryptocurrency is still fragile, and this makes BTC vulnerable to further declines. Sellers Are Getting Exhausted The momentum pause is evident in data across Bitcoin’s spot, futures, options, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) markets. These sectors show that investor risk appetite is moderating, there is cautious positioning, and liquidity is thinning after a period of euphoria. Analyzing the spot market, Glassnode found weakened conditions, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling from 47.4 to 35.8. The RSI is now below its low band, signaling oversold territory. Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) reflects intensifying selling pressure and has declined sharply from -$107.1 million to -$220 million. Additionally, spot volume levels reflect declining liquidity and softer investor participation, plunging from $8.4 billion to $7.5 billion. For the futures market, Bitcoin open interest has slipped from $45.6 billion to $44.9 billion, highlighting a mild position unwinding. Glassnode found that long-side funding fell 33% to $3.1 million, while perpetual CVD declined from -$1.2 billion to -$1.8 billion. This dynamic underscores a pullback in leveraged bullish demand, distribution, and disengagement among market participants. Bitcoin ETFs on Outflow Streak Furthermore, the options market shows Bitcoin open interest tumbling 8.4% to $39.8 billion, with the volatility spread narrowing from 23.84% to 16.26%. There is reduced speculative activity among investors, and less risk is being priced in. Notably, there is high demand for downside protection and rising hedging sentiment, as seen in the 25 Delta Skew rising above its high band to 5.51%. Bitcoin ETFs have been on an outflow streak for the past four trading days. Their net inflows have sunk 25% to less than $270 million, a figure below the low band. This signals weak institutional demand. “On-chain fundamentals were mixed: active addresses rose 3.6% to 729k, while transfer volume dropped 13.9% to $9.4B and fees declined 14.4% to $483.2K, signaling quieter network activity,” Glassnode added. While momentum continues to cool off, the Bitcoin market is retesting the low-liquidity range below the $114,000 threshold. Oversold conditions and seller exhaustion suggest a bounce may be on the way; however, growing fragility may give room for negative triggers and delayed recovery.

This comes as Bitcoin retreated further from the $120,000 resistance level amid a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. Looking at the price outlook, the asset’s weekly Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has dropped below the 14-week Simple Moving Average ( SMA ), a pattern that has historically signaled downturns in Bitcoin’s price, according to an analysis by cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez posted on August 6. Bitcoin price analysis. Source: TradingView Notably, in June 2024, a similar RSI breakdown preceded a nearly 23% decline, while another instance in December 2024 saw Bitcoin fall more than 25%. The same signal has now reappeared in early August 2025, with Bitcoin trading around $113,000. According to Martinez, if history repeats, Bitcoin could fall between 20% and 30% from its recent highs, placing a potential downside target near $95,000. The possibility of a further plunge is reinforced by broader market weakness, as Bitcoin failed to hold the $115,000 level. On-chain data also supports the idea that Bitcoin may have topped out. On August 5, whales dormant for 7–10 years moved 3,000 BTC, a behavior that has historically signaled local tops. This pattern suggests investors should brace for possible losses.

However, the 14-day RSI stands at 46.56, pointing to weakening momentum and a lack of bullish strength. While the price remains well above the 200-day SMA of $91,911, indicating a longer-term uptrend, the neutral sentiment and RSI levels suggest potential consolidation ahead.

49635611,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/claude-ai-predicts-solana-breaking-500-sooner-than-you-think-2025-price-targets-revealed,1754480217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/49635611.jpeg,Claude AI Predicts Solana Breaking $500 Sooner Than You Think — 2025 Price Targets Revealed,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/claude-ai-predicts-solana-breaking-500-sooner-than-you-think-2025-price-targets-revealed,"Solana has spent much of 2025 doing the quiet work that markets tend to notice late: processing hundreds of millions of transactions per day with 99.99% uptime, scaling developer adoption, and pulling real economic activity on-chain. Meanwhile, price has been range-bound. In August 2025, SOL is rotating between $164–$168, still capped by a familiar $180–$188 ceiling. The disconnect is striking enough to ask a simple question: is the market underpricing Solana’s execution? Cryptona.co forecasts that this consolidation phase could resolve to the upside if SOL breaks through $188 with volume, opening the path to $200–$206 in the short term and potentially much higher levels in 2025 if catalysts align. The network continues to post leadership metrics—throughput, stability, and growing DeFi share—while the institutional plumbing (custody, liquidity, and potential ETF access) comes into focus. What the Tape Says (August 2025) Technically, SOL remains constructive despite a soft near-term momentum profile. RSI in the low-to-mid 40s points to neutral conditions, MACD leans mildly bearish, and yet price holds above its 200-day moving average near $162, preserving the longer-term uptrend structure. Spot volumes in the mid-single-billions and a summer peak in futures activity suggest ongoing accumulation during consolidation. For traders, the map is straightforward: acceptance above $188 puts $200–$206 in play; lose $160–$162, and the $155–$157 area becomes the line to defend. Key Levels (Aug 2025) Support Pivot Resistance $155–$157 $164–$168 $180–$188 → $200–$206 Under the Hood: Why Fundamentals Still Lead Solana’s throughput now regularly clears 550M+ daily transactions, backed by 15+ months of stable operation. Developer momentum remains a tailwind, with the platform attracting more new builders than any competing smart-contract ecosystem through 2024 and into 2025. On the demand side, DeFi traction has pushed TVL into the multi-billion range, decentralized exchange activity is disproportionately concentrated on Solana, and stablecoin flows continue to deepen on-chain liquidity. Corporate and institutional footprints—from tokenized funds to enterprise integrations—are broadening utility and lowering the perceived operational risk of building on Solana. The upgrade path matters just as much. Firedancer, a C++ validator client engineered for massive parallelism, targets a step-function increase in capacity (well into the million-TPS realm in testing). Smooth mainnet rollout could be a decisive catalyst for repricing, shifting Solana from “fast enough” to “structural advantage” in the eyes of institutional allocators. The Institutional Channel ETF odds remain elevated in prevailing models, and large-cap issuers are positioned to go live quickly once approvals drop. Internal estimates on the Street point to potential $3–$6B of net new assets in the first 6–12 months post-approval, a scale that would open discretionary and advisory channels still gated today. Put simply, regulatory clarity unlocks participation—not just from funds, but from corporate treasuries, market-making desks, and risk-managed allocators who require rule-of-law guardrails. Analysts at Cryptona anticipate that ETF-driven demand will broaden the holder base, reduce funding volatility, and deepen derivatives markets—conditions that could raise Solana’s valuation floor even without immediate retail mania. Claude’s Price Scenarios for SOL Analysts from Cryptona.co asked Claude for detailed projections on Solana’s potential price trajectory over the next two market cycles. The discussion focused on how network adoption, technological milestones like the Firedancer upgrade, and institutional market entry could interact to influence valuation. Claude noted that price targets are not certainties but probability-weighted outcomes based on current data and assumptions. In the conservative view, Solana grows steadily with moderate adoption, while the base case envisions significant capital inflows following ETF approval and continued DeFi dominance. The bullish case assumes accelerated adoption from both retail and institutional channels, while the extreme bull scenario models a best-case alignment of macro conditions, technology scaling, and global regulatory clarity. Year Conservative Base Bullish Extreme Bull 2025 $300–$400 $500–$800 $1,000+ — 2030 $800–$1,200 $1,500–$2,000 $2,500+ $3,211 According to Claude, these figures represent guide rails rather than fixed destinations. The actual path Solana takes will depend on how quickly the network converts technical capacity into sustained economic activity, how effectively institutional demand materializes, and whether the broader crypto market enters a new multi-year growth phase. Putting It Together This market has been content to wait for evidence. Solana is now supplying it: throughput without fragility, developers without subsidies, DeFi depth without artificial incentives, and a credible path to institutional participation. If $180–$188 is convincingly reclaimed, momentum systems will likely recalibrate higher; if price retests $160–$162, the longer-term setup remains intact so long as fundamentals keep compounding. Cryptona.co forecasts that patient accumulation in this range could position holders for significant upside if key catalysts—ETF approval, Firedancer launch, and sustained DeFi leadership—materialize in the next 12–18 months.

This stagnation poses a crucial question: is the market undervaluing Solana's true potential? According to Cryptona.co , a breakout above the $188 resistance could set the stage for reaching higher thresholds around $200-$206 in the near term. This scenario hinges on maintaining key technical levels and positive market conditions. Technical Analysis and Future Outlook Currently, Solana's technical indicators suggest a balanced momentum. Despite a mild bearish tilt in MACD and an RSI reflecting neutrality, Solana's price resilience above its 200-day moving average suggests underlying strength. Traders should watch for a successful breach above $188, which could potentially lead to higher valuations in line with increased market acceptance. Key Technical and Price Levels as of August 2025 Support Pivot Resistance $155–$157 $164–$168 $180–$188 → $200–$206 The Catalysts Behind Solana's Future Growth Solana's impressive transaction volume, consistent operational stability, and increasing dominance in the DeFi space are pivotal for its growth. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade promises massive scalability improvements that could significantly enhance Solana's network capacity and efficiency. The Impact of Institutional Involvement and ETF Approvals The likelihood of ETF approval remains high, with significant implications for Solana's market access and stability. Analysts at Cryptona project that ETF approvals could attract billions in new assets, thereby stabilizing and potentially elevating Solana's market valuation. Comprehensive Price Projections for Solana (2025 - 2030) Year Conservative Base Bullish Extreme Bull 2025 $300–$400 $500–$800 $1,000+ — 2030 $800–$1,200 $1,500–$2,000 $2,500+ $3,211 Market Dynamics and External Factors Influencing SOL's Price Trajectory The projected price points for Solana are not set in stone but represent potential outcomes influenced by market dynamics, technological advancements, and regulatory developments. In conclusion, Solana's path to achieving and possibly exceeding these price targets will largely depend on its ability to maintain operational excellence and adapt to evolving market conditions. A sustained effort towards technological upgrades and securing regulatory approvals will be crucial for Solana's long-term success. Cryptona.co emphasizes that these insights should guide potential investors about Solana's capabilities and market prospects. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Cardano news revolves around upgrades to scalability, developer tools and interoperability, Remittix is catching the attention of investors looking for a quicker, more accessible growth opportunity. Cardano’s Upgrade Sparks Concerns Amid Growing Competition Cardano’s decision to invest $71 million into a year-long upgrade has been a topic of hot debate in the community. Although this will enhance the scalability of ADA, provide developers with more resources and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, not every holder of Cardano is convinced. There has been a question of transparency of how the money will be spent and people wonder whether the upgrade is the correct way to make Cardano remain competitive against other competitors such as Solana and Ethereum. Despite the community’s backing of the upgrade in theory, many ADA holders are expressing frustration over the lack of clear updates and the significant cost involved. Could this be an indication that ADA price growth has plateaued and that Cardano news isn’t enough to keep pace with the rapidly evolving blockchain space? Remittix Gaining Traction as Investors Look for Real Utility While Cardano’s upgrade remains uncertain, Remittix is quietly taking off. Investors are flocking to Remittix, recognizing it as a low-priced token with major growth potential, offering the real-world utility that many ADA holders crave. Having raised over $18.1 million and sold over 582 million tokens at just $0.0895, Remittix is showing impressive signs of growth. Set to release its wallet beta on September 15, Remittix is on track to become the next big player in the cross-border payments space, offering users a simple, fast and secure way to transfer assets globally, something Cardano has yet to deliver in the same way. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum Over ADA $18.1M+ Raised , with strong community backing Full Wallet Beta Launching Sept 15 — ready for global use 40% Token Bonus for early investors Real-World Use Cases in global remittances and payments With Remittix offering actual utility and ADA holders concerned about the long-term impact of Cardano’s hefty upgrade, the future looks bright for Remittix as the new go-to altcoin for 2025. Why Investors Are Shifting Their Focus to Remittix While Cardano’s $71 million upgrade sounds promising, it has left many investors frustrated by the lack of transparency. Remittix, on the other hand, is seeing real-time growth, offering an easy-to-use wallet and growing use cases in the cross-border crypto payments market. As ADA holders begin to rethink their position, Remittix is the top altcoin they’re increasingly flocking to, ready to take advantage of the real-world utility that ADA price changes cannot deliver immediately.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits TRON’s Spotlight: A Stage Where Creators Keep the Mic (and the Money) TRON (TRX) is a digital highway built in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It first lived on the Ethereum road but soon got its own track. The plan is clear: give artists, gamers and writers full control of their work. Fans can tip them straight away, with no gatekeepers like YouTube or Apple eating the pie. Each thank-you travels in TRX coins, reaching the maker in seconds. The network runs quick code, lets anyone build apps, and keeps every move on a public book. Fees sit near zero, so even tiny payments make sense. This has lured game studios, music hubs and finance fans who want a cheaper place than Ethereum. TRX has held firm while some coins sank, helped by steady use and high daily trade. If the next market upswing rewards busy networks, this coin may shine brighter. As more people seek fair pay online, TRON’s stage could get crowded—and that can lift its token too. LUNC Rises Again: Why Terra Classic Still Turns Heads Terra began in 2018 with one bold goal: make digital money feel like cash. Its network links coins to real-world currencies, so prices stay steady while transfers stay quick. In 2019 the chain went live, serving dollar, won, tugrik, and IMF basket pairs. A hard split in May 2022 created a fresh Terra (now called LUNA) and left the first chain as Terra Classic, powered by the renamed LUNA Classic, or LUNC. Many see the “Classic” tag as a nod to Ethereum’s famous fork. Today LUNC runs on the same fast rails, yet it is steered by a lively community, not big firms. Fees stay tiny, blocks settle in seconds, and regular token burns aim to trim supply. That mix of speed, low cost, and a shrinking coin count gives LUNC a story that traders watch closely, especially while newer chains fight high gas and slow finality. Bitcoin may set the tone and Ethereum may host the apps, but Terra Classic hopes to win users who simply want cheap, stable, everyday payments. Stellar Lumens: The Friendly Bridge for Global Money Moves Stellar is a world money highway. It is open to all and run by many computers, not one boss. People can send dollars, euros, or even Bitcoin across it in a few seconds. The fee is a tiny slice of a cent. The network’s own coin is called Stellar Lumens, or XLM. Born in 2014 with help from Stripe, it has already moved billions of payments and teamed up with big names. Users only need a phone app to join. The next market wave is hunting for coins that do useful work, not just buzz. XLM fits that idea. It acts like oil for a bridge that links banks, wallets, and new apps such as NFTs or small smart deals. Energy use is low, and the supply is fixed, unlike many coins that grow forever. XLM still trades well below its old peak, so some see a value window before the wider crowd returns. If cash moves keep rising on Stellar and more firms plug in, the coin could shine brighter in this cycle. Kaspa's Lightning Blocks: Why KAS Could Outrun The Crowd Kaspa, ticker KAS, is a proof-of-work coin built for speed. It runs on a fresh idea called the GHOSTDAG protocol. When many miners find blocks at once, most chains throw the extra blocks away. Kaspa keeps them all and lines them up in order. This makes a woven web, not a single chain. Thanks to this trick, the network already makes one block per second and hopes to hit ten or even one hundred. Confirmations feel almost instant, limited only by how fast the internet moves. Under the hood, Kaspa packs handy extras like Reachability for map-like searches, smart pruning that trims old data, and light SPV proofs for phones. Future subnetworks could let builders launch layer-two apps with ease. In a market that rewards speed, low fees, and real proof-of-work security, KAS checks many boxes. Bitcoin is slow; Ethereum is busy; Solana is not PoW at all. Kaspa sits in a sweet spot and still has a small value compared with the giants. Many traders now watch it as a possible next-cycle star. Conclusion TRX, LUNC, XLM, and KAS all show strong growth potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by merging sports passion and meme excitement. Early entry offers unique upside as the project targets lasting impact and impressive gains.

While many investors focus on well-known assets like XRP, several less prominent coins offer significant growth prospects, often at a lower entry cost. A Closer Look at XYZVerse's Rising Popularity The cryptocurrency $XYZ, part of XYZVerse, has recently made headlines by hitting a significant $15M in capitalization, reflecting its growing acceptance and investor interest. The project distinguishes itself by integrating sports excitement with meme culture, supported by a solid utility framework and partnerships, such as its recent collaboration with bookmaker.XYZ. This partnership underscores its innovative approach by merging betting with token benefits. TRON: Empowering Creators on Its Unique Platform Since its inception, TRON has aimed to revolutionize how creators receive compensation for their work, offering a direct earnings platform without intermediaries, utilizing its native TRX token. The Resilience of Terra Classic (LUNC) Despite setbacks, Terra Classic continues to attract attention with its robust infrastructure and community-led governance, proving its persistence in the competitive crypto market. Stellar Lumens: Facilitating Efficient Cross-Border Transactions Stellar Lumens stands out with its low-cost transaction model and scalability, making it an attractive option for users needing efficient international money transfers. Kaspa: Innovating with Speed and Scalability Kaspa's use of the GHOSTDAG protocol allows it to handle transactions at an unprecedented speed, making it a noteworthy contender in the market for its technical innovations. Conclusion While XRP is a staple in many crypto portfolios, the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market means that newer and less-known coins like TRX, LUNC, XLM, and KAS also hold considerable promise, with XYZVerse particularly standing out due to its unique market positioning and potential for high returns.

The investors include institutional participation from Singapore’s GreenVision Fund, Jkapital Ltd., and Bearcat, alongside a prominent U.S. public company chairman. This diverse investor group shares a unified conviction: prediction markets represent a transformational shift in how society generates, exchanges, and values information. These funds will accelerate Bayes Market’s product development, regional expansion, and user growth—particularly across Asia , where social and cultural dynamics align naturally with prediction markets. According to the CEO of GreenVision, “Prediction markets are not just a trend—they are the future of how societies find a shared-reality in complex world. Bayes team has the right vision to scale this movement.” Mass Adoption Underway The year 2025 marks a turning point for the prediction market industry. Polymarket’s integration with X and Kalshi’s $2B valuation signal that the industry is moving towards the mainstream. As trust in centralized narratives erode, prediction markets offer a credible, participatory alternative—surfacing diverse viewpoints and aligning incentives for individual expression. Prediction markets were never by nature solely for crypto-native users. Human beings are inherently driven to predict. Whether guessing the outcome of a reality show or speculating on political developments, people engage in informal forecasting daily. Prediction markets formalize this instinct, offering structure, visibility, and rewards. They are not tools for speculators alone—they are an evolution of how people interact with real-world uncertainty. Bayes Market distinguishes itself by focusing on intuitive design, culturally relevant markets across Asia and a strong emphasis on user empowerment. These features enable a familiar, social, and gamified experience—they are social signals embedded in daily life. A New Intelligence Infrastructure for a Decentralized Future As demand grows for open, transparent, and decentralized systems, prediction markets are poised to become a core infrastructure of the information economy. Bayes Market is not just building a product—it is building a public good: a participatory framework for decentralized intelligence. In an age defined by uncertainty, Bayes Market innovates prediction markets holding the belief that they are not an anomaly of crypto—they are the natural evolution of how society as a whole engages with the future.

As whispers of large gains swirl, more investors are taking notice. Talk of a possible price explosion adds to the excitement. What is driving this surge, and could the next big rally be just ahead? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million.

The token still sits 7.15% higher than a month ago, yet it lags 22.07% over six months. Short-term traders see a tug-of-war near the upper edge of the current band. The 10-day average at 0.00001241 hovers just above the 100-day line at 0.00001218, hinting at mild upward bias. RSI at 44.82 is neutral-to-soft, but a 15.65 stochastic signals oversold conditions. MACD edges into positive territory, suggesting momentum could flip bullish if volume picks up. If buyers clear 0.00001384, the first ceiling at 0.00001549 lies 12% higher. A decisive break might stretch toward 0.00001826, adding roughly 32% from the top of the current range. Failure to hold 0.00001107 risks a slide to 0.00000995, a 28% drop, with deeper support at 0.000007183, about 48% below. Indicators lean toward a cautious recovery, but the chart still demands a clean push above resistance to confirm an uptrend. Conclusion SHIB has shown impressive gains and strong communities.

According to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, Marius Marian stole $507,916 in Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) funds from those who rely on the money to cover basic expenses. He also pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States following an aggravated felony conviction and making false statements on his asylum application. Beginning in March 2024, Marian fraudulently obtained EBT funds by using over 601 unique victim EBT account identifiers. EBT benefits are federal funds distributed through the California Department of Social Services to low-income individuals to use for such things as food, rent, childcare and medical expenses. Marian used skimmer devices on ATM and point-of-sale machines to capture the victims’ EBT card numbers when the victims used the cards. He then encoded the stolen EBT account information on counterfeit bank cards and used them to fraudulently withdraw EBT funds from ATMs in Northern California. “As a result of his scheme, Marian withdrew $507,916 in cash and intended to withdraw $611,845 in EBT funds. Marian further admitted that his conduct involved sophisticated means and caused substantial financial hardship to at least 25 victims. Additionally, Marian admitted that on or around April 27, 2023, he knowingly submitted false statements on an application for asylum to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Specifically, Marian knowingly failed to disclose in his asylum application that he had been previously deported from the United States and that he had previously been convicted in 2019 of bank fraud. Finally, Marian acknowledged that he had been previously deported after his 2019 conviction for bank fraud and that he thereafter illegally reentered and was found in the United States.” For theft of the EBT funds, Marian pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. The illegal entry into the US charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, while the asylum fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Marian is due back in court for sentencing on October 20th.

Despite the dip, sentiment remains constructive as the macro picture settles: the Federal Reserve chose to keep rates steady this week, and a sweeping new U.S. crypto strategy was unveiled, offering regulatory clarity many companies have been waiting for. The largest cryptocurrency hit a low of $111,903 before recovering. At the time of writing, it trades around $113,430. While that’s down from its recent local high near $119,000, Bitcoin still shows year-to-date gains of nearly 25%, comfortably outperforming major U.S. stock indices and retaining strong institutional support. At the July meeting, the Federal Reserve opted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it’s held since December. Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious tone suggested rates could stay elevated longer than markets had hoped, despite rising political pressure for cuts. Notably, two Fed governors, Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller, dissented from the decision, advocating for a 25 basis point cut. It was the first such split since 1993. “The Fed is clearly in wait-and-see mode,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital. “Mentions of tariffs pushing up goods prices show they’re still watching inflation closely. For crypto, that likely means sideways price action until we get a clearer signal on cuts.” Still, crypto investors aren’t waiting on the Fed alone. Analysts say this cycle’s momentum appears more durable than previous rallies, driven less by retail speculation and more by institutional inflows, including record volumes into spot Bitcoin ETFs and a wave of corporate adoption of crypto as a treasury asset. Adding to the macro narrative: On Wednesday, the White House released a 163-page national digital asset strategy – the most comprehensive federal crypto framework to date. The report outlines regulatory objectives for stablecoin oversight, tax policy, and the use of enforcement powers by the SEC and CFTC. It also backs legislative proposals like the Clarity Act, which could standardize how tokens are classified and traded in the U.S. While the document largely reaffirms priorities already voiced by the Trump administration, industry observers welcomed the increased visibility. One White House official called it “the most comprehensive piece of work on digital assets that’s ever been produced.” Importantly, the report urges companies to begin preparing now, even in the absence of new legislation. The message is clear: regulatory clarity is approaching, and those waiting on the sidelines may soon be left behind. Projects looking to attract institutional capital or pursue public listings have started to respond. Many are restructuring their legal entities, auditing token models, and aligning with U.S. market disclosure standards (often behind the scenes). For these teams, compliance isn’t a reaction to enforcement risk but a signal of maturity, a way to build trust with investors before the next wave of capital fully arrives. Experts across global legal and financial circles have begun weighing in on what this moment means for companies operating at the intersection of crypto and capital markets. Among them is Lionel Iruk Esq., a seasoned blockchain and fintech attorney who leads legal and regulatory strategy at NAVmarkets . With deep experience navigating both U.S. securities law and international compliance frameworks, Iruk advises teams preparing for token-to-equity transitions, public listings, and global treasury alignment. “The Fed holding rates steady keeps the macro landscape predictable for now, but the real shift is regulatory,” Iruk said. “Clearer policy signals, especially from the White House, are prompting serious teams to lock in legal frameworks, structure their asset strategies, and prepare for broader market participation across jurisdictions.” At NAVMarkets, Iruk leads legal and regulatory strategy for both crypto-native and traditional companies seeking to align their asset models with capital market requirements, often as part of a broader transition toward public-market readiness or strategic crypto integration. NAVMarkets Helps Both Sides of the Market Prepare for Real Adoption NAVMarkets guides both Web2 and Web3 companies through the tricky parts of crypto, like regulation, fundraising, and going public, so they can focus on growth. With U.S. crypto policy starting to take shape and the Federal Reserve signaling steady interest rates, companies on both sides of the aisle are rethinking how they approach structure, compliance, and capital strategy. For traditional businesses, many of which are exploring blockchain integration for the first time, NAV helps build the legal and financial foundations to enter crypto markets responsibly. That could mean launching a tokenized product, onboarding Bitcoin as part of a treasury strategy, or creating a compliant blockchain subsidiary without exposing the core business. The focus is on long-term flexibility and regulatory alignment, especially as global scrutiny of digital assets increases. NAV also works with crypto-native teams looking to mature their operations and access traditional capital markets. Their support ranges from corporate restructuring to public listings via reverse mergers, SPACs, or uplistings, often through dual-asset structures that combine a company’s token ecosystem with a traditional equity layer. This hybrid approach can make regulators and institutional investors more comfortable, particularly when combined with clear governance and disclosure practices. Bitcoin treasury strategies have also become part of NAV’s playbook, especially as more companies look for ways to hedge inflation and align with investor expectations. With corporate Bitcoin allocations hitting record highs this year, there’s growing interest in doing it the right way – from custody and legal structuring to audit-ready reporting across jurisdictions. Market Outlook The next few months could prove decisive for crypto’s long-term relationship with traditional finance. With the Fed holding rates steady and regulatory guidance beginning to take shape, investors and operators alike are preparing for a market where compliance and clarity matter more than ever. Bitcoin’s dip below $112,000 may have rattled some short-term traders, but many see it as a natural correction after a strong multi-month rally. As spot ETFs continue to evolve and global regulation firms up, the long-term case for Bitcoin as both a treasury asset and capital markets gateway remains intact. While macro headlines may continue to swing sentiment in the short term, the deeper shift is structural: crypto is slowly being absorbed into the frameworks of public markets, regulated funds, and institutional portfolios. This means companies, whether they started in Web2 or Web3, need a way to participate without getting caught offside. “We’re entering a phase where strong legal footing and real-world alignment matter just as much as tech innovation,” said Lionel. “The companies that prepare early, on both the crypto and traditional side, will have more options when the next wave of capital hits.” As policy frameworks continue to solidify and investor expectations rise, firms that took the time to build real infrastructure may be best positioned – not just to list, but to lead in the next chapter of digital finance.

49635994,549272,1754481088,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49635994.jpeg,Philippines to Solidify Its Web3 Stance at ASEAN 2026 – New Cryptos to Watch Before Global Hype,https://bitcoinist.com/new-cryptos-to-buy-before-phillipines-asean-2026/,"As the Philippines gears up to host the 44th ASEAN Summit in 2026, the Philippines’ Trade Secretary Cristina Roque and President Marcos Jr. are pushing to showcase the country’s strides in tech and innovation. With its growing reputation as one of Southeast Asia’s most crypto-friendly nations, and Donald Trump possibly joining the summit, now could be a favorable time to check out new crypto projects to watch – before they likely gain more global traction following the newfound hype. Philippine President Invites Trump to ASEAN Summit ASEAN Summit is more than just another tech event; it’s the Philippines’ opportunity to showcase itself as a forward-thinking nation that embraces cutting-edge technologies in the Web3 sector. The Philippines is one of Southeast Asia’s most progressive nations in embracing digital assets and ranks 20th globally in crypto wealth . So, it’s no wonder that Roque wants to spotlight it as a digital leader at the upcoming ASEAN Summit. Her vision closely aligns with Marcos Jr’s broader agenda to modernize infrastructure, drive economic growth, and strengthen regional ties. Interestingly, ASEAN 2026 will mark 80 years of US-Philippine ties and 75 years of the Mutual Defense Treaty. In preparation, Marcos has formed a National Organizing Council and invited US President Donald Trump to attend the summit. ‘I look forward to hosting President Trump next year to attend the ASEAN meetings under the Philippines’ chair, which also coincides with the commemoration of our 80th year of diplomatic ties and 75 years of the Mutual Defense Treaty,’ said Marcos . Trump is extremely pro-crypto, as evidenced by his Working Group on Digital Assets recently dropping a report on improving US crypto access and regulation. So, his presence would highlight the Philippines’ commitment to decentralized technologies. All of this is big news for the crypto space. With the Philippines set to showcase its digital asset leadership and Trump possibly drawing in even more attention, there’s a strong chance investor interest will spike. Suppose Marcos JR gets his way and Trump attends, there might not be any better time to invest in top cryptos – like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , TOKEN6900 ($T6900) , and OpenServ ($SERV) – before they possibly attract more mainstream investors and skyrocket. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram Trading Bot to Offer Secure Swaps & Copy Trading Snorter Token ($SNORT) has a compelling offer for those eyeing early-stage crypto with strong profit potential. That’s because it serves as an access token for the Snorter Bot – an upcoming Telegram trading bot that finds top trending tokens, letting you potentially snag the next crypto to explode . Once launched this quarter, the bot will assist your trades with MEV-protected , sub-second swaps, as well as automated profit taking through limit orders. It’ll first launch on the Solana, promising the lowest fees (just 0.85%) and the fastest execution on the network compared to other trading bots. Just look at Maestro, Trojan, and Banana Gun, for instance: It’ll then expand to Ethereum and BNB Chain, followed by Polygon and Base. As such, it’ll give you seamless access to top networks and expand your reach when searching for high-potential tokens. And you need not worry about scams. Snorter Bot will have honeypot and rugpull detection, helping you to avoid common crypto traps. You can get involved by purchasing $SNORT on presale for just $0.1005. Be sure to hold the coin for extra perks, like early access to new features and bot upgrades. When the bot becomes fully functional and expands across multiple chains in early 2026, $SNORT could potentially surge to $1.92 . No better time to visit the $SNORT presale for +1,800% potential. 2. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – Vibes-Only Meme Coin That’s ‘1X Better Than $SPX’ TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is an ERC-20 meme coin that proudly rebels against typical TradFi and DeFi ethos alike. Instead of offering clear guidelines and roadmaps, it embraces its lack of fundamentals and utility, thriving on degen humor and social media hype instead. Its ultimate aim is to out-meme and out-pump its predecessor, SPX6900 ($SPX), another ‘shitcoin’ that currently sits on an eye-boggling $1.56B market cap . TOKEN6900, however, sets itself apart from $SPX through pure pettiness, adding exactly one extra token to its supply. According to its whitepaper , this makes $T6900 ‘1x better’ – an ironic jab, but one that perfectly showcases this meme coin’s energy. Despite its degenerate attitude, you can rest assured $T6900 isn’t a rug. Its smart contract audits by Coinsult and SolidProof confirm this, classifying the project as low risk. The token creators can’t set hidden fees or block holders from trading. No honeypot risks, no shady minting behind the scenes. The contract ownership is also renounced, making $T6900 decentralized. To say it simply, it’s a great option if you’re chasing the next big hype coin that embraces chaos and community sentiment. This is especially true when taking into account that it has already scooped up over $1.6M on presale, despite one coin currently only costing $0.00685. Check the TOKEN6900 presale to experience the chaos for yourself. 3. OpenServ ($SERV) – AI Token Surges 63% Ahead of OpenServ’s Mainnet Launch $SERV is the linchpin of the OpenServ Network, a cutting-edge AI ecosystem built to power agent-driven automation across Web2 and Web3 workflows. In a nutshell, it aims to use the intelligence of agents to transform how organizations operate, for example through automating tasks to accelerate workflows. As the native utility token that powers OpenServ’s decentralized AI infrastructure, $SERV is used to: Access AI agents, Pay for compute and storage resources, Reward network contributors. To further create long-term value and encourage active participation, $SERV has built deflationary mechanisms. Every time someone uses the AI agent on OpenServ, a portion of $SERV is used as payment. Part of that is then permanently burned to make the token scarcer and thus support its price. Because $SERV is essential for all interactions within OpenServ, when network activity grows, so does the token’s demand. Backing this, OpenServ’s user base surged by 30% last month in anticipation of its mainnet launch. During the same time frame, the $SERV token jumped over 63% . Once the OpenServ network officially goes live on mainnet, $SERV is bound to propel. Its recent price history already signals potential. Now’s an opportune moment to buy the token at its current $0.05948 price tag. $SERV is up for grabs on some of the best crypto exchanges , including MEXC . Verdict – ASEAN 2026 to Spark Global Crypto Surge As the Philippines prepares to solidify its stance as a global Web3 leader at the upcoming ASEAN 2026, more international attention on crypto is on the horizon, especially if Donald Trump shows his face at the summit. In turn, this building momentum makes a great time to invest in low-key crypto coins like $SNORT , $T6900 , and $SERC. A surge in investor enthusiasm could soon follow as bullish crypto news rally the broader market. Whether you want to take advantage of new trading tools, AI agents, or join a crypto degen community, there are digital assets out there that cater to all tastes. This isn’t investment advice.

49636195,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=186292,1754481310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49636195.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial Resistance at $117K Poses Threat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-analysis-resistance/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial Resistance at $117K Poses Threat The cryptocurrency market constantly presents new challenges and opportunities. Currently, a significant point of interest for many investors is the latest Bitcoin price analysis . A prominent crypto analyst has highlighted some critical levels that could define BTC’s near-term trajectory. Understanding these levels is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Understanding Bitcoin’s Crucial Resistance According to cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, speaking on X, Bitcoin (BTC) is encountering substantial resistance. This formidable barrier sits at the $117,000 mark . This level acts as a ceiling, where selling pressure often increases, making it difficult for the price to move higher. Overcoming such strong BTC resistance requires significant buying volume. Martinez’s observations stem from Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data. This specific metric provides insights into the average price at which unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) were last moved on the blockchain. It helps identify strong accumulation zones and potential resistance areas based on investor behavior. The Air Gap: Weak Bitcoin Support Levels Beyond the resistance, the analyst also pointed out a concerning “air gap” in Bitcoin’s support structure. This gap represents a zone of weak support for Bitcoin support between $113,000 and $108,000. An “air gap” suggests there are not many buyers willing to step in at these price points, making a potential fall through this range more likely and potentially faster. What does this mean for traders and investors? If Bitcoin fails to hold above $113,000, it could experience a relatively swift descent towards the $108,000 level. Such a drop could trigger further selling pressure as stop-loss orders are activated, intensifying the downward movement. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends These specific price levels are critical indicators within the broader crypto market trends . Bitcoin’s performance often influences the entire digital asset ecosystem. When BTC faces significant hurdles, altcoins tend to follow suit, experiencing their own price fluctuations. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s movements is paramount for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading or investment. Investors should remain vigilant. Market dynamics can shift rapidly, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, or sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Staying informed about these overarching trends helps in making more calculated decisions. Actionable Insights from UTXO Realized Price Data The reliance on UTXO realized price data by analysts like Ali Martinez provides a deeper layer of understanding. Unlike simple chart patterns, this on-chain metric offers a view into the actual cost basis of Bitcoin holders. It helps identify areas where a large volume of coins last moved, signaling strong psychological and technical levels. Key takeaways for investors: Monitor $117,000: This is a crucial ceiling. A decisive break above it could signal bullish momentum. Watch $113,000 – $108,000: This range is a potential danger zone. A fall into this gap could lead to further declines. Risk Management: Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect capital, especially if Bitcoin enters the weak support zone. Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. Summary: What’s Next for Bitcoin? In conclusion, the current Bitcoin price analysis paints a clear picture: significant resistance at $117,000 and a vulnerable support structure between $113,000 and $108,000. These levels are not merely numbers; they represent critical junctures for Bitcoin’s immediate future. The market awaits a decisive move, either a breakthrough of resistance or a retest of lower support levels. Staying informed and prepared is key for navigating these dynamic market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘resistance at $117,000’ mean for Bitcoin? A1: Resistance at $117,000 means that Bitcoin’s price faces strong selling pressure at this level, making it difficult for the price to move higher. It acts as a ceiling that buyers need to overcome with significant volume. Q2: What is an ‘air gap’ in Bitcoin support levels? A2: An ‘air gap’ refers to a range where there is weak buying interest or few active bids. For Bitcoin, the $113,000 to $108,000 range is identified as an air gap, suggesting that if the price falls into this zone, it could drop quickly due to a lack of strong support. Q3: Who is Ali Martinez and what is Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data? A3: Ali Martinez is a cryptocurrency analyst who shares insights on market trends. Glassnode’s UTXO realized price data is an on-chain metric that shows the average price at which Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) last moved, helping identify key support and resistance levels based on the cost basis of holders. Q4: How do current Bitcoin price levels affect the broader crypto market trends? A4: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the wider cryptocurrency market. Its significant price movements, especially encountering strong resistance or weak support, can influence the sentiment and price action of altcoins and overall crypto market trends . Q5: What should investors do given this Bitcoin price analysis? A5: Investors should monitor the $117,000 resistance and the $113,000-$108,000 support range closely. Implementing risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, and considering portfolio diversification are prudent steps.

The move will begin during the next championship in Aberdeen from 7th to 10th August 2025. The base prize is set at $10,000; if it is unclaimed, it is rolled over to the next tournament. DP World Tour revealed today a new performance-based prize initiative named Course Record in collaboration with Nexo. The prize initiative will commence tomorrow, 7th August, and run through to 10th August in Aberdeen, Scotland. Trump International Golf Links, inaugurated by President Donald Trump with Nexo’s co-founders on July 29, will host the championship . According to Nexo, a digital asset wealth management firm, the Course Record will grant $10,000 for top record holders in the tournament maintained throughout the event period. An additional $50,000 will be issued in Nexo tokens to players who break the course records during the championship. Jamieson & Carry handcrafts the Nexo Championship Trophy Nexo revealed that the Course Record prize is conditioned to be issued if a record is broken; however, if no record is broken, the prize will be rolled over to the next eligible event. The Course Record prize would be incremented by $10,000 in the subsequent event. The prize will be eligible for tournament participants only, plus atleast 36 holes closed for weather-affected events. The championship winner will be awarded the Nexo Championship Trophy, which has been exquisitely handcrafted by the local jewellers Jamieson and Carry, signaling a bespoke symbol of heritage and Scottish craftsmanship. The previous records hold ten records achieved in 2024 and six in 2025. Antoni Trenchev, Nexo Co-Founder, noted the Course Record prize as the first one-of-a-kind award set to recur annually. He added that it combines athlete performance-driven incentives with digital asset innovation, which forms the DP World Tour and Nexo’s shared vision for innovation in the professional golf arena. Ben Cowen, Chief Tournament and Operations Officer at the DP World Tour, also commented that the prize was created to reward top performance and increase awareness. He acknowledged Nexo for supporting the initiative and extended his best wishes to the participating players. Aberdeen hosts the $400 million Nexo Golf Championship The course opened on July 29, in a gala celebration hosted by President Donald Trump, and Nexo’s co-founders were in attendance. The organizing committee believes the tournament would benefit Aberdeen economically through tourist attractions and the golf season. The Golf season reportedly generates more than $400 million annually for Scotland’s economy. The Golf Course Record initiative will run until the end of the season for the DP World Tour Championship and begin again in 2026. Last month, Nexo was named the Official Marketing Partner and Official Digital Wealth Platform of the DP World Tour until 2027. A U.S.-based Working Group developed a national vision for crypto adoption, which sees technology as the next revolution in American innovations. The group cites America’s success in the railroad and the internet, and the potential for blockchain transformation. The group also acknowledged American entrepreneurs for driving technological advancements and believes digital assets could change the system of ownership and governance across the economy. The Working Group recognized Trump as the first U.S. president to acknowledge the cryptocurrency movement publicly. They urged the Federal government to help move forward with Trump’s pledge of making America a crypto capital for the world by advocating for pro-innovation policies on digital assets and blockchain.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-06 11:56:34

And yes, some are starting to wonder, could this be the protocol that actually delivers? A Smarter System That Pays You to Participate Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) isn’t just another blockchain with big talk. It’s a decentralized financial operating system built to reward users from the moment they join. The heart of it? Proof-of-Yield, a dynamic, AI-enhanced model that automatically adjusts rewards based on network activity, energy use, and governance behavior. In simple terms: the more active, clean, and aligned the ecosystem becomes, the more participants can earn. But it’s not just about rewards. BTC3 is designed for performance, privacy, and longevity: AI Energy Efficiency: Federated oracles analyze how much energy nodes are using. Those operating with greener setups earn more. On-Chain Privacy: BTC3 uses zk-SNARK cryptography and decentralized identity, so users can prove compliance without exposing personal data. Smart Contracts with AI Agents: These aren’t static. BTC3’s contracts evolve, learn, and react to real usage patterns to maximize value. The Presale That’s Turning Heads Across Crypto While most projects talk about long-term potential, Bitcoin Swift is delivering results now. We are in Stage 3 of the presale. The price is $3, with a launch target of $15. During this phase, participants earn 121% APY through automated PoY rewards distributed at the end of every stage. With only 1 day left before Stage 3 ends and the presale closing on September 18, 2025, the momentum is undeniable. Over 1600 users have already joined. This isn’t just one of the most talked-about launches, it’s one of the fastest-moving. That reward clock doesn’t wait. Neither does Bitcoin Swift. Crypto Analysts Are Talking, and They’re Not Holding Back It’s not just early adopters watching BTC3 explode. Major influencers and analysts have released deep dives explaining why Bitcoin Swift is attracting serious attention in 2025: Crypto Show explains how BTC3 blends programmable incentives with real-world compliance and privacy. Bull Run Angel breaks down the PoY reward system and why it stands out from anything on the market. Token Galaxy highlights BTC3’s potential to become a top income-generating protocol. Crypto Sister covers how BTC3 creates a balance between privacy and programmable earnings. These aren’t empty reviews. These are full breakdowns by people who’ve seen what works and what doesn’t in this space. Backed by Trust, Built for Growth Security and legitimacy matter, and BTC3 isn’t cutting corners: Audit Solidproof confirmed the smart contract logic and risk resistance. Audit Spywolf adds another level of technical assurance. KYC verification confirms the project team’s identity and legitimacy. X is where the community tracks updates, stage progress, and ongoing news. No hype without receipts. Bitcoin Swift is proving it on-chain and off-chain. Tokenomics That Keep Paying for Decades Unlike projects that dump rewards early and fade, BTC3 was designed for long-term wealth creation. Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) has a total supply of 45 million tokens , carefully allocated to support rewards, liquidity, and strategic growth. Half of the supply, 22.5 million BTC3, is reserved for Proof-of-Yield rewards distributed over 30 years. Another 30% (13.5 million BTC3) is allocated to presale participants, who also gain early governance access. The remaining 15% is set aside for liquidity provisioning, while 5% covers additional reserves and the project team. This allocation prioritizes long-term decentralization and rewards sustainability over speculative hype. This model isn’t about short-term gains. It’s about creating wealth that lasts. Conclusion: Can Bitcoin Swift Make You Rich? If you define rich by fast pumps, BTC3 might surprise you. It’s not selling hope. It’s delivering programmable income, privacy, and AI-backed incentives that start working from day one. The market has seen hype before. Bitcoin Swift is something else entirely. It’s structured, it’s proven, and it’s paying. For those asking if Bitcoin Swift can make them rich, how long can you afford to ignore it?

Hearing Date Revealed,https://bitcoinist.com/will-brazil-make-bitcoin-history-hearing-date-revealed/,"Brazil is gearing up for a major debate on adding Bitcoin to its national coffers. Reports have disclosed that the Chamber of Deputies will hold its first public hearing on August 20, 2025. Lawmakers have set the stage for a discussion on Bill 4.501/2024, which was introduced in November 2024 by Federal Deputy Eros Biondini. The move would allow Brazil to diversify its reserve assets beyond traditional US Treasuries. Chamber Moves To Debate Bitcoin Reserve According to the Economic Development Commission, the session will begin at 4 p.m. in Plenary 5, Annex II of the Chamber of Deputies in Brasília. Federal Deputy Luiz Philippe de Orleans Bragança pressed for this hearing, signaling strong support within the legislature. Bill 4.501/2024 calls for the government to buy Bitcoin and other secure crypto assets, aiming to modernize how Brazil protects its savings. Over a dozen institutions and experts have been invited. Diego Kolling, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Méliuz, will explain how crypto fits into long-term planning. Rubens Sardenberg from Febraban will discuss banking rules. Invitations have also gone to Abcripto, the Central Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce, and Services. Their insights should cover how holding Bitcoin might affect inflation, fiscal policy, and industry growth. Brazil Strategic Bitcoin Reserve comes up for its first public hearing August 20th – $18.5b reserves could be allocated to #Bitcoin . Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies is set to hold its first public hearing on August 20, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. in Brasília to discuss Bill 4.501/2024,… — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) August 5, 2025 Experts Weigh In On Risks And Rewards Based on reports, advocates argue that Bitcoin could hedge against swings in the real and rising inflation. Critics worry about the currency’s wild price swings—Bitcoin has seen up to 30% moves in a single day. Auditors will need clear guidelines on how to record crypto on the nation’s balance sheet. Opponents will likely point to the risk of buying high and then watching prices fall. Brazil won’t be alone if it approves this plan. Texas has already set aside 10 million dollars of public money to buy BTC, after Governor Greg Abbott signed a law in June. Arizona and New Hampshire passed similar measures, though they have not yet funded any purchases. US President Donald Trump has recently signed an executive order related to crypto reserves, giving more weight to the idea of sovereign Bitcoin holdings. Future Of Sovereign Crypto Holdings France is also exploring state-run Bitcoin mining at nuclear plants to turn unused power into a revenue stream. Officials estimate that one gigawatt of extra capacity could generate up to 150 million dollars each year. Brazil has its own mix of hydropower and solar farms with seasonal overflow. If the government backs a Bitcoin reserve and also explores pairing mining operations with clean-energy plants, it could turn wasted power into a revenue stream.

Analyst Shows Game Plan For BTC",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-100000-or-122000/,"Crypto analyst Mark Cullen has laid out the game plan for the Bitcoin price amid the flagship crypto’s choppy price action. Based on his analysis, BTC could either crash to $100,000 or rally to $122,000, close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $123,000. The Game Plan For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Mark Cullen shared what he described as the ‘Bitcoin game plan.’ He noted that BTC is filling out the inefficient area between the two previous weekly ranges. The analyst further remarked that the next move will be determined by how the Bitcoin price breaks out or breaks down from this range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Completes Inverted Head & Shoulders Pattern Above $110,000, What This Means Cullen stated that a break above $116,000 and holding above the previous range low could help the Bitcoin price build a bullish structure for a bigger squeeze to new ATHs later this month. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could first rally to around $122,000, close to its current ATH, before it breaks above to new highs. On the other hand, there is also the possibility of the Bitcoin price declining further. The analyst stated BTC is likely to crash to $100,000 if it loses the weekend low at around $111,000 and fails to attempt a reclaim of $112,000. Cullen declared that critical weeks’ price action is ahead for the flagship crypto, seeing as it is at a crossroads. It is worth mentioning that BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is one of those who believe that the Bitcoin price could still crash to $100,000. Hayes recently predicted that BTC will retest this level while ETH retests $3,000. He alluded to the tariffs as one of the reasons crypto prices would drop this low. The crypto founder also suggests that there is currently no available liquidity to boost the prices of these assets. The last time that Bitcoin was at $100,000 was towards the end of June, before it then went on to reach new all-time highs in July. BTC Could Still Drop To As Low As $95k Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as 95,000. In an X post, he noted that the last two times the weekly RSI dropped below the 14 SMA, BTC corrected by 20% to 30%. Therefore, he remarked that the flagship crypto could fall to $95,000 if history repeats itself.

What Does He Know?,https://timestabloid.com/a-whale-drops-396k-502k-xrp-limit-orders-back-to-back-what-does-he-know/,"A massive XRP accumulation move is raising eyebrows across the crypto market. As shared by crypto analyst Xaif, an anonymous whale recently executed two consecutive limit buy orders, 396,000 XRP followed swiftly by 502,000 XRP, injecting over $1.7 million into the asset. This strategic move came just days after the same trader reportedly secured $275,000 in profits. The timing and size of the trade have sparked one pressing question: What does he know? XRP Price Action: Hovering at a Critical Level As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $2.94, reflecting a mild daily pullback from intraday highs of $3.08 and lows of $2.91. Over the past week, the token has ranged between $2.83 and $3.11, battling resistance at the upper band while maintaining relatively firm support around $2.90–$2.95. Whale Watch Alert > a whale just dropped 396K & 502K $XRP LIMIT orders back-to-back $1.7M+ in buys after already bagging $275K profit a few days ago. what does he know ? pic.twitter.com/EypBH6Ax5j — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 6, 2025 Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. Short-term signals show slight bearish momentum, while long-term trends suggest underlying strength. The 14-day RSI hovers in the neutral zone, and moving averages offer no clear directional bias. A break above the $3.05–$3.10 resistance zone could open the door to further upside, but failure to hold above $2.90 risks a pullback to deeper support. Whale Strategy: Establishing Strong Support? The timing and size of the whale’s limit orders suggest calculated accumulation rather than reactive buying. Placing nearly a million XRP in buy orders just below $3.00 indicates confidence that this price zone will act as a solid base, possibly ahead of an anticipated rally. This strategy mirrors behavior seen in previous bull cycles where whales begin absorbing liquidity at key levels, positioning themselves before retail demand accelerates. Xaif’s update suggests this whale may be front-running a major move or acting on knowledge not yet priced in by the broader market. What Could Be Driving This Confidence? Several key developments may be fueling this optimism. Most notably, the August 15 SEC status update on Ripple’s legal battle looms large. If positive, the resolution could significantly clear XRP’s regulatory overhang, unlocking broader institutional participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Ripple’s growing ecosystem, bolstered by the rollout of RLUSD, tokenized treasury initiatives, and the XRPL EVM sidechain , continues to add real-world utility to the XRP Ledger. There’s also speculation surrounding an XRP spot ETF approval, with deadlines like October 17 drawing closer. Large inflows into XRP-focused investment products, alongside record accumulation by wallets holding over 1 million XRP, further support the bullish narrative. Whale wallet activity has surged recently, indicating growing conviction among major holders. Risks Remain: Can XRP Hold the Line? Despite bullish signs, XRP isn’t without risks. Should price fail to hold above the $2.90 threshold, bears could regain control, pushing price toward $2.87 or lower. Technical indicators such as the MACD and ADX on the daily chart show signs of weakening momentum. A breakdown here could shake short-term confidence and invalidate the whale’s positioning, at least temporarily. A High-Stakes Bet Worth Watching The back-to-back whale orders of 396K and 502K XRP, especially after realizing hefty profits, indicate a calculated bet that this is not the top but the foundation for another leg up. Whether based on legal, technical, or fundamental expectations, the move has placed a spotlight on the $2.90–$3.00 range as XRP’s current battleground. For traders and long-term holders alike, the message is clear: something significant may be unfolding beneath the surface. If the whale is right, these orders could mark the beginning of XRP’s next major breakout. If not, they may signal misplaced optimism ahead of incoming volatility. Either way, the market is watching.

While some analysts predict a price pump to $0.50 for the meme coin, others warn of a bearish scenario in the short term. The Whales Go Wild After its impressive performance towards the end of July, Dogecoin’s price headed south lately and currently trades at around $0.20 (per CoinGecko’s data). However, the recent actions of the large investors (known as whales) signal that another resurgence could be incoming. The popular analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X that such market participants have accumulated one billion DOGE in the past 24 hours. The stash equals roughly $200 million, and this cohort of investors now collectively holds 72.64 billion tokens (almost 50% of the meme coin’s circulating supply). Purchases of that type reduce the amount of coins in the open market and may trigger a price rally (assuming demand doesn’t decline). Additionally, small players might take this as an encouraging sign and follow suit. It is a common theory that whales have access to insider information about key events that could influence the market, which may explain their sudden buying or selling efforts. One potential development that might have a positive impact on Dogecoin’s valuation is the approval of the first spot DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Some of the companies willing to introduce such an investment vehicle include Bitwise, 21Shares, and Rex Shares. The odds of a green light before the end of 2025 stood at 56% on August 3, but in the following days they sharply increased to the current 74%. DOGE ETF Probability, Source: Polymarket The question now is whether the whales have filled their bags in anticipation of a final “yes” from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or if there’s another motive behind their move. The Next Targets DOGE remains one of the most talked-about topics in the crypto community, with many envisioning major gains in the near future . X user Marcus Corvinus described the meme coin as “the real silent killer,” claiming it is “way undervalued” compared to its peak levels from 2024 and its ATH in 2021. The analyst cited Dogecoin’s bullish structure and certain chart patterns to predict a rise to almost $0.50 in the coming months. Others made more bearish forecasts. The X user Astekz argued that DOGE’s current condition looks “horrendous.” They assumed that bulls might get lucky with a 20% move to the upside, but after that, the price might plunge substantially.

What has been driving ETH price action? We believe it is the combination of tokenization and stablecoins interacting with ETH price ascension, to drive buying activity. HBAR climbed +70% in July on a wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization. Crypto markets rebounded in July as regulatory momentum in Washington accelerated, Ethereum surged on tokenization and stablecoin demand, and exchanges filed for broad new crypto ETP approvals. Regulatory momentum in Washington accelerated in July, with a string of major crypto announcements this week following the earlier passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts. Major Crypto Announcements This Past Week July 29, 2025 – SEC clears in‑kind ETP transactions : Spot bitcoin and ether funds can now issue and redeem shares directly in crypto rather than cash, a shift expected to boost liquidity and align them with commodity ETFs. July 30, 2025 – White House publishes 160‑page digital‑asset report : The President’s Working Group outlined a unified regulatory framework, signaling federal support for innovation alongside new guardrails. July 30, 2025 – Cboe, Nasdaq, NYSE seek generic ETP standards : The exchanges proposed rules allowing faster approval of crypto funds without case‑by‑case SEC sign‑offs, potentially opening the door to dozens of new products. July 31, 2025 – SEC unveils “Project Crypto” : Chair Paul Atkins proposed a broad overhaul of U.S. crypto oversight aimed at enabling tokenization of traditional assets and integrating on‑chain markets into existing financial rules. Collectively, these steps mark a shift toward institutionalization, with U.S. policymakers laying the groundwork for a more mature and accessible digital‑asset market.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. BTC volatility dropped to 33%, the lowest since summer 2024. This was partly seasonal but also reflects structural demand: ETPs bought 42K BTC in June and BTC treasury firms added another 68K, more than offsetting June’s 13.5K BTC mined. This steady absorption suppresses volatility by providing a consistent bid. July was a strong month for crypto with BTC ( BTC-USD ) (+9%) and many altcoins exceeding BTC’s returns as exemplified by MVSCLE’s (+34%) performance in July. While XRP ( XRP-USD ) (+38%), ADA ( ADA-USD ) (+33%), and Sui ( SUI-USD ) (+35%) were big winners, the most notable performer was ETH ( ETH-USD ) (+50%). After many agonizing months of ETH’s weakness relative to BTC and ETH/BTC breaking 5 yr lows, ETH rallied (+50%) in dollar terms in July and (+38%) relative to BTC. Besides the technical rebound, ETH’s price performance was catalyzed by strong ETP inflows. In July, spot ETH ETP net flows were $4.7B which is just over half all-time, cumulative inflows of $9.2B. Bitcoin net inflows remained strong with $5.9B in total, helping support positive BTC price action. On a relative basis, ETH inflows absorbed 1% of total ETH spot market capitalization while BTC’s were only 25bps.

We believe it is the combination of tokenization and stablecoins interacting with ETH price ascension, to drive buying activity. Many who have missed out on BTC’s run are drawn to ETH’s positive price action, noticing that it is below its all-time highs as BTC establishes new peak prices. Others are encouraged by the monstrous returns offered by CRCL ( CRCL ), (+500%), since its IPO in June. In July, news emerged that several important financial institutions were taking an active interest in stablecoins and tokenization in the Ethereum ecosystem. These included Robinhood launching 200+ tokenized stocks and ETFs on an Arbitrum L2, eToro’s ( ETOR ) announcing the upcoming rollout of 100 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs on Ethereum L1, and Kraken unveiling 24/5 tokenized equity trading. Some of this jubilance spilled over into ETH’s price action. As Ethereum ecosystem is responsible for 62% of all stablecoin value transfer thus far in 2025 and holds 71% of all assets locked in DeFi, it appears to be the target blockchain for the tokenization and stablecoin efforts of major financial institutions. Ethereum’s revenue also had a strong July (+23% MtM) as DEX Volumes climbed (+8% MtM) and TVL jumped (+39% MtM). As a consequence, Ethereum overtook Solana to jump into third place amongst the top revenue producing blockchains.

Currently, we track eight significant ETH Digital Asset Treasuries (DATS) that hold roughly 1.46M ETH. The largest, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, owns 625K ETH valued at about $2.4B, almost half the DAT total. When corporates that simply keep ETH on their balance sheets are added, institutional treasury reserves reach 2.3M ETH. Combining DATs, treasuries, and exchange‑traded products (ETPs), institutions control 8.2M ETH, or 6.8% of circulating supply. By contrast, Bitcoin’s institutional share is 15.6% and to match it, ETH treasuries would have to expand 4.5x and ETH ETPs 1.4x. For Solana, treasuries and ETPs hold Despite the positive price action for ETH as ETH DATs multiply and mature, several potentially bearish catalysts materialized on Ethereum’s blockchain in July. Over the past few weeks, the exit queue for validators has 24x’d its normal amount to reach 24.2k validators holding 774k in ETH. This is the largest figure in the history of Ethereum and has created a backlog that will last just under 12 days. Realistically, this exit line represents a small portion of total staked ETH, just 2%, but has coincided with other interesting on-chain developments. The Ethereum whale, Justin Sun, also withdrew about $600M worth of ETH from AAVE which corresponds to ~5% of supply and caused ETH borrow rates to spike to above 9% several times.

While some suppose the validator unwind presages sell pressure, many contend that those unwinding their validators may not be selling their ETH positions. Instead, many validator companies may be reducing their validator count to consolidate operations and reduce overhead expenses. The catalyst for this consolidation can be traced to Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade in May which increased the maximum ETH per validator from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Additionally, the outflow of staked ETH is somewhat offset by an inflow of 390K ETH that backs validators seeking to join the Ethereum network. In fact, as of July 14, just before the mass withdrawals of ETH, staked ETH reached a record 36.4M ETH. Going forward, we see positive developments persisting for Ethereum as the community appears aligned in increasing Ethereum’s throughput. For example, in July, 47% of the validators backed a proposal to increase Ethereum’s gas limit from 36M to 45M which increases transaction capacity by 25%. Even with the increase in throughput, Ethereum’s average transaction price, in USD, was (+14%) higher than it was in May and reached the highest average, $1.04, since February 2025. ETH Volatility at its Lowest Levels Since Fall 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 7/31/2029. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. July’s positive crypto price action has sucked the wind out of volatility’s sails. While a summer decline in volatility is typical across all risk assets, July is noteworthy for the persistence of BTC’s volatility drop. BTC and ETH dropped to their lowest volatility levels since fall 2024. In fact, BTC’s volatility has been hovering near its lowest reading ever. We attribute this development to the net buying from both ETPs and Digital Asset Treasuries (DATS) buying both BTC and ETH. However, we believe this volatility vacation is short-lived and believe the fall will bring greater levels of uncertainty, which will translate into price variance. Over the medium term, we suspect that the DATs have the potential to add substantial volatility if there is a sustained digital asset sell off. HBAR Rallies on Momentum HBAR ( HBAR-USD ) climbed +70% in July on a wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre chose Hedera for Project Acacia, a six‑month pilot that tests how tokenized assets and a wholesale CBDC could settle on distributed ledgers. Nineteen live pilots and five proofs of concept will cover assets such as fixed income, carbon credits, and private‑market securities. Hedera’s new private‑network product, HashSphere, lets institutions trial tokenization, AI, and digital‑asset workflows in a compliant environment while staying interoperable with the public chain. At the same time, Hedera became core infrastructure in EQTY Lab’s secure‑AI initiative with Nvidia ([[NVDA]], [[NVDA:CA]]), SCAN UK, and Accenture Public Sector. The project uses NVIDIA Blackwell confidential computing to govern autonomous AI agents; Hedera records cryptographic proofs of agent actions and verifies compliance with legal and geographic policies. Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money‑market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still pre‑launch interest in real‑world‑asset tokenization on the network. Network Activity and DeFi Growth Hedera’s onchain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.

DeFi TVL and Stablecoins Up: The total value locked in Hedera DeFi protocols jumped ~50% in July, reaching ~$146 million, +82% MoM.

July saw the launch of the Hello Future: Origins global hackathon, a three-part saga offering a total of $550,000 in prizes to Hedera builders. The first stage in late July attracted participants worldwide to innovate on Hedera for $150,000 in prizes. Expanding Access and Legitimacy Grayscale Inclusion: In early July, Grayscale added HBAR to its Smart Contract Platform Select Fund, assigning it a 5.8% weight. Robinhood U.S. Listing: HBAR gained broader retail access when Robinhood enabled trading for U.S. users in late July (following its earlier EU listing).

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Solana’s Outperformed Bitcoin in July, But Awaits Catalysts In January 2025 SOL price spiked to an all-time high of $262.50 as memecoin speculation blossomed and many considered Solana the epicenter of on-chain trading. In January 2025, despite being a “low-cost blockchain,” Solana was producing more revenue from transactions fees than the next four largest blockchains combined. If we count MEV, or maximal extracted value, Solana was likely producing at least 4x the total revenue of all other chains put together. However, since it’s the start of the year, SOL (-8%) has underperformed BTC (+26%), ETH (+13%), XRP (+48%) and even XLM (+23%). While this is partly due to SOL price reliance on expectations of unsustainable levels of memecoin trading, Solana’s status as the king of on-chain trading has been usurped by Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid was able to capture much of Solana’s momentum, and likely Solana’s market capitalization, because it offers a simple, highly functional product. Thus, Hyperliquid has poached high value users from Solana and has retained them. For a long time, the bull case on Solana was that it boasted a strong ecosystem of builders who could utilize Solana’s best in class transaction processing capabilities. As a result, trading would continue to thrive on Solana. However, Solana has not delivered meaningful improvements to boost its user experience, specifically in perpetual futures trading (perps), and Hyperliquid stepped up with a better product. The Firedancer developer team, tasked with making revolutionary improvements in Solana’s capabilities, could not meet production deadlines for upgrades to Solana’s core software. Firedancer was not only supposed to expand Solana’s throughput, but also make it provably reliable. Neither goal has been accomplished. At the same time, some of the most important developers left Firedancer and disputes over the quality of Firedancer’s codebase boiled over into public disputes. Some would even argue that the team chosen to improve Solana’s architecture, crack software engineers from the HFT hegemon Jump Trading, were ill-suited to improve Solana. While the Anza team has picked up the slack, the failure of Firedancer has manifested a market poltergeist who is suppressing SOL’s price. Solana’s key differentiating factor compared to Ethereum is its ability to handle more transaction bandwidth. But this advantage only matters if Solana can capture the activity driving current excitement around blockchain. This enthusiasm revolves around financial institutions deploying to blockchain, but many are hesitant to deploy to Solana due to its reliability issues. Thus far, Solana has not been able to make a strong case that it will be important to either the businesses with blockchain plans or to investors who want to profit from the blockchain revolution. Luckily, nothing is set in stone, but we are rapidly approaching the event horizon point for blockchain deployment decisions. Most major financial players still refer to blockchain in the abstract and committed their efforts to one blockchain ecosystem. It is generally assumed that there will be a mix of private ledgers and public ledgers operating in unison. The Ethereum community believes that by default, these banks will choose Ethereum for public exchange of value and L2s for internal remittances. Since this issue is not settled, Solana has a chance to make its case for why it should be the preferred chain of choice. To accomplish this, its community and development team should focus on messaging not only around its capabilities, but also its long-term stability. Ethereum Could Still Emerge as a Better Store of Value Than Bitcoin Alternative digital asset treasuries are growing rapidly, and the most common assets chosen are BTC and ETH. Initially, entities opted to choose BTC because of its strong store of value properties created through its ossified economic policies. The lynchpin of this policy structure is BTC’s predictable issuance that results in a finite total supply. More recently, DATs have emerged that focus on Ethereum. These upstart DATs believe ETH is a better asset for running a digital treasury because savvy firms can engage in exotic financial activities to accumulate ETH at a faster rate than they could BTC. While BTC treasuries can increase their BTC holdings by financing additional purchases, conducting sophisticated options strategies, or lending out their BTC, ETH treasuries have greater flexibility. ETH DATs can replicate BTC DAT financial strategies and also stake their Ethereum to receive Ethereum network revenues and inflationary issuance. Additionally, they can participate in DeFi to achieve additional income. Lost in the discussion, however, are the basic principles that govern Ethereum vs Bitcoin. Paradoxically, Ethereum may arrive at an economic system that favors its tokenholders more than Bitcoin’s. Ethereum, who turned 10 years old on July 30th, 2025, began with much higher inflation than BTC’s, 14.4% vs. 9.3%. However, Ethereum made two major economic policy changes that set it upon the path towards a lower inflation rate than that of Bitcoin. The first adjustment was EIP 1559 which was instituted in August 2021 and created the “burn” of ETH base transaction fees. The consequence of this change is that increases in Ethereum activity cause the total amount of ETH supply to decrease. The second, substantial policy change was the transition of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). Called “the Merge,” the transition occurred in September 2022. The Merge allowed Ethereum to reduce its inflation issuance from ~13,000 ETH/day to ~1,700 ETH/day because it no longer needed to compensate the miners who secured its network. The result was that by March 8,2023, Ethereum’s inflation rate dropped below that of BTC’s. Since that date, ETH’s supply has grown only (+0.2%) while BTC’s has grown (+3%). In fact, the combination of these two monetary upgrades led to temporary reductions in Ethereum’s ETH supply. Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). ETH Inflation Dropped Below BTC's on March 8, 2023 Source: Glassnode as of 7/31/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein However, the superiority of ETH’s inflationary policy may be short lived. Bitcoin’s halving in April 2024 predictably dropped its inflation rate by (-50%). Currently, ETH’s annual inflation over the last year is (+0.38%) vs BTC’s at (+0.84%). Over the course of the next few halvings, BTC’s inflation rate will approach (+0%). Conversely, Ethereum’s rate is hard to predict and may be as high as (+0.5%) or it may be negative. Even if ETH’s current inflationary trajectory remains unchanged, BTC’s will not be lower until 2028. One very underappreciated dynamic is the issue of the Bitcoin’s security budget. Bitcoin maintains inflationary issuance as an incentive to miners and without it, would have to rely upon network transaction fees. In the last year, miners made $278M from transaction fees and $14.64B in network inflation. Clearly, the economics of miners would have to radically adjust if they had to rely upon transaction fees alone. As the halvings occur, BTC’s price must increase to make up for the difference of reduced network inflation to keep miners economically viable. If this price trajectory does not occur, the network’s security may have to adopt a different economic model. There are many potential solutions to this problem and any change will not have a terminal impact on Bitcoin. But the economic policy adjustment will have winners and losers. For example, one option to traverse the security budget dilemma would be for Bitcoin to introduce inflation through a hard fork. Regardless of its implementation, it would undercut one of its community’s core critiques of Ethereum which is that Ethereum’s economic policy is too malleable. More importantly, it would subject BTC holders to a taxation that would favor miners. These political-economic decisions are not zero-sum games and Bitcoin’s system centered around miners favors their interests over token holders. In proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum, token ownership dictates which fork the validators will follow because stake will migrate to validators who choose the preferred forks. By contrast, Bitcoin’s fork choice rule is ultimately decided by the miners and nodes who secure the network. By identity, there is a substantial conflict of interest which favors people whose interest lies in selling BTC to fund their operations. Ethereum, under PoS, lacks this dynamic. While there are inherent economic tradeoffs with each system, ETH’s set of tradeoffs favor the holders of ETH because they ultimately decide network direction. Though BTC holders do have sway on Bitcoin’s network, their ability to influence the progression of the network is far limited compared to ETH holders’ domestic sway. As such, ETH may yet prove to be a better asset than BTC. Disclosures Index Definitions S&P 500 Index: is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.

For those deeply invested in the principles of decentralization and user sovereignty, akin to the ethos found in the cryptocurrency world, the emergence of a new European Search Index presents an exciting development. Qwant and Ecosia, two prominent European search engines, have joined forces to launch Staan, a groundbreaking initiative designed to challenge the long-standing reign of Big Tech giants like Google and Bing. This collaborative effort aims to provide a search experience that is not only more affordable but, crucially, more aligned with user privacy and European values. Unveiling Staan: A Bold European Search Index On a recent Wednesday, the digital world witnessed the official debut of Staan, the fruit of a joint venture between France’s privacy-focused search engine, Qwant, and Germany’s non-profit, environmentally conscious search engine, Ecosia. This collaboration, officially known as European Search Perspective (EUSP), marks a pivotal moment in the quest for digital independence. The core mission of Staan is straightforward: to offer a viable, cheaper, and privacy-centric alternative to the dominant search infrastructures. The ambition is substantial, with EUSP aiming to power approximately 50% of French search queries and 33% of German queries by the close of the year. This isn’t merely about creating another search engine; it’s about building a foundational digital infrastructure that champions user rights and regional autonomy. The development of Staan represents a concerted effort to foster a truly European digital ecosystem, reducing reliance on external technologies that may not always align with the continent’s stringent privacy regulations or strategic interests. By developing their own index, Qwant and Ecosia are taking a concrete step towards diversifying the global search market and offering consumers and businesses a meaningful choice. This move is particularly resonant in an era where data privacy and digital sovereignty are increasingly becoming global concerns. Privacy at the Core: A New Standard for the Privacy Search Engine At the heart of Staan’s proposition lies an unwavering commitment to privacy. In an age where personal data is often commodified and tracked, the concept of a truly Privacy Search Engine is more vital than ever. Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, emphasized this commitment, stating that Staan, combined with Europe’s robust privacy laws, can offer a significantly more privacy-friendly search solution compared to its U.S. counterparts. This isn’t just a marketing slogan; it’s a fundamental architectural principle embedded within the index’s design. Here’s how Staan aims to redefine privacy in search: No User Tracking: Unlike many mainstream search engines that build extensive user profiles based on search history and online behavior, Staan is designed to minimize or eliminate such tracking. Data Minimization: The index aims to collect only the essential data required to deliver search results, adhering strictly to the principle of data minimization. European Data Sovereignty: By hosting and processing data within Europe, Staan ensures that user information is subject to European Union’s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), providing a higher level of protection. Transparency: The joint venture is committed to greater transparency regarding how its index operates and how user data (or lack thereof) is handled. For users, this means a search experience free from targeted ads based on their queries, a reduction in the digital footprint they leave behind, and greater peace of mind regarding their online activities. For businesses and developers, it means the ability to integrate search functionalities that respect their users’ privacy, building trust and fostering stronger relationships. Economical Edge: Powering AI and Search at a Fraction of the Cost Beyond privacy, Staan offers a compelling economic advantage, particularly relevant in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. As AI Search Technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, the underlying data and search infrastructure required to power it can be prohibitively expensive. This is where Staan truly shines, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative for various applications, especially AI chatbots. Kroll highlighted the significant cost disparity, noting, “If you’re using ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, they all do knowledge grounding with web search our index can power deep research and AI summary features. Google and Bing’s solutions are also pricey, and our index can offer power search features at a tenth of the cost.” This remarkable cost efficiency could be a game-changer for startups, developers, and even larger enterprises looking to integrate robust search capabilities into their AI models without incurring exorbitant expenses. Consider the financial implications: Reduced Operational Costs: For companies developing AI applications that rely on real-time web data, switching to Staan could drastically cut their infrastructure expenses. Democratizing AI Development: Lower costs mean that smaller teams and individual developers can access high-quality search indexing, fostering innovation and reducing barriers to entry in the AI space. Competitive Advantage: Businesses adopting Staan for their AI solutions could gain a significant cost advantage over competitors still reliant on more expensive traditional providers. This economic benefit extends beyond AI, making Staan an attractive option for any application requiring a robust and affordable search backbone. Beyond Traditional Search: Staan’s Vision for AI Search Technology The ambitions for Staan extend far beyond merely serving standard web queries. Both Qwant and Ecosia are already leveraging, or planning to leverage, Staan to enhance their AI Search Technology features. Qwant is currently using the new index to power some of its innovative functionalities, such as AI summaries for search results, providing users with quick, concise overviews of complex topics. Ecosia also has plans to integrate similar AI-driven features into its platform in the near future. Furthermore, EUSP is actively engaging in discussions with companies to promote the adoption of its index for enabling search within various applications. A key target market for this expansion is AI chatbots. By offering Staan as a cheaper and more private alternative to established search providers, EUSP aims to become the go-to knowledge grounding source for these conversational AI systems. This means that when you ask an AI chatbot a question, its answer could soon be powered by the Staan index, ensuring a more private and potentially more diverse range of information sources. The integration with AI chatbots signifies a strategic move to position Staan not just as a consumer-facing search engine but as a fundamental component of the broader AI infrastructure, providing the raw data and context necessary for AI models to deliver accurate and relevant responses. Building a Resilient European Tech Stack: Challenging Big Tech Alternatives The launch of Staan is deeply rooted in a broader vision: the development of a resilient European tech stack that reduces dependence on technology originating from the U.S. or China. This strategic imperative is gaining increasing urgency, especially in light of recent geopolitical events. The companies articulated this sentiment clearly in a statement: “The timing could not be more urgent. The outcome of the 2024 U.S. election has reminded European policymakers and innovators just how exposed Europe remains when it comes to core digital infrastructure. Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, putting entire sectors – from journalism to climate tech – at the mercy of political or commercial agendas.” This push for digital sovereignty aligns with efforts by other European entities, such as Proton, to build independent technological foundations. Staan represents a significant step towards creating genuine Big Tech Alternatives that are not only technologically robust but also ethically aligned with European values of privacy, open standards, and fair competition. The goal is to ensure that critical digital infrastructure remains within European control, safeguarding against potential external influences or disruptions that could impact vital sectors. The implications of this strategy are far-reaching: Enhanced Cybersecurity: Reducing reliance on foreign infrastructure can bolster Europe’s digital security posture. Economic Resilience: Fostering homegrown tech solutions creates jobs, stimulates innovation, and keeps digital value creation within the continent. Policy Alignment: A European tech stack ensures that digital services and data processing adhere to European laws and societal norms. This initiative is not just about search; it’s about laying the groundwork for a more independent and robust digital future for Europe. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities for Staan While the launch of Staan is a monumental achievement, the path ahead for Qwant Ecosia Staan will undoubtedly present both challenges and immense opportunities. Competing with entrenched giants that have decades of market dominance and vast resources is no small feat. However, Staan’s unique value proposition provides a strong foundation. Comparison: Staan vs. Traditional Search Engines Feature Staan (Qwant & Ecosia) Traditional Search Engines (e.g., Google, Bing) Data Privacy High (No user tracking, GDPR compliant, European data hosting) Variable (Extensive user profiling, global data centers, different regulatory frameworks) Cost for API/AI Integration Low (Reported 1/10th the cost for AI grounding) High (Premium pricing for extensive API usage) Data Sovereignty European-controlled infrastructure Primarily U.S.-controlled infrastructure Focus Privacy, sustainability, European independence, cost-effectiveness Market share, ad revenue, broad ecosystem integration AI Integration Designed for cost-effective AI grounding and summaries Extensive AI capabilities, but potentially higher cost for external use Benefits for Users and Developers The advent of Qwant Ecosia Staan offers distinct advantages: For Users: A more private and secure search experience, reduced digital footprint, and potentially less biased search results due to a focus away from ad revenue models. For Developers: Access to a cost-effective, privacy-respecting search index for integrating into applications, especially AI chatbots. This enables innovation without prohibitive licensing fees. For Businesses: The opportunity to build services that align with growing consumer demand for privacy and data protection, potentially opening new market segments. For Europe: Strengthened digital infrastructure, reduced reliance on external powers, and a boost to the continent’s tech sovereignty. The primary challenge will be achieving widespread adoption. Building a superior index is one thing; convincing millions of users and thousands of developers to switch from established habits and ecosystems is another. However, the increasing global awareness of privacy issues and the growing need for cost-effective AI solutions provide a strong tailwind for Staan’s success. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the European Search Perspective? The immediate goals for EUSP are clear: to expand their market share in France and Germany and to continue refining the Staan index. Beyond that, the potential for Staan is vast. As the digital economy increasingly relies on sophisticated search and data grounding for AI, Staan could become a crucial backend provider for a multitude of applications across various industries. Discussions with companies to spur adoption for in-app search and chatbot integration are already underway, indicating a proactive approach to market penetration. The success of Staan will not only validate the vision of a truly independent European tech stack but also serve as a powerful example of how collaboration and a focus on core values like privacy and cost-efficiency can challenge even the most dominant players in the global tech arena. The journey of Staan will be closely watched by innovators and policymakers alike, as it represents a significant step towards a more diverse and resilient global digital infrastructure. Conclusion: A Landmark Step Towards a Decentralized Digital Future The launch of Staan by Qwant and Ecosia is more than just the debut of a new search index; it’s a bold declaration of independence in the digital realm. By prioritizing privacy, offering significant cost advantages, and strategically positioning itself within the burgeoning AI landscape, Staan is set to become a formidable force.

Bitcoin — An Offer You Can’t Refuse. pic.twitter.com/XEWWt2ZTXu — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 4, 2025 Una frase emblematica, presa in prestito dal celebre film Il Padrino , che per Saylor riassume alla perfezione il valore irrinunciabile di Bitcoin.Il messaggio ha fatto rapidamente il giro dei social, riaccendendo i riflettori sulle colossali operazioni crypto della società e sulle previsioni audaci di Saylor per il futuro del re delle criptovalute. Acquisti aggressivi di Bitcoin Secondo quanto riportato, Strategy ha appena acquistato 21.021 BTC per un valore complessivo di circa 2,46 miliardi di dollari, a un prezzo medio di 117.256 dollari per coin. Con questa operazione, il patrimonio in Bitcoin della società è salito a 628.791 BTC . Agli attuali livelli di mercato, queste riserve valgono circa 71,4 miliardi di dollari , una cifra che rafforza ulteriormente il ruolo dominante di Strategy nel panorama degli investitori istituzionali in Bitcoin. Dall’inizio dell’anno, grazie alla costante ascesa dei prezzi, la società ha registrato un rendimento del 25% sulle proprie riserve in BTC. Bitcoin come “un’offerta troppo allettante”: Saylor torna a far parlare di sé Michael Saylor non è mai stato timido quando si tratta di usare parole forti. Ha definito Bitcoin come “uno sciame di calabroni cibernetici al servizio della dea della saggezza, che si nutrono del fuoco della verità”. Parole che non sembrano uscite da un white paper tecnico, ma da un poema mistico. L’obiettivo è chiaro: per Saylor, Bitcoin non è solo codice o denaro digitale. È una forza destinata a cambiare radicalmente il modo in cui le persone risparmiano e spendono. Holding istituzionali in ascesa Strategy non è l’unica società quotata a costruirsi un maxi-portafoglio crypto. Giganti come iShares ETF di BlackRock e i trust di Grayscale detengono anch’essi porzioni significative dell’offerta totale di BTC. Nel complesso, questi attori istituzionali controllano circa un quarto di tutti i Bitcoin in circolazione – un livello di concentrazione mai visto prima. Solo pochi anni fa, nessuna istituzione arrivava a possedere più che una piccola frazione. Oggi, invece, tesorerie aziendali e fondi d’investimento sono diventati protagonisti assoluti. Prezzo stabile, ma rischio elevato L’interesse istituzionale ha contribuito a smorzare la volatilità di Bitcoin. I grandi acquirenti tendono a mantenere le posizioni anche nei momenti turbolenti, e i loro ordini costanti aiutano a colmare i vuoti lasciati dai trader più piccoli. Ma concentrare così tanto capitale su un singolo asset non è privo di rischi. Un improvviso calo del prezzo potrebbe avere un impatto enorme sul bilancio di Strategy. I guadagni su carta possono svanire in poche ore se cambia il sentiment del mercato – ma questa è un’altra storia. Per Saylor, citare Il Padrino non è solo una trovata scenica. È una dichiarazione d’intenti. Con un’offerta fissa e una domanda in costante aumento, Bitcoin rappresenta – ai suoi occhi – un’offerta troppo buona per essere rifiutata.",Uncategorized|bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 12:11:48

This move represents a marked shift in Ripple’s operational structure, focusing not on traditional banking services but on positioning itself at the core of next-generation financial infrastructure. According to Diana, the filing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reveals that the trust bank will not provide consumer-facing services like checking accounts, mortgages, or branch locations. Instead, its mission is specific and targeted—to operate the new rails of money through technologies powered by XRP and RLUSD. The bank’s design centers around institutional liquidity, real-time global settlement, and direct engagement with U.S. financial systems. RIPPLE IS BUILDING A BANK — AND IT’S NOTHING LIKE WALL STREET EXPECTED Inside Ripple’s National Trust Bank Play & What It Means for XRP, RLUSD, and the Future of Global Finance #XRP #Ripple #RLUSD #Crypto pic.twitter.com/dOKqykkmHt — Diana (@InvestWithD) August 5, 2025 Understanding the National Trust Bank Structure Diana elaborates on the nature of a national trust bank, emphasizing that it is a federally regulated institution that holds full fiduciary powers. However, unlike conventional banks, it does not engage in retail deposits or loans. Ripple’s trust bank is being structured not to compete with legacy financial institutions on their terms, but to serve as a compliant, tech-forward alternative geared toward enterprise-grade asset management and payment operations. The bank is expected to manage digital asset reserves, particularly XRP and the RLUSD stablecoin. Through its federal charter, Ripple gains potential access to critical U.S. financial networks such as FedWire and ACH, allowing it to bypass traditional intermediaries in the settlement process. The underlying architecture will enable fast and final settlement of institutional payments, aiming to remove delays and costs often imposed by legacy systems. Strategic Implications for XRP, RLUSD, and Institutional Finance The creation of Ripple National Trust Bank appears to be a foundational step in Ripple’s broader financial strategy. Diana outlines several operational goals Ripple aims to achieve through this initiative. These include establishing institutional liquidity pools for XRP, maintaining stable RLUSD reserves, enabling real-time bank-to-bank payments without traditional banks, and supporting a 24/7 global settlement framework. If approved, Ripple would gain the ability to directly convert fiat currencies into RLUSD, eliminating reliance on correspondent banks and enabling cost-efficient transfers with transaction finality. This would strengthen XRP’s role as a bridge asset and enhance RLUSD’s utility in settlements. According to Diana, this charter could also enable Ripple to set new standards in custody, compliance, and risk management, offering institutional-grade safeguards for digital asset operations. The confidential section of Ripple’s filing is expected to include strategic plans related to liquidity partnerships, Fed system integrations, and long-term expansion in digital finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Broader Timing and Regulatory Landscape The timing of Ripple’s application coincides with its recent launch of RLUSD and the evolving regulatory framework for crypto within the United States. Diana notes that Ripple is strategically aligning its operations with emerging U.S. legislation that supports on-chain banking innovations. By acting early, Ripple aims to secure a leading role in modern financial services before traditional institutions adapt or new entrants attempt to do so. The public filing with the OCC includes details such as the bank’s legal structure, board of directors, and NYC headquarters. However, the most critical operational plans remain confidential, possibly due to competitive sensitivities and regulatory constraints. Diana emphasizes that this level of secrecy is likely due to the depth and complexity of Ripple’s infrastructure ambitions. Control Over Infrastructure, Not Participation Diana concludes by asserting that Ripple’s application is not merely about entering the traditional banking space. Instead, it represents an effort to control the infrastructure underlying modern finance. Through the Ripple National Trust Bank, the company seeks to build and manage the digital rails that could underpin future global money movement. By combining the use of XRP for settlement and RLUSD for stable value transfers, Ripple is preparing to operate as a crypto-native institution with direct integration into the core of the U.S. financial system. This approach positions Ripple to deliver a frictionless model for institutional finance, possibly reducing reliance on legacy players while enhancing speed, transparency, and efficiency.

While these numbers are strong, other benchmarks suggest that user activity may be dwindling. Significant Dominance Data analytics firm CryptoQuant shared a report from a community analyst, @JA_Maartun, showcasing how the largest centralized exchange (CEX) is currently well ahead in futures trading volume. The $2.55 trillion in futures volume was reached last month and is the highest level recorded for Binance this year, according to CQ’s graph. The previous peaks were in January, when it hit $2.43T, and May, which recorded $2.26 trillion. This jump followed a month of volatility and price records for both Bitcoin and a few altcoins, which likely brought in more traders. OKX and Bybit also reported marginal volumes, with $929 billion and $1.09 trillion, respectively, and these figures have remained relatively similar throughout the year so far. The Changpeng Zhao-founded exchange remained the leader, by a wide margin, accounting for over half of the total volume across other major exchanges, including Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, and others. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoPotato reported that Binance was leading the charge in the derivatives market in April, and it’s evident that the momentum has remained strong. The increased levels of trading suggest that more users are participating in these markets, leveraging riskier strategies. “The increase in trading suggests more users are active again, possibly due to the recent price breakout,” – noted Maartun. What About Other Metrics? Futures volume may be booming, but other key metrics point in a different direction. As CryptoPotato outlined on Monday, a Bitcoin sell-off resulted in $1.5 billion in liquidations, and the funding rates, a fee exchanged periodically between long and short positions in a perpetual futures contract, turned negative. Negative funding rates indicate that there are more shorts than longs, which can be interpreted as more people betting on prices to fall rather than rise, which is more “risk off” sentiment. Data collected at print time from the Token Terminal also suggests a decline in interaction with Binance, with active monthly addresses dropping from approximately 800,000 at the start of June to around 340,000 at the beginning of August, representing a 57.5% decrease. Source: Token Terminal This clash of positives in negatives seems to be in line with current market sentiment, which is in a “neutral” state. It has been a mixed bag of ups and downs for cryptocurrency prices as well, with the overall crypto market cap dropping to $3.7 trillion, from the $4T it reached in July , according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This shift has sparked a mix of concern and opportunity among investors. In this article, we delve into the dynamics behind these movements and the strategic viewpoint offered by Outset PR, a firm that specializes in crypto market analytics. While some see these dips as cautionary signals, others interpret them as perfect 'buy the dip' opportunities possibly heralding the onset of a new bull market phase. This dual perspective is supported by data and insights from Outset PR , which keeps a close tab on market trends and crypto performance. Understanding XRP's Recent Market Performance Source: TradingView XRP, designed by Ripple Labs, is known for its quick and cost-effective transaction capabilities, particularly in cross-border money transfers.

Its increasing role as a bridge currency in international finance positions it as a viable contender for significant growth in upcoming market cycles. Examining Solana's Position in Current Market Trends Source: TradingView Solana, often lauded as a direct competitor to Ethereum due to its impressive transaction speeds and scalability, has also experienced a significant pullback. However, like XRP, the patterns and market behavior of Solana suggest potential for recovery and profitability. Known for its robust technology and growing adoption, particularly in decentralized applications, Solana remains a strong player in the altcoin market.

This massive cash-out, as reported by Coinglass data, indicates a notable shift in market behavior. It’s crucial for anyone following crypto market trends to understand what this means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset landscape. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Profit-Taking Surge? Recent data from Coinglass highlights a remarkable surge in realized profits among BTC holders . This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a substantial movement of capital. Specifically, the data reveals that approximately $1.01 billion in profits were taken off the table, signaling active participation in the current market dynamics . A staggering $362 million, or 35.8% of the total, came from coins held for 7 to 10 years. This particular group of long-term Bitcoin holders rarely moves their assets, making this activity particularly noteworthy. Another significant portion, around $93 million, was realized by holders who had kept their Bitcoin for 1 to 2 years. This group often includes investors who entered the market during previous bull cycles or significant dips. Understanding these different cohorts helps us decipher the motivations behind the recent Bitcoin profit-taking and its potential implications. Are Long-Term BTC Holders Signaling a Market Shift? The movement of 7-10 year old Bitcoin coins is especially intriguing. Typically, these are considered ""HODLers"" – investors committed to holding their assets for the very long term, often through multiple market cycles. When such a substantial amount from this cohort moves, it raises important questions about crypto market trends : Internal Transfers: Could these be large institutional holders rebalancing their portfolios or moving funds between different wallets? Such transfers might not signify an actual exit from the market, but rather strategic asset management. Actual Exits: Alternatively, these long-term investors might be capitalizing on current price levels, perhaps viewing them as a peak or a favorable point to de-risk. This would imply a genuine sale into fiat or other assets, potentially influencing short-term supply. This unusual activity from long-term Bitcoin holders suggests a moment of strategic decision-making, impacting overall market dynamics and investor sentiment. Understanding the Impact on Broader Crypto Market Trends When significant Bitcoin profit-taking occurs, it naturally influences broader crypto market trends . While profit realization is a healthy part of any market cycle, a large-scale event like this can have several effects: Increase Selling Pressure: More supply entering the market from long-held coins can potentially create downward price pressure, at least in the short term. This is a common reaction to large sell-offs. Indicate Market Sentiment: It can reflect a shift in sentiment, where some long-term investors believe current prices offer a good exit point. This doesn’t necessarily mean a bear market is imminent, but it signals caution among a seasoned group of investors. Provide Liquidity: On the flip side, these sales provide crucial liquidity for new investors or those looking to accumulate Bitcoin at current levels, potentially absorbing the selling pressure. Analyzing these movements helps investors gauge the overall health and direction of the market, offering valuable insights into current market dynamics . Navigating the Current Market Dynamics for BTC Holders For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these market dynamics is key. The fact that long-term BTC holders are taking profits doesn’t automatically spell doom, but it does call for informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and expert analysis to understand the nuances of these large movements. Reliable data sources are your best friend. Diversify: Consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Spreading your investments can help cushion potential impacts. Long-Term View: Remember that Bitcoin has a history of volatility. Focus on your personal investment goals rather than reacting to every short-term price swing. Patience often yields better results. This period of significant Bitcoin profit-taking offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of digital assets. It reminds us that even the most dedicated holders respond to market conditions. In conclusion, the recent realization of over $1 billion in profits by Bitcoin holders , especially from those holding for 7-10 years, marks a notable event in the crypto space. While the exact motivations behind these movements remain a subject of analysis—whether internal transfers or actual market exits—they undoubtedly contribute to the current market dynamics and influence overall crypto market trends . Staying vigilant and informed is essential for navigating these exciting yet complex times in the world of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ""Bitcoin profit-taking"" mean? A1: Bitcoin profit-taking refers to the act of selling Bitcoin (BTC) that has appreciated in value, converting it into fiat currency or other assets to realize the financial gains. It’s a common strategy for investors to lock in profits. Q2: Why is it significant that long-term BTC holders are selling? A2: Long-term BTC holders, often called ""HODLers,"" are typically less reactive to short-term price movements. Their decision to sell can indicate a belief that current prices are highly favorable, or it might be part of a larger portfolio rebalancing strategy. It’s an unusual event that draws market attention. Q3: Does this massive profit-taking mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? A3: Not necessarily. While large profit-taking can create short-term selling pressure, the market’s ability to absorb these sales without a significant price drop can indicate underlying strength. It provides liquidity for new buyers and can be a healthy part of market cycles. However, it’s wise to observe subsequent market reactions. Q4: How can I stay informed about these crypto market trends? A4: To stay informed, regularly check reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, analyze on-chain data (like that from Coinglass), follow expert market analysts, and consider subscribing to newsletters that provide deep dives into market behavior and market dynamics . Q5: What defines ""long-term Bitcoin"" holders in this context? A5: In this context, ""long-term Bitcoin"" holders specifically refers to those who have held their BTC for 7 to 10 years, as highlighted by the Coinglass data. These are typically early adopters or investors with a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Did you find this analysis of Bitcoin profit-taking insightful?

In July, the exchange’s futures trading volume soared to $2.55 trillion — the highest it’s been since January — marking a resurgence in market activity after a volatile summer for cryptocurrencies. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartun, this spike came in the wake of major price swings across both Bitcoin and altcoins, following the crypto market’s historic $4 trillion capitalization peak earlier in the month. The subsequent pullback did little to dampen trading enthusiasm, as increased volatility drew traders back to derivatives platforms in large numbers. Binance Not the Only One Binance wasn’t the only exchange to see action. Competitors Bybit and OKX reported significant volumes as well — $929 billion and $1.09 trillion, respectively — yet Binance remained the clear frontrunner, accounting for more than half of all derivatives trading volume across major exchanges. Binance currently supports 568 trading pairs and boasts the industry’s highest liquidity, with a daily trading volume of $82 billion. On July 18 alone, the platform recorded a four-month high of $134 billion in daily volume, according to CoinGecko. The surge in futures volume may be more than just a blip. It suggests a broader re-engagement from institutional traders and retail users alike, especially as crypto prices look to stabilize post-correction. “The increase in trading suggests more users are active again, possibly due to the recent price breakout,” Maartun said. Futures Activity Signals Institutional Engagement Futures contracts — which allow investors to bet on the future prices of assets like Bitcoin and Ether without owning them — are essential tools in price discovery. Higher volume in these markets often correlates with key trend shifts or uncertainty, as more traders express directional views. More participation in futures also hints at rising leverage, which can lead to sharper moves in spot markets when positions get liquidated. Open Interest (OI) remains elevated at around $79 billion for Bitcoin futures, per CoinGlass. While this is slightly down from its mid-July peak of $88 billion, it still represents a high level of market exposure. Should OI continue to climb unchecked , analysts warn of a potential leverage flushout — a rapid unwinding of leveraged positions — that could trigger sharp corrections in Bitcoin and altcoin prices.

Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Requests Dismissal of FTX's $1.76 Billion Lawsuit In the court petition, Zhao argued that his residence in the United Arab Emirates meant he was outside the jurisdiction of Delaware. The petition also emphasized the international nature of the transactions, stating that US law does not apply to such cross-border situations. “The plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent transfers unlawfully seek the application of bankruptcy law abroad,” it said. Zhao isn't the first Binance-affiliated figure to question the court's authority in this complex legal process. In July, former Binance executives Samuel Wenjun Lim and Dinghua Xiao also filed similar motions to dismiss the lawsuits. The lawsuit in question was filed by FTX Trust and FTX Digital Markets Ltd. in November 2024. The lawsuit is based on Sam Bankman-Fried's July 2021 share buyback transactions from Binance, alleging that Binance and certain executives improperly transferred funds as a result of these transactions.

Projects and users don't need to register liquid staking transactions. The move boosts institutional confidence but faces some internal dissent. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a position statement on liquid staking, clarifying that these activities and the tokens issued by such protocols do not constitute a securities offering. According to this guidance, both projects issuing liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and users who hold or trade these assets are not required to register these transactions. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) in liquid staking protocols across multiple networks is nearly $67 billion: The SEC has previously issued similar guidance on staking, noting that while these recommendations are not binding in enforcement actions, they reflect the regulator’s overall stance. The move has been welcomed by many in the industry. Alluvial CEO Mara Schmidt told Cointelegraph, “Institutions can now confidently integrate LSTs into their products which is sure to drive new revenue streams, expand customer bases, and enable the creation of secondary markets for staked assets.” However, not all SEC Commissioners agreed with the new guidance. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw argued the recommendations were based on ”shaky facts,” said they ”only muddy the waters,” and included legal conclusions that might not be applicable in practice. Additionally, the SEC's decision comes as global regulators continue to scrutinize decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, with several countries proposing new rules on staking services. The popularity of liquid staking has surged alongside Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, increasing institutional interest in compliant DeFi solutions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 12:26:19

He thinks Ethereum has a strong chance of flipping Bitcoin in network value, driven by the rapid growth of ETH treasury companies. Bitmine, which already holds nearly 1% of all ETH, aims to secure 5% of the supply, moving much faster than Bitcoin treasury giants like MicroStrategy. According to Lee, ETH treasuries are not just asset holders. By staking their ETH, these companies become critical infrastructure for Ethereum , earning native yields and actively supporting the network. Unlike ETFs, treasury companies can accumulate ETH faster, create supply scarcity, and benefit from Ethereum's growing ecosystem of tokenized assets and real-world financial applications. Lee compared Ethereum’s current state to Bitcoin’s 2017 breakout moment, emphasizing that Wall Street hasn’t fully grasped Ethereum’s role as the backbone of tokenization, AI, and decentralized finance (DeFi) . He expects Ethereum to revisit $4,000 soon and sees potential for a price surge to $7,000–$15,000 by year-end. Long term, Lee believes Ethereum could reach 100x its current value, mirroring Bitcoin’s trajectory. While some investors worry about a potential bubble in crypto treasuries, Lee argues that as long as these companies avoid exotic debt structures and leverage, their value will grow sustainably. He dismisses rigid spreadsheet models, stating that ETH’s price will be driven by broader adoption, velocity of ETH accumulation, and the liquidity of these treasury firms. For traditional investors seeking exposure to Ethereum, treasury companies like Bitmine offer a unique route, especially for institutions unable to buy ETH directly or through ETFs. Lee points out that Bitmine’s strategy of accumulating ETH at scale, while remaining fully compliant with US regulations, positions it as a key player in Ethereum’s future. In his view, Ethereum’s undervaluation today presents a rare opportunity. As Wall Street and global institutions pivot towards blockchain, Ethereum treasuries could become the new “Exxon Mobiles” of the digital economy—valued not just for their assets, but for their role in securing and scaling blockchain infrastructure.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|ZRX|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-08-06 12:29:01

Currently, users must estimate costs for different resources like computation, storage, and bandwidth. EIP-7999 replaces that with a single global maximum fee, streamlining the process and reducing the complexity involved in interacting with Ethereum. The proposed change not only promises to improve the user experience but also enhances capital efficiency across the network. This new fee model also seeks to fix some of the rigidity introduced by EIP-1559, which focused solely on execution-related fees. By allowing validators to prioritize transactions more efficiently, EIP-7999 could reduce fee volatility and make Ethereum more accessible to mainstream users. Competition pressure behind the proposed fee structure change Ethereum’s proposed fee overhaul comes at a time of intense competition. Rival blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche are rapidly gaining traction by offering cheaper and faster alternatives. In this context, EIP-7999 is seen as a direct response to growing pressure from these networks. The Dencun upgrade in March 2024 had already slashed layer-2 transaction costs by 95%, reducing average fees from $86 to just $0.39. However, Ethereum’s fee revenue has become increasingly volatile, while competitors like Tron and Solana have seen their transaction volumes and fee income surge. The new proposal aligns with Ethereum’s ongoing strategy to optimize cost structures, enhance scalability, and strengthen its appeal to developers and institutional users alike. Institutions double down on ETH Meanwhile, Ethereum’s fundamentals continue to attract institutional capital. On August 4, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming acquired 18,680 ETH — worth approximately $66.6 million — via Galaxy Digital. This move brought its total ETH holdings to nearly 498,884 ETH, valued at around $1.8 billion. SharpLink’s growing ETH treasury reflects its belief in Ethereum’s long-term relevance in the Web3 economy. The company’s chairman, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, emphasized that this acquisition reinforces Ethereum’s mission of decentralization and institutional integration. Over recent weeks, SharpLink has aggressively accumulated ETH through direct purchases from the Ethereum Foundation and secondary markets, while also participating in staking to support the network. Ethereum price outlook At the time of writing, ETH is trading at approximately $3,618, with a 24-hour price range between $3,557 and $3,673. After finding support around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,392 on Sunday, Ethereum bounced back with a 10.25% recovery. However, bullish momentum stalled at the $3,730 daily resistance level. On Tuesday, ETH faced rejection and dropped nearly 3%, with the price slipping to around $3,588 on Wednesday. If the correction continues, analysts warn that ETH could retest support at $3,400. Should this level fail to hold, the price may revisit the $2,957 support level. A move below this threshold could deepen the correction further. On the upside, a daily close above $3,730 may trigger a rebound toward the next resistance at $3,786, with further upside potential toward $3,961 and possibly $4,100.

However, the MACD continues to show a bearish crossover, reinforcing the current correction bias.

The project team lead, Shytoshi Kusama, disclosed this on X, noting that it is a step towards full decentralization. According to a blog post by Kusama, the elections will mark a transition of power and the start of the Shib Network State. He noted that the structures are already in place, and the first step is finding new leaders for the ecosystem. Kusama wrote: “This will be an event like the transition of power in any state, our first and therefore delicate yet powerful in design. A new lead visionary and councils for each dao will need to be chosen.” In order to achieve this, the Shib decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will elect an interim president who will lead the ecosystem’s transition into a network state and shepherd its technological infrastructure and massive community. Kusama explained how the election would go, noting that there would be three rounds of voting. After initial nomination, there will be a vote to select the top ten, followed by a debate among the top candidates. A second vote will pick the top three, and another debate will occur before the final vote. However, he noted the Shiba Inu team will retain the right to veto any candidate, and the winning candidate must complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process with the Shiba Inu Foundation and sign a strict Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA). Shiba Inu whale is likely to become president While Kusama noted that the election process will be transparent and fair, he added that such a person should be a SHIB whale, noting that this would mean they have more incentive to ensure that the ecosystem succeeds as they stand to lose the most if it fails. He wrote : “It is my belief that not only should the candidate be well versed in our actual inception, creation, and challenges, but should be a whale in the Shib community…they have the most skin in our success.” The chances of a whale winning are further reinforced by the recommendation that it should be a 1 token = 1 vote multivote system, where all ecosystem tokens can be used. This effectively means those who have the most tokens supporting them will win. However, the role of President for the Shib Network State comes with many responsibilities according to the post. These include coordinating the transition of power and execution of Shib Paper vision and guidelines while establishing DAO councils and the first Shiba Inu congress. Beyond these administrative responsibilities, Kusama noted that the President’s most important role is managing the community and the project and ensuring that it achieves the vision behind its creation. He acknowledged that it is a herculean task for anyone. With Kusama now disclosing the next phase for Shiba Inu, the post noted that the role of the Shiba Inu team will also change. It will still be responsible for handling the election, but the direction of the Shiba Inu project will now become the responsibility of the decentralized community. Can a new governance direction change SHIB’s fortune? Meanwhile, the latest announcement, a few days after Shiba Inu clocks five years of existence, highlights how far the project has come from being a memecoin . Over the period, it has become a multi-token ecosystem with TREAT and BONE joining SHIB while also launching several products, including the Shibarium Layer-2 network and Shiboshi non-fungible tokens, among others. However, not all these updates and releases have impacted the Shiba Inu token value much. Since reaching its peak in 2021, the token has been in decline. This year alone, it has already lost around 44% of its value and fallen out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Given its current performance, investors in the token will be hoping that the recent decentralization efforts could lead to more impactful community-led decisions that will boost the token value. Nevertheless, any significant increase in SHIB value would first require a massive burn of SHIB tokens, given its current supply of over 589 trillion tokens.

In a recent post on X , the well-known finance coach criticized how people prioritize their spending, urging them to reconsider their financial choices. Coach JV pointed out that many individuals frequently scroll through social media, make impulsive purchases on Amazon, and finance luxury vehicles without hesitation. He stated, “People will mindlessly scroll on social, binge shop on Amazon, and finance a $70K car but won’t take the time to research deflationary assets like Bitcoin/XRP.” His comments were directed at the tendency of many to spend money on rapidly depreciating items while ignoring assets with long-term growth potential. He encouraged consumers to create a budget and commit to a DCA strategy instead, explaining that regularly investing in appreciating assets could reshape their financial future. People will mindlessly scroll on social, binge shop on Amazon, and finance a $70K car but won’t take the time to research deflationary assets like Bitcoin/XRP, create a budget, and dollar-cost average for 10 years. That one discipline could radically transform their family’s… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) August 4, 2025 Measuring the Impact of a 10-Year DCA Approach To evaluate the potential impact of Coach JV’s advice, we used the Uphold DCA calculator to simulate a decade-long investment in XRP and Bitcoin . The results were significant. If an investor had consistently allocated $583 per month into XRP from August 2015 to July 2025, the total investment would have amounted to $69,960. Today, that investment would be worth approximately $4.49 million. In a similar scenario using the same monthly amount and time frame, a DCA strategy in Bitcoin would have yielded a portfolio valued at about $3.5 million. Though Bitcoin produced a higher overall percentage gain, XRP’s price behavior brought stronger returns under a DCA method. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Growth of XRP and Bitcoin In August 2015, XRP was priced around $0.008. Today, it trades close to $3, which marks a 37,400% rise. During the same period, Bitcoin increased from roughly $285 to $114,000, resulting in a 39,900% gain. Despite Bitcoin’s higher growth in raw percentage terms, XRP’s less predictable, more volatile movement has proven beneficial for long-term, periodic investors. Between November 2024 and January 2025, for example, XRP experienced a notable surge of over 580%, a burst that significantly boosted DCA-based returns. In contrast, Bitcoin followed a steadier growth trajectory over the years. Is It Too Late to Start? Experts Say No The impressive returns seen from the past ten years might lead some to assume the opportunity has passed. However, several figures in the crypto industry argue that the market is still early. Edoardo Farina, a well-known crypto educator, has said that XRP continues to present strong potential for future growth. Bitcoin also retains significant upside, according to advocates like Michael Saylor, who has suggested that the asset could eventually reach $13 million. These projections reinforce the idea that committing to a long-term, disciplined investment strategy today may still lead to substantial financial gains. A Call to Strategic Action Coach JV’s message is clear: rather than spending on goods that rapidly lose value, individuals should consider redirecting part of their monthly income into digital assets with proven performance. Through consistency and planning, a 10-year DCA strategy for assets like XRP could provide not only individual wealth but also long-term security for future generations.

ETH is currently trading at $3,631.19, an increase of 1.52% a movement that has most traders reevaluating their Ethereum price prediction targets. With Ethereum gathering momentum, newer ETH-based tokens like Ethena, Ether-Fi and even off-Ethereum DeFi solutions like Remittix are gaining notice for their strong fundamentals and growing use cases. Ethereum Price Forecast and Rise of ETH-Based Tokens The recent hike in Ethereum price has sparked fresh discussion regarding crypto staking, Layer 2 scaling solutions and DeFi solutions on the Ethereum network. With a market cap of $438.31 billion and volume peaking over $33.14 billion (more than 48% higher), ETH continues to be among the major pillars of the crypto economy. Simultaneously, investors are looking wider afield than at Ethereum itself. Tokens such as Ethena and Ether-Fi are increasingly popular among those hoping for the best long-term crypto investment or next top altcoin 2025. Ethena and Ether-Fi: Are These The Next Ethereum Power Tokens? Ethena is currently priced at $0.5996 and has a market cap of $3.96 billion. However, it has fallen by 3.52%, while the trading volume fell by almost 20% to end at $888.46 million. Despite the fall, it remains a strong candidate among crypto with actual utility, especially for those interested in future crypto projects involving ETH infrastructure. Ether-Fi, though, is gaining ground. It’s up at $1.01, with a 0.4% increase along with a 39.46% surge in daily volumes now at $85.31 million. With its market cap at $427.04 million, it’s one of the low cap crypto hidden gems likely to surf Ethereum’s wave upwards, especially for early stage investors in cryptocurrencies. Remittix: The Cross-Chain DeFi Project Changing the Game While Ethereum-based tokens are gaining popularity, Remittix (RTX) is one of the gems of cross-chain DeFi projects developed with real-world practical crypto adoption in mind. Its application is solving a very real problem: transferring crypto straight into bank accounts in 30+ countries rapidly. For $0.0895 per token, Remittix has raised more than $18.1 million with more than 582 million tokens sold. The platform recently released its beta wallet that is launching in Q3 2025. This wallet will support 40+ cryptocurrencies, real-time FX conversion and fiat payouts placing it at the forefront of July 2025 crypto to invest choices. There’s also a 50% token bonus live during this presale phase. Compared to the majority of early-stage crypto projects, Remittix has already built actual payment rails and functionality that is attractive to both legacy users and crypto natives.

According to experts, predicting whether it will return to this level may be premature and even pessimistic at this stage. However, as long as the price remains above $105,696, the current uptrend is assumed to continue. However, a drop below this level is considered a strong warning sign of a bear market.

Both meme coins are attracting new holders and maintaining a strong volume. Despite this, there’s a new contender in the market that is promising 5x in just weeks. DeSoc is, without doubt, the best crypto in 2025. It is building fast, and it’s not just hype. It’s offering real features that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu don’t have. With its presale now live, early investors are rushing in before the price jumps. Image showing the price of Doge Dogecoin And Shiba Inu See Renewed Interest Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been around for years, and they’re not slowing down. Dogecoin is up over 45% in the last 30 days. Elon Musk still supports it, and it’s finding more use in online tipping and payments. With a loyal fan base and high visibility, it continues to hold its spot among the top 10 cryptos. Similarly, SHIB continues to prove that it is more than just a meme. The SHIB team has expanded into DeFi and NFTs. Their Shibarium layer-2 network is live, with more apps coming. Together, these two coins still control a large part of the meme coin market. But meme coins can only go so far. That’s why investors are now watching DeSoc closely. Image showing the price of SHIB DeSoc Could 5x As It Rewards Real Use DeSoc is not just another meme or trend. It’s a social crypto project where users get rewarded for their time and content. Here’s the hook: it pays you to post, engage, and build communities. Here’s what makes it stand out: Users earn $SOCS for posting, liking, and sharing content. Tokens can be used to boost posts or buy ad space. All actions are recorded on the blockchain. Nothing can be faked. Smart contracts make the system fair and clear. Unlike Dogecoin and SHIB, DeSoc has a clear use. It’s not just about trading, it’s about rewarding value and engagement. The total supply of $SOCS is fixed at 3 billion. 45% of those are available in presale now. That means early investors will hold nearly half of the tokens and benefit the most from future price jumps. Why Investors Are Jumping Into DeSoc Crypto investors are looking for more than memes. They want tokens with a good use case and that can still grow fast. DeSoc fits these requirements perfectly; it is the best crypto in 2025. The team has rolled out a full roadmap. It includes audits, exchange listings, and smart contract upgrades. The presale is live, and there are just 30 days left for you to take advantage of this opportunity. And because $SOCS is still relatively inexpensive, you can make well over 5x of your investment when the price goes up. Don’t Just Watch SHIB And DOGE, Act Now Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are solid. They’ve proven they can survive the ups and downs of the volatile crypto market. But they’ve already made their biggest gains. If you’re looking for a token with real growth ahead, DeSoc should be at the top of your list. The project has fresh momentum, a live presale, and a system that pays users to build the platform. Time’s running out. DeSoc could be your next big win.

In a statement released Tuesday, the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance outlined its view that certain liquid staking arrangements — including the issuance of receipt tokens like stETH — do not constitute securities transactions. The clarification represents progress for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, which has long sought regulatory certainty around staking models. It also shows a potential shift in how U.S. regulators approach blockchain-based innovations that involve derivative representations of crypto assets. Liquid Staking Receives Long-Awaited Regulatory Clarity Liquid staking refers to a process in which users stake their crypto assets with a third-party protocol and, in return, receive a new token that represents their deposit and accrued staking rewards. These receipt tokens — such as stETH in the case of Ethereum — allow users to maintain liquidity while still participating in network staking. The SEC’s latest statement aims to clarify whether these arrangements are subject to U.S. securities laws. For many in the industry, the answer comes as welcome news. Sam Kim, Chief Legal Officer of Lido Labs Foundation, described the guidance as a breakthrough moment: “Yesterday’s SEC guidance confirming that liquid staking and receipt tokens like stETH do not constitute securities provides the much-needed guidance that Lido and the wider industry have needed.” A Big Day for Ethereum: SEC Clarity on Liquid Staking Yesterday's SEC guidance confirming that liquid staking and receipt tokens like stETH do not constitute securities provides the much needed guidance that Lido and the industry have needed. As the leading liquid staking… https://t.co/H2WN1BWKSF — Lido (@LidoFinance) August 6, 2025 Kim explains that the clarity will encourage further participation from institutional investors and platforms that had previously been hesitant due to legal uncertainty. Path Cleared for Institutional and Platform Integration With the regulatory fog lifting, liquid staking protocols may now gain broader acceptance with centralized exchanges, fintech platforms, and regulated investment firms. “This opens the door for U.S.-based platforms, financial institutions, and users to engage with liquid staking protocols more freely,” Kim said. “Without the fear of triggering securities laws, more protocols may integrate liquid staking tokens, expanding their utility across DeFi.” By removing the perceived legal risk associated with staking receipts, the SEC’s position could help increase liquidity and utility for such tokens across the U.S. financial ecosystem. Legal Experts Highlight Implications for Broader Token Design Legal analysts suggest the SEC’s language on liquid staking may have broader implications beyond staking itself. Jason Gottlieb, a partner at Morrison Cohen, said the agency’s approach reflects a logical evolution in how it categorizes crypto assets and derivatives. “At heart, a liquid staking token is just a receipt on a token,” said Gottlieb. “With the SEC now correctly taking the position that cryptocurrency tokens themselves are not securities, it makes sense that a receipt for a token is not a receipt for a security.” Gottlieb adds that this reasoning could influence future regulatory considerations around cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens — mechanisms that similarly rely on receipt-style representations. A Pivotal Step for U.S. Crypto Market Maturity As the world’s largest capital market, the United States remains a critical frontier for the growth of digital asset ecosystems. With liquid staking protocols now operating under clearer rules, DeFi builders and institutional actors alike may find renewed confidence to innovate and engage. For stakeholders like Lido and other major protocols, the SEC’s latest stance is more than a legal signal — it’s an invitation to scale.

Meme coins are facing stiff competition from projects with investor-centric tokenomics and real utility. SHIB and DOGE investor attention and choice are shifting to innovative presale projects with real utility. One such project is DeSoc , a decentralised social integration API, rapidly gaining traction among analysts, investors, and developers. Are meme coins out of the trend? Or are investors just willing to invest in real-life utility projects like DeSoc? Let’s get into it. Meme Coin Excitement Fatigue It’s no news that meme coins rely mostly on hypes, trends, and endorsements. Typical meme coins offer no real utility, often contributing to their high volatility, especially when excitement rises. During the last bull run, a lot of meme coins were delivered over 100x in a timeframe of six months. Some of these memecoin include DOGE and SHIB. However, both meme coins are established and have maxed out their early explosive stage. With SHIB having a market cap of $8.69 billion and DOGE with $38.32 billion, their growth potential is limited. A 10x seems almost impossible, or not in a short time frame. Technical Analysis Outlook According to Investtech analysts , Dogecoin has broken the ceiling of the falling trend in the medium-long term, which indicates a slower initial falling rate. DOGE has given a positive signal from the double bottom formation by a breakout through the resistance at $0.25. DOGE price could rise to $0.36. However, if the market reverses, $0.25 will become the needed support. Source; Investtech Trading volume is balanced with high volume on rising prices and low volume on days of falling prices. And with an RSI of above 70 after a good price increase over the past weeks, further increases are possible. Shiba Inu price action is synonymous with DOGE, currently trading at $ 0.000014, steadily recovering from its 2025 lowest low of $0.00001059 on the 22nd of June. Source; CoinCodex Shiba Inu price prediction sentiment is bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index showing 74 (greed). While both seem to have a positive outlook, investors are getting impatient. They are investing in early-stage presales with high potential, like DeSoc. Why Are Investors Choosing DeSoc? DeSoc is a newly launched Web3 decentralised social media integration project. It aims to bridge the gap between Web2 (traditional social platforms, like X, Instagram, and TikTok) and Web3. It offers an open API infrastructure that allows content, identity, and analytics to move freely between Web2 and Web3 platforms. DeSoc’s token, $SOCS, is still in its early stage of presale, allowing early investors to enter at a low price before launch and exchange listings. $SOCS is a utility token that users can use to purchase advertisements, posts, and other services on the platform. DeSoc is built with user-centric tokenomics. $SOCS holders will be regularly incentivised via various mechanisms, such as content monetisation, token rewards, and community recognition. They also earn by participating in community tasks and contributing to the ecosystem. After launch, DeSoc presale investors’ portfolio would pump by over 10x, delivering meme-coin pumps, recreating what SHIB and DOGE did in 2021. While DOGE and SHIB have maxed out their early potential, DeSoc ($SOCS) is building a next-generation Web3 social infrastructure.

Those who caught Solana before it surged, or got into Cardano when it was trading under $0.10, know the power of being early. Many seasoned holders are looking toward something new: a decentralized social media platform called DeSoc , powered by the promising utility token $SOCS. With its presale underway, DeSoc is turning heads; not just because of what it does, but because of what it stands for. It aims to reshape how we think about social networks by bringing them onto the blockchain, which has the kind of growth potential that early adopters are always on the lookout for. Solana and Cardano: Loyal Communities That Spot Opportunity Early What makes Solana and Cardano communities so valuable isn’t just the size of their ecosystems, but their ability to identify real innovation . Source: LiteFinance Cardano and Solana investors aren’t swayed by hype alone; they want to see function, utility, and vision. And that’s precisely what DeSoc delivers. DeSoc isn’t just launching a token but laying the groundwork for a complete decentralized social layer. The platform links up with familiar apps like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok through smooth integrations, but adds a significant twist: users stay in charge of their content, how they engage, and how they earn from it. The Rise of Utility in the Social Layer The $SOCS token is what makes DeSoc tick. Unlike meme tokens or even some general-purpose cryptos, $SOCS is a functional currency within a working digital ecosystem. Whether users are tipping creators, unlocking exclusive content, staking, or voting on platform changes, $SOCS is the currency of interaction. This functionality draws savvy investors, especially those who backed Cardano and Solana for their technical merit. It’s also why $SOCS is seeing early traction in its presale, as word spreads about what the platform offers. Why DeSoc is Different—and What’s Coming Next With data privacy becoming a mainstream concern and centralized platforms increasingly facing user backlash, DeSoc offers an alternative: a place where users can own their data, earn from their engagement, and participate in shaping the platform’s future. Key features that have Solana and Cardano holders paying attention include: Cross-platform functionality via advanced API integrations Decentralized governance with voting power based on token holdings A real use case in one of the most widely adopted digital behaviors—social networking A token ($SOCS) that fuels actual activity, not just speculation These investors have already seen how early utility can drive massive returns; Solana’s DeFi integrations and Cardano’s smart contract rollouts proved that. Now, they’re looking for similar innovation in the social layer of Web3, and DeSoc is leading the charge. Getting In Early—While It Still Counts The current $SOCS presale offers early investors a rare chance to buy in before listings, platform releases, and broader exposure kick in. Just like those who got into Solana and Cardano before major bull runs, today’s DeSoc supporters are positioning themselves ahead of what could be a significant shift in how we connect online. And with $SOCS also functioning as a reward token, the earning potential is layered, not just from price appreciation, but through platform engagement and staking. It’s worth noting that DeSoc’s mission isn’t to replace social media; it’s to fix it, decentralize it, and reward the people who create and connect. Click This Link To Check Out The Desoc Presale.

PI’s price recently slumped to a new all-time low, dragged down by a market-wide correction, ongoing token unlocks, and declining investor interest. More Time for Pioneers Pi Network’s ecosystem consists not only of its native cryptocurrency but also numerous other features. Among the examples are the .pi Domains, which, according to the team, are intended to be “functional Web3 identifiers, anchors for PI-powered apps, services, and storefronts.” Just recently, the team reminded that the .pi Domains Auction was extended to September 30, 2025, in order for users to have additional time to innovate, build, and bid for their applications. Through the domains, pioneers will be able to personalize their PI wallets or identities. For example, instead of long addresses consisting of multiple letters and numbers, people can use their names and the .pi ending to receive payments or operate within the ecosystem. The domains are similar in concept to .eth (Ethereum Name Services) or .bnb (BSC Name Services). Pi Network’s team is notorious for its extensions of previously set deadlines. The project, which saw the light of day in 2019, had postponed the launch of its Open Network and many other important events over the past few years. The latest extension wasn’t met kindly by many members of the community, with some labeling Pi Network as a scam and others losing their trust in it. PI Continues to Decline The price of Pi Network’s native token has been in a state of free fall over the past months, recently plummeting to a new all-time low of $0.33 (per CoinGecko’s data). PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The negative performance aligns with the latest correction of the entire cryptocurrency market, the constant unlocks of PI tokens, and the diminished investor interest in the asset. However, the recent accumulation of a mysterious whale and the potential listing of the asset on a major exchange may reverse the bearish trend. There are some rumors that Binance could embrace PI in mid-August: a move that will increase the token’s liquidity, improve its visibility, and provide it with a reputational boost. The world’s biggest crypto exchange, though, hasn’t announced anything officially on the matter and continues to stand aside from the asset. Some of the well-known platforms where people can trade PI include Gate.io, Bitget, OKX, and others.

Blockchain security firms Lookonchain, PeckShield, and Scam Sniffer reported the incident, tracing the theft to a phishing attack where the victim unknowingly signed a malicious transfer, draining their wallet of Aave-wrapped USDT (aEthUSDT). Anatomy of a Multi-Million Dollar Theft According to on-chain data analyzed by Scam Sniffer, the victim’s address, 0x2d98…6695, interacted with a phishing contract, after which they signed a transaction authorizing the transfer of their aEthUSDT tokens, worth over $3 million, to the scammer’s address. The security experts stated that the scam relied entirely on tricking the user into approving this single, harmful transaction, bypassing the need for direct wallet access. This incident follows a worrying pattern identified by Scam Sniffer involving attackers exploiting EIP-7702 upgraded addresses. Only recently, the platform revealed two addresses that lost $146,551 and $66,000 from such tactics, with malicious batched transfers disguised as legitimate Uniswap swap operations. “Attackers use batch transfers… routing through Uniswap Universal Router to appear legitimate. Be extra cautious!” the on-chain security platform warned. Just days ago, the firm reported on another victim who lost more than $908,000 from a phishing approval they had signed 458 days earlier, advising users to “regularly review and revoke old approvals.” These events follow broader trends highlighted in a recent Bitget report: crypto recorded $4.6 billion in scam losses during 2024, with AI-enabled fraud accounting for nearly 40% of high-value drain events. What Users Need to Know Phishing attack lines often simulate support, wallet prompts, or investment depictions, only to steal when users sign fake requests. Those behind such scams commonly use social media links, fake KYC portals, or false contract prompts. Therefore, users are advised to religiously verify all transactions before signing, especially batch or approval prompts, and confirm that URLs come from official sources. This latest case demonstrates how high-value addresses remain only a signature away from ruin, despite strong on-chain experience or wallet age. The fact that over $3 million was transferred in a batch suggests advanced targeting, not just random spam. Recent regulatory moves and industry watchdog programs, like Bitget, SlowMist, and Elliptic’s $300 million Anti‑Scam Hub, are aiming to detect and disrupt such fraudulent networks, but users must remain cautious. Not all security providers can act in real time, and, like crypto security experts warn, defenders lose more than they can prevent unless every on‑chain signature is questioned.

Whispers of a $300 Solana price prediction are making the rounds, and this time, it doesn’t feel like wishful thinking. With its network stronger than ever and sentiment shifting fast, SOL might be gearing up for one of the biggest comebacks in crypto. But here’s the twist: while everyone’s eyes are glued to Solana, a different name is quietly lighting up private investor chats. A hot new altcoin just launched its presale, and early adopters are already calling it their “next 100x bet.” No loud hype, no flashy marketing, just a sharp idea, perfect timing, and the kind of early buzz that usually comes before a major breakout. $300 Is a Stretch, but the Setup Isn’t Bad: Solana Price Prediction Chatter Grows Louder Solana’s having a strong July comeback. After drifting through June, it’s now back above $150 and currently holding steady at around $192 . Traders who were on the fence are starting to circle back, and that $300 Solana price prediction for 2025 doesn’t sound so wild anymore. With solid fundamentals and a wave of renewed interest, SOL looks like it’s prepping for something bigger. A major spark came from the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana ETF . It dropped on July 2 and didn’t waste time as it raised over $222 million in volume and $69.7 million in net inflows in just two weeks. And that’s with a 0.75% fee. It’s clear: institutions want in, and they’re not waiting for perfect conditions. But while Solana steadies its climb, another player is sprinting out of the gates. A hot new altcoin called DeSoc has kicked off its presale, and it’s already buzzing in early investor circles. Quiet now? Sure! But if the early calls of 100x gains are even halfway right, this might not stay under the radar much longer. This Hot New Altcoin Is Sneaking Up on Everyone as Solana Eyes $300. Every cycle has its surprise winners, and more often than not, it’s the low-key, early-stage projects that pull off the biggest runs. Just like Solana once flipped the script during its early climb, a hot new altcoin named DeSoc is now attracting serious early momentum. Its approach isn’t just ambitious, it’s disruptive. DeSoc is building the first blockchain-based platform that lets users post across TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook at once, all while staying in full control of their data. Its presale is already live, with $SOCS tokens priced at just $0.01. That’s the part catching early buyers off guard, not because it’s cheap, but because the structure actually makes sense. 1.35 billion tokens (45%) are reserved for presale, split across 12 stages, with a steady 10-week vesting that keeps it fair and prevents sudden dumps. And with a hard cap of $50K per buyer, it’s designed to avoid whale games. It’s clean, and that’s rare. But this isn’t just another “buy low” pitch. DeSoc is giving creators real tools: smart contracts that allow tips, paid subscriptions, exclusive content access, ad campaigns, and many more offers. Everything is transparent, traceable, and reward-based. Imagine earning crypto just for posting something people actually like. That’s not just social media on the blockchain, it’s an economy! Some are already calling DeSoc the hot new altcoin of the season, and it’s not hard to see why. With a clear roadmap, clean tokenomics, and a live presale gaining traction, it’s checking boxes that early Solana once did. And if the analyses hold, DeSoc could be the kind of upside you only see once every cycle. Claim Your $SOCS Tokens Now! The DeSoc presale is officially live, and the window to get in early is still open, but not for long. At just $0.01 per $SOCS, this hot new altcoin is already catching the attention of those looking for the next big breakout. If you missed Solana in its early days, this is your second chance.

A fresh XRP price prediction is making the rounds, and it’s not exactly shy. ChatGPT is tipping the XRP price to peak at $4 by next month. It sounds wild, sure, but with the way XRP moves, wild isn’t out of the question. Some traders are watching while others are already making moves Meanwhile, in a corner of the crypto world that most aren’t looking at, a new crypto presale called DeSoc is starting to stir things up. No big promises, no shouting, just a growing chatter. The presale is already live, and early birds say it could be the one. For those paying attention, the whispers are getting louder, and 100x might not be just talk. Bold XRP Price Prediction Gains Traction as Real-World Deals Fuel Momentum XRP has jumped over 48% in the past 30 days and now trades around $3.23. This rally isn’t just momentum; it’s backed by real headlines. On July 23, Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc. revealed a $20 million corporate XRP treasury , funded through SEC-approved equity financing. That kind of move doesn’t go unnoticed. Also, in Brazil, fund giant VERT debuted a $130 million structured credit platform using the XRP Ledger. This further proves that Ripple’s tech is gaining real-world traction. With sentiment this strong, the bold XRP price prediction of $4 next month suddenly feels a lot less far-fetched. Still, early movers say the most explosive upside might lie in DeSoc, a quiet new crypto presale that’s starting to make serious noise. It’s early, it’s raw, and it’s already being whispered about as the one shot most people will wish they didn’t overlook. DeSoc Emerges as the Quiet Favorite Among Early Movers, despite XRP’s $4 Prediction. Crypto always moves fast, but real opportunities tend to sneak in when everyone’s staring at the obvious plays. Sure, Ripple’s getting the spotlight right now. But in the quieter corners of the market, a few are already calling DeSoc the best new crypto to watch. Its presale just went live at $0.01, and it’s already turning heads. DeSoc isn’t just another shiny token. It’s building something with actual weight, a decentralized social platform that talks directly to Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and more. It’s the $SOCS token that fuels that ecosystem, and the structure behind it is no afterthought. With 45% of supply going to presale and just 5% reserved (and locked) for the team, it’s built for real distribution, not insider games. It’s also backed with security and safety. A 30-year liquidity lock, a 10-week vesting schedule that smooths out market entry, and a 12-hour refund window. Combine that with a clean audit, a hard cap on purchases, and no referral gimmicks, and it’s certain that this one is not built to pump and dump. It’s built to last! So while the XRP price prediction remains a noise and traders ride the wave, DeSoc is building something steadier and stronger beneath the surface. It might just be the best new crypto this cycle; one that rewards those who spot it before the crowd does. XRP Pumps but DeSoc Steals Spotlight! XRP is having its moment, with a bold price prediction of $4 fueling fresh excitement. The headlines are loud, and the momentum is real. But the window for big upside might be narrowing. That’s why some sharp eyes are shifting toward DeSoc, the quiet contender many now call the best new crypto to watch. Its presale just opened, the fundamentals are clean, and early entries are still on the table. If DeSoc delivers even half of what early backers expect, this could be one of those rare plays people look back on and wish they’d grabbed sooner.

It outpaced Ethereum, BNB Chain, and even Solana, once seen as the king of on-chain trading. This suggests that Hyperliquid’s adoption boom might have come at Solana’s expense. SOL shot past $260 in January 2025, riding on the meme coin mania. At its peak, Solana was generating more in transaction fees than the next four chains combined. Meanwhile, the continued decline has led Solana to hover around $165, as it remains down by 13% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. HYPE steals the show from Solana According to VanEck’s crypto recap, July marked a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Solana, which in early 2025 had been the dominant force in on-chain trading. It was hitting as much as four times of revenue of all others put together when factoring in MEV. Hyperliquid has successfully poached Solana’s most valuable users and kept them engaged. This happened because it turned out to be a simpler and more functional product, and that too in the perpetual futures (perps) trading space. Hyperliquid’s HYPE has broken into the top 15 cryptos with a market cap of more than $12.5 billion. It is up by 57% on a YTD basis while Solana’s run has fizzled. However, the HYPE lost its momentum recently. Its price dropped by 12% over the last 7 days to trade around $37.50. Source: VanEck Crypto Monthly Recap for July 2025 Solana is still the 6th biggest crypto with a market cap of $88.1 billion. SOL is trading at an average price of $163.75 at press time. DeFiLlama shows that Solana’s DEX TVL dropped by 2% in the last 7 days, but it is still up by 11% over the month. HYPE has outshone almost every major crypto with its YTD surge. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are up by 22% and 8%, respectively. XRP and TRON also rose by 41% and 32%, respectively, still below Hyperliquid. Can Ethereum regain the crown? The report mentioned that Solana’s thesis rested heavily on its technical edge and a robust builder ecosystem. But despite its vaunted throughput, the chain has failed to deliver the improvements needed to maintain its lead. Central to that disappointment is the Firedancer upgrade project, which was supposed to supercharge Solana’s performance and reliability. Instead, the initiative missed key deadlines, suffered talent attrition, and became mired in internal disputes. This even raises questions about Jump Trading’s suitability to revamp. The Anza team has stepped in to salvage momentum, but the damage is already showing in SOL’s sluggish price and slipping market relevance. Most of the Solana-based meme coins have posted losses on the longer frames. Tokens like BONK and WIF are down by 22% and 53%, respectively, on YTD. Solana only matters if it can channel that throughput into real economic activity. But many financial institutions remain hesitant to build on Solana due to persistent reliability concerns. It seems like Solana has a narrow but crucial window to make its case Ethereum is again appearing to be the default pick for large-scale blockchain deployment, with L2s gaining traction for institutional remittances.

This positive start is a crucial development for anyone tracking broader financial markets , including those deeply invested in cryptocurrencies. Understanding this shift in investor sentiment can provide valuable context for your digital asset strategies and help you anticipate potential movements. What’s Driving This Positive Market Performance? The U.S. Stock Markets have indeed kicked off the day on a strong note, signaling robust confidence among investors. The S&P500 gained 0.14%, the NASDAQ saw a 0.18% increase, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.13%. These early gains reflect a generally optimistic investor sentiment across various sectors, from technology to consumer goods. Analysts are pointing to several factors contributing to this upward trajectory, suggesting a foundational strength in the current economic environment. Key drivers behind today’s encouraging market performance include: Strong Corporate Earnings: Many companies have recently reported earnings that surpassed market expectations, demonstrating resilience and growth potential even amidst global uncertainties. Easing Inflation Concerns: Recent data suggests that inflation might be cooling, which could lead to a less aggressive stance from central banks regarding interest rate hikes. This prospect often fuels optimism in the markets. Positive Economic Data: Broader economic indicators , such as consumer spending reports and manufacturing data, have shown encouraging signs, painting a picture of a resilient economy. Such movements in traditional financial markets are always worth observing, as they often ripple through other asset classes, influencing overall market confidence and liquidity. How Do Economic Indicators Influence Investor Sentiment? Understanding economic indicators is absolutely key to grasping the nuances of U.S. Stock Markets . These data points act as a barometer for economic health and directly shape investor sentiment . When indicators like inflation rates, employment figures, and consumer confidence reports suggest stability or growth, confidence tends to rise. This increased confidence often translates into more buying activity across various asset classes, including equities. For instance, if a new jobs report indicates stronger-than-expected employment growth, it signals a healthy economy, which can reassure investors. Conversely, unexpected downturns can trigger caution. This positive outlook in traditional financial markets can sometimes spill over into the cryptocurrency space. When investors feel more secure about the broader economy and their traditional portfolios, they might be more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like digital currencies. It’s a complex interplay, but generally, a healthy traditional market environment can foster a more favorable backdrop for all investments, boosting overall market performance . What Does This Market Performance Mean for Your Portfolio? The current market performance in the U.S. Stock Markets offers important insights for your investment portfolio, regardless of whether you primarily hold stocks, crypto, or a mix of both. For traditional equity holders, today’s open is certainly welcome news, potentially indicating a continuation of positive trends and an uplift in asset values. However, even in rising markets, vigilance and strategic planning remain crucial. For those with diversified portfolios including cryptocurrencies, a strong stock market can sometimes indicate a broader appetite for risk. This might lead to increased capital flow into digital assets as investors seek higher returns, or it could simply mean that investors are feeling more secure about their overall financial standing. It’s not always a direct correlation, but positive sentiment in one major market can often breed confidence in others. Key considerations for your strategy: Monitor Trends Closely: Observe how long this positive momentum lasts and if it is supported by subsequent economic indicators . Re-evaluate Diversification: A balanced portfolio remains vital. Consider if your current asset allocation still aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals in light of these market movements. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional financial markets and crypto-specific news. Understanding the broader economic narrative is just as important as tracking individual asset performance. Consider Long-Term Goals: Short-term market fluctuations are common. Focus on your long-term investment objectives rather than reacting impulsively to daily changes. This positive start underscores the dynamic nature of global financial markets and the interconnectedness of various asset classes. In conclusion, the strong opening of the U.S. Stock Markets today is a clear signal of prevailing positive investor sentiment . This upward trend, driven by various economic indicators and robust corporate performance, highlights the dynamic nature of financial markets . While this positive market performance is encouraging, especially for those navigating both traditional and digital asset landscapes, continuous analysis and strategic planning remain paramount. The world of finance is interconnected, and understanding these shifts can empower better investment decisions, helping you navigate the exciting opportunities ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are the main U.S. stock market indices mentioned in the article? The article mentions the S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average. These are key benchmarks for the overall health and market performance of the U.S. Stock Markets . Q2: How do U.S. stock market movements affect cryptocurrency markets? While not always a direct correlation, positive movements in U.S. Stock Markets can indicate a broader positive investor sentiment and increased risk appetite. This can sometimes lead to more capital flowing into higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors feel more confident about the overall economic outlook. Q3: What are some key economic indicators investors should watch? Investors should pay attention to economic indicators such as inflation rates, employment figures (like jobless claims and non-farm payrolls), consumer spending reports, and manufacturing data. These provide insights into the economy’s health and can influence investor sentiment . Q4: Should I adjust my investment strategy based on daily market opens? While daily market opens offer a snapshot of current investor sentiment , it’s generally advisable to focus on your long-term investment goals rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations. A well-diversified portfolio and a clear strategy are usually more effective. Q5: What is investor sentiment, and why is it important? Investor sentiment refers to the overall mood or attitude of investors towards a particular market or asset. It’s important because it can significantly influence buying and selling behavior, driving short-term price movements and contributing to overall market performance .

Fresh data from Finbold suggests more subdued performance could be on the horizon. Currently ranked 22nd by market capitalization, SHIB is trading at $0.00001212, with a market cap of $7.14 billion. The token has shed 4.64% in the last seven days and remains down 8.92% year‑over‑year, though it is up 3.49% over the past month. SHIB 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold At its peak on December 5, 2024, SHIB briefly surpassed a $19 billion market cap, a far cry from the $35.91 billion it achieved in October 2021 during its hype‑driven surge. This weakening comes against a backdrop of shifting meme coin dynamics. Finbold reported in November that 97% of meme coins have effectively died, eroding speculative appetite for smaller tokens and cooling the once‑white‑hot meme sector. SHIB governance shift and market impact On August 4, SHIB began electing its first “network president,” a major governance change designed to decentralize control from founder Shytoshi Kusama. While this move could strengthen the network’s long‑term credibility, it has introduced near‑term uncertainty, with traders hesitating as they await clarity on Shibarium upgrades and broader ecosystem direction.

Weak whale participation and stagnant burn activity have also done little to offset persistent sell‑side pressure, leaving SHIB’s short‑term trajectory under strain.

The report showed that the firm increased its Bitcoin exposure, while reducing its Ethereum and XRP holdings.

Meanwhile, the company’s Ethereum and XRP holdings dropped in the second quarter, indicating a sale of some of these coins.

As volatility settles, a potential recovery is beginning to take shape, fueled by key technical signals on lower timeframes. With the market stabilizing, the next move could define the short-term trend. Sharp Pullback Follows Rejection At $115,000 Resistance Zone Providing an update on the current state of the crypto market, Kurnia Bijaksana pointed out that Bitcoin, along with several altcoins, experienced a sharp decline last night. The sudden move caught the attention of traders and analysts alike, prompting a closer look at both the technical and fundamental factors driving the action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buying Spree Ends On Coinbase: Temporary Pause Or Trend Shift? From a purely technical perspective, the decline appears to have been triggered by Bitcoin hitting a key resistance zone near the $115,000 level. Despite the pullback, Kurnia observed that Bitcoin’s price is now showing early signs of recovery. This area has acted as a ceiling for prices in recent sessions, and the rejection sparked selling pressure across the broader crypto market. However, on the intraday chart, a rebound is already underway, suggesting that buyers are stepping in to defend key levels and potentially absorb the recent selling. Whether this bounce can turn into a sustained move higher remains to be seen, but for now, the charts suggest that Bitcoin may be stabilizing after the initial drop. 1-Hour Chart Reveals Early Signs Of A Trend Reversal Kurnia Bijaksana provided further analysis, focusing on Bitcoin’s price action within the 1-hour timeframe. According to the analyst, BTC is currently forming a higher low—a classic indicator that signals growing bullish momentum and the potential for an upward continuation in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic Bijaksana also highlighted the potential development of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically seen as a strong bullish reversal signal. In this case, the neckline of the pattern is located around the $115,300 level, a key resistance zone that Bitcoin must break through to confirm further upside. If Bitcoin manages to break and hold above this neckline, Bijaksana believes it could trigger a measured move toward the $118,000 level. A confirmation of this breakout would provide a clear bullish signal, possibly paving the way for continued strength in the coming sessions. Bitcoin is currently priced around $114,315, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $2.2 trillion. Over the past 24 hours, it has recorded a trading volume of more than $58.8 billion, reflecting strong market activity.

One of the ETFs will feature a direct allocation to XRP and Bitcoin, while the other will combine Bitcoin exposure with gold, marking a significant expansion of SBI’s blockchain and digital asset ambitions. Source: SBI Q2 Report The proposed funds, titled the Crypto Asset ETF and Digital Gold Crypto ETF , seek to address rising institutional demand for crypto investment products , particularly across Asia and North America. SBI plans to list both ETFs on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, pending regulatory approval. The move reinforces the group’s long-standing partnership with Ripple and comes amid accelerating interest in XRP-based financial products globally. The Crypto Asset ETF will consist solely of XRP and Bitcoin. Though SBI has not yet disclosed the exact allocation, the firm emphasized its intent to provide direct exposure to crypto assets. In contrast, the Digital Gold Crypto ETF will allocate over 51% of its portfolio to physical gold, with the remaining portion invested in the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), offering a hybrid strategy for investors seeking diversification across traditional and digital stores of value. Ripple Stake and IPO Hopes Add to Strategic Outlook Japan proposes crypto tax cuts (55% 20%) and ETF approval under new reforms, aiming to become a global crypto hub. #Crypto #Japan https://t.co/9a6cw4LgFG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 6, 2025 Beyond its ETF ambitions, SBI remains heavily invested in Ripple, holding a 9% equity stake. The Japanese financial giant reiterated its confidence in Ripple’s growth trajectory, suggesting that any future IPO would unlock substantial value. While Ripple has not announced formal IPO plans , SBI pointed to its latest valuation metrics as a sign of latent upside once the company lists. Crypto analyst Johnny has said that Ripple’s long-anticipated IPO could drive both the company and its token to new heights. #Ripple #XRP https://t.co/YyNxxIL8bH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 18, 2025 In its latest earnings, SBI reported a 2.8-fold increase in investment balance over the past five years, with assets reaching ¥795.1 billion ($5.37 billion). The group expects many of its portfolio companies, including Ripple, to go public within the next two years, with Ripple positioned as a key driver of future returns. Meanwhile, SBI continues to expand its integration of Ripple products into its core financial services. This includes the use of XRP for international remittances and early-stage exploration of Ripple’s new U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. SBI’s ETF plans also coincide with growing global momentum around XRP investment products. In June, Canadian regulators approved two spot XRP ETFs, and more than ten U.S.-based asset managers are currently pursuing similar filings. SBI’s entry into the space could further bolster XRP’s visibility and utility in global markets. Bitcoin ETFs See $196M Outflow and XRP Slides Despite Japan’s First XRP ETF News XRP prices dipped even as Japan’s financial powerhouse SBI Holdings unveiled plans to launch the country’s first XRP-focused exchange-traded fund. Technical indicators suggest that the token may be losing momentum. According to data analytics firm Glassnode, over 96% of XRP wallets remain in profit, a level that historically coincides with short-term market tops. Adding to this concern is a bearish divergence between XRP’s rising price and falling relative strength index (RSI), signaling weakening upward momentum and making traders more cautious. Source: TradingView/CryptoNews Looking at current price action, if XRP manages to break above the $3.07 level and then moves toward $3.48, $3.59, $3.71, and potentially $3.99, it becomes plausible. However, a dip below $2.88 could shift sentiment toward the downside, with targets at $2.67 and $2.45. The 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently hovering around $2.52, may act as a key dynamic support level during this correction phase. While XRP struggles with upward momentum, the broader crypto market is also experiencing headwinds. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $196 million in net outflows on August 5, marking the fourth consecutive day of investor withdrawals. The outflows come from a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price, which slid 3.5% over the past week to trade around $114,125. Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflow tally with $99.11 million in redemptions, closely followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $77 million withdrawn. These ETF outflows contrast sharply with the trend seen in July, when Bitcoin ETFs recorded only five days of net outflows throughout the entire month.

This dramatic shift resulted from mounting sell-side pressure and has sparked widespread concern among market participants about whether the crypto bull run is dead. The deteriorating liquidity conditions have also impacted the ETF market, which experienced a substantial 25% drop in record inflows to $269.4M, falling well below the lower threshold, according to Glassnode’s latest Bitcoin market analysis. Glassnode Reveals: Bitcoin RSI Crashes to 35.8 as $13B Volume Evaporates Glassnode’s August 4 report showed that spot market conditions deteriorated markedly as the RSI declined from 47.4 to 35.8, falling beneath its lower band and indicating oversold conditions. Off-chain indicators show broad cooling: • RSI dropped to 35.8 – oversold zone • Spot CVD fell to -$220M → intensified sell pressure • Futures funding -33% WoW • Options skew spiked → rising demand for downside protection • ETF inflows down -25% pic.twitter.com/y9AmQ1D3iC — glassnode (@glassnode) August 5, 2025 This weakness coincided with a reduction in spot volume from $8.4B to $7.5B, suggesting a cooling of Bitcoin’s euphoric phase as the asset pulled back from its $123,218 peak to $110,000 lows on August 5. These developments, combined with over $800 million in Bitcoin ETF outflows, representing the second-largest single-day withdrawal in these products’ history as previously reported , have intensified fears that the crypto market may have peaked and bear market conditions are emerging. Even traditionally optimistic crypto investors who typically view weak price action as buying opportunities have begun taking profits and reducing their risk exposure. On August 3, crypto billionaire and Maelstrom Fund CIO Arthur Hayes disclosed that he had recently liquidated $8.32 million worth of ETH, $4.62 million in Ethena (ENA), and $414,700 of the meme token Pepe (PEPE), with $22.95 million now held in USDC stablecoin, according to Arkham Intelligence data. When influential whales and key opinion leaders are actively booking profits, it naturally raises questions about whether the market has reached its cyclical peak. “Bull Run is Not Dead’ – MEXC Analyst Defends $100K Bitcoin Floor However, industry experts like MEXC Exchange Chief Analyst Shawn Young maintain that the current crypto bull cycle remains intact. When Cryptonews questioned him about market conditions, Young explained that “ Bitcoin’s struggle to maintain key levels and increased demand for downside protection through the options market indicates a more cautious, risk-averse trading environment rather than complete capitulation or structural breakdown. “ He emphasized that while ETF outflows from Bitcoin products reflect near-term uncertainty, the long-term bullish narrative remains fundamentally sound. Young outlined his bullish thesis to address market concerns, stating that the bull market framework stays valid as long as Bitcoin maintains above $100,000 and institutional demand across digital assets doesn’t completely evaporate. BULL MARKET IS NOT OVER Last 3 Bitcoin bull run cycles: 2013: 371 days to peak 2017: 504 days to peak 2021: 548 days to peak Each cycle is getting LONGER. This means the real blow off top for this cycle will be around Nov 2025. Don’t let whales shake you out. pic.twitter.com/25WnBYnirs — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) July 30, 2025 However, he cautioned that a decisive break above $116,000 on Bitcoin or fresh catalysts from the Federal Reserve or global liquidity expansion would be necessary for a push toward new all-time highs. Young also provided insights into the evolving corporate treasury landscape in crypto. Companies like BitMine (currently the largest public holder of ETH with approximately $3B), VERB, and Sequans have moved beyond experimental approaches to implement comprehensive blockchain-native treasury strategies. The trend extends beyond Bitcoin alone. Ethereum, Toncoin , BNB, and SOL are increasingly being incorporated as companies align their reserves with the digital finance ecosystem. Young referenced Bernstein projections suggesting that corporate Bitcoin investments could reach $330 billion by 2029, a figure comparable to substantial traditional finance sectors. NoOnes CEO: ‘Bull Markets Don’t End Until Conviction Collapses’ Ray Youssef, CEO of Bitcoin P2P marketplace NoOnes, also challenged assertions that the crypto bull market is over. Youssef emphasized that recent market corrections represent natural consequences of overheating in a market still highly susceptible to macroeconomic narratives. According to him, the market is experiencing its first genuine test of structural conviction. ETF outflows and declining spot volumes suggest this correction may have additional room to develop in the near term. “However, bull markets don’t conclude when price action stagnates; they end when market conviction collapses.” “ Nevertheless, regulatory clarity is improving, stablecoin infrastructure is maturing, and real-world asset tokenization is accelerating. “, Youssef noted. The War Chief and a few others remain true. What about you ? https://t.co/2fQJag7y1A — Ray Youssef (@ray_noOnes) August 3, 2025 These developments have reinforced the bull cycle’s structural integrity. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart (BTC/USD) shows that significant liquidity has accumulated in the purple zone around $116,000–$118,000, with fair value gaps (FVG) marked by repeated wicks and rejections. Source: TradingView Should a near-term bullish move fill this FVG and test overhead liquidity, the price will likely revisit the lower green FVG zone near $111,000–$112,000.

As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, the integration of an AI agent platform into enterprise workflows presents a similar, critical challenge: safeguarding sensitive data. For organizations, especially those in highly regulated sectors or managing proprietary information, the hesitation to embrace AI tools stems from a fundamental fear – data compromise or inadvertent training of public models. This is where Cohere’s new AI agent platform , North, steps in, promising a groundbreaking solution to a pervasive problem that echoes the security demands of the blockchain world. AI Agent Platform: Unlocking Enterprise Potential Securely AI agent tools offer the compelling promise of streamlining daily workflows and eliminating drudgery. However, the path to widespread adoption has been hindered by a significant hurdle: enterprise data security . Large corporations with proprietary information, companies operating in highly regulated industries, and government agencies have understandably hesitated to integrate AI tools, fearing that their — or worse, their customers’ — data could be inadvertently exposed or used to train foundation models. This concern is valid, as the integrity and privacy of information are non-negotiable. Canadian AI firm Cohere directly addresses these apprehensions with its innovative AI agent platform , North. This new platform is engineered to enable private deployment, ensuring that enterprises and governments can maintain their data, and their customers’ data, safely behind their own firewalls. North is designed to bring the power of AI agents directly to where the data resides, eliminating the need for sensitive information to leave the secure confines of an organization’s infrastructure. Revolutionizing Enterprise Data Security with Private Deployment The core philosophy behind North is that AI models are only as effective as the data they can access. As Nick Frosst, co-founder and CEO of Cohere, emphasized during a North demo, “LLMs are only as good as the data they have access to. If we want LLMs to be as useful as possible, they have to access that useful data, and that means they need to be deployed in [the customer’s] environment.” This statement highlights the critical need for solutions that prioritize data sovereignty. Unlike traditional deployments that might rely on public enterprise cloud platforms like Azure or AWS, Cohere asserts that it can install North directly on an organization’s private infrastructure. This ensures that Cohere itself never sees or interacts with a customer’s sensitive data. This approach is a game-changer for enterprise data security , offering a level of control and privacy previously unattainable with many AI solutions. The platform’s architecture is built from the ground up to respect data boundaries, providing peace of mind for organizations handling highly confidential information. The Power of Private AI Deployment: On-Premise and Beyond North’s versatility in deployment options is a key differentiator, making true private AI deployment a reality for a wide range of organizations. Nick Frosst detailed that North can operate effectively across various environments, including: On-premise infrastructure: For organizations that prefer to keep all data and processing within their physical control. Hybrid clouds: Blending on-premise resources with private cloud environments. VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds): Providing isolated sections of public cloud resources for enhanced security. Air-gapped environments: Completely isolated networks with no external connectivity, crucial for the most sensitive operations. Frosst even quipped about its minimal hardware requirements, stating, “We can deploy literally on a GPU in a closet that they might have somewhere,” underscoring North’s efficiency, as it was designed to run on as few as two GPUs. This flexibility in private AI deployment means that organizations of virtually any size and security posture can leverage advanced AI capabilities without compromising their existing infrastructure or data privacy policies. Building Trust: Cohere North’s Secure AI Solutions and Compliance Beyond its innovative deployment model, Cohere North integrates robust security protocols to offer truly secure AI solutions . These measures are designed to provide comprehensive protection and control over AI agent operations within an enterprise environment: Granular access control: Ensuring only authorized personnel and systems can interact with specific data and functions. Agent autonomy policies: Defining and enforcing strict rules for how AI agents operate and what actions they can take. Continuous red-teaming: Proactively testing the system for vulnerabilities and weaknesses to strengthen defenses. Third-party security tests: Independent audits to validate the platform’s security posture and compliance. Furthermore, North is built to meet stringent international compliance standards, a critical factor for global enterprises. It adheres to regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), SOC-2 (Service Organization Control 2), and ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System). This commitment to compliance reinforces North’s position as one of the most secure AI solutions available on the market. Cohere, which has successfully raised $970 million and holds a $5.5 billion valuation, has already piloted North with several prominent customers. These include RBC, Dell, LG, Ensemble Health Partners, and Palantir, demonstrating real-world confidence in North’s capabilities to deliver secure and effective AI agent functionalities. Exploring the Capabilities of Cohere North: Beyond Just Q&A While security is paramount, the utility of Cohere North as an AI agent platform extends far beyond its private deployment capabilities. Out of the box, North mirrors many advanced AI agent platforms with its chief features centered around intelligent interaction and information retrieval: Chat and Search: Users can quickly get answers to customer support inquiries, summarize lengthy meeting transcripts, draft marketing copy, and access information from both internal enterprise resources and the broader web. Transparency and Auditability: Nick Frosst highlighted that all responses generated by North include citations and “reasoning” chains of thought. This crucial feature allows employees to audit and verify the output, building trust and ensuring accuracy. Powered by Core Cohere Technology: The chat and search functions leverage existing, proven Cohere technology, including Command (its family of generative AI models) and Compass (its multimodal search tech stack). North specifically utilizes a variant of the Command model, fine-tuned for sophisticated enterprise reasoning. Frosst further explained that Cohere North goes “beyond just Q&A and gets into doing work for you.” This means the platform has robust asset creation capabilities, enabling it to: Create tables and complex documents. Generate professional slideshows. Conduct in-depth market research. It’s worth noting that Cohere’s acquisition of Ottogrid, a Vancouver-based platform specializing in automating high-level market research, in May further enhances North’s capabilities in this area. Like other advanced AI agent platforms, North is designed for seamless integration with existing workplace tools such as Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Outlook, and Linear. It can also connect with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing access to industry-specific or in-house applications. This deep integration fosters a smooth transition, as Frosst describes, “As you build confidence by chatting to the model, there’s like a smooth transition that happens between using this as an augmentation to using it as an automation.” A New Era for Enterprise AI Adoption Cohere North represents a significant leap forward in enterprise AI adoption. By directly addressing the critical concerns around enterprise data security and offering unparalleled private AI deployment options, it paves the way for organizations to harness the full potential of AI agents without compromising their most valuable asset: their data.

However, short-term consolidation above this critical zone is anticipated. XRP Analysis By Shayanmarkets The Daily Chart XRP recently broke above the $3.4 high in mid-July, tapping into a major liquidity pool. This upward move triggered buy-side liquidity, often targeted by smart money to trigger stop-losses from over-leveraged long positions, a classic bull trap scenario. Following this sweep, XRP faced significant selling pressure, pulling the price back toward a crucial support region around the $2.7 level, which also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. This zone is likely to act as a short-term support, leading to consolidation within the $2.7–$3.4 range. As long as this structure holds, the price is expected to range sideways, absorbing selling pressure before its next decisive move. A valid breakout above or below this range will likely lead to a strong directional move. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the lower timeframe, the breakout above $3.4 quickly reversed as sellers stepped in, reinforcing the idea of a bull trap. XRP has since declined sharply, finding support at the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, which has triggered a minor bullish pullback. The current price is range-bound between $2.7 (support) and $3.1 (resistance). This consolidation phase could persist unless a strong catalyst emerges. A bullish breakout above $3.1 would open the door for a retest of the $3.4 high, while a breakdown below $2.7 would expose the $2.58 support as the next key level. This price behavior reflects classic market manipulation and liquidity dynamics, with smart money exploiting key levels. Traders should remain cautious and watch for a confirmed breakout before positioning for the next move.

Basel III: The Growing Pressure on Banks Basel III, finalized by the Basel Committee in 2017 and set for full implementation by 2025, was designed to strengthen the global banking system. It raises the bar on liquidity coverage, leverage ratios, and capital adequacy. In practical terms, it means banks must hold a larger amount of high-quality liquid assets, mostly idle and low-yielding, to hedge against financial shocks. Under current regulations, banks must hold capital equal to 100% of the value of crypto assets such as XRP, making these holdings costly and inefficient. This requirement further strains liquidity and forces banks to tie up billions in reserves, capital that could otherwise be deployed for productive use. This is how $XRP wins Most are sleeping on this XRP doesn’t just move money, it cuts deep costs banks are desperate to eliminate Basel III is choking them with capital requirements Ripple offers the escape hatch, instant settlement. Less capital locked Read here pic.twitter.com/kqxh7qz8of — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) August 6, 2025 According to the IMF, global banks held over $1.2 trillion in capital reserves as of 2024. With Basel III’s “endgame” in sight, many institutions are desperate to find ways to reduce that burden. Ripple’s Instant Settlement: A Capital Efficiency Tool Ripple, the company behind XRP, offers a clear alternative: instant settlement using XRP as a bridge asset. This eliminates the need for pre-funded nostro accounts and shortens settlement windows from days to seconds. By reducing the time capital is locked up in the settlement process, banks can free up liquidity and potentially reduce the amount of capital they’re required to hold. A 2017 Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report already hinted at this: faster settlements could lead to significantly lower capital requirements, as funds are no longer trapped in long cross-border processes. Ripple’s solution brings that theory to life. As X Finance Bull put it: “XRP doesn’t just move money, it cuts deep costs banks are desperate to eliminate.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Regulatory Strategy Gains Momentum Critics often argue that banks won’t adopt XRP because of regulatory uncertainty. But Ripple is actively working to dismantle that narrative. In July 2025, the company applied to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national trust bank charter. This move could bring Ripple into direct alignment with federal banking regulations. The proposed “ Ripple National Trust Bank” would offer custody for digital assets, stablecoin issuance (including Ripple’s RLUSD), and may even seek access to Federal Reserve settlement systems. If approved, this would mark a significant step toward integrating XRP into the heart of traditional finance. XRP’s Strategic Edge The timing is critical. As the Federal Reserve considers easing parts of the Basel III endgame capital rules, banks are reassessing their long-term strategies. With pressure mounting to optimize balance sheets and enhance efficiency, XRP’s role as a settlement asset could become indispensable, especially if paired with regulatory clarity and federal backing. XRP isn’t just a speculative asset anymore. It’s becoming a strategic instrument—one that addresses real problems banks are currently facing. And as capital regulations tighten, that utility is more valuable than ever. The world is watching. XRP, it seems, is just getting started.

The London-listed technology firm announced Tuesday that the Paris-based asset management company, which has maintained Bitcoin exposure since 2016, fully subscribed to the “Smarter Convert” instrument through three managed funds. The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) RNS Announcement: Smarter Convert – $21 Million Subscription. The Smarter Web Company is pleased to announce the launch of Smarter Convert, a strategic, interest free capital-raising initiative structured as a convertible bond,… — The Smarter Web Company (@smarterwebuk) August 6, 2025 Unlike traditional convertible bonds, this structure denominates the principal repayment amount in Bitcoin while keeping the conversion share price fixed at £2.05, representing a 5% premium to Monday’s closing price of £1.95 per share. Revolutionary Bond Structure Offers Bitcoin Upside with Downside Protection The convertible bond includes several unique mechanisms designed to protect both issuer and investor interests in volatile market conditions over its 12-month term. After an initial six-month period, Smarter Web can force conversion to equity if shares trade 50% above the conversion price for ten consecutive trading days, effectively capping the company’s Bitcoin exposure risk. Conversely, if bondholders opt against conversion at maturity, the company will repay 98% of the bond’s Bitcoin-adjusted value and retain 2% to offset transaction costs. This Bitcoin denomination means repayment amounts will fluctuate with cryptocurrency prices rising if Bitcoin appreciates and falling if it declines, while conversion terms remain denominated in British pounds. If all bonds convert to equity, approximately 7.7 million new shares would be issued, calculated by dividing the $21 million at current exchange rates by the £2.05 conversion price. TOBAM CEO Yves Choueifaty described the structure as offering “prudent downside protection, premium equity participation, and a Bitcoin-denominated structure that reflects our conviction in Bitcoin as the next cornerstone of trust.” Similarly, Smarter Web CEO Andrew Webley positioned the offering as expanding funding options, stating the deal “marks yet another first for the UK capital markets” and expressing confidence it will “open up a new segment of capital for the Company.” Corporate Bitcoin Financing Evolves Beyond Pure Equity Dilution Models This convertible bond structure is yet a potential evolution in how Bitcoin-focused companies access capital markets, moving beyond the pure equity dilution model popularized by MicroStrategy. The new approach offers a middle path between traditional debt and equity financing, potentially addressing concerns raised by analysts about excessive shareholder dilution in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space. UK BTC Companies Accumulation Race (Source: Smarter Web ) Smarter Web’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy has generated remarkable returns, with the company achieving a 49,198% year-to-date BTC yield through multiple purchases throughout 2025, including 325 Bitcoin in July and 196.8 Bitcoin in June. Smarter Web Company crosses 2,000 Bitcoin mark after $27 million purchase reaching top 25 global corporate rankings with 49,198% YTD yield. #Bitcoin #Treasury https://t.co/cDM2etAMnF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 The company has invested £166.8 million total at an average price of £81,346 per coin, positioning itself among the top 25 global corporate Bitcoin holders with approximately £500,000 in remaining treasury cash for future deployments. However, this aggressive strategy has driven significant stock volatility, with shares falling 15% after recent fundraising despite being up 274% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Japanese Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet recently filed to raise $3.6 billion through preferred stock offerings, demonstrating continued appetite for innovative financing structures in the sector. The broader corporate Bitcoin treasury movement has seen over 283 companies accumulate 3.64 million Bitcoin collectively, though some industry observers question the sustainability of current strategies. In fact, Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz recently suggested the market may have reached “peak treasury company issuance,” shifting focus to which existing players will achieve meaningful scale. Even earlier this year, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel warned that companies issuing shares near their Bitcoin net asset value risk creating “erosion” rather than capital formation.

Yet, there are some signs of exhaustion beginning to surface on the lower timeframes, which could translate to a deep pullback on the higher ones. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart ETH continues to consolidate below the $4,000 zone after its aggressive rally from the $2,800 breakout level. The asset is holding above the previous resistance-turned-support at the $3,400 area, and the buyers are defending that zone well so far. The 100-day moving average has also started to curl up and is chasing the price, confirming the bullish structure and momentum. Looking ahead, the major resistance remains at $4,100, which is the 2024 high. If the buyers manage to reclaim momentum and push above $3,800, a retest and breakout above the $4,100 level could be on the table. On the flip side, losing $3,400 would likely trigger a deeper correction toward the $2,800 area, which also coincides with the 100-day moving average. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows that ETH swept the $3,700 highs and was rejected twice, forming equal highs and suggesting some exhaustion in the short term. The asset has now created a lower high and potentially a lower low after weeks of bullish structure, which could be the beginning of a deep pullback if the $3,700 resistance level holds. Yet, for now, ETH is respecting the local demand zone at $3,500. As long as this level holds, short-term bias remains neutral to bullish. A break below $3,500, however, could attract sellers and trigger a move toward $3,300 and even lower. On the other hand, reclaiming $3,700 and holding above it would open the door toward $3,900 and possibly $4,100. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest Open Interest has started ticking lower after peaking near $28B just as ETH reached $3,800. This slight drop in OI during consolidation suggests some long positions have been closed or liquidated. However, the broader trend is still clearly upward, with open interest doubling since May. This trend shows that traders are still heavily participating in ETH derivatives, although the market may be due for a reset. Yet, there is still room for more upside before excessive risk builds up. For now, it’s healthy to see a slight decline in leverage as price consolidates.

Key Takeaways: SEC’s Project Crypto signals a major shift toward onchain finance. Bitwise CIO sees Layer 1s, DeFi, and super-apps as top crypto bets. Institutional adoption of DeFi could unlock new value for investors. In a memo to clients on Tuesday , Hougan described Atkins’ plan as a complete rethinking of how financial markets should work in the digital age. According to Atkins, all assets, including stocks, bonds, and dollars, will eventually migrate onchain, with decentralized finance (DeFi) at the core and blockchain-native firms leading the charge. “It’s the most complete vision of how crypto can reshape financial markets that I’ve read,” Hougan wrote, adding that the initiative transforms crypto from fringe to foundational. Most Bullish Crypto Bets Bitwise CIO Says You Shouldn’t Miss Hougan highlighted three key investment opportunities: Layer 1 blockchains, crypto-enabled super-apps, and DeFi platforms. Ethereum leads the pack in Layer 1 infrastructure, but Hougan advises diversification across other networks like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche. He warns that early dominance doesn’t guarantee future leadership, citing past tech cycles where initial winners eventually faded. Bitwise, which already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is pushing to expand its exposure through a crypto index ETF, currently trading under ticker “BITW.” The fund includes assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP, aligned with Hougan’s diversified bet on foundational blockchain infrastructure. Beyond base layers, Hougan pointed to financial “super-apps” as a future battleground. Atkins’ speech laid out a regulatory path for broker-dealers to seamlessly offer crypto and traditional assets under a unified license regime. Coinbase and Robinhood are both moving in this direction, and Hougan believes the firm that cracks this model could become the world’s most valuable financial company, potentially surpassing a $1 trillion market cap. DeFi, long caught in a regulatory limbo, also gets a nod in Project Crypto. Atkins acknowledged that DeFi doesn’t fit traditional frameworks and requires new thinking. Hougan sees that as a signal that platforms like Uniswap and Aave, already boasting billions in trading volume and TVL, could be on the verge of institutional adoption. He expects DeFi tokens to grow stronger economic ties to protocol performance, unlocking more value for investors. SEC Chair Vows to Bring Crypto Innovation Home with ‘Project Crypto’ Earlier this week, Atkins reaffirmed his commitment to keeping the next wave of financial innovation in the U.S., stating the SEC will not let overseas markets outpace American capital markets. We will make sure the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Watch highlights from my speech launching Project Crypto at @A1Policy . pic.twitter.com/euqY9samPt — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) August 4, 2025 Speaking at the America First Policy Institute, Atkins emphasized the agency’s determination to support a thriving onshore crypto ecosystem. He also backed the latest report from the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, calling it a blueprint for U.S. leadership in blockchain. Atkins framed the effort as part of a broader national agenda, declaring that under new guidance, “our crypto asset economy will be” part of America’s Golden Age.

Under the agreement with RIZAP Group Inc., Bakkt will acquire roughly 30% of the Tokyo-listed company, positioning itself as Marusho Hotta’s largest shareholder. Pending shareholder approval, Marusho Hotta will be renamed bitcoin.jp, aligning its brand with its new bitcoin-centric direction, the company said. Bakkt has also secured the domain bitcoin.jp as part of the deal. In a strategic leadership shift, Phillip Lord, President of Bakkt International, will take over as CEO of Marusho Hotta. Meanwhile, bitcoin treasury firm BitBridge Capital Strategies has completed its merger with Green Mountain Merger Inc., the company said in a press release yesterday. The company will start trading under the ticker symbol BTTL on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets by the end of the third quarter, with plans to uplist to NASDAQ thereafter.

Price structure suggests a bullish reversal with rising momentum and a target set near the 3.28 level.” Therefore, DeGram believes that XRP has broken above its descending resistance and is now retesting the $2.96 zone, which is a former key support. This setup signals a bullish reversal, with momentum building toward a $3.28 target. The analyst added that the breakout retest offers a prime entry for bulls, with the dip holding above key support and higher lows signaling a short-term uptrend resumption. Technical Landscape As of today’s market data, XRP is trading around $2.96 , consistent with DeGram’s reference level. The token appears to have cleared a multimonth downward trendline, a breakout that often signals a shift in market structure from bearish to bullish. The fact that XRP is now re‑testing the upper limit of a recent support range adds weight to the bullish thesis. Notably, recent technical coverage shows XRP rebounding from $2.80 support and encountering resistance between $3.00 and $3.14, with sellers resting near overlapping exponential moving average (EMA) and volume weighted average price (VWAP) zones. Momentum & Patterns Indicators support expansion since momentum oscillators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) have turned upward from neutral levels, while volume patterns show increasing interest on ripple rallies, but still limited conviction above $3.00. That said, the structure resembles a rising reversal: higher lows, breakout from descending formations, and ascending momentum suggest price is poised for further upside. Price Target Near $3.28 DeGram’s projected $3.28 target sits just beyond short‑term resistance clusters at $3.14–3.34, making it a logical next stop if momentum persists. Analysts place near‑term upside targets between $3.33 and $3.43, and in some bullish scenarios even beyond the psychological price of $5 later in 2025 if broader catalysts like ETF approval and regulatory clarity materialize. Is There Light at the Tunnel for XRP Lawsuit? Ripple's Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, recently praised SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a move widely seen as a strong signal that the XRP lawsuit may be nearing its conclusion. Alderoty praised Atkins for shifting the SEC toward clearer, collaborative crypto regulation, highlighting the “Project Crypto” initiative and his stance that most digital assets aren’t securities. This endorsement comes at a pivotal moment since the SEC is set to vote by August 7 on whether to withdraw its appeal against Ripple ahead of the August 15 deadline. Legal experts like Bill Morgan say the agency is “more likely than not” to drop the appeal, with formal filings expected if the vote passes. In a parallel step, Ripple has escrowed the agreed $125 million civil penalty , pending final resolution. Once both sides withdraw their appeals, the funds are expected to be transferred to the U.S. Treasury, closing the financial chapter. However, the court’s finding that $728 million in institutional XRP sales violated securities laws still stands, even as public exchange sales remain lawful under Judge Torres' 2023 ruling. Conclusion Alderoty’s praise isn’t just diplomatic, it hints at shared momentum toward resolution. As both sides prepare to submit their formal filings, the crypto sector is watching closely with mid‑August now seen as the likely capstone to one of its most important legal sagas. Meanwhile, XRP’s breakout above its descending resistance line and current test of the $2.96 support zone forms a textbook bullish setup in line with DeGram’s analysis. The technical structure marked by a reversal pattern, rising momentum, and proximity to Fibonacci/EMA confluences supports a plausible move toward $3.28. Nevertheless, slipping below $2.90–$2.80 would invalidate the bullish thesis and could draw in risk of deeper correction.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 15:33:18

Whales Move $69M as Taker Volume Plunges,https://cryptopotato.com/eth-sell-off-whales-move-69m-as-taker-volume-plunges/,"TL;DR Large ETH wallets sent $69M to exchanges, showing signs of positioning before potential selling. Net taker volume dropped $418M, marking one of the sharpest sell imbalances in ETH history. ETF flow reversed after major outflows, with $73M added back amid shifting market sentiment. Large Sell-Side Volume Raises Attention Ethereum (ETH) recorded a sharp drop in taker activity, with daily Net Taker Volume falling to -$418.8 million, according to data from CryptoQuant. This means that around 115,400 more ETH were sold using market orders than bought on the same day. Meanwhile, this kind of order flow suggests urgency from sellers who prioritized speed over price. Such deep negative values have not occurred often and are usually seen near market peaks. The imbalance signals that buyers were not able to match the volume coming from the sell side. Source: CryptoQuant Whale Wallets Move Funds to Exchanges Two large ETH holders have moved a combined total of nearly $69 million to centralized exchanges within the past 24 hours. The wallet 0xc156 deposited 13,459 ETH to Binance, while 0x46DB sent 5,504 ETH to OKX. Whales are selling $ETH . 0xc156 deposited all 13,459 $ETH ($49M) to #Binance 20 minutes ago. 0x46DB deposited 5,504 $ETH ($19.8M) to #OKX in the past 16 hours. https://t.co/zRG9Tn5pQ9 https://t.co/FQe95DLj9R pic.twitter.com/vmp4VKgS2r — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 6, 2025 Transfers of this size often appear before increased sales. While not all deposits lead to sales, they usually indicate preparation to exit positions, especially during uncertain market conditions. Price Remains Under Resistance After Trendline Break Ethereum is now trading close to $3,630, down roughly 1% in the last day and 4% over the week. After rising steadily in July, the price broke below a trendline that had supported the move up, as outlined by analyst Crypto Patel. A recent retest of this trendline failed, suggesting that sellers remain in control for now. Notably, the current setup shows the $3,800 level as key resistance. If the asset remains under this area, focus shifts to possible support around $3,147 and $2,913. These zones may offer buyers an entry point, especially if broader conditions stabilize. ETF Activity Sends Mixed Signals Ethereum ETFs saw new inflows of $73.3 million on Tuesday, following what had been a stretch of heavy withdrawals. Just days earlier , products tied to ETH recorded a single-day outflow of $465 million, the largest so far. Consequently, this change in flow indicates a shift in sentiment. While retail buyers may have been cutting exposure, some recent buying could mean that some traders are setting up for a rebound. Overall flow extinction timing differences lead to uncertain short-term direction. The post ETH Sell-Off?

Since May 2, when Warren announced that Greg Abel would take over as CEO, class A shares have dropped 14%, which for Wall Street, that’s pretty steep. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 11%, including dividends. The 25 percentage point gap is the widest underperformance in more than three decades. Warren, who is widely regarded as the greatest investor in modern history, spent nearly 60 years turning Berkshire from a failing textile company into a holding giant. But the investors who built up his reputation are starting to walk. The Monday after his retirement plan was made public, the stock dropped almost 5%. The last time Berkshire trailed this hard was during the pandemic crash when financial stocks, which still make up a large part of the company’s portfolio, took a hit. Old money exits as investors ditch value for growth Berkshire’s class A shares, the company’s original high-vote stock, were trading at a record $812,855 in May. That’s when selling began. These shares are usually held by families who got in decades ago and passed them down through generations. It’s still unknown who exactly is offloading them, but public filings from major institutions are due later this month. Despite the selloff, Berkshire’s operations aren’t bleeding. The second quarter saw profit growth in the BNSF railroad, utility businesses, manufacturing, and retail. The company’s operating earnings rose 8% from a year ago, excluding currency changes. But even with strong numbers, buyers aren’t biting. Berkshire’s stock had gained 18.9% in the months leading to its annual meeting in May. That run was driven by fears of market volatility, especially around President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade fights. Investors rushed to what they saw as a safe bet. “As the worries about tariffs started to build . . . there were people rotating into the safety of Berkshire,” said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust. But since then, investors have dumped value names and run back to fast-growing tech stocks. Stone said, “What is really moving in this market is technology, and we know that’s not really his thing.” He also compared Berkshire’s $344 billion in cash and Treasury investments to Fort Knox, but admitted that hasn’t been enough to stop the outflows. Warren sells stocks, stops buybacks, holds cash Warren has stopped buying back Berkshire shares too. That decision came as the company’s price-to-book ratio rose to 1.8 times, the highest level since October 2008. Berkshire only repurchases stock when Warren believes it’s trading below its “intrinsic value.” That wasn’t the case in May. “The stock was overvalued,” said Christopher Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments. Bloomstran added he expects Warren to return to buybacks now that the stock has dropped again. Instead of buying, Warren’s been selling. He dumped a large chunk of Apple last year, and for 11 straight quarters, Berkshire has been a net seller of equities. At the end of June, cash made up 30% of Berkshire’s total assets, showing just how defensive the company’s gotten. This isn’t new behavior from Warren. During the dotcom boom in 1999, he refused to chase hype. Berkshire’s stock trailed badly during that time, especially against the Nasdaq Composite. Critics slammed him for sitting out the tech rally, but when the bubble burst, Berkshire avoided the wreckage. This time, though, things are different. Cathy Seifert, analyst at CFRA, said Berkshire always had a “Warren premium,” but warned that may not stick under Abel. The next few quarters will show whether that legacy can hold.

Digital assets built on the blockchain are transforming the financial ecosystem and shaping its future. Digital assets are no longer living on the fringe of the global financial system — they are becoming central to its future and to the movement of value through the capital markets and payments rails. The relatively small size of the crypto market pales to traditional financial markets, belying the enormous opportunity for digital assets and their growth trajectory. The total cryptocurrency market cap is approaching $3.8 trillion, approximating one segment of the MSCI World Index and dwarfed by the global market cap for equities, projected to reach $128.07 trillion this year. Yet, the capital markets environment is thriving, evidenced by Circle and eToro IPOs and these notable M&A trends: Partnerships : To deepen digital asset strategies – Kraken / NinjaTrader ($1.5B); Coinbase / Derebit ($2.9B); Ripple / Hidden Road ($1.25B); and JPMorgan Chase linking customers to Coinbase wallets, enabling crypto wallet funding via credit card rewards and direct account funding. Private Equity: To enter new market sectors through a portfolio-based acquisition strategy – Carlyle / SurePay (undisclosed); Bain Capital / Acrisure ($2.1B). Cross-Border Deals: To fortify digital transformation and gain a competitive advantage through broader market reach – Robinhood / Bitstamp ($200M); Swyftx / Caleb & Brown ($100M-200M est.). This activity is being driven by a highly-anticipated shift in policy: Regulatory action by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2024 allowed the inclusion of bitcoin and ether in spot commodity-based ETFs. This action, accompanied by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) clarifying the regulatory framework for options on these ETFs, paved the way for institutional investors to enter the market. In Chairman Atkins’ first major policy shift, the SEC inaugurated “Project Crypto” and approved in-kind redemptions for spot BTC and ETH ETFs, allowing authorized participants to create and redeem ETF shares directly in BTC or ETH. In coordination with “Project Crypto,” the CFTC Acting Chair Pham has initiated “Crypto Sprint,” seeking to enable “immediate trading of digital assets” on CFTC-registered exchanges. Also, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated that liquid staking activities covered in its statement issued yesterday do not involve the offer and sales of securities. Legislative action is taking shape with passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act working its way through the Senate. It creates a regulatory framework underpinning “digital commodities” linked to the blockchain, excluding traditional products (bank deposits, commodities, securities, and investment vehicles) and divides primary regulatory oversight between the CFTC and SEC. Once enacted, regulators will be expected to quickly implement regulations and an interim registration framework. Also, the Senate Banking Committee released a discussion draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act to establish a larger role for the SEC than in the Clarity Act in classifying digital assets. The Trump administration heralded a new era for the growth of digital assets, reinforced in a comprehensive policy report released last week by the White House Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, with guidelines and recommendations covering stablecoins, digital asset market structure (including custody, token issuance and trading infrastructure), expanded CFTC regulatory authority and safe harbors for developers. Policy and capital markets activities are aligning. Crypto is no longer on the sidelines, it’s becoming core infrastructure for the future of finance. The changes we’ve witnessed so far this year will undoubtedly lead to a robust finish for 2025.",CoinDesk Indices|Institutional Investment|SEC|Regulation|M&A|CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short|Opinion|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-06 15:47:23

KakaoBank Signals Entry into South Korea's Stablecoin Market According to local media reports, KakaoBank Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Kwon Tae-hoon stated at the meeting where the bank announced its first-half 2025 financial results that it is evaluating various options in the digital finance arena. These options include issuing digital assets or offering custody services. Kwon emphasized that the online-only digital bank is working with Kakao Group's stablecoin task force to prepare for this. Speaking to ZDNet Korea, Kwon said: “The most critical factors for stablecoins are stability and technological competence. For the past three years, we have been providing real-name accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges, effectively implementing risk management processes based on know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).” Kwon also stated that they participated in the South Korean Central Bank's digital currency (CBDC) trials and that they were operating digital wallet, transaction and money transfer infrastructures within this scope. Preparation for KRW-Based Stablecoin KakaoBank's move comes as the South Korean won (KRW)-based stablecoin market is taking shape, a space supported by recently inaugurated President Lee Jae Myung. During his election campaign, Lee promised to promote a local currency-based stablecoin market to prevent capital outflows. Following his election victory, a ruling party lawmaker introduced a bill to parliament that would establish a basic regulatory framework for KRW stablecoins. The private sector responded quickly to these developments.

From optimizing supply chains to personalizing customer experiences, these intelligent systems are automating a wide array of tasks previously handled by humans. In the financial sector, for instance, AI agents are indispensable for robust fraud detection, meticulously analyzing vast transaction datasets in real-time to flag anomalies. Similarly, sales organizations leverage these agents to meticulously gather data on potential customers, scouring the web and social media for invaluable insights. The core challenge, however, lies in enabling these agents to access the vast ocean of internet data effectively and responsibly. Tavily Funding: A $25 Million Vote of Confidence in Secure AI The significant Tavily funding round, amounting to $25 million, marks a pivotal moment for the future of compliant AI. Insight Partners led a substantial $20 million Series A investment, bringing the one-year-old startup’s total funding to this impressive sum. This investment underscores the urgent market need for solutions that bridge the gap between powerful large language models (LLMs) and the critical requirement for enterprise-grade security and compliance. Founded by data scientist Rotem Weiss, Tavily evolved from his viral open-source project, GPT Researcher, which demonstrated the early demand for real-time web data access for AI before LLMs had native internet connectivity. The transition from a consumer-focused tool to an enterprise solution highlights a strategic pivot towards addressing the most pressing challenges in AI deployment. Why Enterprise AI Demands Specialized Solutions? For enterprise AI applications, simply connecting an AI agent directly to a general-purpose LLM like ChatGPT without specific safeguards can lead to highly inappropriate or non-compliant results. George Mathew, managing director at Insight Partners, succinctly put it: “Governance, risk and compliance at the enterprise is so important now, and if you just let that happen, it’s just going to be the wild, wild west.” This emphasizes the critical need for a structured and policy-driven approach to AI integration within large organizations. Enterprises require AI agents that can not only access the internet but also find information from relevant, trusted sources, all while strictly adhering to company policies and mirroring the meticulous work of a human researcher. Tavily’s suite of tools is designed precisely for this purpose, offering companies like Groq, Cohere, MongoDB, and Writer the capabilities to search, crawl, and extract structured insights from both public and private data sources. Revolutionizing AI Web Connectivity The ability of AI web connectivity is paramount for AI agents to move beyond static data and truly operate as dynamic, informed entities. Tavily addresses this by providing the necessary infrastructure for AI agents to intelligently navigate the internet. Unlike early LLMs that lacked real-time data access, modern AI agents require dynamic web interaction to stay current and effective. Tavily’s solutions enable agents to not only perform searches but also to crawl websites and extract structured insights, ensuring that the information gathered is relevant and actionable. While many AI agents are not yet fully connected to the internet, Tavily’s ambitious goal is to onboard the next billion agents to the web, democratizing access to real-time information for AI systems at scale. This connectivity is essential for tasks ranging from market research to competitive intelligence, ensuring AI systems can act on the most up-to-date information. Ensuring Robust AI Compliance and Governance The conversation around AI development increasingly centers on AI compliance and robust governance frameworks. In an era where data privacy regulations and ethical AI guidelines are becoming stricter, enterprises cannot afford to deploy AI agents without a clear strategy for adherence. Tavily’s core value proposition lies in its ability to connect AI agents to the web in a manner that is fully compliant with company-specific policies. This means integrating safeguards that prevent agents from accessing inappropriate content or violating data handling protocols. The platform helps mitigate risks associated with unchecked AI behavior, ensuring that automated tasks align with legal, ethical, and internal standards. This focus on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) is what differentiates solutions like Tavily and is crucial for fostering trust and widespread adoption of AI within sensitive industries. The Competitive Landscape: Who Else is Powering AI Web Search? Tavily is certainly not alone in this burgeoning market. The demand for specialized search tools for AI agents has spurred innovation from several players. Competitors like Exa, which secured a $17 million Series A from Lightspeed, Nvidia, and YC, also offer solutions in this space. Another notable, albeit smaller, startup providing a web search connectivity layer is Firecrawl. Even industry giants like OpenAI and Perplexity are offering search solutions, though these are often geared more towards independent developers rather than the stringent enterprise requirements that Tavily targets. This competitive environment underscores the growing importance of intelligent web access for AI, highlighting a race to provide the most robust, compliant, and efficient solutions. Looking Ahead: The Future of Connected AI The vision articulated by Tavily’s founder, Rotem Weiss, to onboard the next billion AI agents to the web, speaks to a future where AI systems are deeply integrated with the vast resources of the internet, yet operate within defined boundaries. This level of sophisticated AI web connectivity will unlock unprecedented capabilities for businesses, allowing for real-time data analysis, proactive risk management, and highly informed decision-making. As industries continue to embrace automation and intelligent systems, the infrastructure provided by companies like Tavily will be fundamental to ensuring these powerful AI tools are deployed responsibly and effectively, safeguarding enterprise integrity while maximizing operational efficiency.

The network also achieved higher fees compared to all other L1 and L2 chains for ten months in a row. Solana apps reflected the increased liveliness of the crypto space, with revenues soaring by 50% in July. Total application revenue reached $164M for the previous month, with over $43M locked in during the week between 14 and 22 July. Solana app revenues picked up again in July, driven by trading tools and meme token swaps. | Source: Blockworks Solana is trying to accelerate its usage and go beyond meme tokens, though launch platforms remain among the top revenue producers. For the last weeks of July, the effect of LetsBonk.fun was reflected in total fees, as well as generally increased Phantom wallet usage for multiple on-chain tasks. The fee production on Solana also reveals the main use cases of the network and its potential to carry out additional tasks. Based on active users, Raydium lines up as the busiest app, followed by Pump.fun and Jupiter Exchange. Jito is among the leaders in terms of daily fees, reaching $1.54M, while Jupiter DEX and Meteora achieve days with over $3M in revenues. App results fluctuate based on short-term conditions. Most apps also got a boost from the growth of stablecoins on Solana, after USDC supply rose above 12B tokens and USDC broke above 2B. Solana trading tools and memes boost revenues The network is still far down from its peak revenue day on January 20, when fees reached $28.89M during the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. Since then, Solana fell to a lower baseline, with revenues driven by a mix of lending protocols and DEX. Despite the higher app revenues, fewer addresses engaged in Solana compared to June. Meme generation also switched to whale wallets and automated activities. Additionally, trading bots were among the most active fee producers on Solana. Trading tools as a class were the major source of revenues, followed by meme token trading. Solana still requires trading facilities, including routing services, bots, MEV services, and others, to complete a trade. The network is also separately producing block fees for its validators. While lending and DeFi are growing, the app share is still small compared to the use cases linked to token trading. Whales return to Solana SOL whales returned to Solana in July, once again a far cry from the January celebrity token era. Despite this, a total of five ‘Solana Lords’ held more than 5M SOL for the month. Solana lords, whales with more than 5M SOL balance, increased in July, reaching the highest balance since January’s celebrity meme frenzy. | Source: Dune Analytics The Solana Lords metric is at the highest level for 2025, after some whales moved away following January’s rise in celebrity meme tokens. In addition to whale activity, Solana’s liveliness peaked around the middle of the month, with 17.93% of the supply turning active. SOL is viewed as the next potential valuable asset for ETFs and corporate treasuries, leading to a rush to acquire or move tokens. The native SOL token was up 11.3% net for the whole month, and is up 8.3% net in the third quarter to date. The token gained 24.2% in the first quarter, retaining its momentum.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a bold prediction: could Ethereum truly surpass Bitcoin as the leading Ethereum long-term value asset? A recent VanEck report certainly thinks so, sparking an important debate around the future of ETH vs Bitcoin in the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just about price; it’s about fundamental utility and economic design that could reshape the crypto investment landscape. Why is Ethereum’s Long-Term Value Gaining Astounding Traction? VanEck’s July report provides compelling reasons why Ethereum’s long-term value proposition is strengthening. One key factor highlighted is Ethereum’s significantly lower inflation rate, sitting at a mere 0.2% compared to Bitcoin’s approximately 3%. This stark difference contributes to Ethereum’s appeal as a sustainable crypto store of value . Furthermore, the introduction of Ethereum staking after the Merge has transformed its economic model. Staking offers participants a yield, effectively turning ETH into a productive asset. This mechanism, combined with its deflationary tendencies through transaction fee burning, gives Ethereum a unique edge. It makes ETH more attractive for those seeking both capital appreciation and potential income. The Evolving Battle for Supremacy: ETH vs Bitcoin For years, Bitcoin has held the crown as “digital gold,” primarily valued for its scarcity and decentralized nature. However, the report suggests that Ethereum’s flexible utility offers a different, potentially superior, path for long-term appeal. While Bitcoin’s use case remains largely static as a store of value, Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem. Think about it: Ethereum is the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). This inherent utility and programmability make Ethereum a dynamic asset, constantly evolving and expanding its potential applications. This contrasts sharply with Bitcoin’s more singular focus, leading many to reconsider the dynamics of ETH vs Bitcoin for future treasury holdings. Unpacking Robust Institutional Ethereum Adoption and Staking Benefits A significant indicator of growing confidence in Ethereum’s future is the increasing rate of Institutional Ethereum adoption. The VanEck report reveals that institutional ETH holdings have now reached an impressive 8.2 million ETH, representing 6.8% of the total supply. This isn’t just retail interest; major players are accumulating. For example, Bitmine Immersion leads the pack with a substantial 625,000 ETH in their portfolio. What drives this institutional interest? Beyond its utility, the attractive yield from Ethereum staking plays a crucial role. Institutions can earn passive income on their holdings, adding another layer of value to their investment strategy. This makes Ethereum not just a speculative asset, but one that can generate returns. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Value? The insights from VanEck paint a compelling picture. Ethereum’s combination of lower inflation, a productive Ethereum staking yield, expansive utility, and growing Institutional Ethereum adoption positions it as a formidable contender for the ultimate crypto store of value . While Bitcoin’s legacy is undeniable, Ethereum’s dynamic nature and evolving economic model present a strong case for its potential to eventually surpass BTC in Ethereum long-term value and treasury appeal. This shift in perspective suggests that the market may increasingly favor assets that offer both scarcity and utility. As the digital economy matures, assets like Ethereum, with their multifaceted use cases, could redefine what it means to be a foundational long-term investment in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is VanEck’s main prediction about Ethereum? A1: VanEck’s report suggests that Ethereum has the potential to surpass Bitcoin as a long-term value asset, primarily due to its lower inflation, staking yield, and flexible utility. Q2: How does Ethereum’s inflation rate compare to Bitcoin’s? A2: Ethereum’s inflation rate is significantly lower at approximately 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin’s around 3%, making ETH a more deflationary asset over time. Q3: What role does Ethereum staking play in its long-term value? A3: Ethereum staking allows holders to earn a yield on their ETH, transforming it into a productive asset. This passive income potential, combined with deflationary mechanics, enhances its appeal as a long-term investment. Q4: Why are institutions increasingly interested in Ethereum? A4: Institutions are attracted to Ethereum due to its growing utility across DeFi and NFTs, its deflationary nature, and the attractive yields offered through Institutional Ethereum staking programs, making it a compelling treasury asset. Q5: What are the key differences in utility between ETH and Bitcoin? A5: Bitcoin’s primary utility is as a decentralized store of value (“digital gold”). Ethereum, on the other hand, offers broad utility as a platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs, making it a dynamic and programmable asset.

49645612,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780457,1754495928,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49645612.jpeg,"Coinbase stock dropped 17% after weak earnings, ending its blue-chip rally",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbases-blue-chip-streak-stalls/,"Coinbase hit $106 billion in value after joining the S&P 500 earlier this year, riding a 69% rally that pushed it to the front of the crypto-to-Wall-Street pipeline. That run ended hard last week when the stock dropped 17% after its earnings release, the second-biggest post-earnings dip in the company’s history. Analysts are now asking whether Coinbase can keep charging higher fees without losing ground to cheaper competitors. For years, the company ignored pressure to drop its fees, even increasing them in March for some stablecoin trades. But the game has changed. Robinhood and Kraken are closing in fast, and Gemini and Bullish are getting ready to go public. “We still see long-term risks to their growth due to above-average retail transaction fees and increasing competition from platforms like Robinhood,” said Alex Woodard, an analyst at Arca. Robinhood, Kraken, Gemini heat up the competition Robinhood charges roughly half what Coinbase does, based on estimates from Mizuho. Kraken is expanding beyond crypto by adding stocks and ETFs to keep users inside its app longer. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has stabilized, and that’s giving users space to think about where they trade and what it costs. All of this is forcing Coinbase into a corner. The company either lowers prices and sacrifices margins or holds prices and loses users. Brian Armstrong, who co-founded Coinbase in 2012, took it public in 2021. That gave him a head start on most of the industry, as Coinbase became the main place to trade crypto for both retail users and big institutions in the U.S. On last week’s earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said part of the trading slowdown was linked to Coinbase’s decision to start charging for stablecoin trading pairs, a segment that had mostly been free. “This was in our control,” Alesia told shareholders. “When you exclude the impact of lower stable-pair volume, our total trading volume was more similar to the overall spot markets.” Coinbase framed the move as a tradeoff, betting on margin instead of user growth. A company spokesperson allegedly told Bloomberg in an email, “As more players enter crypto, it’s a sign the space is going mainstream. That’s good for the ecosystem, but we’re here to win.” Whether that win comes with fewer users or not is the big question. Coinbase leans on expansion plans Coinbase isn’t sitting still. It’s planning to offer stock trading and expand its custody services, which already serve institutional products like Bitcoin ETFs. It bought Deribit and added perpetual-style futures contracts for U.S. users. It wants to become the “everything exchange,” with plans to include prediction markets next. It still has over $9 billion in cash and revenue coming in from its partnership with stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group. But a big part of its business still relies on people trading crypto. Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho, said that full dependency on trading is dangerous. He explained, “Either way, being so fully dependent on crypto trading is risky.” But again, competition is turning up the heat. OKX is back in the U.S. market. Binance, even with its legal troubles, was reportedly talking to World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture owned by the Trump family. Despite the pressure, Coinbase still trades at about 44 times forward earnings. That’s higher than old-school exchanges but lower than Robinhood’s 65. It’s nowhere near Circle’s multiple. But even that premium is in danger. H.C. Wainwright downgraded the stock in July, warning that the competitive squeeze could impact its valuation. Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau is still optimistic. He expects a 46% revenue rebound in the third quarter. “I don’t think COIN’s valuation is out of reach,” Lau said. “It is trading at a big discount compared to HOOD and CRCL. I think if they can continue to grow both top and bottom line, it will help.” Get seen where it counts.

But not all crypto sportsbooks treat bonuses the same way. Some rely on opaque leveling systems or vague cashback mechanics, while others offer structured rewards that truly benefit the user. This article compares three platforms, Spartans , Rollbit, and Gamdom, to determine which one offers the most crypto-friendly bonus experience. If you’re looking for the top crypto sportsbook promotions in 2025, read on. Spartans: Structured Bonuses That Reward Crypto Users Spartans has quickly become a go-to for crypto bettors who want real rewards, not just flashy interfaces. The sportsbook’s promotions are designed with crypto users in mind, supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Avalanche, and more. Instead of vague point systems or casino-only perks, Spartans delivers two key promotions: a 300% sports welcome bonus and a 25% daily deposit bonus, both fully compatible with crypto wallets. The 300% sports bonus kicks off with a low $5 minimum deposit and goes up to $200 in bonus value. Wagering requirements are clear, 10x the bonus amount, with reasonable odds requirements that don’t limit player strategy. That means you can bet on what you actually want, whether it’s a UFC main event or Champions League action. The bonus is valid for seven days, and users can withdraw up to ten times the bonus amount if they meet the requirements. The 25% daily deposit bonus gives returning users something to work with every single day. With just a $10 deposit, crypto users can access up to $50 in extra funds for sports betting. The wagering multiple is just 8x, and the bonus supports football and basketball markets, with fair odds minimums. Compared to other platforms, Spartans has found the sweet spot between accessibility and meaningful reward. It’s consistent, transparent, and gives crypto users exactly what they expect: frictionless value. Rollbit: Cashback Without Clarity Rollbit takes a different approach. Rather than structured bonuses, it leans into a rakeback model based on user wagering activity. While this sounds great in theory, the execution is murky. Cashback percentages fluctuate based on player volume, engagement, and account tier, but these tiers aren’t always clearly explained. Crypto users often find themselves playing without knowing when or how much they’ll get back. For high-volume players or those engaged in Rollbit’s other features like trading or NFTs, the rakeback may seem attractive. But for the average sports bettor who deposits crypto and wants to wager on matches, there’s a noticeable lack of upfront value. There’s no guaranteed welcome bonus for sports betting, and no daily or weekly deposit match that makes crypto go further. For users who want immediate value from their deposits and bonuses that clearly apply to the sportsbook, Rollbit’s approach falls short. It rewards loyalty, sure, but in a system that feels random unless you’re heavily invested in the platform already. Gamdom: Leveling That Leaves Players Guessing Gamdom introduces a level-based rewards system where users climb ranks to unlock bonuses. The site supports crypto deposits and has built a loyal following, but the promotional structure can be a barrier for those who expect instant rewards. The leveling process is tied to volume and time, meaning you have to wager significantly before seeing any tangible return. While Gamdom does offer occasional promotions or targeted bonuses, they tend to lack consistency. The value of the rewards at each level isn’t always disclosed ahead of time, which makes it hard to calculate expected returns. There’s also no dedicated sportsbook welcome bonus that directly benefits crypto bettors. Most of the perks come through leveling or temporary events, which may or may not align with the user’s active betting period. For casual players or anyone new to crypto sports betting, this system can feel more like a game of chance than a reward engine. Compared to Spartans, which offers upfront, guaranteed bonuses with clear crypto compatibility, Gamdom’s format is better suited to long-haul users who are willing to grind their way to unknown rewards. Spartans Sets the Standard for Crypto Bonus Clarity When evaluating the top crypto sportsbook promotions in 2025, Spartans stands out as the most balanced, rewarding, and transparent option. Its combination of a 300% welcome bonus and a 25% daily bonus delivers immediate value to crypto bettors without forcing them into confusing tiers or abstract cashback loops. The bonuses are easy to trigger, tied directly to real crypto deposits, and offer realistic terms that players can actually meet. Rollbit and Gamdom may have built-in reward systems, but neither offers the same level of clarity or instant value. For users who deposit crypto and expect structured bonuses in return, Spartans provides the clearest path to boosted bankrolls and real withdrawal potential. It’s not about gimmicks or hidden mechanics, it’s about giving crypto sports bettors what they deserve: full control, fast payouts, and bonuses that deliver.

One of the most notable is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a quickly emerging force in decentralized lending that’s gaining a standalone headlines in the altcoin competition. The project is at $0.035 in stage 6 of the presale. The 7th stage will have a 14.29% price hike to $0.04. Existing investors expect a return of 71.43% when the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has raised over $14.1 million in capital and brought in over 14,800 investors so far. While XRP surfs regulatory tides and institutional appetite, other tokens with distinct catalysts are also targeting the symbolic figure of $5. Ripple (XRP) Aims for $5 as ETF and Legal Catalysts Pick Up Steam XRP is priced at $3.00 trading within a volatile range of $2.85–$3.03. This follows frequent legal news and growing ETF speculation. Technical and on-chain analysis reveal that XRP has broken out of a bullish flag and is now targeting $4.00–$5.00 within the next few months if regulation becomes clearer and institutions increase exposure. Other forecasts are already indicating additional upside into $6–$10 or higher based on ETF approvals and sustained bullish sentiment. As XRP consolidates at critical support funds are flowing into new DeFi-focused crypto tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Activity Growth Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 during stage 6 of presale. Its token price moves up by 14.29% to $0.04 during phase 7. The investment made by the phase 6 buyers will yield a 71.43% ROI because the token will reach the market at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.1 million. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM users become more efficient and independent with double models of lending. Smart contracts under the Peer-to-Contract model enable intermediary-free lending. Autoregulated interest rates adjust smart contracts to generate high interest rates on their own. Peer-to-Peer architecture eliminates intermediaries and provides lenders and borrowers with direct access to each other. $50,000 Bug Bounty and Incentives Rolled Out to Increase DeFi Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners will get $10,000 MUTM tokens each. The project has also launched a new top 50 token holder leaderboard who will be rewarded bonus tokens based on their ranking. In order to further protect its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced a Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 in collaboration with CertiK. All bugs will be rewarded, and the bounty will be paid on four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Ripple (XRP) may be making a solid case for $5 by 2025, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly emerging as a force to reckon within the altcoin market. At a presale price of just $0.035, over $14.1 million raised, and over 14,800 investors, early adopters can gain 71.43% ROI at launch. Aside from numbers, its innovative dual-lending mechanism, its planned USD-pegged stablecoin, and strong security framework audited by CertiK make it one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year.

Prices are shifting, traders are leaning into risk, and the loudest moves are happening in meme coins. Everyone recognizes the old champion: Dogecoin , but another name is starting to echo across chat groups and forums: Pepeto . DOGE has woken up, flashing a spark we haven’t seen in a long while. Some traders are even throwing around a ten‑dollar dream. Bold? Absolutely. Unrealistic? Maybe. But in crypto, wild hopes are part of the game. Pepeto’s presale feels different. It carries the quiet tension that seasoned traders recognize, the calm before the market realizes what it’s been ignoring. These are the moments early buyers talk about long after the move has passed. Dogecoin’s Big Target vs. Harsh Math Dogecoin (DOGE) has broken free from its downtrend, cleared the $0.20 to $0.21 resistance, and painted a double‑bottom pattern on the charts. The market data supports the momentum: spot and futures volumes are rising, whales are back in play, and sellers have thinned out. Confidence climbed further after the U.S. Genius Act passed, giving traders another reason to stay bullish. Could DOGE run to $2? Very possible. Ten dollars?, though, is where the numbers push back. With 145 billion DOGE in circulation, that price equals a $1.45 trillion market cap, bigger than Bitcoin’s all‑time peak and brushing up against Apple or Microsoft territory. Its last true peak was $0.74 in 2021, driven by Elon Musk and an unforgettable retail rush. Pepeto, meanwhile, trades at just $0.000000144. Even modest inflows can move it sharply, creating the high‑reward setup DOGE once offered, but with infrastructure that makes it more than a meme. Pepeto: More Than Just Another Meme Coin Pepeto is an Ethereum‑based project that already raised over $5,7M in presale, blends community excitement with tools that actually work. Instead of vanishing after a quick pump, it’s built to last. PepetoSwap allows zero‑fee meme coin trades and the cross‑chain bridge moves tokens seamlessly between networks. Pepeto is the first meme coin project with this level of real value. Early meme coins delivered laughs and speculation. Pepeto adds the backbone they lacked. BUY PEPETO FROM OFFICIAL WEBSITE Tokenomics That Reward Early Believers Pepeto’s 420 trillion token supply is designed for health and longevity, not a flash run. About a third of the supply sits with presale buyers, giving them a strong early stake. Another similar portion feeds the staking pool, where rewards can reach around 255% APY. A smaller piece, roughly one‑eighth of the supply, keeps liquidity flowing. The remainder pushes marketing and project development, keeping the momentum alive well past launch. Trading is tax‑free, so every buy and sell keeps its full value. Independent audits by SolidProof and Coinsult confirmed no high‑risk issues, a rare level of security in the meme coin world. Why This Window Matters Dogecoin is the legend. Pepeto is the fresh chance for investors who want ground‑floor access before the wider market catches up. DOGE is already expensive and listed everywhere. Pepeto is still in presale, and windows like this never stay open long. Final Takeaway Opportunities in crypto appear calm before they turn chaotic. Pepeto is in that calm right now, waiting for the few who can spot it early. Once the market wakes up, the story will already belong to those who moved first.

This year, the focus shifts to coins showing credible growth, actual use cases, or smart entry points driven by solid numbers and trends. Whether it’s a presale with clear momentum, a coin built for short-term plays, or tech-focused assets with real fundamentals, only a handful truly stand out. Here’s a breakdown of four notable cryptocurrencies that are being watched closely due to their ROI potential, unique appeal, and timing. Each brings a distinct strategy for those exploring the fastest growing cryptos in 2025 before major price shifts take place. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): 2,660% Gains Already Delivered and Still Room to Grow BlockDAG is attracting attention with its presale price holding at $0.0016 until August 11th, opening one of the strongest ROI setups in crypto right now. While its demo dashboard displays a $0.0276 internal price, BDAG remains available at just $0.0016 in batch 29. That contrast points to a built-in upside of over 1,600% even before any exchange listing takes place. BlockDAG has already crossed major milestones, with $363 million raised and over 24.7 billion coins sold in presale. Since batch 1, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. Unlike many early-stage projects, BlockDAG has released a full interactive dashboard showcasing trading simulations, pricing tools, and real-time visuals, giving users a preview of how the token will behave post-launch. This isn’t just about timing, it’s about measurable growth. With its tools live and active community, BlockDAG (BDAG) earns its spot among the fastest growing cryptos in 2025. The $0.0016 pricing window closes August 11th, making this a data-supported, time-sensitive play worth watching. 2. BONK: Momentum-Driven Moves in a Meme-Heavy Market Among Solana-based meme coins, BONK has carved a space thanks to its volatile runs and expanding retail participation. Unlike projects chasing long-term utility, BONK thrives on speed, volume, and trader sentiment. Its model focuses on fast swings and liquidity cycles rather than deep development. BONK’s appeal comes from its low price-per-unit combined with high trade volume, making it perfect for those who target 2x to 5x shifts in short timeframes. Being linked to the Solana network ensures consistent presence across major exchanges and apps. While BONK doesn’t promise sustainable mechanics, it continues to ride speculative waves with force. For quick-turnaround gains, BONK remains one of the fastest growing cryptos in 2025, thanks to its price action-driven appeal and potential for short bursts of profit in reaction-heavy markets. 3. Kaspa (KAS): Efficient Tech Meets Long-Term Potential KAS is gaining support from the technically aware crypto crowd because of its advanced GHOSTDAG structure and near-instant block processing. Built with a proof-of-work base yet designed for speed, Kaspa delivers an efficient alternative to traditional PoW chains without compromising decentralization. Its performance metrics remain strong, transaction speed, security, and growing adoption rates all signal a solid build. KAS’s price trajectory has also been consistent, showing rising volume and gradual climbs, even with a market cap smaller than other layer-1 platforms. The upside here lies in its blend of scalability and underexposure. With growing listings and staking options on the horizon, Kaspa has every reason to be on the fastest growing cryptos in 2025 list. It’s not built for hype; it’s built for sustainability and continuous improvement. 4. Cronos (CRO): Strategic Brand, Quiet Accumulation Phase CRO, the utility coin backing the Crypto.com ecosystem, is often overlooked in high-volume chatter, but that quiet may be its strongest asset. Its presence across global sporting promotions and integration within the app give it a wide base, and its current price level offers upside for those looking ahead. CRO has been trading close to its bottom range, giving room for entry before a potential volume resurgence. Once Crypto.com resumes broader reward programs and exchange traffic rebounds, CRO could begin retesting old highs. It has an established user community and remains fully functional within a large ecosystem. For those evaluating the fastest growing cryptos in 2025 from a recovery angle, CRO represents a calculated play. It’s a low-noise, high-potential setup with a strong platform supporting it. Final Say When looking at the fastest growing cryptos in 2025, it’s not only about hype but strong data, proven activity, and time-limited entry windows. BlockDAG leads this group with a structured setup that has already brought 2,660% gains to early adopters and offers over 1,600% potential as its $0.0016 price stays live until August 11th. BONK continues to deliver on short-term trades, Kaspa brings reliable architecture with strong upside, and CRO offers a quiet accumulation opportunity backed by a major brand. For anyone following numbers over narratives, these four assets make a compelling case for the fastest growing cryptos in 2025 .

In 2025, the spotlight has shifted toward new crypto-first betting sites that prioritize speed, trust, and smooth user experience. These platforms are changing the rules, ditching delayed withdrawals, simplifying bonus systems, and focusing on what users care about most: fast access to winnings and real control of funds. If you’re searching for a forward-thinking platform or want to know how to claim betting bonus offers without wading through fine print, this list covers the five most promising new crypto betting sites of the year. 1. Spartans: Instant Withdrawals and Seamless Betting Flow Spartans ranks as the #1 new crypto betting site of 2025 for good reason. It’s built from the ground up with a crypto-first philosophy, meaning no fiat gateways, no card declines, and no banking interference. Deposits and withdrawals are processed instantly through trusted crypto wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. This direct-to-wallet system eliminates delays and keeps players in full control of their funds. Whether you’re placing sports bets or spinning slots, Spartans delivers a seamless experience that transitions effortlessly between casino games and live odds markets. The platform’s popularity has exploded among both players and affiliates due to its consistent performance and transparent terms. Players particularly appreciate how easy it is to understand the reward system. If you’re wondering how to claim betting bonus offers, Spartans simplifies it with daily deposit bonuses and a 300% welcome bonus that’s clearly explained on-site. There’s no confusion about minimum odds, no hidden steps, and no waiting period to see rewards applied. Another major advantage is the platform’s usability. Spartans supports both casino and sportsbook betting in one dashboard, which keeps players from jumping between tabs or apps. It’s mobile-optimized, easy to navigate, and offers a rare combination of speed, clarity, and crypto flexibility. For bettors who value time, trust, and payout speed, Spartans sets the standard for what a 2025 crypto betting site should be. 2. Roobet: Fast Play, Limited Bonus Structure Roobet continues to grow in the crypto betting world, offering a sleek interface and fast gameplay. It features branded slots and celebrity partnerships, which attract attention, but the bonus offerings can feel limited. Most rewards are tied to promotional campaigns or VIP programs, and new users may have to dig into settings or support pages to figure out how to claim betting bonus rewards. 3. BC.Game: Gamified Interface, High Altcoin Support BC.Game has become known for its wide support of altcoins and gamified user experience. Its wheel spins, daily challenges, and chest rewards add a sense of fun to the platform. However, these bonuses often lack consistency and transparency. Players looking for a straightforward explanation of how to claim betting bonus offers might find BC.Game’s reward mechanics unclear or overly randomized. 4. Betano: Strong Sportsbook, Limited Crypto Focus Betano has been gaining ground in Europe for its sportsbook interface and competitive odds.

Recently, a notable development on the Hyperliquid platform caught the attention of the crypto community: a prominent Hyperliquid whale , known as “@qwatio,” made a decisive move to halve a substantial Bitcoin (BTC) short position. This action highlights the inherent risks and dynamic nature of crypto trading losses , even for experienced market participants. What Prompted This Hyperliquid Whale’s Strategic Shift? On-chain analyst EmberCN, a well-regarded voice on X, first brought this intriguing situation to light. EmberCN identified “@qwatio” as an “insider,” suggesting a deeper understanding of market dynamics or perhaps even privileged information. Initially, this whale’s BTC short position was immensely profitable, boasting an unrealized gain of a staggering $26 million. However, market shifts quickly turned the tide. The unrealized profits vanished. The position instead accumulated $2 million in losses. This rapid reversal compelled “@qwatio” to act. This dramatic swing from significant profit to a notable loss underscores the unpredictable nature of leveraged trading on platforms like Hyperliquid. Understanding the Dynamics of a BTC Short Position and On-Chain Analysis A BTC short position essentially means betting on a price decline. Traders open shorts when they expect Bitcoin’s value to fall, hoping to buy back at a lower price and profit from the difference. When the market moves against a short, as it did for “@qwatio,” losses begin to mount. This is where on-chain analysis becomes crucial. Analysts like EmberCN monitor public blockchain data to track large transactions and significant wallet movements, providing insights into the actions of major players, or “whales.” Their reports offer a transparent look into market sentiment and potential trends. Navigating Crypto Trading Losses: A Whale’s Perspective Why would a trader, even one with the capital of a whale, cut losses after such a massive reversal? This decision, while painful, is often a core component of a sound whale trading strategy . Allowing losses to accumulate indefinitely can lead to even greater financial damage or even liquidation, where the exchange automatically closes the position. Halving the short means reducing exposure and preserving capital, even if it locks in existing losses. It’s a strategic retreat to fight another day, rather than a full capitulation. Risk Management: Prioritizing capital preservation. Market Volatility: Acknowledging unpredictable swings. Adaptability: Adjusting to changing market conditions. This move by the Hyperliquid whale serves as a powerful reminder that even the biggest players face challenges and must adapt to survive in the volatile crypto markets. What Can Traders Learn from This Hyperliquid Whale’s Action? The case of “@qwatio” offers valuable lessons for all traders, regardless of their capital size. Firstly, it emphasizes that unrealized profits are just that – unrealized. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning fortunes overnight. Secondly, it highlights the importance of having a robust risk management plan, including clear stop-loss levels or strategies for cutting losses. Finally, observing the actions revealed by on-chain analysis can provide insights into how large entities manage their positions, offering a glimpse into professional trading psychology. Never rely solely on unrealized gains. Implement strict risk management. Learn from experienced traders and on-chain insights. This incident on Hyperliquid reinforces the unpredictable nature of crypto, urging traders to remain vigilant and disciplined. The recent move by the Hyperliquid whale , “@qwatio,” to halve a significant BTC short position after experiencing a substantial profit reversal into losses, provides a compelling narrative from the front lines of crypto trading. It underscores the critical importance of adaptable strategies and stringent risk management, even for those with deep pockets. As the crypto markets continue their dynamic dance, stories like these serve as crucial reminders that discipline and quick decision-making are paramount for navigating both immense potential and unforeseen challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is “@qwatio” and what is their significance? “@qwatio” is a pseudonymous trader on Hyperliquid, described by analyst EmberCN as an “insider” or “whale” due to their large trading positions, like the significant BTC short. Their actions are noteworthy because they can influence market sentiment or reflect informed perspectives. What is a BTC short position? A BTC short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows Bitcoin and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later, return the borrowed Bitcoin, and profit from the price difference. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade various cryptocurrencies with high leverage. It’s known for its speed and on-chain operations. How did “@qwatio”‘s position go from profit to loss? Initially, Bitcoin’s price likely dropped, allowing “@qwatio”‘s short position to accrue $26 million in unrealized profits. However, a subsequent increase in Bitcoin’s price would have caused these profits to vanish and turn into losses, reaching $2 million. Why did the whale cut their losses instead of waiting? Cutting losses is a fundamental risk management strategy. By halving the position, “@qwatio” reduced their exposure to further price increases, preventing potentially larger losses or even a forced liquidation of their entire position. It prioritizes capital preservation. Did this intriguing story of the Hyperliquid whale resonate with you? Share your thoughts on risk management in crypto trading!

The launch, which took place on August 5, 2025, marks a major milestone in the evolution of cryptographic verifiability and scalability in the Web3 ecosystem. Related Reading: $255 Solana? Supply Shock Fuels Bullish Forecast Following the mainnet debut, the PROVE token was listed on Bitget, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. Within 24 hours, the token surged by over 50%, reaching a trading price of $1.50 and generating over $715 million in 24-hour volume. Bitget’s Succinct (PROVE) Listing Fuels Market Momentum Bitget added PROVE to its Innovation Zone, opening spot trading for the PROVE/USDT pair on August 5, 2025. To incentivize adoption, the exchange launched a CandyBomb campaign featuring 66,666 PROVE in total rewards for traders and depositors. This strategic listing allows users to engage with PROVE through both trading and staking activities. The token will also be listed on Binance, where it carries a Seed Tag and supports multiple trading pairs, further increasing its visibility and liquidity. Succinct (PROVE) is trading near $1.2 and analysts note signs of consolidation ahead of a possible surge. PROVE's price trends to the upside on low timeframes, following its debut on major crypto exchanges. Source: PROVEUSD on Tradingview Powering the Future of ZK Infrastructure The PROVE token is the backbone of the Succinct Prover Network, a decentralized, two-sided marketplace where developers request ZK proofs and independent provers compete to fulfill them. Unlike traditional systems that require complex and costly infrastructure, Succinct simplifies the integration of ZK proofs via a general-purpose zkVM that supports languages like Rust. Currently, the network supports 35+ protocols, has processed over 5 million proofs, and secures more than $4 billion in value. Notable partners include Polygon, Mantle, Lido, and Celestia. Looking Ahead Succinct’s approach to verifiable computation is drawing comparisons to foundational internet protocols, with CTO John Guibas noting, “Our goal was to make proving infrastructure accessible at internet scale.” With strong developer traction, dual exchange listings, and a scalable infrastructure model, Succinct is well-positioned to become a core component of blockchain scalability and privacy.

That question is coming up more often as Pudgy Penguins gains traction and BONK’s dip shows how fast trends can flip. In a space driven by speed and sentiment, catching the right entry point matters more than ever. That is why Cold Wallet ($CWT) is starting to stand out. It is not just storage; it is a system that rewards users for staying active. Every gas fee, swap, or on-ramp can earn cashback. Right now, Diamond Tier is still within reach. At just $0.00942, buyers can lock in top-tier benefits before $CWT launches at $0.35171. Pudgy Penguins Price Eyes Support as Hype Cools Off Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is currently trading around $0.0377, slipping nearly 8% in just 24 hours. Still, it remains up more than 180% over the past month, signaling it is far from out of play. Recent highs near $0.041 reflect strong interest, though current support appears to be forming around $0.032. Looking ahead, analysts suggest a pullback to $0.029 may be in play by early August. Even with short-term resistance holding, volatility makes room for another bounce. PENGU remains a strong example of how meme hype and utility can drive high-risk opportunities. BONK Faces Sell Pressure: Exchange Moves Rattle Price BONK saw a sharp dip after Galaxy Digital transferred $18.75 million worth of tokens to major exchanges. The price dropped 9% from a high of $0.00003763 to $0.00003430. Despite recent burns and swap activity, heavy volume kept the pressure on, testing support near $0.0000325. Forecasts now suggest a potential decline to the $0.000024 to $0.000026 range in the coming days. While short-term bounces are possible, sentiment remains cautious. BONK is still attracting meme coin watchers, but momentum may shift only if volume returns with strength. Diamond Tier Unlocks Cold Wallet’s Top Cashback With $CWT at $0.00942 Cold Wallet’s Diamond Tier is more than a label. It is a fast track to becoming one of the most rewarded users in the crypto space. Over $5.66 million raised confirms that the word is out. Diamond users earn 100% cashback on gas fees, token swaps, and on-off ramp transactions. No conditions. No staking. Simply hold $CWT in your wallet and start earning money for the activities you would already be doing. At the current Stage 16 price of $0.00942, Diamond Tier access comes at a steep discount. With 685 million tokens already sold and the next price set at $0.00998, the window is narrowing fast. At launch, $CWT will list for $0.35171, giving current buyers a clear 37x advantage. If $CWT moves toward $2 as some projections suggest, the difference could mean being locked out entirely. Presale participants also get access to structured benefits. Token unlocks start with 10% at TGE, followed by a linear three-month vesting schedule. Referral bonuses add to the upside, with 10% for the sender and 5% for the recipient. Cold Wallet continues to prioritize early adopters by turning commitment into real returns. There is no staking or hidden setup. Just hold $CWT and unlock full access to the wallet’s most rewarding tier. For anyone watching how the top crypto earners got started, this is the kind of entry point that rarely comes twice. Key Points Pudgy Penguins is still holding interest despite recent volatility, while BONK’s drop reflects how quickly sentiment can shift after major exchange moves. These price swings are reminders that timing shapes everything, whether you are entering or exiting. That is exactly why Cold Wallet’s $CWT presale is drawing attention now. With $CWT priced at just $0.00942, buyers can still lock in Diamond Tier and earn 100% cashback without any staking or lockups. When launch arrives at $0.35171, the cost will be far steeper. Cold Wallet does not just reward use; it rewards those who show up early.

BTC continues to maintain its reputation as a hedge, with many prominent figures in the sector claiming that the asset could spur financial freedom and independence. The Bitcoin Freedom Wave Is Spreading Michael Saylor, the outspoken Bitcoin advocate and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, has once again made waves in the crypto world by declaring that Bitcoin is an unstoppable asset that drives financial freedom. Saylor’s statement comes in the midst of growing institutional interest in BTC, as big firms rapidly accumulate the crypto king. In the interview with Fox Business shared by Coin Bureau on the X platform, Saylor called BTC a freedom virus based on a monetary and truth virus. This underscores the digital asset’s function as a global force for monetary independence and resistance to centralized control, presenting it as more than just a financial tool . With BTC gaining mainstream recognition, the chairman considers the asset a swarm creature due to the robust support for the Bitcoin ecosystem across the world. According to Saylor, there will always be individuals supporting BTC with their electricity, computer power, political power, and economic power, which reinforces its presence in the financial sector. Saylor believes Bitcoin is unstoppable at this point, comparing its stability to a swarm of hornets. He further stated that BTC is currently spreading rapidly throughout the world, demonstrating robust strength on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. As economic uncertainty endures and mistrust of established traditional systems increases, Saylor’s bold declaration reinforces the ongoing notion that Bitcoin is more than just a store of value . The crypto king has become a fast-growing movement that is changing the way the world thinks about finance and freedom. Treasury Companies Revolutionizing BTC Investments Strategy’s unwavering confidence toward Bitcoin is now being emulated by several large treasury companies seeking to own a BTC reserve . Such growing interest among institutions is revolutionizing BTC investments in recent times. Presently, companies like Strategy and Metaplanet are accelerating BTC’s journey to becoming a global reserve asset. According to Degen Station, this is making it possible for institutions to buy stocks or bonds backed by BTC, unlike before, when they were unable to purchase spot BTC due to constraints. Degen Station noted that these firms are currently using smart leverage, which is safer than margin or daily-reset ETFs , because they have access to long-term corporate debt. Addressing potential misunderstandings, the market experts stated that this is a normal aspect of BTC’s adoption curve and does not pose a danger to its ethos.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coin Bureau|Degen Station|Fox Business|Metaplanet|michael saylor,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 16:00:36

From fresh Ethereum forecasts to bold SUI predictions, analysts are highlighting new upside. Traders are jumping in fast. Still, for everyday users, old problems remain. Fees are high. Tools are scattered. Getting started feels complicated, and simple actions are too costly. For crypto to go mainstream, those issues need fixing, not just price talk. That’s where a different path is getting noticed. Cold Wallet ($CWT) doesn’t chase charts. It focuses on solving what keeps users away. Self-custody, low fees, and clean design make it practical from day one. While others push price narratives, Cold Wallet builds tools users actually need. Ethereum’s Cost Barrier Still Holds Users Back Ethereum price prediction headlines now float around the $10,000 mark. The signals are optimistic, backed by strong inflows and institutional chatter. Yet users still face the same core problem; gas costs. On high-traffic days, fees spike, and even basic tasks become expensive. That makes participation harder, especially for newcomers. These cost barriers clash with Ethereum’s potential as a mass-use platform. While price speculation grabs attention, actual utility still lags. It raises a question: Can the average person really use Ethereum daily? Cold Wallet addresses the same issues, just from the ground up. It brings control and simplicity to users who don’t want to lose money with every click. And when evaluating where value lies, usability counts more than just the price target. SUI Gains Steam, Yet User Access Falls Short SUI price predictions are turning bullish. Analysts point to a breakout above resistance with potential for bigger upside if trends hold. The chart looks strong. But once again, tools become the deal-breaker. Even fast chains struggle if users can’t onboard smoothly. Wallets, bridges, and apps still feel disconnected. This makes things harder for those testing the network for the first time. For any rally to last, user experience has to match the price chart. Cold Wallet sees that gap clearly. It builds around simple flows from the start. No hurdles, no unnecessary steps. That’s why it’s attracting attention. For users comparing coins, real-world access is becoming a major deciding factor—more than just what a chart shows. Cold Wallet’s 3,600% Potential Built on Real Utility Cold Wallet’s approach is practical. It lets users manage their funds without running into constant charges. The interface is clean, self-custody is central, and every feature is built for convenience. That’s the kind of system long-term users want, one where fees don’t eat into every action. Even during peak periods, the platform keeps things affordable. While Ethereum and SUI grab headlines, Cold Wallet quietly ensures users don’t pay the price for network activity. It’s built for consistency, not just performance on good days. The presale is now in Stage 16 at $0.00942. With the launch price set at $0.3517, that’s a projected 3,600% return from current levels. It’s raised $5.7 million already and sold over 682.8 million coins, showing strong traction. This isn’t just about upside, it’s about making usage simple. Cold Wallet aligns product experience with the real needs of everyday users. Instead of charging more as activity rises, it makes actions smoother. In a market driven by predictions, this kind of functionality is what sticks. Crypto adoption needs more than noise. It needs systems that work when the market is quiet too. Cold Wallet delivers that balance; real tools, clear ROI, and a user-first design. Why Practical Tools Will Define the Next Market Leader Price forecasts are part of the game. A bold Ethereum prediction can move markets. A breakout SUI chart can fuel interest. But if using the platform still feels expensive or confusing, people walk away. That’s where Cold Wallet changes the rules. It doesn’t chase hype, it solves what breaks adoption. With low fees, fast access, and practical design, it brings usability back to the spotlight. Choosing what to buy isn’t just about numbers. It’s about who’s building tools people can actually use. Cold Wallet lowers the barrier to entry, making it easier to stay active without frustration. When those pieces are in place, price can follow, but people don’t need to wait for it. In a sea of forecasts, Cold Wallet brings the focus back to utility. That’s why it’s gaining attention now, before the rest of the market catches on.

Major crypto/forex pairs offer 24/7 trading; stocks follow the traditional market schedule. Platform upgrades, price oracles, and user wallet trading boost DEX growth.

Contracts for AAPL, AMZN, and TSLA track stock prices on traditional markets, but their trading is limited to standard exchange sessions. Crypto and forex pairs like BTCUSD, ETHUSD, BNBUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD remain available for trading 24 hours a day. PancakeSwap’s perpetual swaps allow traders to speculate on stock prices with up to 25x leverage while maintaining full control over their assets. The DEX plans to expand the list of available instruments in the coming months. The exchange introduced PancakeSwap Perpetuals in 2022. Last October, the platform released a major upgrade featuring a revamped interface and a liquidity engine utilizing the ALP pool. The trading platform has also integrated price oracles from Pyth, Binance Oracle, and Chainlink, and removed the order book. PancakeSwap users can trade directly from their wallets without transferring assets to the exchange. For large pairs like BTC/USDT, the platform supports leverage up to 150x. Growth and Market Position According to DeFi Llama, PancakeSwap is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX), with daily trading volume exceeding $1.7 billion. The platform’s total value locked (TVL) stands at $2.01 billion. In July, PancakeSwap generated more than $28.6 million in revenue and processed $146.6 million in trading fees.

According to Fagel, another vote from the SEC Commissioners may still be required before the final judgment can be approved. This revelation, shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, comes amid rising investor anticipation for closure in the high-profile lawsuit. The Exchange That Raised the Alarm Attorney Bill Morgan, a vocal supporter of Ripple, recently engaged in a discussion with Marc Fagel, former regional director at the SEC. Morgan asked whether another Commission vote was necessary to finalize the settlement and dismiss the case. BREAKING: EX-SEC OFFICIAL FAGEL: “WE’RE PRESUMABLY STILL WAITING ON ANOTHER VOTE” IN #XRP CASE. ORIGINAL APPROVAL DIDN’T COVER INJUNCTION MODIFICATION. pic.twitter.com/fyaCl4NElp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 6, 2025 Fagel responded that while there was a slim chance the original vote covered everything, including the modification of the existing injunction, the delay in court proceedings made it clear that this likely wasn’t the case. His conclusion: “We’re presumably still waiting on another vote.” STEPH IS CRYPTO brought this exchange to the forefront in a post that read: “Breaking: Ex-SEC official Fagel: ‘We’re presumably still waiting on another vote’ in XRP case. Original approval didn’t cover injunction modification.” This pointed statement has raised critical questions about what exactly is holding up the final steps in one of crypto’s most closely watched legal battles. Why Another SEC Vote Matters At the center of the delay is the issue of injunctive relief—a court-imposed order that restricts certain actions by Ripple. While the SEC and Ripple reached a settlement agreement in June 2025, Judge Analisa Torres rejected their jointly proposed motion , thus allowing for the appeal to continue. Under SEC procedures, any material change to an enforcement case—particularly involving injunctions—typically requires a formal vote from the five-member Commission. If the modification to the injunctive order wasn’t included in the original approval, a new vote must occur. Fagel’s remarks strongly suggest that this step hasn’t yet been taken.

In July 2023, Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges, delivering a partial win to Ripple. However, the judge also found that Ripple’s past institutional sales did violate securities laws, and this portion of the case remained open for penalties. Following a failed resolution attempt, Ripple opted to drop its counter-appeal; the SEC appeals are also expected to be dropped, as indicated by Garlinghouse and other insiders. But the unresolved issue of the injunction continues to block a formal closure of the case. A Waiting Game for XRP Holders Until the SEC takes the necessary procedural step, presumably, another vote to drop its appeal, the case remains open. The XRP community, which has endured nearly five years of legal uncertainty, remains on edge. For now, all eyes are on the SEC. Whether a new vote happens soon will determine when, and if, the Ripple case can finally be put to rest. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Imagine a world where your AI assistant needs to pay for every piece of information or service it accesses online, constantly asking for your approval or needing new subscriptions. This friction is exactly what Lava Payments aims to eliminate, positioning itself at the forefront of the next wave of AI payments . Revolutionizing Transactions: Why AI Payments Are Essential? The digital frontier is rapidly being reshaped by autonomous AI agents, capable of performing complex tasks on behalf of users. However, as these agents become more sophisticated, a fundamental hurdle arises: how do they pay for the services and data they consume without constant human intervention? This was the core problem identified by Mitchell Jones, founder of Lava Payments, after his tenure at a Y Combinator-backed fintech startup, Lendtable. Jones’s personal experience highlighted a significant inefficiency. While experimenting with AI applications, he found himself spending hundreds of dollars just to build a basic form-filling agent. The issue wasn’t the cost of the core AI models themselves, but the repetitive nature of payments. He realized that using the same underlying models through different platforms or ‘wrappers’ meant constantly re-subscribing, re-authenticating, and paying separately, even though he had already paid for access to the core model. “I kept running into the same issue,” Jones explained. “I was using the same underlying models and tools again and again, but through different wrappers or platforms.” This fractured payment experience felt fundamentally broken. What was needed, he concluded, was a unified system – a single wallet, one set of credits, and the freedom to move between tools and providers without starting over every time. This realization sparked the idea for Lava Payments: to create a seamless, developer-friendly system for AI and agent-driven transactions. Lava Payments: Ushering in a New Era of Digital Wallets Lava Payments is designed to be the definitive solution for the fragmented world of AI-driven transactions. At its core, Lava introduces a revolutionary concept of digital wallets that operate on a system of ‘usage credits.’ This innovative approach allows merchants to enable the Lava wallet for their customers, who can then upload credits to it. The brilliance lies in the universality of these credits: once loaded, they can be used across any merchant that accepts Lava, as well as foundational AI models like GPT and Claude, all on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis. Consider the traditional payment model for AI agents versus Lava’s streamlined approach: Feature Traditional AI Agent Payments Lava Payments for AI Agents Payment Method Multiple subscriptions, credit cards, manual approvals Single digital wallet with usage credits Transaction Flow Frequent interruptions, re-authentication for each service Seamless, frictionless, autonomous transactions Cost Efficiency Potential for redundant payments for core models Pay-as-you-go, optimized usage of credits User Experience Frustrating, time-consuming approvals Effortless, truly autonomous agent operations This streamlined approach means that instead of asking a user to approve transaction after transaction, an AI agent can simply charge from a pre-funded usage credit as it performs various tasks. Jones draws an analogy to accessing the internet: “Without Lava, agents can’t move smoothly through the internet because they constantly get blocked when it comes time to pay.” Just as you don’t pay Google for every map view because you’ve already paid your internet provider, Lava ensures AI agents can operate freely once credits are established. Building the Foundation of the Agent-Native Economy Lava Payments is not just building a payment platform; it is laying the groundwork for what Mitchell Jones calls the “ agent-native economy .” This concept envisions a future where autonomous AI agents are not just tools, but active participants in the digital marketplace, capable of transacting and interacting without human oversight for every single payment. The focus is on creating an interconnected ecosystem where agents can seamlessly move and conduct business across different platforms and services. “We see the world as very interconnected,” Jones stated, highlighting Lava’s unique differentiator from other startups in this space, such as Metronome. While others might focus on specific payment niches, Lava’s broader vision is to become the “invisible layer that kind of powers the AI web.” This means ensuring that as AI agents increasingly find themselves in the checkout line, they are empowered to transact and build without friction. The core philosophy is simple yet profound: enable AI to be truly autonomous in its financial interactions. This liberation from constant payment prompts and re-authentications is crucial for the proliferation and utility of advanced AI agents across various industries, from customer service to complex data analysis. Lava is designed to make AI accessible and functional for everyone, fostering an environment where even a kid from Dayton, Ohio, can leverage powerful AI tools without financial barriers impeding their innovation. Strategic Fintech Innovation and Funding Success The promise of Lava Payments has not gone unnoticed by investors. The startup recently announced a significant milestone: a successful $5.8 million seed funding round. This substantial investment was led by prominent venture capital firm Lerer Hippeau, a testament to the compelling vision and potential impact of Lava’s fintech innovation . Mitchell Jones’s journey to this funding success is a story of perseverance and strategic networking. Born to a working family in Dayton, Ohio, Jones absorbed the foundational advice of hard work, saving, and education. This ethos led him through Yale, successful stints at Goldman Sachs and Meta, and the founding of two prior fintech companies, Parable and Lendtable (a YC S20 alum). His connection with Lerer Hippeau’s Will McKelvey, a high school acquaintance who had been following Jones’s career, proved pivotal in securing the lead investment. The seed round also saw participation from other notable investors, including Harlem Capital, Streamlined Ventures, and Westbound. This diverse backing underscores the widespread belief in Lava’s mission to simplify AI transactions. The fresh capital infusion will be strategically deployed to accelerate the company’s growth. Key areas of investment include: Hiring Talent: Expanding the team with top engineers and developers to further refine and scale the platform. Product Development: Enhancing the core Lava wallet and usage credit system, adding new features, and integrating with more foundational AI models and merchant services. Go-to-Market Strategies: Developing robust plans to onboard more merchants and users, ensuring widespread adoption of the agent-native payment system. Lava Payments is poised to become an indispensable component of the future digital economy. By addressing the fundamental challenge of payment friction for AI agents, it is paving the way for a more seamless, efficient, and truly autonomous digital experience for everyone. Lava Payments represents a crucial step forward in the evolution of digital commerce, particularly within the burgeoning AI landscape. By providing a unified, frictionless payment solution for AI agents, Lava is not just solving a technical problem; it is unlocking new possibilities for innovation and accessibility in the agent-native economy. As AI continues to integrate deeper into our daily lives, platforms like Lava will be essential in ensuring these powerful tools can operate at their full potential, without being hampered by outdated payment infrastructures. The future of AI transactions is here, and it’s powered by Lava. To learn more about the latest AI market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI models features.

BTC briefly reclaimed $115,000 on Tuesday but lost momentum almost immediately, plunging to a low of $112,756. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and move to its current level of $114,064. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally down over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) registered a notably bigger decline, dropping almost 1% to $3,634. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim $3,700, and is down almost 5% over the past week. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 3%, having slipped below $3 and trading around $2.95. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is down 2.32%, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 2.82% and Cardano (ADA) is down 2.31%, trading around $0.726. Stellar (XLM) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , Uniswap (UNI) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. SEC Says Some Liquid Staking Activities Fall Outside Securities Laws The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that certain cryptocurrency liquid staking activities are not securities offerings. The directive is a significant step towards the market regulator’s efforts to provide clear guidance on digital asset regulation. The SEC released a statement referring to key sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. “The statement clarifies the division’s view that, depending on the facts and circumstances, the liquid staking activities covered in the statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities.” The SEC defined liquid staking as the process of staking digital assets through a protocol and receiving a “liquid staking receipt token,” which acts as proof of ownership. “Today’s staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff’s view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction.” BlackRock Leads Spot Ether ETF Exodus US-based spot Ether ETFs registered nearly $500 million in daily net outflows on Monday, the highest in a single day since their launch, according to data from Farside Investors. Farside Investors’ data showed that spot Ether ETFs registered net outflows of $465 million on Monday, the second day of outflows since breaking a 20-day inflow streak on Friday. The sharp pullback in ETFs could signal a potential shift in investor sentiment following a strong showing in July. Spot Ether ETFs registered a record $5.43 billion in net inflows in July. The latest outflows coincided with ETH dropping to an intraday low of $3,380 on Sunday, down nearly 12% from its peak last week. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) registered the biggest outflow on Monday with $375 million. Despite the outflows, the ETF maintains a cumulative net inflow of $9.3 billion and net assets $10 billion. Trump Could Sign Order To Probe Debanking Claims President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order directing banking regulators to investigate debanking claims made by prominent individuals from the crypto sector and several conservatives. A rough draft of the order directs bank regulators to probe financial institutions that violated antitrust, consumer financial protection, or fair lending practice laws to cut any agency policy that could have led to banks dropping customers. The order also directs regulators to refer potential violations to the US Justice Department, with violators facing fines and legal action. According to reports, Trump could sign the executive order as early as this week. Prominent crypto industry executives have long claimed that the Biden administration used regulators to cut off the crypto industry from legacy financial institutions after the FTX collapse. Court documents revealed that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had asked banks to pause crypto-related activities in 2022. Philippines SEC Goes After Unregistered Crypto Platforms The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission has issued an advisory naming several cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, and Kraken, for operating without proper authorization under the country’s new crypto regulations. The alert warned that several platforms were offering and promoting crypto services despite lacking the necessary registration under SEC Memoranda Circulars No. 4 and No. 5. The new circulars came into effect on Tuesday. The alert stated, “These platforms have no license, registration, or authorization from the SEC to operate in the Philippines or to solicit investments from the public. Their actions are unauthorized and expose Filipino investors to significant risk.” The Philippines SEC acknowledged that their current list may not include all violators, and other platforms providing similar services are also in violation of Philippine Securities laws. “The rules apply to any person or entity that offers, promotes, or facilitates access to crypto-asset trading venues or intermediation services such as buying, selling, and derivatives trading of crypto-assets.” The agency warned violators it would pursue legal and regulatory action against them, including cease-and-desist orders and criminal complaints. The regulator also plans to work with Google, Apple, and Meta to restrict unauthorized marketing activities. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continues to falter as the flagship cryptocurrency fell back into the red during the ongoing session. BTC ended the weekend positively and pushed higher on Monday, rising 0.69% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,097. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling to an intraday low of $112,722 before settling at $114,722, down almost 1%. BTC’s rebound faces resistance as long-term holders continue cashing out and institutional interest begins to cool. BTC is also seeing several sell signals, with two key metrics suggesting a shift in investor sentiment. This points to a possible pause in upward momentum as long-term holders lock in their profits, giving sellers an advantage. Several old whales have also moved around 3,000 BTC around Thursday. Historically, such movements are generally associated with local tops, indicating that BTC’s rally could take a breather. Taker sells volume on futures contracts has also risen. The last time this happened, BTC saw a 6% drop. Options data shows a clear shift in sentiment, with the 30-day skew dropping from +2% to -2%, indicating that investors are paying more to hedge against declines. Institutional interest has also cooled, with $1.2 billion being moved out of spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past two days, adding to the sell pressure. CoinShares believes a trend shift is underway following a hawkish FOMC meeting. Georgii Verbitski, founder of TYMIO, stated, “Sideways trading through August is the most probable scenario before momentum resumes.” Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital founder Michael Novogratz has warned that the growing trend of Bitcoin treasury companies has peaked. Recent months have seen an influx of several new companies holding Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets. “The question now is which of the existing companies will become monsters.” Novogratz warned that the growing number of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether treasury companies could shut out new entrants thanks to dwindling liquidity and opportunities in the sector. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.31% to $119,398. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. The price encountered volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $117,925. BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,722 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. It rebounded to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,783, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Thursday as BTC fell almost 2% and settled at $115,800. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC dropped over 2%, slipping below $114,000 and settling at $113,365. The price continued declining on Saturday, falling almost 1% to settle at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,311. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.69% and settled at $115,097. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,722 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,135, ultimately registering a drop of 0.84%. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is marginally up during the ongoing session despite a substantial decline on Tuesday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency dropped to an intraday low of $3,547 as selling pressure intensified thanks to a major selloff in Ethereum ETFs. Spot Ethereum ETFs registered a staggering $465 million outflow in a single trading session, prompting analysts to question the longevity and sustainability of the current bull cycle. Claims that the bull market may have reached its peak appear justified with BTC, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies registering notable declines. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF registered its most significant outflow since inception, with over 101,000 ETH worth around $375 million liquidated. The outflow snaps the asset manager’s 21-day inflow streak. “ETH ETFs were bloody red today. 133.1K ETH ($465M) of outflows. On the bright side, ETH ended up green for the day (+6.3%).” Collective Ethereum ETF outflows reached $465 million, the largest single-day redemption since their launch in July 2024. ETH ended the previous weekend up 3.52% at 3,875. However, it lost momentum on Monday, falling over 2% to $3,797. The altcoin experienced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as ETH registered a marginal decline. The price fell to an intraday low of $3,680 on Wednesday. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,800 and settle at $3,811, ultimately rising 0.42%. Sellers reclaimed control on Thursday as ETH fell almost 3% and settled at $3,699. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Friday as ETH plunged almost 6% to $3,488. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell nearly 3%, slipping below $3,400 and settling at $3,393. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $3,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rose over 6% to reclaim $3,700 and settle at $3,721. ETH was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% to $3,613. The current session sees the price marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is back in the red after a strong start to the week as buyers failed to push the altcoin past $170. SOL started the week in bullish territory, rising nearly 5% and settling at $169. However, buyers lost steam on Tuesday as the price fell 0.60% to $164. The current session sees SOL marginally down, trading around $163. SOL started the previous week with a sharp jump to an intraday high of $195. It lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping over 3% to $183. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell almost 1% to $181. SOL dropped to an intraday low of $170 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to settle at $177, ultimately registering a 2.06% decline. The price continued declining on Thursday, dropping over 3% and settling at $172. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as SOL plunged 5.57%, slipping below $170 and settling at $162. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as SOL slipped below $160 and settled at $158. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $160 and settle at $162. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rose nearly 5% and settled at $169. However, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 3% and settling at $164. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $163 as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) fell below $2 on Tuesday, signalling weakness and a potential continuation of its downward trajectory. Despite the recent decline, XRP rose nearly 30% over the past month, with its momentum fueled by institutional interest, whale accumulation, and a regulatory breakthrough with the Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP investors are growing increasingly optimistic ahead of the market regulator’s expected status report on August 15, which could finally end Ripple’s multi-year lawsuit. XRP-related investment products registered over $31 million in inflows. Whale trackers also confirmed large transactions, including a 20 million XRP transfer worth $60 million. Investors are also positive about potential XRP ETF approvals. The SEC is set to rule on several XRP ETF applications on October 17. XRP started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 4% to $3.12. It registered a marginal increase on Tuesday but was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 1.06% and settling at $3.09. Buyers attempted a recovery as the price reached an intraday high of $3.17. However, it could not stay at this level and fell 2.41% to settle at $3.02. Sellers retained control on Friday as XRP dropped over 2%, slipping below $3 and settling at $2.96. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as the price fell almost 7% and settled at $2.76. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, XRP recovered on Sunday, rising 6.61% to end the weekend at $2.95. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose over 4% to reclaim $3 and settle at $3.07. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as XRP dropped 3.58%, slipping below $3 and settling at $3.96. The current session sees XRP marginally down, trading around $2.94. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) registered a sharp drop on Monday (July 28), dropping nearly 6% and settling at $10.40. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell almost 1% to $10.31. UNI encountered volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price fell over 3%, slipping below $10 and settling at $9.99. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as UNI plunged over 6% to $9.35. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment persisted on Friday as the price fell 3.36% to $9.04. Sellers retained control on Saturday as UNI dropped over 3%, slipping below $9 and settling at $8.75. The price recovered on Sunday, rising 4.48% to reclaim $9 and settle at $9.15. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as UNI rallied, rising nearly 9% and settling at $9.95. However, buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as the price fell 3.70% to $9.58. The current session sees UNI marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.

However, Bitcoin has steadily built its case as a modern alternative. In 2025, the comparison between these two assets is not just theoretical — it’s rather a reality unfolding right in front of us. This Bitcoin vs. gold guide compares both assets across technical attributes, price behavior, macro factors, and their long-term investment outlook. After taking office, US President Trump listed five cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) as strategic reserves, which means that the era of encryption has arrived.

The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the remaining charges, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate international sanctions, despite four days of deliberations after the three-week trial. A sentencing date has not yet been set, and it is currently unclear whether prosecutors will elect to re-try Storm on the remaining charges. Prosecutors told the court on Wednesday afternoon that they will confer internally and decide. Storm was arrested in 2023 and charged with helping hackers and other cyber criminals, including North Korea’s famed hacking squad, the Lazarus Group, launder more than $1 billion in dirty money through Tornado Cash, the crypto privacy tool he helped develop. After the jury read the verdict, prosecutors moved for Storm, who is currently out on bail, to be remanded to prison to await sentencing, arguing that “he is from Russia” (Storm was born in Kazakhstan and is a U.S. citizen who has lived in Seattle, Washington for over a decade), “has advised people how to cheat the immigration system” and has the financial means to flee the country, according to reports from Inner City Press. Storm’s lawyers pushed back, arguing that the developer is not a flight risk. Keri Axel, a partner at Waymaker and a lawyer for Storm told District Judge Katherine Polke Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) that Storm surrendered his passport and has deep family ties — including joint custody of a five-year-old daughter in Washington state, where he lives, and extended family in Sacramento, California — to the United States. Failla ultimately sided with Storm’s lawyers, arguing that she did not think Storm was a flight risk since he was only convicted on one charge. “He may appeal, he has every incentive to stay and fight,” Failla said. “He is not a risk of flight, given the size of the bond. There is a lot of fighting left in this case before sentencing, and I think Mr. Storm will stay for it.” Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer at the DeFi Education Fund, said that the organization will continue to support Storm as he fights the conviction on the money transmitting business charge, calling it ""fundamentally flawed charge from the start."" ""It is incredibly disappointing that the jury hung on the other two counts...because they also rest on the inaccurate, dangerous, and limitless pricniple that a software dev can be held responsible for third parties' use of their code. But it is not surprising the jury could not agree on those two counts - the DOJ made a ton of mistakes and they should not retry Roman on those charges,"" Tuminelli said in an X post. ""It is now the Trump DOJ - not the Biden DOJ - who has a decision to make, and they absolutely can and should choose NOT to allow SDNY to pursue this case further."" The verdict in Storm’s case comes just a week after the developers of Samourai Wallet, a Bitcoin-focused privacy tool similar to Tornado Cash, pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The developers, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, changed their initial ‘not guilty’ pleas after reaching a deal with prosecutors that saw the heftier money laundering conspiracy charges dropped.",Policy|Roman storm|Tornado Cash|SDNY|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ASIA|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-06 17:12:09

The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed $115,000 on Tuesday but failed to maintain its upward trajectory, dropping to end the day at $114,135. BTC’s recovery has faced resistance and selling pressure as long-term holders lock in their profits and institutional sentiment cools. Bitcoin ETFs Register Dramatic Selloff Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a dramatic selloff, registering over $333 million in outflows, prompting investors to question the longevity and sustainability of the current bull market. BlackRock’s flagship ETFs, IBIT and ETHA, accounted for 84% of total outflows recorded on August 4. “Blackrock institutional clients net sold yesterday. -$292M -$375M. This is the first significant outflow since February.” As a result, BTC retreated below $112,000, dropping to a low of $111,920 before recovering. Fidelity and Grayscale also reported substantial outflows, losing around $49 million in Bitcoin, according to data from SoSoValue. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, believes the bull market is not over, adding that BTC is experiencing another wave of profit-taking. According to Moreno, this leads to a period of consolidation and correction before the rally’s next leg. Indonesia Exploring Bitcoin Reserve Bitcoin Indonesia has claimed the Indonesian government is exploring the use of Bitcoin (BTC) as a reserve asset. Bitcoin Indonesia representatives met with government officials to discuss how a Bitcoin reserve strategy could drive economic growth. Bitcoin Indonesia stated in a post on X, “We were invited to the Vice President’s office to present how Bitcoin could benefit the country. We explored a bold idea: Using Bitcoin mining as a national reserve strategy. Yes, seriously. [Indonesia] is looking into how Bitcoin could fuel long-term economic strength.” Bitcoin Indonesia stated that the meeting also focused on Bitcoin mining and educational initiatives. Bitcoin Indonesia’s presentation to government officials included how the country can leverage hydroelectric and geothermal resources to boost economic growth, a strategy that has worked in several other countries. The Bitcoin group also presented Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor’s prediction that BTC could reach $13 million by 2045. It also discussed the importance of Bitcoin education initiatives to drive adoption, a view one representative agreed with. Bitcoin Indonesia stated, “Indonesia is waking up to Bitcoin. Adhit from the VP office says, "" Indonesia must also continue to educate about Bitcoin in the future.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $113,950 as buyers attempt to reclaim $115,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in positive territory, registering a 0.69% increase to settle at $115,097. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling to an intraday low of $112,722 before settling at $114,135. BTC is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $115,300. Analysts highlighted two key metrics that indicated a shift in investor sentiment. According to analysts, BTC could pause its upward momentum as long-term holders lock in their profits and adverse market sentiment keeps prices muted, giving sellers an advantage. Bitcoin whales have also started moving their BTC holdings, suggesting that prices have reached a local top. Taker sells volume on futures contracts has also risen. The last time this happened, BTC saw a 6% drop. Options data shows a clear shift in sentiment, with the 30-day skew dropping from +2% to -2%, indicating that investors are paying more to hedge against declines. Institutional interest has also cooled, with $1.2 billion being moved out of spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past two days, adding to the sell pressure. CoinShares believes a trend shift is underway following a hawkish FOMC meeting. Georgii Verbitski, founder of TYMIO, stated, “Sideways trading through August is the most probable scenario before momentum resumes.” Galaxy Digital founder Michael Novogratz added to the adverse market sentiment by warning that the trend of companies being created to accumulate Bitcoin has likely peaked. He added that Bitcoin treasury companies could lock out new entrants by limiting available liquidity. Meanwhile, uncertainty around tariffs and macroeconomic conditions has created a risk-off sentiment, as markets adopt a wait-and-watch approach. Fidelity's director of global macro, Jurrien Timmer, urged investors to exercise caution, highlighting weak market breadth, with gains concentrated in a few stocks. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.31% to $119,398. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. The price encountered volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $117,925. BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,722 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. It rebounded to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,783, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Thursday as BTC fell almost 2% and settled at $115,800. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC fell over 2% and settled at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67%, dropping below $113,000 and settling at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,311. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.69% to $115,067. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,722 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,135, ultimately registering a 0.84% drop. The current session sees the price up almost 1%, trading around $115,235 as buyers look to push the price above a key resistance level.

This marks a significant milestone in the country’s regulated crypto landscape. At the same time, this move strengthens Ripple’s presence in Asia and supports the growing demand for secure, legal access to tokenised assets. XRP Custody Goes Live on BDACS In a recent X post , the regulated digital asset custody provider shared that XRP is now fully supported on its custody platform. This update means institutional investors in South Korea can now store and manage XRP securely, in line with local regulations. In addition, XRP can now be used across the country’s major exchanges like Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, through the BDACS platform. This makes it easier for institutions to enter and operate within the crypto market legally. This latest rollout builds on BDACS’s earlier partnership with Ripple Labs . This collaboration was formed to support the XRP Ledger ecosystem and help align with South Korea’s long-term crypto regulatory plans. BDACS aims to attract more institutions to explore real-world use cases for tokenised assets on the XRP Ledger. To support this, the company has already integrated with major trading platforms and has joined Busan’s innovation sandbox for blockchain development. The firm is also connected with other major blockchain networks like Avalanche and Polymesh. XRP’s Growing Role in Korean Markets XRP is becoming more popular in South Korea’s crypto market. It is now the most traded digital coin on Upbit , the country’s biggest exchange. This shows that more people trust Ripple’s technology. It also supports BDACS’s plan to help more institutions use XRP. Ripple itself expects the global crypto custody market to exceed $16 trillion by 2030. BDACS’s new XRP custody solution may help speed up this growth by providing secure and compliant access to XRP for institutions. Recent data shows that over 25% of South Koreans between the ages of 20 and 50 own digital assets, with those in their 40s leading the way. Interestingly, 42% of people in a survey said they would invest more in crypto if banks offered these services. BDACS and Ripple are now meeting this need. Their XRP custody service gives institutions a safe, trusted way to enter the crypto market. Ripple’s Expansion Across Asia Ripple is investing heavily in Asia, with South Korea playing a central role in its regional strategy . In Japan, Ripple’s local partner, SBI Holdings, is working to add RLUSD to its SBI VC Trade platform. This move shows Ripple’s effort to partner with major financial firms to grow the use of digital assets. Ripple has also committed over $5 million to academic and technical blockchain research through its University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI). This funding is used to support institutions across South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.

There May Be a Danger That Is Not Being Discussed Much,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-donald-trumps-tariffs-affect-bitcoin-there-may-be-a-danger-that-is-not-being-discussed-much/,"New tariffs implemented by US President Donald Trump are shaking up the Bitcoin mining industry within the country. Ethan Vera, Chief Operating Officer of US-based mining services company Luxor Technology, warned that the White House's heavier tariffs on ASIC devices imported from Southeast Asia could slow growth in the sector. Following the expiration of the 90-day tariff pause announced by Trump in April for “Liberation Day,” the White House implemented new tariffs on ASIC devices from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, effective July 31st. The tariffs, which took effect on August 7th, impose a total tariff of up to 21.6% on mining devices imported from these countries. The 57.6% tariff on China has been held steady for now. According to Vera, these new rates make the US an unattractive market for mining equipment: “With tariffs of 21.6%, the US is now among the most uncompetitive countries for device imports. Our customers are shifting equipment purchases to countries with more favorable tariffs, such as Canada.” Related News: Reactions Grow to SEC's Statement Concerning Many Altcoins! Former SEC Chairman Gensler's Chief Advisor Likens It to the Biggest Crash, Warns Furthermore, companies already holding used ASIC stocks in the US are believed to be at an advantage in this environment. As local demand for used equipment increases, prices are expected to appreciate by over 20%. Meanwhile, Leo Lu, CEO of Singapore-based publicly traded Bitcoin mining company BitFuFu, argues that despite tariff pressures, US miners can remain competitive thanks to low energy costs and access to renewable resources. BitFuFu continues to expand its operations through partnerships in states like Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado. Ethan Vera believes Trump's tariffs will impact not only the US but also the global distribution of hash power. Countries with lower import costs, such as Russia, could become new destinations for Chinese capital and mining equipment. Additionally, countries like Canada, Northern Europe, Ethiopia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay are emerging as alternative hubs for investors. *This is not investment advice.

Fundamentals are warming for a move as the macro backdrop is starting to shift in favor of risk assets like altcoins . Speculators now expect up to three rate cuts before year-end, starting as soon as September. FED CAN NOW DO 3 RATE CUTS BY THE END OF 2025. MORE LIQUIDITY = ALTSEASON pic.twitter.com/0Q8uwjjkrb — Max (@MaxCryptoxx) August 5, 2025 Lower borrowing costs could stimulate new inflows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies, reviving altcoin season sentiment. And Solana stands as a prime beneficiary with the approaching October 10 deadline for a potential spot SOL ETF, which could open the gates to previously untapped TradFi demand. Solana Price Analysis: Does the SOL Bull Run Hinge on $297? Solana could be on track to fulfill the $297 breakout target set by a previous falling wedge, as it now nears the breakout of a 4-month ascending channel. SOL / USDT 4-hour chart, ascending channel aids falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. This 4-month consolidation phase has allowed the wedge pattern to gradually play out—and with market sentiment warming, its full upside potential may finally come into view. With a potential double bottom reversal pattern forming around $157, Solana could reverse to retest resistance at $207, the level that capped its most recent bull run. This comes as momentum indicators still reflect weakness. The RSI hovers just below the neutral line, suggesting sellers maintain short-term control. More so, the MACD teeters on a death cross, with the line moving in close parallel to the signal, pointing to a fragile uptrend. A second bounce off $157 could provide the strength needed to flip the outlook fully bullish. Crucially, $207 marks the final threshold to a breakout of the ascending channel, opening the door for a retest of the $297 resistance. If flipped to support, this level becomes a launchpad for Solana to enter price discovery. With interest rate cuts and a spot ETF approval likely to boost demand going into the final quarter of the year, a 205% rally to $500 could be in play. The Solana Ecosystem Holds Higher Gain Opportunities When it comes to large-cap coins like SOL, gains tend to move slowly. Explosive breakouts can take months to develop, only to play out in a matter of days. That means holders spend most of their time waiting. Meanwhile, the low-cap meme coins in its ecosystem, like TROLL , are posting 2x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in.

This rapid increase is indicative of the first decentralized finance (DeFi) boom, where overall value locked in DeFi projects skyrocketed from $1 billion to $100 billion from 2020 to 2021. Demand for Tokenized Equities Explodes Blockchain wallet addresses holding tokenized stocks grew to over 90,000 in July from 1,600 in June. The growth indicates growing interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a sector ranked among the most promising ones for blockchain finance. Tokenized stocks, unlike traditional shares, can be traded 24/7, transferred at will, and in some cases, exchanged for free, like on Kraken. $1.3 Trillion Opportunity Ahead If merely 1% of world equities go onchain, tokenized shares may have a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion—a full eight times the size of DeFi when it reached its peak. Binance Research contends that this level of adoption would drive further development of more advanced DeFi infrastructure, generating a cycle of innovation and growth. Over 60 tokenized stocks are currently traded on the likes of Kraken, Bybit, and Solana-based Backed Finance’s xStocks, including Amazon, Tesla, and Apple. Beyond ‘Wall Street on Blockchain’ While the nascent phase of tokenization is still focused on replicating traditional assets, it is the industry leaders who claim that the ultimate goal is something more profound in nature. “Tokenized equities cannot be ‘Wall Street on a blockchain.’ That’s the wrong idea,” says Mark Greenberg, who is the global head of Kraken’s Consumer Business Unit. He imagines an ecosystem that is like the internet—always on, ubiquitously available, and user-driven. Tokenization, if it works, can reshape global financial access and rethink how investors interact with equities in the digital economy.",Blockchain|Sticky,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-06 17:18:49

Bitcoin's legitimacy is rising, with its market cap surpassing $2.2 trillion and institutional adoption growing, supporting long-term growth potential. YBTC's high distribution helps manage Bitcoin's volatility, enabling investors to build cash reserves for reinvestment and flexible portfolio strategies. I rate YBTC a hold with a buy bias, as high distributions may cap price performance and total returns could remain volatile in the short term. I have been looking to find income alternatives to invest in the crypto asset class this year because the crypto market has grown to over $2 trillion. A market of such size should be able to offer attractive investment opportunities for income. Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) shows as an effective approach to retrieve the income distribution due to its weekly schedule, which may offer a protection mechanism for cash-in in the volatile bitcoin market. In addition, the over 50% distribution rate allows investors to build a cash reserve quickly for reinvesting purposes. This flexibility is very important in the market where new Bitcoin ETFs or stocks may emerge and offer better investment opportunities. YBTC is a hold at the current level and can be considered by income-oriented investors who want to establish some crypto exposure. ETF Overview YBTC is a Bitcoin covered call ETF actively managed by Roundhill, which claims it is the first of its kind listed. The ETF was started on 01/17/2024 and has grown to an AUM of over $250 million. It is a very reasonable-sized ETF with such a short history. YBTC's underlying is called exchange-traded products (“ETPs”). The covered call options are written and sold on Bitcoin Futures ETFs or Bitcoin ETPs to generate income distributed on a weekly schedule. Thanks to the high volatility of Bitcoin, YBTC is offering a Distribution Rate of 55.79%. YBTC ETF Holdings (Roundhill) From the holdings list above, one can see that the main components are around the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (CBTX). The synthetic positions are established on both ETFs, which are the underlyings. The call options are sold (marked short positions above) for credit as income. FGXXX is the government (treasury) fund that serves as the collateral for the short put options. YBTC's expense ratio is 0.99%, which is typical for an actively managed ETF based on the complex option strategy. The following is the relevant peer group compiled using the data from Seeking Alpha. Bitcoin Income ETFs (SA) One can see in the list that YBTC has the lowest expense ratio and the highest AUM. The trading volume is over 100K, which offers reasonable liquidity. Digit Gold is Getting the Market Vote Bitcoin as an investment asset came to my attention because of Warren Buffett. He has expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for years. For example, in 2018, he commented in an appearance on CNBC that bitcoin is a ""mirage"", indicating its super speculative nature. Admittedly, I have been hesitant to take a serious look at Bitcoin. Fast forward to 2025, the total bitcoin market has reached the staggering $2.2 trillion , which is as large as the gold market. It is fair to say that the market is starting to buy the digital gold story for Bitcoin. On the other hand, the institutions have 6% allocation. I don't view Bitcoin as something speculative right now. I would like to explore it as a very interesting investment alternative in this huge marketplace. As far as value is concerned, I view Bitcoins as a collection of old stamps or an oil painting. Scarcity is the main property and value anchor for Bitcoin. I will probably let the economists and financial experts figure out whatever values they may come up with in their fields. I used to trade stamps, and I see similar market mechanisms with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The rare ones could be golden, while many with abundant quantities may be just worth pennies, such as the stamp's face value. Market price is determined by supply and demand, with the supply side fixed for bitcoin. Bitcoin has a finite supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins. In other words, the price of bitcoin would have one way to go if the demand holds up. Secular Growth is the story Many believe that the Bitcoin market can grow to $20 trillion in 5 years. This is going to be a significant rate to grow from today's $2.2 trillion. As indicated in the same reference above, there are globally 200 million Bitcoin accounts (wallets) with about 100 million owners at the moment. So it is not difficult to forecast that the user population may go 10 times as large in the future. The newly passed GENIUS ACT is perhaps the most convincing reason why cryptocurrencies are becoming ""officially"" the real thing, backed by the US federal regulating framework, aiming to enhance market stability and protect investors. From a market perspective, the growth potential is increasingly reflected in the market. There are 63 Digital Assets ETFs according to Seeking Alpha's class sorting . Some Bitcoin ETFs have grown to ten billion in AUM. The following is a list of some of the largest Bitcoin ETFs. Notice Strategy ( MSTR ), viewed as a bitcoin proxy, has a market cap exceeding $112 billion. Bitcoin ETFS with billions in AUM (SA) These bitcoin ETFs are expected to grow in size in the next few years, together with the bitcoin market, which could have much bigger space to grow, as indicated earlier. However, the growth pace may vary, and the path may not be a straight line. Show Me the Money, an Income Train is More Important Unlike the old paintings or old stamps, which are typically just for store value, I feel more comfortable investing in Bitcoin when I can see real income streams. Thanks to the equity market, a few income-focused ETFs have been created to generate income while tracking bitcoin itself. These became my main areas of investment quickly. The weekly distribution for YBTC seems to fit my investment strategy for Bitcoin or digital currencies based on the following considerations: Build a cash reserve very quickly and be ready for deployment and/or reinvestment. Bitcoin is very volatile. I need to monitor it carefully; the high distribution is a way to manage the volatility. It is much safer and easier to reinvest in Bitcoin (asset) based on a more friendly backdrop and supportive market conditions. There are other ETFs designed for different purposes, e.g., ultra-leveraged in both bear and bullish sentiments. So I can opt to use the cash raised from the weekly distribution to seek outsized capital gain during a bullish trend; conversely, I can hedge positions while the trend turns bearish. This may prove to be important, as the growth path of Bitcoin may be bumpy, as mentioned earlier. I plan to establish an initial position with YBTC and gradually build my bitcoin exposure, as the growth projection may become more convincing over time. The high-income distribution of YBTC is a kind of strategic element in my investment portfolio. Risk Analysis The Bitcoin market is very volatile, as measured by the 30-day IV level of 34.7 for IBIT, which is one of the key underlyings for YBTC. So YBTC is also more volatile than many option ETFs with equity exposures, such as the S&P 500 Index. YBTC may suffer worse impacts from the capped gain or NAV loss for the V-shape bounce in the price move. There is also a fair amount of skepticism about the future of Bitcoin, which is the main cause for its high volatility. Interested investors should keep monitoring the market carefully and choose reasonable entry points, which could potentially make a significant difference in total returns. Bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, and/or new ones in the future as the cryptocurrencies continue to evolve. The bitcoin market and its growth trajectory could be affected or even altered. These factors could impact the total returns for YBTC. Closing Thoughts Bitcoin is becoming a more legitimate investment tool as its market size surpasses $2.2 trillion. There is a good probability that the market could grow much bigger in the future. The high volatility may still be a holding factor for many investors. Investors can consider the bitcoin option income ETFs like YBTC as an investing alternative. With a weekly high-income distribution, investors could raise cash quickly and build bitcoin positions gradually. I rate YBTC a hold with a buy bias. The hold reflects the impacts of high distribution at 50%, which may affect the price performance to a large degree, and accordingly, the total return could be volatile in the short-term frame.",IBIT|YBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-06 17:19:03

By rewarding every post, comment, and share with on‑chain SOCS tokens, the platform turns content into capital. Ripple (XRP) and Avalanche (AVAX) veterans are now diversifying into social incentives, betting that DeSoc’s unique rewards and governance model will outpace pure utility tokens. DeSoc’s Social‑DeFi Model Is Winning Hearts DeSoc has already secured $10 million in funding by solving real problems that affect billions of users daily. The new project takes a fundamentally different approach by targeting the $100 billion social media market with technology that delivers immediate utility rather than theoretical improvements to existing blockchain architecture. The platform’s content syndication eliminates the platform fragmentation that forces creators to choose between maintaining existing audiences and embracing Web3 innovation. DeSoc bridges this gap by enabling simultaneous content publication across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and its platform through revolutionary API integration. While AVAX developers build complex DeFi protocols for crypto enthusiasts, and XRP pursues institutional partnerships that may take years to materialize, DeSoc delivers value that billions of users can access today. Beyond this, DeSoc creates authentic token demand through multiple revenue streams that activate with every user interaction. Content creators earn $SOCS tokens through quality-based rewards, community tipping, exclusive access monetization, and advertising partnerships. Another feature that struck a chord with savvy investors is its transparent blockchain governance. Ripple’s Holders Weigh In With Whale‑Backed Breakouts XRP is currently trading at $3.24, and it has experienced a 2.3% decline in the last 7 days with 24 24-hour trading volume of $17.08 billion. This intraday swing reflects continued interest among payment token investors. A high-profile whale accumulation pushed XRP down on July 22, then it boosted it back up in rapid succession, fueling speculation of a potential surge toward $10 in 2025. Despite brief pullbacks, on-chain data show that large wallets are steadily increasing their XRP holdings, underscoring confidence in Ripple’s cross-border payment ambitions. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs recently expanded its On‑Demand Liquidity service to new corridors in Asia, bringing real‑world usage that could underpin further price gains. They are looking to tap the almost $2 billion a year remittance market between Japan and the Philippines through the use of their on-demand liquidity (ODL) service. Avalanche Upgrades Drive Fresh Investor Interest AVAX’s price dipped slightly to $23.35 in the last 24 hours but still achieved a 28% climb over the past month, outpacing broader crypto markets. That surge followed the activation of Avalanche’s “ Blizzard” upgrade , which improved consensus efficiency and reduced block times by 15%. It is a $200 million fund established by the Avalanche Foundation to accelerate development, growth, and innovation within the Avalanche ecosystem. Futures’ OI in Avalanche at exchanges rose from $667.08 million on Saturday to $796.35 million on Tuesday, a new all-time high, according to data from CoinGlass. An increasing OI represents new or additional money entering the market and new buying, which could fuel the current AVAX price rally. Avalanche’s developer ecosystem also expanded this week with two new DeFi protocols launching on the C‑Chain. These additions boost TVL above $1 billion and underscore AVAX’s growing appeal as a smart‑contract hub. For AVAX users, DeSoc offers a fresh avenue to apply their on‑chain earnings toward community and content incentives. DeSoc Hype Shows Social Tokens Can Rival Utility Networks DeSoc’s swift presale uptake illustrates a growing appetite for social‑DeFi mechanics. Unlike XRP’s payment focus or AVAX’s throughput upgrades, SOCS rewards transform every interaction into a stake in the protocol’s success. Creators earn directly, and token‑gated experiences foster tighter communities. Ripple and Avalanche holders jumping onboard validate DeSoc’s promise: a network where engagement, governance, and monetization intertwine. As DeSoc’s testnet launch approaches, early participants will see whether social tokens can match or even exceed the returns of traditional utility assets. Watching how DeSoc balances user incentives with robust tokenomics will reveal whether social-DeFi can cement its place alongside payment and smart-contract champions in 2025.

The analyst noted that these firms are attracting attention not just for their holdings but also for their financial structure, which is starting to become attractive for investors. “The NAV multiples (market cap divided by value of ETH held) have now also started to normalise for the ETH treasury companies,” said Kendrick, adding that this dynamic is making the ""treasury companies now very investable for investors seeking access to ETH price appreciation."" Buying ETH for the balance sheet, following Michael Saylor's bitcoin (BTC) buying strategy, has taken off recently. Many publicly traded firms have jumped on board and seen their share prices surge initially, boosting their market cap and NAV multiples. Now, their NAV multiples are coming down from their initial peak. Some of the top companies enjoying this market euphoria include BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Among these companies, Kendrick highlighted SharpLink Gaming's (SBET) NAV multiple, which at its peak was around 2.50 and is now coming down to a more normalized level of near 1.0. This means its market cap is only slightly higher than the value of its ETH holdings. To be sure, the analyst said that he doesn't see any reason for the NAV to go below 1.0, as these treasury firms provide investors with ""regulatory arbitrage opportunities."" Kendrick also highlighted that these treasury companies have bought just as much ETH as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since June. Both groups now hold around 1.6% of the total circulating ETH supply — just under 2,000 ETH — over that time period, adding to his call that both the treasury stocks and ETF holders now provide similar exposure to ETH, all else being equal. The combination of these two factors is now adding to his thesis that ETH treasury plays are a better buying opportunities than ETFs. ""Given NAV multiples are currently just above 1 I see the ETH treasury companies as a better asset to buy than the US spot ETH ETFs,"" he said. Standard Chartered is maintaining its year-end price target of $4,000 for ether. ETH is currently trading at $3,652, up 2% over the past 24 hours.

Roman Storm guilty on unlicensed money transmitter charges, a verdict that sends ripples across the industry. As a co-founder of Tornado Cash, this development marks a pivotal moment for digital asset privacy and regulation. Crypto in America podcast host Eleanor Terrett shared this breaking update via X, confirming the jury’s decision. While the verdict found Storm guilty on one key charge, he was found not guilty on sanctions evasion. Furthermore, the jury reached a hung outcome regarding money laundering charges. This mixed result underscores the complexities of applying traditional financial laws to decentralized blockchain technologies. Understanding these nuances is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Understanding the Roman Storm Guilty Verdict The core of the recent legal proceedings centered on whether Roman Storm operated an unlicensed money transmitter . In simple terms, a money transmitter is any business that moves money on behalf of others. This typically requires a license to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The prosecution argued that Tornado Cash, by facilitating the mixing of cryptocurrencies, acted as an unlicensed money transmitter. This verdict suggests that the court views decentralized protocols, even those without a central controlling entity, as potentially falling under existing financial regulations. It’s a significant interpretation that could influence future enforcement actions against similar platforms. The jury’s decisions were specific: Guilty: Unlicensed money transmission. Not Guilty: Sanctions evasion. Hung Jury: Money laundering. This outcome highlights the challenges prosecutors face in proving intent and direct involvement in illicit activities when dealing with open-source, decentralized tools. However, the conviction on the money transmitter charge is a clear signal. What Does This Mean for Tornado Cash and Blockchain Privacy? The implications of the Roman Storm guilty verdict extend far beyond an individual. For the Tornado Cash founder and the protocol itself, this ruling creates a precedent. Tornado Cash was designed to enhance blockchain privacy by breaking the on-chain link between sender and receiver addresses. Many users valued this feature for legitimate privacy reasons, such as protecting financial anonymity from prying eyes or preventing doxxing. However, authorities have consistently argued that such tools are exploited by criminals for illicit purposes. This legal battle represents a clash between the ethos of decentralized privacy and the imperative of financial oversight. The verdict will likely intensify scrutiny on other privacy-enhancing protocols and decentralized finance (DeFi) services that offer similar functionalities. Users who rely on these tools for legitimate privacy may now face increased uncertainty. The ruling could push developers to reconsider how they design and deploy privacy solutions, potentially incorporating more compliance-friendly features, or risk similar legal challenges. Navigating Unlicensed Money Transmitter Regulations in Crypto This crypto legal case emphasizes the growing tension between innovation and regulation in the digital asset space. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps) that often operate without traditional intermediaries. The classification of certain crypto activities as an unlicensed money transmitter is a recurring theme in regulatory discussions. This case serves as a stark reminder that even if a service is decentralized, its developers or key contributors can still be held liable under existing financial laws. Projects must proactively seek legal counsel to understand their regulatory obligations, especially if their services facilitate value transfer. The industry needs clearer guidelines from regulators. Without them, developers and users operate in a gray area, making it difficult to innovate responsibly while ensuring compliance. This verdict is a call for greater dialogue between policymakers and the crypto community to foster an environment that supports both innovation and financial integrity. The Future of Crypto Legal Cases and Blockchain Privacy The conviction of the Tornado Cash founder sets a significant precedent for future crypto legal case scenarios. It signals that simply being decentralized or open-source may not provide a shield from legal accountability, particularly concerning financial regulations. This could lead to more aggressive enforcement actions against other mixers, DeFi protocols, and even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that facilitate financial transactions. For the pursuit of blockchain privacy , this verdict poses a considerable challenge. While privacy is a fundamental right, its application in the transparent world of public blockchains often clashes with regulatory demands for traceability. The crypto community must now consider how to develop privacy solutions that can coexist with regulatory frameworks, perhaps through ZK-proofs or other technologies that offer privacy without enabling illicit activity. Ultimately, this case underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto law. The industry must adapt by prioritizing robust legal compliance alongside technological innovation. Developers, investors, and users alike need to stay informed about these developments, as they will undoubtedly shape the future landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation The Roman Storm guilty verdict on unlicensed money transmitter charges marks a defining moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the serious implications of operating decentralized services without clear regulatory compliance, particularly for those involved in facilitating financial transactions. While the fight for blockchain privacy continues, this outcome emphasizes the need for responsible innovation and proactive engagement with legal frameworks. The crypto community must learn from this landmark case, striving for a future where technological advancement and regulatory clarity can coexist.

49648959,549941,1754501260,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49648959.jpeg,"Mixed Verdict For Tornado Cash Founder: Guilty On One Charge, Not Guilty On Another",https://bitcoinist.com/mixed-verdict-for-tornado-cash-founder/,"A US jury has reached a deadlock on key charges against Roman Storm, the founder of Tornado Cash on Wednesday. The jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision regarding allegations of money laundering and sanctions evasion, which stem from charges filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) two years ago. However, the Jury did find the cryptocurrency mixer’s founder guilty of a lesser charge: conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Jury Deadlocks On Key Charges Against Tornado Cash Founder As reported by Inner City Press on social media, the jury found Storm guilty on only one of three counts, leaving the more serious allegations of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate North Korean sanctions unresolved. The charges against Storm, along with his co-founder Roman Semenov, revolve around the operation of Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer that has been implicated in laundering over $1 billion in criminal proceeds. US authorities allege that the service facilitated untraceable financial transactions, allowing hackers—some of whom were allegedly backed by the North Korean government—to conceal the illicit origins of their funds. The DOJ’s indictment emphasized that while Storm and Semenov presented Tornado Cash as a sophisticated privacy service, they “knowingly” aided criminals in their efforts to disguise the fruits of their illegal activities. Accused of Skipping KYC And AML Regulations The indictment also pointed out that the founders of Tornado Cash intentionally bypassed essential regulations, such as implementing “know your customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) programs. The Department of Justice alleged that this decision not only contravened existing laws but also contributed to money laundering operations that the service enabled. As the jury’s mixed verdict indicates, the intersection of cryptocurrency and law enforcement remains a contentious issue, with regulators grappling to strike a balance between fostering innovation and preventing illicit activity.

Ripple partners with BDACS to support RLUSD Ripple partnered with BDACS on February 26 with plans to support RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed Stablecoin. The collaboration aimed to advance tokenization, support developers building on the XRP Ledger, and expand Stablecoin use cases within Busan’s blockchain regulation-free zone. XRP is now live on BDACS! We’re thrilled to offer custody support for #XRP , one of the most popular digital assets in #Korea , to our institutional clients. This launch strengthens our long-standing partnership with #Ripple and underscores our commitment to the Korean market.… pic.twitter.com/j8IKSBr7W7 — BDACS (@BDACSKorea) August 5, 2025 Ripple custody, now live on BDACS, allows regulated institutions to store and manage crypto assets securely. Ripple’s custody infrastructure has multi-signature wallets and transaction controls designed to be secure and compliant according to the standards of the custodians and financial institutions. The collaboration came about after Ripple noted in February that the crypto custody market projections could reach up to $16 trillion by 2030. Ripple added that approximately 10% of the global GDP will potentially represent tokenized assets. Fiona Murray, Asia-Pacific managing director, and Harry Ryoo, BDACS CEO, stressed the importance of collaboration as a key driver in boosting the digital asset ecosystem in South Korea. Murray said the collaboration came amid rising market activity and evolving regulatory conditions in South Korea. Ryoo revealed that BDACS aimed to provide secure and compliant custody services to support Ripple’s blockchain ambitions. XRP is the native token of XRP Ledger, a layer one blockchain technology that offers low-cost and scalable transfers for tokenized and digital assets. XRP is trading at $2.95, a 0.35% drop over the past 24 hours. The asset’s YTD has declined 2.55%, reflecting a negative economic landscape for the platform. Angne Linge, Head of Growth at WEFI, a decentralized on-chain bank, noted that XRP has gained influence in Asia, and Japanese banks have shown interest in its adoption. According to Linge, approximately 80% of the firms are ready to adopt XRP as a global payment platform. Crypto holdings spike in South Korea Hana Institute of Finance report showed that one in four citizens in South Korea aged between 20 and 50 hold crypto 14% in personal wallets. The report highlighted that citizens in their 40s had the most individual participation in crypto holding. The report also indicated that 70% intended to increase their crypto awareness. Ripple has maintained multiple partnerships globally. In February, the blockchain-based digital payment firm collaborated with Revolut and Zero Hash to advance RLUSD adoption. It also partnered with Portugal’s Unicambio to allow payments to Brazil. It also partnered with Chainlink recently to enable RLUSD to offer on the Ethereum-based DeFi protocols. David Shwartz, Ripple CTO, defended Ripple’s decentralized nature as debates continue to spark on whether Ripple XRP should be included in the U.S. cryptocurrency reserve. Ripple has also enhanced its Ledger with improved compliance functions and lending capabilities. The feature allows issuers to reclaim assets linked to fraudulent activities and decentralized identity tools that will improve user verification processes. The growing interest in crypto assets has also prompted South Korean financial institutions such as Kakao Bank, Kookmin Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Korea to file for Korean Won Stablecoin trademarks, showing a potential shift in the country’s financial ecosystem.

This unprecedented agreement, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for a mere $1 per year, is more than just a discount; it’s a strategic maneuver set to accelerate federal AI adoption and potentially redefine the competitive dynamics among AI giants. OpenAI’s Groundbreaking Government AI Deal: A Game Changer? The news that OpenAI has struck an agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to offer its premier AI tool, ChatGPT Enterprise, at an astonishingly low price of $1 per agency for the next year has sent ripples across the tech world. This bold move positions OpenAI to significantly undercut competitors like Anthropic and Google in the race to integrate AI tools into federal agency workflows. The partnership follows closely on the heels of the GSA adding OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its list of approved AI vendors. These companies will now offer their services via the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS), a federal contracting platform that simplifies access to AI tools for government agencies through pre-negotiated contracts, eliminating the need for individual vendor negotiations. While the generosity of OpenAI’s offer is evident, it remains unclear whether other AI firms will follow suit with similarly discounted rates. However, GSA Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum has openly encouraged “other American AI technology companies to follow OpenAI’s lead and work with us.” Beyond the nominal fee, OpenAI is sweetening the deal by offering unlimited use of advanced models for an additional 60 days. Federal employees will also gain access to a dedicated government user community and tailored introductory training resources, designed to help them quickly become proficient with OpenAI’s powerful tools. Why is ChatGPT Enterprise the Preferred Choice for Federal Agencies? The selection of ChatGPT Enterprise by the GSA for such a pivotal role underscores its robust capabilities and the trust placed in OpenAI’s technology. For federal agencies, the Enterprise version offers enhanced security, scalability, and performance features crucial for handling sensitive government operations. Its advanced models promise to streamline various administrative tasks, improve data analysis, and foster greater efficiency across departments. The integration through the MAS platform means agencies can bypass lengthy procurement processes, rapidly deploying cutting-edge AI. This streamlined access is a significant benefit, allowing the government to quickly leverage AI for public service, research, and national security applications. The provision of dedicated training and a user community further ensures that federal employees can maximize the utility of these tools, fostering a more AI-literate workforce within the government. Navigating AI Data Security Concerns in Government For government agencies, data security is not just a priority; it is a paramount concern. The prospect of sensitive information being exposed or inadvertently used in model training sets is a major hurdle for widespread AI adoption. Bitcoin World has actively sought details from the GSA regarding the safeguards in place to protect government data, including inquiries about the use of on-premises or private cloud deployments to enhance security measures. A GSA spokesperson affirmed the government’s commitment, stating, “The government is taking a cautious, security‑first approach to AI. This ensures sensitive information remains protected while enabling agencies to benefit from AI‑driven efficiencies.” This statement highlights the delicate balance between leveraging AI’s benefits and maintaining stringent data protection protocols. The specifics of how OpenAI plans to ensure the complete isolation and security of federal data will be critical in building long-term trust and expanding the scope of AI Data Security within government operations. The Impact on Federal AI Adoption and Market Competition This OpenAI Government Deal is poised to dramatically accelerate federal AI adoption . By offering such an accessible entry point, OpenAI is not only securing a significant foothold in the government sector but also setting a new benchmark for competitive pricing. This aggressive strategy could compel other AI developers to reconsider their pricing models for government contracts, potentially leading to a more competitive market benefiting federal agencies. The timing of this agreement is also noteworthy, coming just weeks after the Trump administration published its AI Action Plan, which aims to boost data center buildouts and integrate more AI tools into government. Furthermore, it follows a Trump executive order that bans “woke AI” and AI models that are not “ideologically neutral” from government contracts. OpenAI’s approach to these policy directives, particularly the “ideologically neutral” requirement, will be closely watched as it navigates its new role as a key government AI provider. This deal underscores a clear intent to embed advanced AI capabilities deeply within the fabric of federal operations, signaling a future where AI-driven efficiencies are standard rather than exceptional. GSA AI Contracts: Paving the Way for Future Partnerships The role of the GSA, particularly through its Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) platform, is pivotal in facilitating this rapid integration of AI. The MAS streamlines the procurement process, allowing federal agencies to access pre-negotiated contracts with approved vendors. This mechanism reduces bureaucratic hurdles and accelerates the deployment of essential technologies like AI. The GSA’s encouragement for other American AI companies to engage similarly suggests a proactive strategy to diversify its AI portfolio and foster innovation across the sector. These GSA AI Contracts represent a significant step towards modernizing government infrastructure. By establishing clear pathways for AI procurement, the GSA is not only enabling immediate access to tools like ChatGPT Enterprise but also laying the groundwork for future, broader partnerships between the government and the burgeoning AI industry. This framework ensures that federal agencies can stay at the forefront of technological advancement, leveraging AI to better serve the public and enhance national capabilities. A Transformative Era for Government AI OpenAI’s strategic $1 deal with the GSA marks a significant milestone in the integration of artificial intelligence into government operations. This unprecedented move is set to dramatically accelerate federal AI adoption, offering a powerful tool like ChatGPT Enterprise at an almost symbolic cost. While the benefits of enhanced efficiency and access to advanced models are clear, critical discussions around AI Data Security and competitive fairness will undoubtedly continue. This partnership not only cements OpenAI’s position as a key player in the public sector but also sets a compelling precedent for how technology companies might engage with government entities in the future. As AI continues to evolve, its secure and effective deployment within federal agencies will be crucial for national progress and innovation.

One way to increase the chances of hitting these gems is by looking into promising crypto presale projects. These projects could be the next big thing in the market with improving macroeconomic signals, including the progress on the bipartisan GENIUS stablecoin bill. Keeping that in mind, we’ve listed the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. DeSoc ($SOCS): The New Presale Star with 100x Potential The best crypto presale to buy right now is DeSoc ($SOCS) , which is gaining mainstream attention as a decentralized solution to online media. The presale has been an enormous success, raising over $10 million. However, the presale ends on the 12th stage, meaning there is only a limited chance to buy at a fixed price before the token launches on exchanges, with many predicting significant gains. Here is why analysts believe DeSoc can achieve 100x; Massive presale traction with $10 million raised from nearly 70 % of tokens sold under a $200 million FDV. Unlike other hype projects in the crypto space, DeSoc relies predominantly on providing real-world solutions. Structured roadmap that includes marketing campaigns to amplify its reach and demand. Deflationary tokenomics with only 45% of the total supply (1,350,000 coins) available in its ICO phase. Versatile cross-platform integrations with other social media outlets to ensure rapid adoption. A certified audit from BlockAudits to prove its smart contract is free from vulnerabilities. The DeSoc utility token is at the center of all the platform operations, which means it will be used for content monetization and rewards programs. That’s because the DeSoc platform is not just about being an alternative to existing social media platforms. With DeSoc, the internet community can unlock exclusive content access. Now, consider Alberto, a football pundit on X. Using the DeSoc platform allows Alberto to earn money, motivating him to produce rich content for his audience. He can lock some of his posts behind a paywall, accessible only to users with a specific number of tokens. Additionally, DeSoc plans to foster a partnership with major social media platforms for targeted advertising campaigns. In this system, users can utilize the $SOCS tokens when purchasing advertisement space or boosting their posts on popular social media platforms to increase visibility and engagement. Nexchain (NEX): AI Speed Gem with Notable Innovation Nexchain is a new crypto that directly integrates artificial intelligence into an existing Layer 1 blockchain infrastructure. This unique tech allows the token to optimize scalability, security, and interoperability across multiple industries. It processes up to 400,000 transactions per second with fees as low as $0.001. So far, Nexchain has raised $6.4 million in USDT, underscoring strong investor confidence. Each presale stage increases the token price slightly, rewarding early participants while maintaining a steady, transparent path to the listing. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): The AI Protocol with Real Infrastructure The third project in this trio of top crypto presales is Lightchain, a next-generation AI solution that takes innovation to an entirely new level. At its core is a fully functional AI Virtual Machine and a novel Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, where nodes get rewarded for running real AI operations like model training and inference. That means the system doesn’t just secure itself, it gets smarter as it grows. The project has already raised $21.8 million, and the current bonus round gives latecomers one more shot at its presale price of $0.007125 Conclusion In a market marked by unbridled volatility and uncertainty, DeSoc, Nexchain, and Lightchain AI rank high for their genuine value, technical innovation, and investor momentum. DeSoc, in particular, provides real-world solutions by curing the maximum inefficiency in the social media space with its decentralized network. As the availability of this window of opportunity is ticking away, the smart thing might be to act now before it is too late. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Solana’s Seeker Phone Fixes Saga’s Flaws With Usability Upgrade Base Says Sequencer Failure Caused Block Production Halt of 33 Minutes Solana's Jito Proposes Routing 100% of Block Engine Fees to DAO Treasury Cardano Community Approves $70M Core Dev Budget, Boosting ADA Prospects Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network news SOLANA SEEKER PHONE BEGINS SHIPPING: The Solana Seeker phone is not your average smartphone, nor does it want to be. Building on the lessons of its predecessor, the Saga, Solana Mobile’s newest device reimagines what a crypto-native phone can be. Smaller, lighter and boasting a longer-lasting battery than its predecessor, the Seeker aims to improve on the user experience while doubling down on mobile-first crypto usability. Out of the box, it’s clear who this device is for: active Solana users who regularly transact on-chain, with the design focusing on everything crypto-first. With 150,000 phones pre-ordered from over 50 countries and at a price point of $500 the Seeker wants to bring Solana ecosystem participants the ability to transact on the go in a matter of seconds. If you’re someone who frequently uses Solana, the Seeker might feel like it was built specifically for you. However, this phone is not intended for the casual crypto user. “If you're somebody who transacts at least once a week, frankly, then you might not be a full on power user, but you're at least a regular enough user that Seeker makes sense,” Emmett Hollyer, the general manager at Solana Mobile, told CoinDesk in an interview.

POST-MORTEM ON BASE’S BLOCK PRODUCTION HALT : Block production on Coinbase’s (COIN) Base network halted for 33 minutes early Tuesday following a sequencer failover that didn’t recover as expected, developers said in a post-mortem report . The outage began at 06:07 UTC on Aug. 5, when the active sequencer fell behind due to congestion from on-chain activity. While Base’s Conductor module — a core component of the OP Stack designed to maintain uptime — correctly attempted to shift leadership to a standby sequencer, the new instance had not been fully provisioned and was unable to produce blocks. Since it couldn’t automatically switch again, production stalled until engineers manually fixed the issue. The network was fully recovered by 06:40, according to the report. To avoid reorganization risks — that is, when a blockchain temporarily rewrites history by replacing confirmed blocks with alternative ones — the team paused Conductor and coordinated a controlled leadership transition. This process contributed to the length of the outage. The outage highlighted a key operational risk in layer-2 rollup networks that rely on centralized sequencers to order and submit transactions. These systems remain dependent on rapid failover mechanisms and complete provisioning, and a single-point gap in this chain can lead to full network stalls. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . NEW JITO PROPOSAL FOR REROUTING BLOCK ENGINE FEES: Jito Labs put forward a new governance proposal , called JIP-24, aimed at decentralizing the network further by routing all its Block Engine and Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) fees directly to the Jito DAO treasury. If approved, the DAO would assume control over protocol revenue streams, directing them to the network's JTO tokenholders. This, in turn, would reduce Jito Labs' influence over the network of the same name, with a DAO subgroup taking on a greater role in development. Jito Labs hopes the change will ultimately boost the Jito token's value. Currently, rewards from Jito’s Block Engine are split evenly — 3% to Jito Labs and 3% to the DAO. JIP-24 would eliminate the split, sending the full 6% of fees, along with all future BAM-related revenue, to the DAO treasury permanently. “This proposal reflects the commitment of the Jito ecosystem to ensure that protocol fees accrue directly to the token holders as optimally as possible and cements the DAO as central to the technical and economic governance of the Jito Network,” the Jito Labs team wrote in their proposal. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . CARDANO CORE DEVS GET $70M BUDGET : Cardano’s core development team, Input Output Global (IOG), secured approval for a $71 million treasury allocation to fund 12 months of network upgrades following a drawn-out governance vote that drew concerns around transparency, accountability and cost. The proposal passed with 74% in favor and authorizes the disbursement of 96 million ADA, or roughly 13% of the protocol’s treasury, to IOG. Payments will be milestone-based and overseen by Intersect, a member-driven governance body. Smart contracts and an independent committee will add additional oversight, IOG said. Key deliverables include Hydra, a layer-2 scaling product for faster and cheaper transactions, and Project Acropolis, which aims to re-architect the Cardano node for greater modularity and ease of developer onboarding. The team also plans to reduce memory usage and improve operational costs for validators. Such implementations can eventually lead to increased developer activity and new use cases on the Cardano network, contributing to demand for ADA, the network’s gas token. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option In Other News Big banks are making it harder and more expensive for consumers to use fintech and crypto apps, which amounts to what could be seen as ""Operation Chokepoint 3.0."" That’s according to Alex Rampell, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). In the firm's latest fintech newsletter , Rampell pointed to traditional financial institutions charging high fees to access account data or move money, particularly to services like Coinbase or Robinhood, as a move to strangle the competition. ""Under the Biden administration, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 tried to debank and deplatform crypto,"" Rampell said. ""That era has ended, but now the banks are aiming to implement their own Chokepoint 3.0 — charging insanely high fees to access data or move money to crypto and fintech apps — and, more concerningly, blocking crypto and fintech apps they don’t like."" — Francisco Rodrigues Read more . When Celestia airdropped its TIA token to 580,000 users in 2023 it was the plat du jour among traders and investors, with the project saying the release aligned with a new ""modular era."" However, despite rallying to a dizzying $20 price point in September 2024, it has since slumped to less than $1.65 in a desperate plight spurred by a series of massive cliffs in the token's vesting schedule. Data from Tokenomist shows that core contributors and early backers, notably a slew of venture capitalists, could sell tokens purchased relatively cheaply in early fundraising rounds onto the open market. This coincided with TIA's precipitous move to the downside, although it's worth noting that the token's market cap, currently at $1.2 billion, actually increased by 50% despite the token losing 90% of its value due to the sheer scale of supply increase. — Oliver Knight Read more . Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Regulatory and Policy The White House is preparing an executive order that would penalize banks for cutting off customers over their beliefs. The order, reported by the Wall Street Journal , is expected to be signed by President Donald Trump as early as this week. It would direct banking regulators to investigate whether financial firms violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or other consumer protection laws when closing accounts. While the order could still be altered, it would bring further stability to the crypto sector. During the Biden administration, a coordinated effort from the federal government was launched to de-bank crypto firms, an effort known as Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . The draft order does not name specific banks, but reportedly references an incident involving Bank of America and a Christian nonprofit in Uganda. The bank said it closed the accounts because it does not serve small businesses operating abroad.— Francisco Rodrigues Read more . A group of French lawmakers is preparing a draft law that would enable the use of surplus electricity from nuclear power plants to mine bitcoin, according to recent public statements. The proposal would install mining hardware at facilities owned by state utility, Électricité de France (EDF), according to Le Monde . The process would take advantage of surplus energy generated by these nuclear power plants. France is the largest producer of nuclear power in the European Union, according to 2023 data from Eurostat. It accounted for 338,202 gigawatt hours, or more than half the 27-nation bloc's total output. The heat produced by nuclear fission is used to produce electricity, but more than two-thirds of it is lost, the statistics agency said. — Francesco Rodrigues Read more .

She observes that, “XRP is stabilizing after a pullback from the recent surge, with consolidation forming near the psychological 3.00 level. Price is respecting diagonal support and forming a bullish falling wedge just below the previous breakout zone. A breakout above 3.05 could initiate the next rally toward the 3.40 target zone.” She added that the structure signals a classic continuation pattern, primed for a bullish breakout. Technical Setup & Market Structure According to Lingrid’s view, XRP is currently nestled in a bullish falling wedge pattern, a well-known reversal structure signaling weakening selling pressure and increasing buyer interest. The price action shows repeated tests of diagonal support, forming tighter compression just under the previous breakout band, hinting at an impending shift in momentum. Lingrid emphasizes the significance of the $3.00 psychological level , which has held firm despite recent pullbacks. This stable zone is critical for maintaining the integrity of the wedge formation. Traders are positioning watchfully, with the $3.05 breakout level as a key trigger for likely upside continuation. What’s Next: A Breakout Toward $3.40? Lingrid projects that a successful breakout above $3.05 particularly with volume support could launch XRP into a rally targeting $3.40. That would represent roughly a 13% move from $3.00, aligning with technical projections and recent trend strength. The zone near $3.40 has previously acted as resistance, which if cleared, could pave the way for higher price discovery. Such a scenario becomes even more plausible when considering broader momentum. Upcoming catalysts, including ETF approval chatter, Ripple’s institutional uptake, and macroeconomic easing could provide the fuel to lift XRP beyond this resistance band. The Case for XRP as Payroll Leader on American Soil Prominent crypto expert and analyst Luis Delgado, aka Del Crxpto, boldly predicts XRP will soon become the leading crypto for employee income distribution in the U.S. Citing rising adoption, favorable regulatory shifts, and evolving payroll infrastructure, he sees XRP at the forefront of on-chain compensation. Del Crxpto highlights XRP’s technical strengths, such as its high transaction throughput, minimal fees, and lightning-fast settlement times, as core enablers for payroll functionality. These characteristics make XRP well suited for real‑time wage disbursements, especially compared to slower or more expensive chains. Importantly, his projection aligns with the recent surge in institutional and governmental interest in crypto infrastructure. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched Project Crypto, aimed at shifting U.S. financial markets onto on-chain architectures and this initiative includes frameworks for tokenized payroll and crypto custody. The White House also issued a comprehensive crypto policy report, and Congress recently enacted landmark stablecoin legislation, all signaling growing openness to digital assets like XRP. Where XRP Payroll is Already Gaining Traction While still nascent at scale, XRP-based payroll is gaining real-world footholds. Platforms such as Coinbase enable employees to convert their salaries into XRP instantly. Payroll services like Deel and Bitwage already support crypto payouts domestically and globally with XRP included. Del Crxpto argues that these early use cases, especially among freelancers, remote workers, and tech companies, set the stage for broader corporate adoption. Conclusion Del Crxpto’s prediction rests on tangible momentum in payroll services, infrastructure, and regulatory reforms. XRP’s unique blend of speed, low cost, U.S.-based development, and growing compatibility with employee paycheck platforms positions it at the forefront of a potential shift toward crypto salaries. On the other hand, Lingrid’s technical thesis that XRP is stabilizing after a retracement, forming a bullish falling wedge just below its breakout zone is being reinforced by current price action and accumulation behavior. With consolidation taking place near the $3.00 psychological level and a potential breakout above $3.05, XRP looks primed to challenge $3.40, possibly higher if broader sentiment and legal clarity align.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-06 17:36:02

For presales, it is usually the extended presale campaigns, vague roadmaps, and endless marketing promises that have created a toxic environment where genuine innovation struggles to distinguish itself from elaborate cash grabs. This erosion of trust has reached a tipping point. Investors are now demanding transparency, immediate utility, and proven development progress before committing their capital to any blockchain venture. Right now, investors are now gravitating toward projects that solve actual problems and provide immediate value to users. Let’s find out more. BlockDAG: The Never-Ending Tale of Presale Fatigue The BlockDAG presale serves as a perfect example of everything wrong with current crypto fundraising practices. Since the campaign took longer than expected, investors are gradually losing confidence in its potential. This development could likely result in massive sell-offs upon launch, thereby causing a heavy downtrend for BDAG. On Trustpilot, BlockDAG has an average rating of 2.8 out of 5. About 47% of the reviews are negative, with some users calling it a scam and warning others to be careful. The project has been running its presale for over 18 months, constantly shifting launch dates and raising concerns about transparency and legitimacy. Industry analysis reveals that BlockDAG Network has invested heavily in advertising, securing paid placements in media outlets, and launching promotional campaigns on social media platforms rather than focusing on product development. This approach has led many to question whether the project represents genuine innovation or simply another elaborate fundraising scheme. DeSoc: The Blue Chip Social Media Revolution While projects like BlockDAG struggle with credibility issues, DeSoc has become the blue-chip cryptocurrency project that serious investors are flocking to. With $10 million already raised toward its revolutionary vision, DeSoc represents everything the market has been waiting for: genuine innovation, immediate utility, and transparent development. DeSoc is pioneering the first blockchain-based social media platform that enables seamless content syndication across all major social networks. Unlike theoretical blockchain improvements, DeSoc addresses real problems that millions of social media users face daily. This makes the new decentralized social media revolution an immediately valuable and practical solution for everyone’s day-to-day social media use. The platform’s unique approach enables users to publish content simultaneously on DeSoc and traditional platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, through sophisticated API integration. This breakthrough eliminates the painful choice between embracing Web3 technology and maintaining an existing social media presence. Revolutionary Monetization Ecosystem DeSoc’ s monetization framework represents a paradigm shift in how content creators and users interact with social media. The platform introduces multiple revenue streams through its native $SOCS token, including: Content Rewards: Users earn tokens for creating valuable content based on engagement metrics and quality assessments Tipping and Micropayments: Direct creator support through token-based appreciation systems Exclusive Content Access: Premium content monetization through token-gated experiences Advertisement Partnerships: Strategic use of $SOCS tokens for purchasing ad space across integrated platforms This comprehensive approach ensures that every participant in the DeSoc ecosystem can generate meaningful returns while contributing to platform growth. Transparent Tokenomics Built for Sustainability DeSoc’s token distribution demonstrates the careful planning and community focus that distinguishes blue-chip projects from speculative ventures. The strategic allocation ensures long-term sustainability while providing immediate value to early supporters. With 45% of the total 3 billion token supply allocated to presale across 12 structured stages, DeSoc maintains accessibility while building a strong foundation. Platform development receives 20% allocation with team tokens locked for two years, demonstrating long-term commitment. Marketing initiatives account for 15%, community rewards claim 10%, and liquidity reserves secure the final 10%. This transparent structure contrasts sharply with projects that obscure tokenomics or heavily favor insiders over community participants. The Clear Investment Choice The contrast between struggling presale projects and DeSoc’s focused innovation could not be more apparent. While others make endless promises and delay deliverables, DeSoc is building the future of decentralized social media with proven funding, clear utility, and demonstrable progress. In fact, its ongoing presale has raked in more than $10 million, a testament to investors’ growing interest in DeSoc’s dream. The presale is currently selling at $0.01 in its opening stages, and many BlockDag investors are already flocking to it. Don’t get left behind.

While established names like Bitcoin continue to dominate headlines, newer projects are gaining momentum, especially among those scanning the crypto presale list for upcoming opportunities. One of the most talked-about names this year is Nexchain, a new crypto token presale that blends AI integration with blockchain scalability. At the same time, projects like BTC Bull and BlockchainFX are vying for attention with their unique approaches. In this comparison, we explore how each project fits into the evolving landscape of token presales and what makes Nexchain stand out. Nexchain Introduces AI-Driven Blockchain Technology Nexchain positions itself among the top crypto presales by offering a Layer 1 blockchain built entirely with artificial intelligence. Unlike many projects that follow traditional models, Nexchain’s infrastructure uses AI at every level, from consensus mechanisms to transaction optimization. This helps reduce processing delays and keeps the system adaptable to new developments. Security is another major feature. Nexchain applies decentralized protocols to help keep the network stable, even under high activity. Its current progress in Stage 24 of the token presale reflects growing interest. The price per NEX token is $0.096, with $8M already raised out of an $8.47M target. Nexchain is being mentioned frequently on crypto presale lists due to its unique architecture and traction with early adopters. While it’s still in its early days, the project’s use of AI and its ability to scale transaction speed make it one of the most-watched crypto presale projects this year. BTC Bull Shows Signs of Correction Bitcoin, often viewed as the benchmark for market direction, has seen a minor pullback recently. Over the weekend, BTC dropped about 5%, moving from $118,330 on Friday to $112,300 by Sunday. This decline falls in line with seasonal trends that often bring volatility to the market during this time of year. Analysts point out that maintaining support above $110,000 could be crucial. If this level holds, Bitcoin might stabilize before testing previous highs again. Still, this dip reminds investors that even leading assets experience pressure and corrections. These shifts in Bitcoin’s price often influence the broader crypto presale environment. When BTC pulls back, attention sometimes shifts toward presale cryptocurrency opportunities with fresh narratives, such as those featured in the best crypto presale 2025 conversations. As a result, investors may explore other areas like presale crypto tokens with distinct value propositions. BlockchainFX Offers Real-World Trading Utility BlockchainFX is another token presale attracting attention, not just for its price point but for its functionality. Priced at $0.018 during its presale phase, the token is set to launch at $0.05. That difference alone has sparked interest among early participants looking for real utility over hype. Unlike many meme tokens driven by social trends, BlockchainFX aims to serve active traders through a multi-feature trading super app. It also raised $4.4 million from over 3,700 contributors, a sign of growing traction and community involvement. Though it’s still in its early stages, BlockchainFX reflects a broader trend among crypto presale projects: the shift toward building real use cases. While it’s impossible to predict long-term success, its focus on trading functionality has given it some visibility in crypto coin presale circles. It shows how a clear utility model can elevate a token beyond short-term speculation in the crypto ICO presale space. Nexchain and the Rise of Intelligent Token Presales Among the growing number of presale crypto tokens , Nexchain stands out for its use of AI to solve some of blockchain’s toughest challenges. Its current momentum reflects not just hype but a broader trend toward intelligent infrastructure in Web3 crypto presales. As investors continue to search for the best crypto presale to buy right now, they’re also becoming more discerning. Projects like Nexchain that prioritize scalability, security, and tech-first solutions tend to attract deeper interest from both developers and long-term holders. Meanwhile, traditional tokens and speculative projects are still part of the conversation, but token presales like Nexchain hint at where the industry may be heading. Whether or not it becomes a benchmark for future presale cryptocurrency models, it offers a strong example of what’s possible when advanced tech meets decentralized systems. For now, it earns a firm place on many top crypto presales lists in 2025, alongside names like BlockchainFX and the ever-watchful BTC Bull.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-06 17:42:00

Which Is A Better Investment In July?",https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-or-desoc-which-is-a-better-investment-in-july/,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu or DeSoc? That’s the question on every investor, analyst, and expert’s mind. For weeks, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have been leading the resurgence in the meme market, posting double-digit percentage gains within a month. However, analysts and savvy investors are now focusing on value-driven utility rather than mere speculation that meme coins hold. One project that has been on everyone’s mind is the new DeSoc Ethereum-based social media platform, which is spearheading the decentralized social media concept. So, which is a better investment in July? The usual meme hype with no utility or a promising disruption to a $101 billion social media market? Let’s find out. Dogecoin Surges Past $0.25 as Revolutionary Zero-Knowledge Upgrade Ignites Whale Frenzy The meme coin that started as a joke is now making serious moves. Dogecoin has shattered the critical $0.25 resistance barrier with explosive 38% monthly gains, catapulting toward ambitious targets of $0.31 and $0.42 looks imminent. Behind the rally lies a game-changing development: DogeOS has submitted a groundbreaking zero-knowledge proof upgrade proposal that could revolutionize Dogecoin from a simple payment token into a powerhouse DeFi and gaming platform. The OP_CHECKZKP proposal promises to enable thousands of off-chain transactions per second through zk-rollups, while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum. Crypto whales are taking notice in a big way. Large investors holding over 10 million DOGE tokens have accumulated a staggering 122.59 billion tokens. Trading volume has also surged past $20 billion in 24 hours, and the RSI is forming higher highs without bearish divergence. Shiba Inu’s 400% Rally Setup Has Analysts Buzzing Technical patterns don’t lie, and Shiba Inu is painting a masterpiece that has veteran analysts reaching for their calculators. The formation of a massive Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern on SHIB’s chart has market observer Javon Marks projecting a mind-bending 400% rally to $0.000081. The meme coin already delivered a solid 16% gain over the past month, but according to analyst Friedrich , the real fireworks haven’t started yet. SHIB needs to punch through $0.000017 resistance to trigger what CW calls “big upside” potential. Behind the scenes, SHIB’s burning mechanism is working overtime. The burn rate skyrocketed 200% over seven days, with 135 million tokens sent to digital oblivion. While the dollar value may seem modest, consistent token destruction creates scarcity that could amplify any potential demand surge. Retail interest is heating up fast. Google searches for Shiba Inu just hit a five-month high, signaling a growing appetite from everyday investors. Trading volumes recently exploded to 4.33 trillion tokens, far exceeding historical patterns and suggesting institutional money is taking notice. DeSoc Emerges as the Smart Money’s July Pick While meme coins chase nostalgic highs, sophisticated investors are quietly accumulating DeSoc, the social media revolution that makes Dogecoin and Shiba Inu look like yesterday’s news. The $10 million already flowing into DeSoc represents something neither DOGE nor SHIB can offer: genuine utility that grows stronger with adoption. DeSoc solves real problems that billions face daily. The platform’s groundbreaking content syndication technology allows simultaneous publishing across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and DeSoc itself through sophisticated API integration. The tokenomics structure reveals careful planning that meme coins lack. With 45% of the 3 billion token supply allocated across 12 presale stages, DeSoc builds sustainable community growth while the platform develops core functionality. Revenue streams flow through content rewards, creator tipping, exclusive access monetization, and advertising partnerships using $SOCS tokens. Market timing couldn’t be better. Social media platforms face mounting regulatory pressure over creator compensation and data privacy, creating massive demand for decentralized alternatives. DeSoc targets the $100 billion social media advertising market, a prize that dwarfs anything meme coins currently address. Smart contracts govern every platform decision through transparent blockchain verification, ensuring community participation in DeSoc’s evolution. While DOGE and SHIB depend on retail sentiment and whale manipulation, DeSoc creates authentic demand through platform usage. The choice between speculative meme coin trading and revolutionary social media infrastructure has never been clearer. Why July Favors Real Innovation Over Meme Magic Dogecoin and Shiba Inu offer compelling technical setups with clear price targets; however, they remain at the mercy of market sentiment and whale activity. DOGE’s $0.25 breakout and SHIB’s 400% rally potential depend entirely on continued speculation and retail FOMO. DeSoc represents a fundamental shift toward utility-driven investing. While meme coins chase previous highs, DeSoc builds the infrastructure for Web3 social media adoption. The $10 million initial funding, transparent tokenomics, and revolutionary content syndication technology create sustainable value that transcends market cycles. Its ongoing presale has seen an astronomical rise in demand, and fortunately, the price is at just $0.01. This remains your best shot at life-changing gains. Seize the moment!

CrediX announced the agreement on social media , stating that the exploiter will receive compensation “ fully paid by the CrediX treasury “, while affected users receive airdrops of their asset shares. We have good news for our users. Reached succesfull parley with the exploiter who agreed to return the the funds within the next 24-48 hours in return for money fully paid by the credix treasury. We have addresses of all the affected users and will airdrop them their share of… — CrediX (@CrediX_fi) August 4, 2025 Multisig Wallet Compromise Exposes Bridge Role Vulnerabilities The resolution follows a six-day compromise where attackers gained administrative control of CrediX’s multisig wallet and abused bridge privileges to mint unbacked collateral tokens on the Sonic network. The hacker used Tornado Cash-funded addresses to exploit BRIDGE role permissions, directly minting acUSDC tokens before borrowing against worthless collateral to drain approximately $2.64 million from lending pools. CrediX has joined a growing list of 2025 DeFi protocols that successfully negotiated fund returns with exploiters, including GMX’s massive $40.5 million recovery. The trend contrasts sharply with 2025’s devastating security record, showing $2.29 billion in net losses across 344 incidents during the first half. Security experts note that most hackers realize that keeping stolen cryptocurrency creates more problems than benefits due to enhanced blockchain forensics and legal risks. However, speaking with Cryptonews, Immunefi CEO Mitchell Amador warned that “ relying on a hacker’s change of heart is not a viable strategy for protocol security ,” while noting that nearly 80% of hacked projects never fully recover their value after exploits. White-Hat Negotiations Emerge as Recovery Strategy Amid Rising Exploits The CrediX recovery continues a pattern of successful negotiations between DeFi protocols and exploiters seeking legal amnesty in exchange for fund returns. GMX protocol recovered $40.5 million in July after offering a $5 million bounty to the attacker who exploited re-entrancy vulnerabilities to manipulate token pricing through flash loans. Similarly, ZKsync Association recovered $5 million in April when a hacker exploited the airdrop distribution contract’s sweepUnclaimed() function to mint 111 million unclaimed tokens. The attacker accepted a 10% bounty and returned 90% of the stolen assets within a designated 72-hour safe harbor window. KiloEx also achieved complete fund recovery in April after issuing an ultimatum to attackers who exploited price oracle vulnerabilities to manipulate ETH/USD feeds. The protocol offered 90% return terms with a 10% white-hat bounty while threatening legal pursuit and exchange collaboration to freeze associated addresses. These successful negotiations contrast with major 2025 losses, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion theft, Cetus Protocol’s initial $225 million drain, and the ongoing $234 million WazirX legal proceedings. Regarding the Cetus case, Sui validators intervened , freezing and redistributing $162 million through blockchain governance rather than hacker cooperation. CertiK data reveals that crypto investors lost $2.47 billion across 344 incidents in 2025’s first half , with wallet-related breaches accounting for $1.7 billion across just 34 attacks. Source: Certik Report Phishing scams contributed $410 million in losses through 132 separate incidents, while smart contract vulnerabilities caused $229 million in losses in May alone. Security Expert Warns Against Reactive Measures as Prevention Remains Key Mitchell Amador of Immunefi emphasized that successful fund recoveries represent exceptions rather than standard outcomes, noting that most exploited projects suffer permanent devaluation beyond initial losses. He criticized reactive security measures like post-hack bug bounties. “ Prevention always beats negotiation. Whereas reactive measures like launching a bug bounty only after a hack exacerbate the problem. ” He added, “ that not only signals weakness or lack of preparedness but also potentially creates a ‘race to the bottom’ where underincentivized researchers might further exploit rather than report. ” Amador advocated for unified security stacks integrating AI-powered agents for constant vulnerability scanning and immediate threat detection rather than human-dependent monitoring systems. He warned that inadequate bug bounty rewards and slow response programs discourage legitimate security researchers while potentially turning warnings into actual attacks. Additionally, July hack losses jumped 27.2% to $142 million across seventeen major incidents , reversing June’s temporary decline. July crypto hack losses surge 27% to $142 million with CoinDCX's $44 million insider breach and GMX's $42 million exploit leading victims. #July #CryptoHack https://t.co/4UCMKaxUvI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 Major exploits included CoinDCX’s $44.2 million insider breach and various DeFi protocol vulnerabilities affecting BigONE , WOO X , and Future Protocol platforms. Recovery efforts returned $187 million through law enforcement action, white-hat agreements, and exchange cooperation during the first half of 2025. However, net losses still totaled approximately $2.29 billion, with average incident losses reaching $7.1 million despite partial recovery successes.

Focus is shifting from buzz to real use. Cold Wallet, Tron, Hyperliquid, and Sui are all moving upward, each for its own reasons. Tron (TRX) is nearing important resistance points, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is holding a strong chart pattern, and Sui (SUI) is gaining attention with rising open interest. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, links usage to every $CWT move. Here’s a clear view of why each is trending and what makes one stand out beyond short-term charts. 1. Cold Wallet: Built-In Use, Fast Growth, Clear Structure Cold Wallet is changing how crypto utility works. Instead of releasing a token first and hoping it finds value, this platform ties its $CWT coin to all core actions. From checking balances to using tools or sending funds, the token powers it all. This isn’t just a twist it’s a working system. The presale numbers show strong interest. Over $5.7 million raised and 685 million tokens sold. Current price sits at $0.00923 in Stage 15, heading to $0.00942 in Stage 16. The set launch price is $0.3517, and that makes early moves worth tracking. Those joining now could see over 3,700% returns at launch. Its presale isn’t built on a flat or fixed method. Cold Wallet rolls out across 150 stages. Each one builds fresh interest while giving value to early users. It rewards smart timing and keeps attention high. What makes Cold Wallet rise is not hype but real use. As people use the platform more, the $CWT token gains value. This tight link between use and price is rare, which makes Cold Wallet one of the best crypto coins to watch right now. 2. Tron (TRX): Eyes on Resistance, Chart Holds the Clue Tron has drawn fresh attention with a breakout from a long-term symmetrical triangle, a pattern that often signals a shift in trend. Now priced near $0.322, TRX is moving toward a resistance zone from April that ranges between $0.325 and $0.34. If TRX manages to move past this range, it could approach $0.44, though that will depend on trading activity and overall market support. From a tech perspective, Tron stays focused on stablecoin use and decentralized content delivery, but it’s the price action that offers the most immediate insights. For those reviewing the best crypto coins to watch, Tron presents a real-world test of how past resistance lines behave in a shifting market structure. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Range Builds, Momentum Waits Hyperliquid is showing healthy consolidation rather than weakness. At $44.66, it’s just under its recent $49.75 high, forming a rising flag pattern. This structure often points to a pause in bullish energy, not a reversal. What makes it notable is how narrow the range has stayed, suggesting steady interest from buyers. The project’s decentralized perpetual futures platform is gaining traction due to its quick execution and market depth. While it’s not as old as some DeFi platforms, Hyperliquid’s solid price structure puts it among the best crypto coins to watch for those who track chart patterns and value momentum over marketing. 4. Sui (SUI): Open Interest Hints at Bigger Moves Sui’s move from $3.88 to $4.21 has lined up with a 60% rise in open interest, a figure often seen ahead of sharp price moves. While open interest alone isn’t a guarantee, when paired with solid support, it often shows a change in trader behavior. After a quiet period, this data spike makes Sui a project worth watching again. Sui is based on the Move programming framework, which improves how asset ownership is handled. While it hasn’t had the same exposure as major market names, its current setup puts it on the list of best crypto coins to watch, especially as volume starts to rise again. Different Paths, One Question: What Matters Now? Each of these projects, Cold Wallet, Tron, Hyperliquid, and Sui, offers something different. Tron is testing old resistance, Hyperliquid is tightening its structure, and Sui is seeing rising volume. But Cold Wallet sets itself apart through its built-in use case. $CWT is already active in powering its platform. For those scanning the best crypto coins to watch , the lead may belong to the one with live utility and a system that rewards activity, not just speculation.

The latest development is the introduction of trustless vaults, designed to allow BTC holders to deposit their tokens without relying on a centralized entity, as outlined in a new white paper shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday. In DeFi ecosystems, trustless vaults are a form of digital asset storage or management that removes the need for users to trust a central authority or intermediary. Instead, the systems use smart contracts to ensure security and enforce the rules of the vault. Babylon says its vaults will allow bitcoin to be used as collateral in DeFi applications such as lending and stablecoin issuance, as well as the staking that its protocol provides. Users can also earn yield on their BTC holdings by staking it to support the operation of proof-of-stake networks. They then receive rewards paid in BABY , Babylon's native token. The development forms part of the broader movement to utilize the enormous value held in bitcoin to power DeFi activity across other blockchains. Accounting for over 60% of the total cryptocurrency market cap , bitcoin is worth comfortably more than every other digital asset combined and could prove a far more potent source of blockchain-based fuel than any other crypto in existence. Existing bridges that allow bitcoin to be deployed on external blockchains rely on centralized third parties. Furthermore, Bitcoin's scripting language does not allow for covenants — mechanisms that allows specific conditions on how the funds can be spent in the future — although not for a lack of trying from developers . The absence makes it harder to build trustless bridges. Babylon proposes solving this by providing on-chain vaults, with the stored BTC tied to a specific smart contract protocol on an external chain. This harnesses BitVM3 , the latest evolution of BitVM, a framework for enabling smart contracts on Bitcoin. BitVM3 is designed to improve the efficiency of its predecessor by moving the bulk of computational work off-chain using ""garbled circuits,"" to make fraud proofs more compact on-chain. The trustless bitcoin vaults are ""programmable, and withdrawals are permitted only when a zero-knowledge proof of a specific smart contract state is verified on the Bitcoin chain,"" Babylon said in the abstract of the paper. ""Together with an appropriate Bitcoin scripting design of the vault, this eliminates the need for mutual trust among parties.""

In a recent announcement, the development team revealed that Shibarium is now positioned as the core infrastructure for a decentralized, community-led future, highlighting its broader functionality and long-term vision for the evolving ecosystem. Shibarium Evolves Beyond Layer 2 Solution On August 4, the Shiba Inu team behind Shibarium clarified in an X social media post that the platform is more than just a Layer 2 scaling solution. They described it as a robust infrastructure designed to power a fully decentralized, community-driven ecosystem. This positioning marks a strategic expansion of Shibarium’s role in the broader blockchain space, emphasizing its importance as a foundational layer for both innovation and governance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Unveils New Developer Hub Updates — Here’s The 411 Initially introduced as a Layer 2 built on the Ethereum blockchain to provide scalable and low-cost transactions, Shibarium’s evolution reflects a deliberate shift towards multifunctional utility. The team has outlined the platform’s capacity to support on-chain governance structures, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and real-world applications. This indicates Shibarium’s readiness to serve as a multi-purpose blockchain ecosystem rather than a single-purpose scaling solution. Another key component highlighted by the Shiba Inu team is Shibarium’s ability to allow developers to build freely on the network while empowering communities to govern their protocols independently. This dual emphasis on infrastructure and self-governance aligns with the core principles of decentralization, giving Shibarium the potential to become a breeding ground for next-generation blockchain applications. Compared to other Layer 2 solutions that primarily focus on throughput and transaction fees, the Shiba Inu team notes that Shibarium integrates the above features within a framework geared toward long-term sustainability and utility. In doing so, the team presents Shibarium as a dynamic platform where resilience and innovation converge to support a decentralized future. WoofSwap Proposes Major Updates For Shibarium WoofSwap, a key community voice within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, released a set of reform proposals on X, aimed at enhancing Shibarium’s scalability, utility, and overall appeal. At the center of the suggestions is a potential revision to the 20 million BONE token allocation, with WoofSwap urging community input to fine-tune the distribution. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bearish Reversal Setup Says Dump Below $0.000013 Is Coming Alongside tokenomics adjustments, the proposal targets technical improvements such as optimizing cross-chain speed to achieve a near one-minute transaction finality, positioning Shibarium as a faster and more competitive Layer 2 network. Other key technical refinements include streamlining smart contracts to lower Ethereum gas fees and expanding support for trendline cross-chain tokens. Beyond infrastructure, the proposal addresses governance and engagement for Shibarium. Decentralization also remains a priority, with a call to gradually open validator nodes while maintaining strict security standards. WoofSwap also urged influencers to be more cautious with their public roles, highlighting the need for credibility as Shibarium evolves.

Until recently, Ethereum (ETH) had been held to be the number one in blockchain technology. However, the second-largest cap is facing scaling issues at the moment. At this very moment, DeSoc , the decentralised social platform on top of DeFi, is making fast waves and garnering genuine interest from within the crypto fraternity. DeSoc ($SOCS): A Brave Mix of Social Media and DeFi DeSoc is a new platform that combines social media with decentralised finance. The $SOCS token is at the heart of it all. It enables people to trade with each other, earn money from their content, and utilize promotional tools. This new approach empowers users by allowing them to control their data and earnings, which platforms like Facebook and TikTok currently restrict. The response has been great. The presale for DeSoc has already brought in $10 million, and a lot of $SOCS tokens have been sold at just $0.01. This early success shows that investors have a lot of faith in the project’s future. The value of $SOCS could increase significantly if the platform is widely used and works well at scaling. One of the best things about DeSoc is its innovative contract system. It gives users rewards for being active on the site. Instead of relying on ads, creators can earn a direct profit from their content. This gives users more control over their online presence. DeSoc aims to transform social media by offering users a fairer, decentralized choice that prioritizes their interests. Ethereum (ETH): Strong Basics, But Problems Ahead Even though some say that Ethereum may have peaked, it is still doing well in the short term. ETH is worth $3,626.82 right now. In the last 24 hours, it has gone down by 1.9%, and in the previous month, it has gone up an impressive 49%. This rise is very different from the rest of the crypto market, which dropped 17% in the same period. Ethereum’s market cap is now about $439.77 billion, which shows that investors are confident and that institutions are still using it. Ethereum has come a long way in fixing problems brought up in the past. The Merge switched the system from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, which cut energy use by more than 99%. This made it more sustainable and in line with ESG goals. Later updates, like Dencun and Pectra, added features like Proto-Danksharding and better staking, which helped lower transaction costs and speed up processing. Institutional players have noticed these upgrades. More and more, banks, governments, and significant funds are looking into Ethereum-based ETFs and other solutions. Technical indicators point to a positive outlook, with strong support between $3,570 and $3,600 and resistance near $4,000. Analysts say that if ETH goes above that level, it could reach new highs, $10,000 to $15,000 by the end of 2025. But it’s not certain that Ethereum will stay in charge for a long time. Despite its updates, it still has trouble growing when the network is busy. Ethereum will still have difficulty keeping low fees and fast transactions as more DeFi and dApp projects launch. Competitors like Solana and Avalanche are getting ahead by providing similar features but with better performance metrics. Conclusion Ethereum is having trouble scaling, and DeSoc is starting to look like a possible disruptor. DeSoc combines DeFi and social networking, two of the most active areas in blockchain. It has a lot of early momentum, a unique way to make money, and a focus on the user, which makes it a serious player to watch. The presale for $SOCS is almost over, and the project’s rapid growth suggests that this could be one of the last chances to buy in at a low price of just $0.01. Even though there are still risks, early supporters of DeSoc see it as a chance to get in on the ground floor of a significant change in cryptocurrency and how people interact online. Both Ethereum and DeSoc show how blockchain technology is changing and growing. Investors can choose the established strength of Ethereum or the pioneering spirit of DeSoc.

49650184,549350,1754503220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49650184.jpeg,France Moves To Mine Bitcoin With Nuclear Power — Here’s What We Know,https://bitcoinist.com/france-mine-bitcoin-nuclear/,"France is moving into a new phase of cryptocurrency adoption, as the country’s far-right political party, Rassemblement National (RN), is reportedly drafting a new law that would allow unused nuclear power to fuel Bitcoin mining operations. According to French newspaper Le Monde, party leader and three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen promoted the plan during a visit to the Flamanville nuclear plant on March 11, calling it a smart way to turn wasted electricity into “secure and extremely profitable” digital assets. France Pushes New Plan To Mine Bitcoin With Nuclear Energy Rassemblement National’s proposal is now one of the most talked-about crypto developments in France . The party argues that since France often produces more electricity than it can use, the extra power shouldn’t go to waste. Leading the charge is RN lawmaker Aurélien Lopez-Liguori. He has drafted a bill to install Bitcoin mining equipment at nuclear sites run by Électricité de France (EDF), the country’s state-owned power company. The proposal aims to redirect the country’s unused nuclear energy, up to one gigawatt of surplus energy from these plants, straight into Bitcoin mining facilities. Since France generates over 70% of its electricity from nuclear energy, when supply exceeds demand, energy companies sell the extra electricity at a loss or even pay neighboring countries to take it off their hands. Instead of selling the extra power at a loss, France would use it for something more valuable: mine Bitcoin and keep the profits. The bill, submitted to the French National Assembly on July 11, 2025, includes a five-year pilot program that will allow power producers to set up mining operations right at nuclear plants with internal projections that could bring in between $100 million and $150 million each year. A Political Turnaround: From Crypto Skeptics To Advocates The Rassemblement National’s push for Bitcoin mining marks a dramatic shift in the party’s stance on cryptocurrency. In 2016, Marine Le Pen was strongly against crypto, warning that it would strip citizens of their financial control and give more power to global banks, calling for a complete ban on its use in France. However, by 2022, Le Pen had begun to soften her tone, showing support for regulated crypto use in finance. Now in 2025 , she’s openly backing Bitcoin mining as part of a national strategy, which reflects how far both her party and the broader political conversation have evolved on crypto. After a similar proposal failed in June 2025, Lawmaker Lopez-Liguori reworked the draft to focus more on national infrastructure and economic recovery, claiming the plan would help make France more economically independent while solving a long-standing energy problem. If passed , France would become the first country in Europe to officially link state-backed Bitcoin mining with nuclear energy, setting an example for other nations looking to monetize excess renewable or nuclear power.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin mining|Bitcoin mining news|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC Mining|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|France|France news|Mining news,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 18:00:20

Cold Wallet’s CWT token is now priced at $0.00942, with a listing target of $0.3517. That puts the expected ROI at 3,633%, and that’s just before any post-launch spike. Cold Wallet introduces a simple but compelling concept: a wallet that gives back on every use. With over $5.7 million already collected and 16 stages snapped up quickly, this presale isn’t being questioned for its concept, but rather for how much profit still remains for those yet to buy. Cold Wallet Aims to Reverse Hidden Costs in Crypto Most wallets quietly chip away at user balances through gas fees, bridges, swaps, and conversions. Cold Wallet flips this experience by rewarding usage instead of taxing it. By integrating CWT, the platform ensures cashback from transactions, rebates from swaps, and rewards from both on-ramp and off-ramp activity. With $5.7 million already raised across 15 stages and adoption boosted by a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, bringing two million users, the coin’s future looks solid even before launch. CWT is fast becoming one of the best crypto options available now. Massive Token Buyers Fuel Stage Sellouts This isn’t just about small-time buyers; major buyers are sweeping up CWT in bulk. Stage 15 vanished in a flash, Stage 16 is depleting fast, and the price has surged by over 34% since the first allocation. Every completed stage trims down the potential ROI. With the launch price fixed at $0.3517, each stage that sells out raises the cost of entry, reducing the upside for those still undecided. While gains of over 3,633% are still in play, the clock is undeniably ticking. Analysts Predict Bigger Gains After Launch Although the current presale ROI is already impressive, experts suggest the real move may come after listing. Private crypto circles and Telegram trading groups are tossing around post-launch targets of $5 to $10 per coin. With today’s entry still at $0.00942, even a small climb toward those upper estimates could mean serious upside. But with each passing stage, hesitation is becoming costly as the window to maximize gains keeps closing. Turn $1,000 Into $37,000, Or Even More A single look at the numbers is enough. Buying $1,000 worth of CWT now at $0.00942 gets you around 106,000 tokens. At launch, if the token hits $0.3517, that turns into more than $37,000, before any additional upward move. If it hits $5, the same stake jumps to over half a million. Should it reach $10, it tops $1 million. These figures aren’t guaranteed but do explain why early crypto presale demand is high. As each stage raises the cost, returns shrink, turning delay into missed profit. Entry Price Still Promising, but Time’s Running Out CWT still offers up to 3,633% returns at the current rate of $0.00942, but the number is slipping. Stage 15 sold out fast, Stage 16 is halfway through, and each new buyer inches ROI downward. Over $5.7 million already locked in shows that many already view Cold Wallet as one of the best crypto picks. A $1,000 buy-in could turn into $37,000 by launch. Miss Stage 16, and you’ll be paying more for less. Crypto rarely puts such clear potential on the table. Watching it fade while others cash in is a story few want to be part of.

Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that one investor in TROLL is looking at a gain of more than 130,000% after the memecoin inspired by the internet trolling culture had an explosive rally over the last month. “From $2,900 to $3.78 million in just 3.5 months – a 1,300x return! Trader ‘frostx.sol’ spent $2,900 to buy 20.91 million TROLL three months ago, sold 2.55 million for $50,700 and still holds 18.36 million TROLL ($3.73 million). With TROLL’s recent surge, his position has flipped nearly 1,300x, with a profit of $3.78 million.” Source: Lookonchain/X TROLL hit an all-time high on Wednesday at $0.2018, an increase of more than 423% from its seven-day low of $0.0403. TROLL has since retraced from its ATH and is trading for $0.1669 at time of writing, up 15.2% on the day. With a market cap of $175 million, TROLL is the 344th largest crypto project. Meanwhile, Solana, which has gained network activity from the memecoin craze, may be losing investor interest, according to crypto analytics platform Glassnode. Glassnode says that one key metric suggests that Ethereum ( ETH ) may be suddenly attracting more investors at the expense of Solana. The firm uses the Hot Realized Cap metric, which measures the capital held by accounts that have been active in the last seven days, to track the capital inflow of new investors. “The SOL/ETH hot capital ratio is in a clear downtrend, now at its YTD low of 0.045. ETH saw record short-term inflows on July 29th, while SOL hit a local peak – but both are now decelerating. The cooldown is sharper for SOL, signaling a fading but notable ETH-led rotation.” Source: Glassnode/X ETH is trading for $3,649 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, SOL is trading for $167 at time of writing, up 2.6% on the day.

According to Levi of Crypto Crusaders, XRP is preparing to challenge, and potentially surpass, its all-time high , with a major price move expected within the next two days. His analysis, supported by clear historical patterns and strengthening fundamentals, is igniting fresh optimism across the market. Technical Indicators Signal Imminent Surge Levi’s assessment centers on XRP’s current technical posture. The token is presently oversold, a condition that often precedes a sharp upward reversal. At the same time, he notes the emergence of positive momentum, suggesting that XRP may be poised to transition from consolidation into a full-scale rally. TWO DAYS LEFT!!! Until you know how #XRP Breaks All-Time High #XRP pic.twitter.com/78UnwkZzey — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 5, 2025 To support this outlook, Levi draws a comparison to XRP’s behavior on June 23, when the asset was similarly oversold. In the weeks that followed, XRP surged from $1.90 to $3.66, nearly doubling in price. That rally saw a swift transition from a market low to an overbought condition in under a month. The resemblance between these past and present setups is fueling speculation that XRP may be about to repeat that explosive performance. XRP ETFs Could Accelerate Institutional Inflows In addition to the bullish technical signals, the potential introduction of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) adds another powerful catalyst. Levi highlights the growing anticipation surrounding ETF approvals, which could bring a wave of institutional capital into XRP, much like the impact Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have had on their respective markets. The improved regulatory clarity following potential resolution of Ripple’s legal battle against the U.S. SEC has made XRP far more appealing to institutional investors. ETFs would provide regulated and convenient exposure to XRP, removing barriers that previously kept large players on the sidelines. If approved, these products could help sustain price appreciation and provide greater liquidity across the board.

As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.97. Volume is increasing, volatility is returning, and open interest in derivatives markets suggests growing speculative interest. These factors, combined with the oversold readings and rising momentum, indicate that XRP may be entering a breakout phase. Levi’s bold call for a major move within two days has captured attention throughout the crypto space. Many analysts and traders are closely monitoring price action, looking for confirmation that XRP is indeed repeating its previous pattern of rapid gains following a technical bottom. What Comes Next for XRP? As the countdown begins, the market is bracing for a potential turning point. If XRP follows the path outlined by Levi of Crypto Crusaders, the token could soon challenge its all-time high of $3.84 —and potentially move beyond it for the first time in history. Whether the breakout unfolds in the exact timeframe predicted or not, the conditions are undeniably aligning. With strong technical signals, rising institutional interest, and bullish sentiment, XRP may be on the verge of a defining moment in its price history.

The U.S. bitcoin mining industry is bracing for significant turbulence as President Trump’s administration has imposed a wave of steep reciprocal import tariffs on mining hardware from key Southeast Asian markets. The new measures, which were finalized on July 31, target countries that are central to the global supply chain for ASICs and could derail the president’s efforts to turn the U.S. into a global mining hub. Trump’s tariffs threaten U.S. Bitcoin mining momentum The tariffs, effective August 7, impose a 19% reciprocal duty on mining rigs imported from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a total levy of 21.6%. The imposition follows the expiration of the 90-day tariff pause announced in April under Trump’s “ Liberation Day ” trade reset. While these rates are lower than earlier proposals of up to 50%, they represent a steep increase from the pre-Trump standard U.S. import duty of 2.6%. According to Ethan Vera , the COO of the Bitcoin mining infrastructure firm, Luxor Technology, the new tariffs are already reducing the demand from U.S.-based miners. “At 21.6% tariffs, the U.S. is now one of the least competitive jurisdictions to bring machines in,” according to Vera. He added that mining companies are increasingly looking to Canada and other countries with more favorable import regimes. U.S. tariffs on China remain unchanged for now. A 10% reciprocal tariff remains in place through August 12, as well as a 20% premium specifically for China, totaling 57.6% on imports. This rate is well below the initially proposed 145%. Back in May, Vera warned that the U.S. could lose its edge as a top mining destination if tariffs are fully applied across the sector’s global supply chain. “Russia is likely to be the main beneficiary,” he noted, citing the country’s access to cheaper hardware and the growing Chinese capital investment. Other markets such as Canada, Northern Europe, Brazil, and Paraguay are also expected to attract fresh mining capital fleeing the U.S. In response, Luxor continues to advocate for Bitcoin mining ASICs to receive special tariff exemptions, similar to those granted to imports under HTSUS 8471, which covers computers, laptops, and servers. Vera emphasized that such treatment would be in line with the Trump administration’s campaign pledge to support domestic bitcoin mining. U.S. miners are exploring onshore partnerships Luxor Technology is helping its clients to secure equipment through new onshore partnerships, including a domestic production deal with Chinese rig manufacturer MicroBT. Vera noted that major ASIC producers are actively working to expand U.S.-based manufacturing to offer cost-effective solutions for American miners. However, these efforts won’t be enough to plug the immediate gap. “Final assembly in the U.S. is possible today,” Vera said, “but the raw materials and components largely come from Asia.” As a result, even U.S.-assembled machines carry higher costs. He estimates it could take years before a fully domesticated ASIC supply chain is realized. In the short term, Vera expects these machines to appreciate by more than 20% as import tariffs will drive demand for locally available alternatives. BitFuFu’s CEO Leo Lu told The Block that U.S.-based miners can still maintain competitive margins thanks to low-cost, increasingly renewable energy in states like Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado. BitFuFu says it is building out local partnerships to mitigate the impact of tariffs while expanding its U.S. presence. As the global hashpower landscape begins to shift and machine flows reroute to more favorable jurisdictions, the U.S. Bitcoin mining sector could face a prolonged period of stagnation — unless further policy accommodations are made.

Recently, a significant shift in perspective has emerged from a major financial institution. Standard Chartered, a global banking giant, is signaling a clear preference for Ethereum treasury firms over traditional ETH ETFs for investors seeking optimal returns. This insight comes directly from Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of FX and Digital Assets Research, and it’s sparking considerable discussion in the crypto community. This isn’t just a fleeting observation. Kendrick highlights that these specialized firms are becoming “very investable,” holding a substantial 1.6% of the total ETH supply. This figure remarkably matches the collective holdings of U.S. spot ETH ETFs . So, what makes these firms stand out in the competitive world of crypto investment strategies ? Why Are Ethereum Treasury Firms Gaining Traction? The core of Standard Chartered’s endorsement lies in the inherent advantages offered by Ethereum treasury firms . Unlike their ETF counterparts, these firms provide access to crucial functionalities within the Ethereum ecosystem. This difference creates a significant disparity in potential upside for investors. NAV Multiples Above 1: These firms often trade at a premium, indicating strong market confidence and perceived value beyond their underlying assets. Access to Staking Benefits: A key differentiator is the ability to participate in Ethereum’s staking mechanism. This allows firms to earn additional yield on their ETH holdings, compounding returns for investors. DeFi Opportunities: Beyond staking, these firms can also engage with various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, potentially unlocking further growth and utility for their assets. This active participation in the Ethereum network provides a dynamic edge that passive investment vehicles simply cannot replicate. For those exploring new crypto investment strategies , this flexibility is a powerful draw. Unlocking Superior Returns: ETH ETFs vs. Treasury Firms When comparing ETH ETFs with Ethereum treasury firms , the contrast becomes clear. While ETFs offer straightforward exposure to Ethereum’s price, their structure limits participation in core network activities. This limitation impacts their ability to generate additional revenue streams. ETFs, by design, typically cannot stake their underlying ETH. This means investors in these products miss out on the passive income generated from securing the Ethereum network. In contrast, Ethereum treasury firms actively leverage staking to enhance their returns, creating a more compelling value proposition. Geoffrey Kendrick’s analysis for Standard Chartered crypto research underscores this critical distinction, pointing to a higher potential upside for the treasury firm model. This fundamental difference positions treasury firms as potentially more lucrative for investors seeking to maximize their Ethereum exposure. It’s about not just holding the asset, but actively growing it within the ecosystem. Strategic Crypto Investment Strategies: Leading the Way The trend towards Ethereum treasury firms is already gaining momentum, with several entities leading the charge. The Block reported that firms like BitMine and SharpLink are at the forefront of this movement. These companies are actively growing their Ethereum treasury firms holdings, demonstrating a tangible commitment to this investment approach. Their success serves as a practical example of how these innovative crypto investment strategies are being implemented in the market. As more investors become aware of the substantial staking benefits and DeFi opportunities, the expectation is that these firms will continue to expand their ETH portfolios. This growth could further solidify their position as preferred vehicles for institutional and sophisticated investors looking for more than just passive exposure. The evolving landscape demands a nuanced approach, and Standard Chartered crypto insights suggest that the future of institutional Ethereum investment might very well lie with these dynamic treasury operations. In summary, Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick has presented a compelling argument for prioritizing Ethereum treasury firms over traditional ETH ETFs . The ability of these firms to engage in staking and DeFi activities, coupled with their strong NAV multiples, positions them for superior returns. As the crypto market matures, understanding these nuanced differences in crypto investment strategies will be crucial for making informed decisions. The trend is clear: active participation in the Ethereum ecosystem through treasury firms offers distinct advantages for growth and yield, making them a highly attractive option for the savvy investor. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How do Ethereum treasury firms differ from ETH ETFs? A1: Ethereum treasury firms actively manage their ETH holdings, often participating in staking and DeFi protocols to generate additional returns. In contrast, ETH ETFs typically hold ETH passively, offering price exposure without the ability to earn yield from network activities like staking. Q2: What are the main benefits of investing in Ethereum treasury firms? A2: Key benefits include access to staking benefits , potential participation in DeFi, and often trading at NAV multiples above 1, indicating strong market confidence and potential for superior returns compared to passive ETF investments. Q3: Why does Standard Chartered favor these firms? A3: Standard Chartered crypto research, led by Geoffrey Kendrick, favors these firms due to their active management capabilities, ability to earn yield through staking, and overall higher potential for upside compared to the more limited structure of traditional ETH ETFs . Q4: Can individual investors access Ethereum treasury firms? A4: While some Ethereum treasury firms might be geared towards institutional or accredited investors, the increasing interest in these crypto investment strategies may lead to more accessible avenues for individual investors in the future. It is advisable to research specific firms and their investment requirements. Q5: What are staking benefits? A5: Staking benefits refer to the rewards earned by locking up cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, to support the operations and security of a blockchain network. This process helps validate transactions and create new blocks, and in return, stakers receive new tokens as yield, similar to earning interest on a savings account.

SOCS tokens power content monetization, governance votes, and premium access tiers, all outlined in the whitepaper . While BlockDag and Litechain AI jockey for attention in the Web3 space, DeSoc’s combination of cross‑chain syndication and on‑chain incentives may deliver outsized gains by year’s end. DeSoc’s On‑Chain Social Model Sets It Apart SOCS tokens underpin every interaction on DeSoc’s network. Creators can gate premium content behind minimum SOCS holdings, forging tight‑knit communities that share in the platform’s growth. Every token transfer is publicly auditable on Ethereum explorers, reinforcing trust. A fixed 3 billion supply allocates 45% to a multi-phase presale with transparent vesting to prevent immediate sell-offs (whitepaper). Early participants earn rewards for posting, commenting, and sharing—no ad middlemen skimming returns. Key project mechanics include: Cross‑Platform Proofs: Every post anchors on Ethereum while reaching Web2 audiences. On‑Chain Rewards: SOCS payouts for engagement metrics replace ad skims. Token‑Gated Communities: Premium content locked behind SOCS minimums boosts demand. As DeSoc rolls out its testnet, users will see how SOCS incentives drive quality content and decentralized decision‑making. With cross‑chain syndication, posts are anchored on Ethereum yet still reach audiences on Twitter or Facebook. This blend of familiar social flows and DeFi mechanics may fuel stronger network effects and higher returns than competitors relying solely on data‑driven ad models. BlockDag’s Directed Acyclic Graph Ambitions BlockDAG’s Layer 1 presale has raised over $350 million at $0.0016 per BDAG token, offering buyers a possible 3,025 % ROI if the launch price hits $0.05. ChatGPT’s forecast aligns with market sentiment that high‑throughput DAG architectures will attract institutional capital, but caps projected returns at around 3,300 % given expected token unlocks. Recent performance highlights: Presale Scale: 24.3 billion BDAG tokens sold across multiple batches ROI Potential: Early backers already see 2,660 % gains on initial batches Technical Edge: Testnet demonstrated 2,000 TPS , outpacing many smart‑contract chains While BlockDAG’s fundraising prowess underscores broad interest, ChatGPT’s comparative models suggest diminishing returns as token unlocks and exchange listings dilute upside late in the cycle. Without on‑chain content rewards, it may trail platforms that blend engagement incentives with high throughput. Litechain AI’s Machine‑Learning Focus Lightchain AI has quietly raised over $21.1 million across 15 funding rounds and set a fixed $0.007 bonus‑round price ahead of its late‑July mainnet launch. ChatGPT estimates LCAI could climb to $0.073 by December, delivering roughly 950% returns, driven by demand for decentralized AI services but capped by a narrower application scope. Recent ecosystem moves: Mainnet Imminent: Corenet activation scheduled for late July, unlocking Proof of Intelligence consensus. AI‑Focused Tech: Introduction of an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine for on‑chain model inference. Developer Grants: Ongoing Pectra update enhances transaction speeds and lowers fees to support AI workloads Despite strong fundamentals, ChatGPT’s scenario analysis finds that LCAI’s specialized niche yields lower overall upside compared to broad‑appeal social‑DeFi and Layer 1 presales. Why DeSoc Could Outpace Competitors by Year’s End DeSoc blends social media and DeFi in one unified protocol. By rewarding content creation, curbing whale dominance and enabling cross‑chain syndication, it taps both user engagement and network effects. BlockDag excels at throughput and Litechain AI at on‑chain AI, but neither offers built‑in rewards for the very behavior that fuels social networks: posting, sharing and commenting. When creators earn SOCS for each interaction and hold governance power via quadratic voting, platform growth becomes a shared endeavor. Transparent vesting schedules and public audits reinforce confidence, while token‑gated communities drive stickiness. As the testnet goes live, early participants will see how these mechanics translate into real‑world value. ChatGPT’s models predict that, given current presale momentum and DeSoc’s unique feature set, SOCS could deliver higher returns than DAG‑based or AI‑focused tokens by the close of 2025. For those betting on social‑DeFi over pure throughput or compute, DeSoc may be the standout performer to watch. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

In the highly anticipated “ Keynote with Ben: Reshaping What’s Next, Bit by Bit ,” CEO and Co-founder Ben Zhou delivered a forward-looking vision grounded in real-world adoption, institutional-grade innovation, and deep ecosystem alignment. Celebrating over six years of service, 74 million users, and a milestone where 1 in 8 crypto enthusiasts globally have chosen Bybit, CEO and Co-founder Ben Zhou reaffirmed the exchange’s mission: Rewrite Your Success. Reshape The Standard. “Crypto is no longer just about speculation — it’s about real world application. At Bybit, we’re not just trading the future; we’re rewriting and reshaping what success looks like, bit by bit,” said Zhou. Compliance as a Foundation for the Future Bybit opened the keynote with a reaffirmation of its compliance-first approach — a critical pillar as the industry matures. Now fully compliant with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) framework and securing FIU-India registration in the first half of 2025, Bybit emphasized compliance not as a barrier but as an enabler. Zhou emphasized that “sustainability in crypto begins with trust and transparency,” and positioned compliance not as a constraint, but as a catalyst for long-term growth. Rewriting the Industry Security Standard Bybit has also successfully rewritten the industry standard for security following a sophisticated multi-stage attack on one of its vendors in February — the largest known hack in crypto history. While Bybit’s own infrastructure remained uncompromised, the company acted swiftly in response. Within weeks, it completed nine extensive security audits — conducted by both internal and independent experts — and implemented over 50 enhanced safeguards. The response drew industry-wide praise and global recognition for its transparency, resilience, and user-first approach. Today, Bybit’s security overhaul is regarded as a new benchmark in platform integrity. Trading Excellence Backed by Infrastructure Upgrades Bybit continues to lead in performance and reliability. Its upgraded matching engine now handles 3.5 million transactions per second, processing nearly 200 billion daily orders — a 75% year-over-year increase in the first half of 2025. By extending its Rapid Price Improvement (RPI) mechanism to perpetual contracts, Bybit has delivered 150% higher liquidity and up to 5x better execution across retail and VIP accounts, firmly establishing itself as the go-to destination for professional trading. Setting a New Height in Crypto Wealth Management As institutional and high-net-worth adoption increases, Bybit is reshaping what wealth preservation means in the digital age. Its newly launched wealth management platform has already surpassed $150 million in AUM, offering curated portfolios and strategic services tailored to sophisticated investors — all underpinned by Bybit’s trading depth and robust security infrastructure. Redefining Real-World Utility: Bybit Card and Payments Another highlight was the new edition of the Bybit Card — now positioned as a crypto-native business card that integrates seamlessly into both corporate and consumer spending. With support for Visa and Mastercard networks, smart security features, and real-time expense tracking, the card bridges the gap between digital assets and daily transactions. Bybit Card is expected to expand into the EU region in August, with Peru and Colombia lined up for Q4. Bybit’s payments infrastructure has also made major strides. Native support for nationwide QR payments in Southeast Asia and LATAM has driven a 719% quarter-over-quarter increase in usage. With over two million users and cross-sector partnerships with local services like Rappi and Vivaticket, Bybit is moving closer to making crypto as usable as “cash”. Introducing Bybit Lite to Earn, Manage, and Trade Zhou unveiled the upgraded Bybit App — a unified platform that streamlines both active trading and passive income generation. Bybit Lite is a new upgraded version for casual users and a reimagined Earn section, offering personalized strategies and simplified ways to activate idle capital. A Key Partner of Mantle 2.0 A major announcement was Bybit’s deepened strategic alignment with Mantle This partnership sets the stage for what Zhou called “a bold new chapter in institutional-grade on-chain finance.” The launch of Mantle 2.0 comes with renewed leadership and tighter ecosystem integration — including Helen Liu , Co-CEO and Partner of Bybit and Emily Bao , Head of Spot and Web3 at Bybit stepping in as key advisors. Together, Bybit, as one of Mantle’s ecosystem partners, will accelerate the development of decentralized finance by aligning infrastructure, liquidity, and governance. The collaboration aims to set new standards for scalability and compliance, while tapping into the growing demand for trust-driven DeFi solutions. Reshaping the Standard With this keynote, Bybit signaled more than just platform growth — it marked a shift in how the industry defines success. Zhou’s message was clear: The next era of crypto will be shaped by platforms that offer trust, usability, and true innovation. “We believe crypto should be usable, secure, and powerful enough to serve everyone — from first-time users to institutional investors,” Zhou said. “Together with our community, we are rewriting the rules and reshaping the space for good.” Watch the full keynote replay here . #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

Reports show the global investment management corporation has added more Ethereum (ETH) to its holdings this week. That is a strong signal and indicates the asset manager’s trust in the top altcoin. When the world’s largest asset manager moves, the market pays attention. But ETH isn’t the only name gaining traction. A new presale called DeSoc is tipped to be the best crypto in 2025 and is getting flooded with early investors. The timing isn’t random. Big players are stacking ETH for larger returns in the future. Retail buyers are stacking $SOCS. BlackRock Isn’t Playing Games BlackRock’s recent move is not a surprise. The company has been bullish on crypto since launching its spot Bitcoin ETF. Now, it is shifting more attention to ETH, which is the leading altcoin in the crypto market. The firm’s ETH ETF, filed earlier this year, is likely pushing this move. More ETH means more support for Ethereum’s overall value. The best part is that, from all indications, BlackRock believes ETH will keep gaining value, as the plan is to further commit. Chart showing the price of ETH DeSoc Presale Attracts Thousands While ETH hits the news, DeSoc is drawing buyers from all corners. Over 50,000 wallets have joined the presale. The project has also raised more than $10 million during the ongoing presale. The token, $SOCS, powers a working product, not just a whitepaper. DeSoc is a social crypto platform. It lets users post once and send that content across major platforms, whether it is X, TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook, or all at the same time. You can earn from tips, views, and ad sharing. It is not just mere promises; the tool is already working, and you can even test it from their website. People want results. DeSoc gives that. It’s not just hype. It’s usable and growing. Why DeSoc Matters in This Market? As BlackRock loads up on ETH, smaller buyers are looking for the next ETH-like opportunity. That’s where DeSoc comes in. It is still in its presale stage, which means you have a good chance of making up to 5x profit when it eventually launches. DeSoc rewards real action when users post content and share links. It’s built for everyday users, not just traders or miners. This and more is why it is the best crypto in 2025 ETH Holds the Floor, $SOCS Builds the Hype ETH’s price is holding steady. BlackRock’s buy shows strength. But gains in ETH might take time. $SOCS, on the other hand, is just getting started. Early buyers have already seen returns above 100%. More gains could come once it lists. The two tokens tell different stories. ETH is the stable long-term hold; on the other hand, $SOCS promises huge gains for early investors. Some buyers are holding both. Want in Before Listing? DeSoc is still in presale, but for a limited time. When it hits public exchanges, the price will likely spike. Don’t sit on this one. ETH has the giants, while $SOCS has the early movers. Both matter. Time’s running out. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

The country’s digital asset custodian, BDACS, recently announced the launch of an institutional-grade custody service for Ripple (XRP). This step is considered the first concrete result of the strategic partnership established with Ripple in February. BDACS stated on Twitter that XRP is one of the most traded digital assets in South Korea. The new custody service provides access to XRP to large institutional investors in a regulated environment. The infrastructure will be provided by Ripple's institutional custody solution, Ripple Custody. This solution is optimized not only for XRP but also for Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD. To increase institutional access, BDACS has completed integrations with Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, three major cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. This development aligns with the South Korean Financial Services Commission's policy to promote the digital asset market. BDACS officials stated, “We will support the growth of not only custody but also tokenization and stablecoin use cases within the XRP Ledger ecosystem.” Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Company Reveals Surprise Altcoin Ownership - The Only Company Investing in This Altcoin According to market research, the global digital asset storage market could exceed $16 trillion by 2030. It is estimated that tokenized assets could account for 10% of global GDP. Fiona Murray, Ripple Asia-Pacific President, highlighted the importance of this partnership, saying, “While the regulatory environment is changing rapidly, institutional demand is also increasing at the same pace.” BDACS CEO Yoo Hae-ri said in a statement, “Together with Ripple's blockchain infrastructure, we will provide a secure and reliable storage environment. Together with Ripple, we will lead the growth of the digital asset industry.” BDACS is already actively involved in the Busan Blockchain Free Zone and is developing partnerships with projects like Avalanche (AVAX) and Polymesh. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrpl-validator-sends-critical-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"A trusted voice in the XRP Ledger community has raised the alarm over growing security risks tied to a new cross-chain airdrop. In a post shared on X, XRPL validator Vet issued a critical warning to XRP holders participating in the Midnight airdrop , a project emerging from the Cardano ecosystem. According to Vet, users must exercise extreme caution, interact only with official websites, never share their XRP account keys, and avoid downloading any third-party software. Midnight Airdrop Draws Interest—And Scammers The Midnight airdrop , which distributes NIGHT tokens to holders of multiple major assets including XRP, ADA, BTC, and ETH, is gaining rapid attention. Designed by Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, this airdrop allows eligible users—those who held at least $100 worth of XRP during a snapshot in June—to claim NIGHT tokens through a portal hosted at claim.midnight.gd. The claim process is currently facilitated through the Xaman Wallet, previously known as Xumm. Careful collecting the Midnight airdrop for XRP holders coming from the Cardano/Charles community. Only interact with the official site, don't share your XRP account keys, don't download any software! Stay extremely vigilant. — Vet (@Vet_X0) August 5, 2025 However, this spike in visibility has also drawn malicious actors. Fake websites, phishing links, and impersonated support agents have begun circulating widely. Vet’s post highlights these threats, warning XRP users not to fall victim to unofficial channels or deceptive prompts. The validator emphasized that the only safe route is through the project’s verified resources. The Rising Risk of Exploits As enthusiasm around XRP’s growing ecosystem intensifies—fueled by tokenization advancements, sidechain integration , and the EVM compatibility —scammers are capitalizing on FOMO (fear of missing out). Vet notes that these exploitative schemes often surge during major events, particularly airdrops, when users may act impulsively without verifying details. Phishing campaigns typically mimic the appearance of trusted platforms to trick users into entering private keys or downloading malicious software. Once compromised, wallets are emptied instantly. Vet’s proactive warning is therefore a vital intervention, urging users to slow down and double-check every step. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Verified Claim Process: What to Know Those eligible for the airdrop are advised to use only the official claim portal at claim.midnight.gd . Access should be made directly—never through third-party links shared on social media or messaging platforms. The Xaman Wallet app should be used in its latest, unmodified version, and users must be especially careful never to input their seed phrases outside the app’s official environment. Importantly, support for the airdrop will only be offered through the in-app helpdesk, not on Telegram, Discord, or unofficial X accounts. A Timely Reminder for the XRP Community Vet’s message comes at a pivotal time. As the XRP Ledger gains momentum and cross-chain interoperability becomes more common, ensuring user security is paramount. The Midnight airdrop represents a significant opportunity—but only if approached with care. This warning serves not to create fear but to foster awareness. With proper caution and a commitment to safety-first practices, XRP holders can benefit from the expanding utility of the ecosystem without falling prey to avoidable traps. In crypto, opportunity and risk often walk hand in hand. Vet’s call for vigilance is a powerful reminder that trust begins with protection.

Trading above key 50-day , 100-day , and 200-day EMAs, with only the 20-day EMA at $3.02 providing minor resistance, XRP demonstrates a resilient bullish structure with a strong institutional foundation. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 20 real-time technical indicators, Japanese ETF developments, the SEC decision timeline, and the Korean institutional custody launch to assess XRP’s 90-day trajectory amid key regulatory inflection between consolidation continuation and explosive breakout momentum. Technical Analysis: Healthy Consolidation Above Key EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.98 reflects a steady +0.78% daily gain from the opening price of $2.96 , establishing a tight trading range between $2.99 (high) and $2.90 (low). This controlled 2.9% intraday range demonstrates institutional accumulation typical of pre-breakout consolidation phases. Source: TradingView The RSI at 50.61 sits in perfect neutral territory with substantial room for upward movement without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal strong positioning with XRP above most major EMAs: 50-day at $2.81 ( -5.9% ), 100-day at $2.60 ( -12.9% ), and 200-day at $2.35 ( -21.1% ), with only the 20-day EMA at $3.02 ( +1.0% ) providing resistance. This structure indicates healthy consolidation within an uptrend. Source: TradingView MACD shows mixed signs at -0.0557 below zero, but a positive histogram at 0.1023 suggests building momentum toward a potential bullish crossover. Volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 79.32 million XRP during consolidation, indicating sustained institutional interest. ATR at 2.20 suggests a high volatility environment with potential for strong moves as regulatory catalysts approach. Historical Context: Steady Recovery Following Summer Volatility XRP’s August performance demonstrates resilience with current consolidation building on July’s explosive rally to $3.10 despite broader market uncertainty. The steady positioning above $2.90 validates institutional confidence in regulatory resolution. January’s $3.40 start, followed by a spring correction to February’s $1.177 and extended consolidation through June at $2.18-$2.21, established a strong accumulation base. July’s breakthrough to $3.10 confirmed the resumption of the bullish structure. Source: TradingView August’s current consolidation between $2.70-$3.00 represents healthy digestion of July gains while maintaining elevation above historical resistance zones. Current pricing maintains a 23.25% discount to the all-time high while securing extraordinary 106,000%+ gains from 2014 lows, showing both remaining upside potential and proven capacity for institutional-grade appreciation through regulatory cycles. Support & Resistance: Strong Foundation Below Current Levels Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $2.90 , reinforced by psychological support and proximity to the 50-day EMA at $2.81 . This confluence provides primary defense with substantial EMA support layers below. Source: TradingView Resistance begins at the 20-day EMA around $3.02 , followed by the July high at $3.10 and major resistance at $3.20-$3.40 . Breaking above $3.02 could trigger momentum acceleration toward these higher targets. The technical setup suggests minimal downside risk with strong EMA support, while upside breakout above $3.02 could trigger rapid appreciation toward $3.20-$3.40 based on ETF momentum and regulatory clarity.

Correction on Regulatory Setbacks (20% Probability) Unexpected regulatory delays could trigger selling toward $2.60-$2.80 support levels, representing 10-15% downside.

ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Regulatory Convergence Creates Opportunity ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals unprecedented convergence of regulatory resolution, institutional ETF adoption, and technical consolidation strength. Next Price Target: $7.00-$10.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.02 resistance to validate continued institutional momentum over consolidation. From there, regulatory clarity acceleration could propel XRP toward $7.00 psychological milestone, with sustained ETF adoption driving toward $10.00+ representing new cycle highs. However, failure to break $3.02 would indicate extended consolidation to $2.70-$2.90 range as the regulatory timeline extends, creating an optimal accumulation opportunity before the next regulatory victory wave.

A substantial 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury has sparked discussions across the digital asset landscape. This significant stablecoin minting event by Circle, the issuer of USDC, holds important implications for the broader crypto ecosystem and its participants. What Does 250 Million USDC Minting Mean? When Whale Alert reports a large sum like 250 million USDC minted , it signals a direct action by Circle, the company behind the USD Coin. Minting, in this context, means creating new USDC tokens and adding them to the circulating supply. This process is typically driven by demand from institutional investors, exchanges, or large-scale users who wish to convert fiat currency into USDC for various purposes within the crypto space. It essentially means new U.S. dollars have entered the crypto economy via this stablecoin. Increased Liquidity: More USDC means more capital available for trading, lending, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Market Demand: Large mints often indicate a growing demand for stablecoins, suggesting capital inflow into the crypto market. Treasury Activity: The USDC Treasury acts as a central hub for these operations, ensuring transparency of the minting and burning process. Why is Circle USDC Minting Significant for the Market? The act of Circle USDC minting such a large amount, 250 million, is not a random occurrence. It typically reflects a direct response to market demand for a stable, dollar-pegged digital asset. This demand can come from various sources, including institutional players looking to onboard significant capital into the crypto ecosystem without direct exposure to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Furthermore, it influences the overall USDC supply , making more of the stablecoin available for use across different blockchain networks. Consider these key points: Institutional Inflow: Large mints can indicate that big money is entering the crypto space, seeking a stable entry point. DeFi Growth: USDC is a cornerstone of many DeFi protocols. Increased supply can support the growth of lending, borrowing, and yield farming platforms. Global Accessibility: USDC offers a fast and efficient way to transfer dollar-denominated value globally, bypassing traditional banking rails. Understanding the Broader Crypto Market Impact How does a large stablecoin minting event truly affect the crypto landscape? The infusion of 250 million USDC can have a ripple effect. For instance, increased USDC availability can lead to more active trading pairs on exchanges, potentially boosting liquidity for other cryptocurrencies. It can also signal a bullish sentiment, as new capital often seeks to deploy into other digital assets once it has entered the ecosystem via a stablecoin. This dynamic contributes to the overall crypto market impact , influencing trading volumes and investor confidence. This flow of funds helps to: Stabilize Trading: Provides a reliable base currency for traders to move in and out of volatile assets. Facilitate Payments: Enhances the utility of stablecoins for cross-border transactions and remittances. Boost Confidence: Demonstrates the ongoing utility and adoption of stablecoins within the financial system. What Does This Mean for the Future of USDC Supply? The consistent activity around USDC supply , including significant mints like 250 million, underscores the growing role of stablecoins in the digital economy. Circle’s transparency reports regarding its reserves back every USDC token 1:1 with U.S. dollar reserves or highly liquid assets, ensuring its stability. This transparency is crucial for maintaining trust and encouraging wider adoption. As the crypto space matures, the demand for reliable stablecoins like USDC will likely continue to grow, supporting various innovative applications from payments to decentralized finance. This ongoing minting activity suggests: Continued Growth: The stablecoin market is expanding, with USDC as a key player. Evolving Utility: USDC is finding new use cases beyond simple trading, including enterprise solutions. Regulatory Scrutiny: As stablecoins grow, so does the attention from regulators, which could shape their future. In conclusion, the recent 250 million USDC minted by Circle, reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a number; it is a clear indicator of sustained demand and growing utility for stablecoins within the dynamic cryptocurrency ecosystem. This event highlights the ongoing flow of capital into the digital asset space and reinforces USDC’s position as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. As the market evolves, understanding these movements becomes vital for investors and enthusiasts alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. It is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one U.S. dollar. It is issued by Circle and backed by reserves of cash and short-duration U.S. government obligations. Why does Circle mint new USDC? Circle mints new USDC primarily in response to demand from individuals and institutions who want to convert U.S. dollars into a digital, blockchain-based equivalent. This often facilitates easier and faster transactions within the crypto ecosystem, especially for trading, lending, and payments. How does 250 million USDC minted affect the crypto market? A large amount of USDC minted , like 250 million, typically indicates an inflow of capital into the crypto market. It increases liquidity, making it easier for traders to move funds and potentially signaling a bullish sentiment as this stablecoin capital can then be deployed into other volatile assets. Is USDC a safe stablecoin? USDC is widely considered one of the most transparent and regulated stablecoins. Circle regularly publishes attestations of its reserves, showing that every USDC in circulation is fully backed. However, like all financial assets, it carries some inherent risks, though generally lower than unbacked cryptocurrencies. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions on various blockchains. It provides real-time notifications about significant movements of digital assets, helping observers understand large capital flows in the crypto space.

With a gain of only 8.9% in the first half of 2025, it had a more subdued start to the year. However, analysts speculate that Ripple could reach $6 in 2025. Although it would need to double from its current price to hit the $6 per token milestone. While it is difficult, it is not impossible. Another crypto making the headlines is Desoc , a project said to be the first blockchain-based social media platform to allow and enable content syndication where users can publish their content simultaneously on both your platform and the world’s most popular social media platforms. Analysts rank DeSoc as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025. Keep reading to learn more. Ripple’s Potential to Reach $5 XRP is currently trading at $3.18 on a downward trend. However, due to the several favorable catalysts it is currently exposed to, XRP does stand a chance at reaching $5. The first driver is the consistent uptake of XRP’s payment options, which is a result of diligent efforts by Ripple, the company issuing it. Currently, Ripple Payments has more than 400 financial institutions connected, and the XRP coin is used in the backend to process live flows in more than 80 markets. Because each new payment corridor requires partners to purchase and then hold onto some XRP as pre-funded liquidity, the demand for tokens rises in tandem with transaction volume. There is also the silent transition of central bank stablecoin pilots from the whiteboard to actual production. At least six additional monetary authorities are experimenting with sandbox initiatives, and stablecoins from Bhutan and Palau already operate on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). It is unlikely that a central bank will later rip out XRP once it has been incorporated into its payment infrastructure, and additional pilot programs are most likely in the works. It’s possible that certain nations will eventually implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC) on the XRPL. All of these make Ripple one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. DeSoc – The Best Crypto to Invest In DeSoc is a decentralized social media platform poised to redefine the digital landscape. The project will enable the integration of major social media platforms through the use of a versatile API; enabling efficient data transfer and synchronization of content across platforms while adhering to each platform’s posting guidelines.

Analyst compares SEI to SUI’s pre-rally setup, forecasting a sharp move toward $4 soon. Futures market heats up near $0.30 while Sei network TVL climbs to $604 million. SEI Declines After Pullback, Now Trading Below $0.29 Sei (SEI) is trading at around $0.29 after falling 3% over the past day and 9% over the past week. Daily trading volume came in close to $209 million, showing that traders remain active even as the token moves lower. SEI has seen steady selling pressure in recent sessions, moving away from the $0.30 level. Technical tools now place the token near its short-term support. Analysts are watching this area for signs of a possible reversal. Analyst Sees Bullish Setup Similar to SUI Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a comparison between SEI and SUI, pointing out a similar structure. According to the chart, SEI may be following the same path SUI did before its rally above $5. “This could be the very last dip before a monster bull rally to $4,” Ali posted on X. Buy the dip! https://t.co/luEyY5nAHx — Ali (@ali_charts) August 6, 2025 Interestingly, the current price of SEI sits below the 0.382 Fibonacci level, while the chart shows SUI had bounced from the 0.236 level in a similar setup. If SEI follows this structure, future levels of interest include $0.95, $1.38, $2.12, and $3.05. Price movement above these zones would require strong momentum and volume support. Sei is also seeing higher network activity. Data shared by Crypto Rand shows that SEI recently passed SUI in daily transactions. This shift in user activity points to steady growth across the Sei blockchain and may reflect stronger demand for its features at this stage. Indicators Show Mixed Signals Amid Consolidation On the 4-hour chart, Bollinger Bands show SEI moving inside a narrow range. The current price is near the middle band, which sits at $0.29. The bands are not widening or tightening, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Source: TradingView In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 46. This is slightly below the midpoint of 50 and signals weak momentum. It is not in oversold territory, but also not showing much buying strength. Futures Market Activity and Network Growth CryptoQuant’s bubble map shows growing volume in SEI futures. Recent data marks several overheating zones near the $0.30 level. While increased activity can lead to rallies, overheating can also trigger short-term corrections if volume comes from leveraged trades. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, Sei recorded over $604 million in total value locked, up 7% in the past 24 hours, according to Defi Llama. The network has also integrated native USDC and Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol V2 (CCTP), aiming to improve liquidity and transfer efficiency.

While uncertainty around tariffs has dulled enthusiasm for riskier plays like meme coins , a 7% bounce since the start of the month could signal a new DOGE uptrend. This move comes as the macro backdrop begins to shift in favor of risk assets. Speculators now expect up to three rate cuts before the end of the year, starting as soon as September.

MORE LIQUIDITY = ALTSEASON pic.twitter.com/0Q8uwjjkrb — Max (@MaxCryptoxx) August 5, 2025 Lower borrowing costs could stimulate new inflows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies, reviving altcoin season sentiment. Could DOGE Be In for a Second, Larger Bull Run? The early August turnaround could signal the second leg of Dogecoin’s bull run, with the technical setup now echoing the first, according to popular X analyst Kriss Pax . DOGE/USDT 4-hour chart, RSI Breaches oversold threshold for the first time since June. Source: X, @Krisspax. Back in June, the 4-hour RSI dipped into oversold territory below 30, and what followed was a 70% rally that carried DOGE to its late July peak. That pattern now appears to be repeating. But this time, the move could be bigger. “Last time the price was $0.14 and now it’s around $0.20. Higher lows lead to higher highs,” Pax noted, suggesting stronger upside potential.

Dogecoin Price Analysis: Biggest Rally Coming? Dogecoin could be in for a bull run continuation as the breakout of a falling wedge opens the door for a return to its late July peak. DOGE / USDT 4-hour chart, falling wedge breakout. Source: TraidingView, Binance. Since Pax’s observation, the 4-hour RSI has bounced back from oversold territory to near neutral at 47, paving the way for a breakout of the wedge as buyers step back in. While the post-breakout momentum has stalled, the upper resistance of the pattern now holds as support. However, this footing could be weak as the MACD teeters on a potential death cross, moving tightly alongside the signal line. This opens the door to another retest of $0.19. A successful bounce from that level could form a double bottom, building a stronger base for reversal. For now, the uptrend shows staying power. If this momentum holds, Dogecoin could continue on the breakout path to $0.25 for a potential 24% gain from current prices. Should that level flip to support, the rally may extend toward the mid-July high at $0.2875 in a 38% gain, clearing a path for a continuation of the bull run. Much like the last time the RSI hit 30, it took a month for momentum to build. August could see continued consolidation as DOGE navigates the effects of new U.S. tariff duties on over 90 countries . Come September, a potential rate cut and the build-up to the spot DOGE ETF decision deadline in October could see renewed inflows.

Following the update, total value locked on Cronos climbed to $710 million, up from $640 million the previous month. ETF speculation has also entered the picture. Crypto.com, in partnership with Canary Capital, submitted applications for a CRO-based exchange-traded fund. While approval is uncertain, the move has fueled discussion about potential institutional inflows. At the same time, transaction volume on decentralized exchanges running on Cronos reached $142 million in July, a sharp increase from June’s $76 million. Market Snapshot and Why It Matters CRO’s price has gained 76 percent over the past 30 days and more than 6.4 percent within the last 24 hours. Chart patterns, including a golden cross and a bullish pennant, may support further upside. Technical projections suggest a possible recovery toward $0.20 if buying pressure continues. Community activity has helped maintain momentum during the altcoin season . Staking on the network continues to attract participation, offering yields that appeal to long-term holders. On LunarCrush, CRO recorded thousands of social mentions in July, indicating strong retail engagement alongside protocol development. Despite recent strength, CRO is trading far below its all-time high of $0.9698 set in November 2021. While the current market structure is more cautious than in prior bull runs, the combination of rising TVL, ETF discussions, and technical support levels gives the token a clear base for continued interest. Cronos now sits in the middle ground. It is not part of the largest market-cap assets, but it has shown resilience and steady improvement through utility upgrades and community traction. Traders watching DeFi activity and ETF headlines may find CRO positioned for further movement as the second half of 2025 develops.

Going with the flow of Solana, Bonk has blazed many of its peers with eye-popping volume and price movements, and the technical recovery and the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem have once again proved the long-term viability of the top meme coin. Nevertheless, above the meme insanity, leading analysts are moving their focus to an emerging competitor- DeSo (Decentralized Social). Having a dazzling vision to transform social media with the help of blockchain, DeSoc has now been forecasted as the greatest beneficiary of 2025, a possible move towards the displacement of tokens becoming large via hype to prospering via use cases. Bonk Proves to be a Top-Rated Meme Coin If you are a crypto enthusiast, you must be familiar with Bonk, the first dog-themed coin on Solana. Bonk has been trading in the greens since the week began, putting smiles on investors’ faces. However, the meme coin is currently trading red at $0.0000321 . Its trading volume is what got investors excited, expanding dramatically at $1.46billion this week. Bonk has experienced an increase in value since its launch, ranking as one of the top meme coins by market capitalization. Based on its current chart, analysts suggest BONK will experience resistance around $0.0000536 and hold key support at $0.000033. Institutions are also showing interest, which could enhance Bonk’s credibility and liquidity. The project is currently seen as a financial movement with a potential for a 10 billion market cap. Yet, DeSoc still seems to be the number one gainer this year. Shiba Inu’s Increase in Value Gets Investors Excited Shiba Inu had a price rally of seven percent in 24 hours early this month, putting SHIB near 0.00001340. Market data shows that it has increased by over 22% in the last month. Although SHIB is currently trading at $0.0000138 , investors are still optimistic. Chartists see a potential double-bottom pattern that could flip resistance at 0.00001400 into support. Shiba Inu recently broke its long-standing bear trendline and formed a bullish pattern, suggesting upside toward $0.000081, an over 500% increase from its current price. Whales have accumulated over 10 trillion SHIB while the price was close to $0.0000116. And there were another 700 billion tokens that came in within two days, showing signs of strong conviction. The project has continued to grow this year, showing signs of potential 8x gains by the end of the year, if the current momentum and trend pattern persist. DeSoc The Dark Horse of 2025 DeSoc is a blockchain technology that is aimed at powering decentralized social media. The project aims at integrating major social media platforms through the use of a versatile API, enabling efficient data transfer and synchronization of content across platforms. All data and content shared on the DeSoc platform are publicly accessible on the blockchain, making it possible for users to verify the authenticity. DeSoc has proven to be a great idea as it is already attracting investors globally. The global DeSoc space is projected to grow to over $100 billion in the decade to come, which highlights massive long-term potential. At the heart of DeSoc lies the utility token, $SOCS. Designed to fuel interactions and incentivize engagement, $SOCS empowers users to unlock a world of possibilities within our decentralized ecosystem. Users on DeSoc will be incentivized to participate actively through various mechanisms such as token rewards, content monetization, and community recognition. DeSoc is one of the leading social-first blockchains, hence it could attract early Web3 social adopters. Join DeSoc on this transformative journey as they pioneer a new era of social media.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $806.26, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,867.35 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the price of solana within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $168.17 (+12.06%) Market Cap $90.6 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $4.05 Billion Circulating Supply 538.53 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $169.30 24-hour Low $161.40 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $162.07 200-Day SMA $161.87 Price Prediction $353.03 (110.48%) F & G Index 22.47 (extreme fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 14-Day RSI 23.76 Solana price analysis: SOL rises above $160 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows recovery to $168 Resistance for SOL is at $170 Support for SOL/USD is at $160 The price analysis of Solana for August 6 shows that SOL has climbed back above $160 as bulls aim for higher levels. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL recovers to $168 Solana faced selling pressure as buyers failed to climb past $210. The bearish trend observed the price falling to $155 before recovering to the $168 level where it trades at press time. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.72, which reflects the recent trend, showing that the recovery pulls the indicator close to the mean suggesting room for higher volatility across the short-term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line rises steadily, suggesting rising buying pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls hold $156 as selling pressure declines The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady decline as the bears aimed to move below the $160 price level. The recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $156 support line before recovering back above $160. Now the price has recovered to $168 as the bulls seek to challenge higher levels. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at 0.71, with the indicator showing rising buying demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL will continue to rise to challenge the $170 resistance level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose to 53.36 indicating that Solana has plenty room for further movement in either direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $156 level to prevent a breakdown towards $150. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 147.30 BUY SMA 5 $ 156.80 BUY SMA 10 $ 169.42 SELL SMA 21 $ 178.13 SELL SMA 50 $ 163.72 BUY SMA 100 $ 162.67 BUY SMA 200 $ 155.26 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 171.04 SELL EMA 5 $ 167.00 BUY EMA 10 $ 158.83 BUY EMA 21 $ 148.62 BUY EMA 50 $ 147.60 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.73 BUY EMA 200 $ 167.68 BUY What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates minor resistance around $190. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price climbs back towards $170, SOL can be expected to break past the level rising towards the $180 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price falls below the $160 level, SOL can be expected to continue holding above the $156 level. Is SOL a good investment?

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-06 19:21:00

Recent trends and developments have led to speculation about a strong upward trend. The attention is focused on Cardano ADA and Ondo . Understanding the factors driving this excitement can be key to predicting their future movements. Discover the reasons behind the anticipated surge. Upbeat Cardano Momentum Amid Mixed Trends Cardano recorded a noticeable 21.81% gain over the past month, while its performance over the last half-year shows a modest change of 1.42%. The coin faced an 8.57% decline in the recent week, reflecting volatility despite the positive monthly trend. Buying interest has picked up, although the six-month performance indicates limited overall growth. This combination of strong short-term gains with minimal longer-term movement suggests shifting market sentiment, prompting traders to look for breakout signals to determine future direction. Current price conditions for Cardano show trading within a $0.54 to $0.94 range, with resistance at $1.14 and support at $0.34. The Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator indicate slight bearish trends, with values at -0.018 and -0.117, respectively, and an RSI of 44.65 highlights a balanced market zone. The lack of a clear uptrend suggests traders watch closely for bullish pressure at $1.14, while $0.34 support provides a safety net against further declines. Traders should consider short-term positions within these levels as market volatility continues. Upward Bounce Amid Long-Term Weakness Ondo coin experienced mixed price action in recent months. A monthly gain of 13.57% contrasts with a six-month decline of 33.13%, showing short-term recovery against longer-term losses. Price fluctuations ranged between $0.71 and $1.15, indicating volatility over these periods. Technical indicators reflected moderate negative sentiment, with the momentum indicator at -0.163 and an Awesome Oscillator of -0.029 highlighting subdued performance. Current price levels indicate that the coin remains in a cautious trading zone. The range between $0.71 and $1.15 is close to resistance at $1.38, with support at $0.51. Bears appear dominant, supported by an aggregate recommendation of -0.42 and a moving average bias of -0.67. The relative strength index at 45.49 suggests neutral ground. Trading calls for a breakthrough above $1.38 for bullish momentum or a drop below $0.51 that may trigger a deeper correction. Caution is advised when placing orders around these levels. Conclusion ADA and ONDO show strong signals for growth. Cardano's network upgrades and partnerships are driving interest. ONDO's innovative approach to decentralized finance is gaining traction. Both projects are well-positioned to attract more attention. Market trends indicate increasing adoption and potential price rises. Investors are keeping a close watch on these coins.

Its network is blazing speed, thriving DeFi protocols, and inexpensive transactions. But there’s a new entrant DeSoc , designing something in secret that could shake up what we presently believe about blockchain practicality. And it’s not sprinting after pace. It’s sprinting after something more: cross-platform compatibility. As investors swamp the SOCS token presale, others are now asking: can DeSoc potentially become the next Solana threat in 2026? Solana: Fast, Scalable, But Still Siloed Solana is renowned for low-gas-fee cryptocurrency transactions and instant execution. It’s a favourite chain for NFTs, games, and DeFi protocols. But as with all Layer-1 giants, it is a walled garden. Applications built on Solana benefit from the speed but don’t cordially talk to other platforms. DeSoc is committed to creating an integrated ecosystem rather than yet another silo. This approach is raising eyebrows. What Sets DeSoc (SOCS) Apart? Rather than another multi-purpose blockchain, DeSoc is developing infrastructure for decentralized social networks. Its flagship product? An authoritative API that enables users, developers, and platforms to transfer social content, data, and identity between chains and apps. That is: No more redrawing your following when changing platforms No more manually reposting the same stuff No more vendor lock-in It’s not just a utility token—it’s the passport to data ownership and social freedom in Web3. Why SOCS Tokens Are Heating Up the Presale Scene The SOCS token is the platform currency behind DeSoc’s platform, used for developer access, synchronizing content, and network participation. It’s already one of the biggest crypto presales of the year, and here’s why: Interoperability at its core – Bridges Web2 and Web3 social platforms Crazy presale traction – Early sale sold out within minutes Utility-focused – No hype; real developer tools and software Privacy-enabled – With zero-knowledge proof and soulbound credentials support Positioned as next 100x crypto – Demand, utility, timing alignment Within a Layer-1 and meme coin-saturated market, SOCS is charting a very different course. Will DeSoc Outperform Solana By 2026? Whereas Solana is performance-focused, DeSoc is focused on solving one of crypto’s least solved issues: fragmentation. With dozens of social apps, wallets, and DApps deploying each month, users are drowning in logins, copied content, and isolated followers. DeSoc solves that. Its API-first approach offers the adhesives that could hold together the next generation of Web3 creators. Developers needn’t pick and choose. DeSoc allows them to build once and deploy to numerous social apps, from Lens to Farcaster to future DeFi-based networks. Users retain control of their identities and content, regardless of platform. This isn’t yet another DApp. It’s a protocol-level solution of lasting importance. Final Thoughts: The Smart Money Is Watching SOCS Solana’s still dominating headlines with its flashy TPS statistics and big-brand collaborations, but don’t overlook what’s happening on DeSoc. The SOCS token presale is the year’s fastest-growing presale, fueled by a genuine solution to a real Web3 problem. For crypto investors looking for the next breakout project, SOCS is not speculation, it’s utility, it’s relevance, it’s ecosystem-level impact. As 2026 nears, do not be surprised if DeSoc appears not as a Solana copycat, but as a category-bending platform unto itself. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

But in 2025, newer projects like DeSoc are taking center stage, and the money as investors prioritize usability, scalability, and utility. Within a few weeks, DeSoc has raised over $10 million in presale capital, and the buzz around its SOCS token is growing by the second. At present, SOCS may seem like a minnow in comparison to Litecoin’s $111 price point and Monero’s $312, but savvy investors know where the momentum is moving. Litecoin and Monero: Robust, But Outdated? Litecoin and Monero both offer battle-tested functionality. Litecoin, with an $8.4 Billion market cap, remains a popular “Bitcoin-lite” alternative, faster and cheaper, to be sure, but nothing revolutionary. And Monero’s focus on private transactions keeps it viable in privacy-minded circles, with a $5.7 Billion market cap. Here’s the thing, though: neither project is evolving fast enough to remain relevant to the trajectory of Web3. Litecoin does not have any meaningful support for smart contracts or modern DeFi use cases. Monero, while private and secure, is increasingly out of touch with mainstream crypto integrations. That stands in comparison to DeSoc, a protocol constructed for the future of decentralized content, identity, and data sovereignty. What Makes DeSoc (SOCS) a Smarter Play? DeSoc isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a fundamentals project tackling one of the biggest pain points in Web3: fragmentation across social platforms. With its interoperable API, DeSoc enables developers, users, and platforms to sync data, posts, and identities across decentralized and centralized networks. The SOCS token powers that ecosystem, acting as the access, data transfer, staking, and participation token. Why SOCS Is Getting Attention: $10M+ raised in record time – Massive early confidence from the crypto community Real utility – Not a meme, but a project developed to solve multi-platform chaos Interoperability built in – Bridges the gap between siloed Web3 and Web2 platforms Low gas fee crypto potential – Optimized for efficiency at scale Touted as the next 100x crypto – Undervalued with high upside It’s Not Just About Privacy Anymore Monero gained fame by offering fully private transactions, but today’s Web3 users demand more than privacy; they want control. Control of identity, data, content, and access. DeSoc delivers that by enabling wallet-based identity, zero-knowledge proof capability, and even soulbound credential support. These characteristics set it up for widespread adoption by developers, creators, and DAOs in addition to privacy maximalists. Meanwhile, the simplicity of Litecoin is becoming a liability. Since newer protocols offer greater utility and steeper adoption curves, it risks becoming lost in the shuffle without the backing of smart contracts or a distinct ecosystem. Why the Smart Money is Moving Into DeSoc Amidst a year of presales and hype, DeSoc stands out as it has already launched a product with demand. The $10 Million+ raised is being put towards infrastructure scaling, onboarding partners, and opening developer access. As more crypto holders seek real-world use cases, staking rewards, and tokens that are tied to platform adoption, SOCS offers a rare mix of fundamentals and forward readiness. It isn’t just a short-term hype train; it’s the kind of project that builds network effect as more social platforms integrate its framework. Final Take: Time to Rethink the Crypto Portfolio Litecoin and Monero still serve specific roles in crypto payments and privacy. But if you’re chasing growth, utility, and future relevance, DeSoc is the smarter investment in 2025 and beyond. Having raised over $10 million, developer adoption is growing, and a token tied to a real-world functional solution, SOCS, is possibly the silent giant that will overcome traditional coins by 2026.

Announced on Tuesday, August 5, the launch marks PancakeSwap’s official entry into the expanding market for tokenized stocks , an emerging sector that blends decentralized finance (DeFi) with exposure to real-world equities. According to the project’s blog, the new contracts are available on its perpetual trading platform, enabling users to go long or short with up to 25x leverage, all while maintaining custody of their funds through a connected crypto wallet on BNB Chain. “Starting today, you can trade perpetual contracts for Apple, Amazon, and Tesla, fully on-chain and directly from your crypto wallet,” the PancakeSwap team wrote in its official announcement . PancakSwap offers on-chain stocks at traditional prices PancakeSwap’s version of stock perps uses price feeds that track the real-time value of publicly traded companies, offering crypto-native users access to traditional financial assets through a decentralized interface. Unlike crypto perpetuals, which are tradable 24/7, the stock-based perps follow U.S. market hours (13:30 to 20:00 UTC), mirroring the trading windows of Nasdaq-listed stocks. The trading experience is designed to replicate high-frequency derivatives trading found on centralized platforms, but without intermediaries. This is part of a broader trend in DeFi that pushes for greater accessibility to traditional finance through composable, decentralized applications. Tokenized real-world assets have taken off Tokenized stocks, in particular, have drawn growing attention from both DeFi developers and centralized players. Last month, U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken revealed the launch of “ xStocks ,” a Solana-based tokenized stock offering that includes assets like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta, although it will only be available to users outside the U.S. Meanwhile, platforms like Aster have already begun offering 24/7 trading of stock perpetuals with up to 50x leverage, including support for a wider variety of U.S. equities. PancakeSwap’s move is a calculated step to expand beyond crypto-native assets and deliver exposure to RWAs directly to DeFi users, especially those underserved by traditional brokerages. On the infrastructure side, this initiative boosts the utility of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which has been actively promoting itself as a fast and low-cost alternative to Ethereum for DeFi apps. Regulatory risks linger Despite the growing enthusiasm for tokenized stocks and on-chain financial products, regulatory clarity remains a concern, especially in jurisdictions like the U.S. Binance, the world’s largest exchange, had to discontinue its own tokenized stock offering in 2021 after regulators from different jurisdictions flagged it for noncompliance with local securities laws. To mitigate these risks, PancakeSwap’s contracts are not tokenized representations of stocks themselves, but instead synthetic derivatives that track their price movements. This distinction may help the platform avoid immediate regulatory scrutiny for now, before regulators intervene or set a clear roadmap.

Sam Altman, founder of the company and the associated Worldcoin (WLD) altcoin, stated in a statement on the X platform that a collaboration with the US General Services Administration (GSA) has been initiated as part of the “OpenAI for Government” initiative. Following the development, the WLD price reversed its decline during the day and rose approximately 3% in the last 24 hours. Chart showing the performance of WLD price during the day.

OpenAI stated in a blog post that this move aligns with the Trump administration's AI Action Plan and aims to reduce bureaucracy. The company noted that employees using ChatGPT in Pennsylvania saved an average of 95 minutes of time per day on routine tasks. In North Carolina, 85% of participants in a 12-week pilot project with the Treasury Department rated their experience positively. Following these developments, another AI company, Anthropic, added its product, Claude, to the GSA list, allowing federal agencies to access Anthropic products at pre-negotiated prices and terms. Meanwhile, the US government has added OpenAI, Alphabet's Google, and Anthropic to its officially approved AI supplier list, according to Bloomberg.

High above $2 just hours before. Panic sets in. Hack VC strikes fast. In the last seven hours, Hack VC claims 1,279,890 MYX from the airdrop claim contract at `0x92216267bFB526e4142d161Bb4D99C4b0e630530`. That haul clocks in at roughly $2.15 million. No hesitation. No second thoughts. First wave: 445,000 MYX heads to wallet `0x259Db7C69DE9bbbf86E82ba8AD0cc5064514FE57`. Sold on-chain. Proceeds: ~$747,000 at an average of $1.68 per token. They hit the bids. They lock in gains. Second wave: 835,000 MYX moves to MEXC via wallet `0x72FB6d06A5DB3931dd33Db2AfE676488c7cE5353`. Deposit price: $1.77. Value: ~$1.48 million. All rails clear. No drama. This looks coordinated. Timed or tactical, it lands exactly as $MYX records its steepest fall. Classic unlock-day play. The dump accelerates the slide. Bears feast. Market response is brutal. From a high above $2, $MYX rocks down to $0.80. It’s a 58% wipeout. Right now, price bounces back to $1.70. Traders hunt for bargains. But confidence is shaken. $MYX Price Action To Monitor On CoinMarketCap , $MYX Finance trades at $1.84, with a 24-hour volume of $266.9 million and a market cap of $289.8 million. It sits at rank #161, floating among mid-caps with thin order books awaiting the next catalyst. Social feeds ignite. On X, EyeOnChain calls it an “Unlock Day Unleashes Bloodbath.” Traders rage. “VC dump,” they tweet. Some cry “rug unlock.” Others tag it “market clearing.” Few defend it as healthy shakeout. Hack VC goes radio silent. No tweets. No AMAs. Their socials dark. Rumors swirl. Was this risk management? Or straight profit grab? Either way, it sets the tone for token unlocks ahead. On-chain analytics spot more big wallets stirring. Several move tokens into sell walls under $1. That spells danger for late buyers. Trap zones form. Only aggressive buys at $1.50–$1.80 keep floors from collapsing deeper. Still, opportunists circle. At $1.70, $MYX trades at a 19% discount from yesterday’s $2.10 peak. Volume spikes on DEXs. Whales nibble. They chase a rebound play. Staking yields and ecosystem incentives still shine. Adoption buzz could flip sentiment. Yet risk remains high. Next month’s vesting cliff looms. More tokens unlock. If another dump wave hits, prices could test below $0.50 territory. And VCs keep stockpiles locked for months. Their moves will dictate price. Unlock Day Bloodbath: Hack VC Cashes Out as $MYX Crashes 58% On the highly anticipated unlock day, #MYX plunged 58%, tumbling to $0.9184 — and Hack VC didn’t waste any time.

Watch three metrics closely: 1. Order Books. Big sell walls under $1. Watch if bids hold. 2. Vesting Schedules. More unlocks mean more supply. 3. Wallet Flows. Follow the whales. Their exits or entries drive price swings. Unlock days always bring drama. This one delivered in spades. Hack VC made a clean exit. Traders got scorched. And $MYX’s trajectory now hinges on whether buyers can absorb the next supply surge. Stay sharp. The next move could hit at any moment. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While broader market indicators are mixed, these three tokens have drawn interest from investors looking for volume, use cases, or yield mechanics. Ethena: Synthetic Dollar Protocol Gains Ground Ethena’s price is around $0.598 with a market cap near $3.96 billion and daily trading volume exceeding $650 million, according to CoinMarketCap. The protocol supports a synthetic stablecoin called USDe. Activity has picked up since launch, with trading and staking demand contributing to increased token circulation. Liquidity data from Curve and Binance reflect daily usage, and July performance showed relative strength compared to larger market peers. Traders continue to focus on Ethena’s dual-token model and staking mechanics. ENA’s recent volatility has not deterred holders, who remain active in governance and liquidity programs. This participation keeps Ethena in focus during altcoin season debates. Sky: Tokenization and Credit Activity Support Value Sky’s price sits near $0.0798, with a market cap of approximately $1.7 billion. Trading volume is modest at around $1.9 million. SKY Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token backs activity on credit-focused DeFi platforms, including those operating on Avalanche. Sky supports decentralized lending pools and tokenized assets tied to real-world credit. The project has not seen the same level of attention as other mid-cap names but remains consistent in use and protocol growth. Though Sky’s price movement has been limited in recent weeks, DeFi activity around its supported protocols has kept the token in circulation. Curve DAO: Stablecoin Liquidity and Trading Depth Curve DAO’s price is near $0.92 with a market cap of around $1.27 billion. Its 24-hour volume is above $220 million. The token underpins one of the largest stablecoin trading platforms in DeFi. Curve volumes remain strong, and the protocol continues to be a key source of liquidity for USDT, USDC, and other stable assets. CRV holders have been active in governance proposals, including fee structure changes and incentive models. While CRV has declined from its all-time highs, it continues to see regular volume and periodic inflows tied to on-chain yield cycles. Altcoin Season Index Remains Steady While Bitcoin dominance remains above 60% , certain assets like Ethena, Sky, and Curve DAO are showing independent momentum. This points to rotation that favors functional protocols and liquidity hubs even when altseason indicators are subdued. Ethena offers synthetic dollar exposure. Sky supports decentralized credit flows. Curve DAO remains central to stablecoin liquidity. Each represents a different angle on altcoin season activity, showing how token flows are now linked to usage and trader behavior. Altcoin season is not in full effect, but selective rotation continues. Traders are watching volume, staking programs, and governance participation as key metrics. Ethena, Sky, and Curve DAO have each shown enough activity to remain part of that conversation.

Stage a welcome for DeSoc , a rapidly rising presale favorite now being talked about by analysts as the “next big thing” in crypto. In weeks, DeSoc has raised more than $10 Million, and its SOCS token continues to attract early adopters, such as a growing tidal wave of SHIB and Dogecoin holders seeking to diversify into projects that are going to last long term. Meme Coins Were Fun, But Investors Are Getting Serious Dogecoin and Shiba Inu produced disastrous returns in past bull cycles. Backed by hype, memes, and social backing, they accumulated gigantic followings. Currently, Dogecoin is still sitting at a $35.6 billion market cap, and SHIB is holding strong at just over $8 billion. But with little or no development under the hood, the question is being asked by many investors: what’s next? The answer could be utility-first tokens like SOCS, activating platforms that tackle real pain points in Web3, starting with how we manage our identities and content online. Why DeSoc Is Gaining Momentum Rapidly DeSoc (Decentralized Social) is not just another blockchain clone. It’s an infrastructure project building an interoperable API connecting centralized and decentralized social networks. It is the middleware of Web3 social, allowing developers and users to move content, identity, and data in any direction across ecosystems. The SOCS token fuels the network, bringing features like content sync, developer permissions, and rewards for users into play. Why Dogecoin and SHIB Investors Are Jumping In: Real use case – Solves a real problem: broken Web3 ecosystems After 100x crypto potential – First mover advantage in a growing market Interoperability focus – Unlike meme coins, it connects platforms instead of entertaining enthusiasts Low gas cost crypto model – Built for scale and longevity Crypto staking alternatives on the horizon – Adds a passive revenue stream to the utility From Meme Mania to Multi-Chain Utility Shiba Inu has tried to grow up with Shibarium, but Dogecoin remains primarily a payment meme. DeSoc is Web3-born instead, and it solves issues far deeper than tipping or trading. It’s about making the user have full control of digital identity, social presence, and data ownership the building blocks of the decentralized internet. Dogecoin and SHIB can remain fun and community-driven, but SOCS offers actual utility that builders, platforms, and DAOs need now. Analyst Buzz: DeSoc’s Ecosystem Could Outscale Meme Coin Utility Crypto analysts are comparing DeSoc’s roadmap to influencers like Lens and Farcaster, but on a broader scale. Rather than competing with existing social DApps, DeSoc integrates them all in one place. This makes SOCS available for long-term adoption, not speculative flip. And the more devs integrate DeSoc’s API, the more demand for its token grows organically, supporting its tokenomics in the long run, a world away from Dogecoin or SHIB’s game of no end supply troubles. Final Word: The Smart Meme Coin Exit Plan? If you gained with meme coins but now want a wiser, more utility-driven next step, SOCS is something to consider. With real-world use, rising presale volumes, and analyst support, DeSoc is perfectly poised as one of 2025’s top crypto investments. And with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu fans already pouring in, the market momentum is just beginning. DeSoc might not bark or meme, but it’s building the groundwork for Web3 social. And that makes it one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

In a new report , VanEck highlights the growth of the Hedera (HBAR) ecosystem, which the firm notes in July, saw a price increase of over 70% due to a “wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization.” VanEck named several examples of notable adoption of the Hedera network in July, including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Project Acacia , which aims to explore the development of Australian wholesale tokenized asset markets. Archax, the first regulated global digital asset exchange in the UK, also announced it would begin using the Hedera network for settlement purposes, VanEck notes. “Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still prelaunch interest in real-world asset tokenization on the network.” And according to VanEck, stablecoin supply has exploded on Hedera. DefiLlama data shows that Hedera’s stablecoins are almost entirely driven by Circle’s USDC. “Hedera’s on-chain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.” Source: VanEck At time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.24 with a market cap of $10.3 billion.

Mutuum Finance stands at Phase 6 and is trading at $0.035. The next price increase will take Mutuum Finance to $0.04 in phase 7. Presale investors at this investment phase will have a return on investment of 71.43% once the token goes live for $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has passed more than $14.1 million raised and welcomed more than 14,800 unique holders. Mutuum Finance could $1 post-launch. While Solana holders keep close watch on significant support levels with positive anticipation, the buzz surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) suggests that there is stronger demand for next-generation DeFi platforms poised to transform decentralized finance as we know it. Solana (SOL) Tests Critical Support as Sentiment Shifts Solana currently trades at $162.45, near significant support levels of $160–$165 following recent drops from highs above $180. Analysts note that support at $160–$162 can firm price up and lay the groundwork for a potential breakout to $180–$200, particularly if the buyers can pick up steam again, though failure here primes additional consolidation into $150–$155. While Solana remains a dominant Layer-1 asset in DeFi and NFT space, investor attention is being drawn progressively toward newer protocols focused on decentralized lending as well as real-world utility, including Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reveals Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has finished its Phase 5 presale and moved into Phase 6, where its tokens can be purchased at $0.035. The next price adjustment will be an additional 14.29% increase to bring the token price to $0.04. Early investors will have a 71.43% ROI as soon as the token reaches $0.06 at launch. The presale of MUTM has already generated over $14.1 million and attracted over 14,800 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Joins Hands with CertiK to Unveil $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is partnering with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program’s reward pool is $50,000 USDT. Four types i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded. The program showcases the vision of Mutuum Finance to build community-driven, safe and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik for user fund security and blockchain security. This is a milestone for Mutuum Finance’s vision of an open and institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Deploys Mass MUTM Token Promotion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a $100,000 giveaway where the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its newly launched leaderboard system will also give rewards to the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders. While Solana struggles to hold support, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors looking for more substantial upside potential. Priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6, the token offers a 71.43% ROI at launch, with over $14.1 million raised and 14,800+ holders already on board. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50K bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, Mutuum Finance is quickly building momentum as one of DeFi’s most talked-about projects. Its innovative dual-lending model and focus on security are setting new standards in decentralized finance.

USDT Transfers Make Up For A Notable Portion Of Network Fees In a post on X, Paolo Ardoino has shared the latest data related to USDT’s transfer fees share on the major blockchains. Transfer fee here naturally refers to the amount that senders have to attach with their network transactions as a reward for the validators. Below is the chart shared by the Tether CEO that shows the trend in the percentage of these transfer fees that users on major networks are paying for making USDT transfers. Nine networks are included here: Ethereum, Tron, Toncoin, Solana, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. From the graph, it’s visible that the 7-day moving average fees share of USDT transfers across these chains recently hit the 40% mark. Fees usage can serve as a proxy for transaction activity, so this high share would indicate strong user interest in Tether’s stablecoin. “Hundreds of millions of people in emerging markets use Tether’s digital dollar USDt daily, to protect their families from local inflation and devaluation of their national currencies,” notes Ardoino. On most networks, the transfer fee is paid using the chain’s native token, even when the transaction involves a secondary coin. For example, ETH is required to make any kind of transaction on the Ethereum network. Since stablecoins like USDT run on blockchains like these, senders also need to own the network’s main token to participate in transfers related to them. Among the chains included in the above data, however, there is one exception: Tron . This year, the blockchain launched a feature that allows users to pay gas fees in other tokens, including USDT. As a result, Tron has established itself as the dominant network when it comes to the supply of the number one stablecoin. “Blockchains that will focus on lower gas fees, allowing paying these in USDT will take over the world,” says the Tether CEO. In related news, the on-chain volume associated with all stablecoins set a new record recently, as institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora has pointed out in an X post . As displayed in the above chart, the combined monthly transaction volume of the stablecoins crossed $1.5 trillion last month, which is a new all-time high (ATH). ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, down more than 4% over the past week.",Tether (USDT)|stablecoin|Tether|Tether Stablecoin|USDT|USDT Fees|USDT Stablecoin,EN,0,0,USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|ARB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 20:00:07

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drops by 9%, even with a 600 million token burn, raising questions among holders. At the same time, XRP (XRP) price forecast is still unclear. XRP remains stable, but a breakout above $3.18 is needed to start a strong rally. A fall toward $2.80 is still possible. While this unfolds, a new top trending crypto is quietly gaining attention: Cold Wallet . It changes the regular wallet idea by giving rewards to users just for being active. By Stage 16, the presale has already brought in over $5.7 million, a strong signal that interest is growing fast. If demand continues to rise, Cold Wallet could be one of 2025’s biggest crypto stories. SHIB Falls 9% After Burn, Support and Resistance Stay Tight SHIB dropped to $0.00001276, its lowest point since July 10, falling 9% for the week. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drops even after a 600 million token burn. This spike in burn rate, up 16,710%, did not lead to a real recovery. SHIB is now stuck between $0.000013184 resistance and $0.000012663 support, without a breakout. Still, a few signs of a rebound are there. Trading volume jumped to 43.5 billion tokens during a small rally. In the final hour, SHIB climbed 0.25%. But if more Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drops follow, some traders may begin watching other memecoins instead. XRP (XRP) Price Forecast Hints at a Breakout or Pullback On July 31, XRP traded between $3.04 and $3.17. It closed the day with a $185.2 billion market cap and $5.3 billion in trading volume. After hitting $3.179 and pulling back, a tight red candle appeared, showing a short pause. A bounce to $3.13 hints that selling might be slowing down. Still, the XRP (XRP) price forecast is unclear. If it moves above $3.18 with strong volume, it could confirm a bullish flag and push toward $3.40 or even $3.66. If the price fails to hold above $3.20, it may head back to $3.00 or $2.80. Why Cold Wallet’s Presale Is Moving Quickly Crypto still offers big potential, but using it has become more frustrating. What once felt like financial freedom now comes with constant fees. Swapping tokens, bridging assets, or moving between crypto and cash often costs more than expected. Cold Wallet is working to fix this by making the wallet itself rewarding. Instead of losing money with each action, users earn CWT, its native token, as cashback. It’s a self-custody wallet that gives users rewards for regular actions that usually come with no return. Currently in Stage 16, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00942. With a launch price set at $0.3517, early buyers are looking at a possible 4,900% return. The project has already raised over $5.7 million within weeks, showing that large holders are entering early. Cold Wallet also bought Plus Wallet in a $270 million deal, bringing 2 million users into its system. This kind of growth points to long-term goals beyond the presale. The CWT token presale is planned over 150 stages, but the speed of interest suggests it might sell out faster than expected. For those looking ahead to 2025, Cold Wallet could be a strong option before it moves out of reach. What’s Gaining Ground as SHIB and XRP Stay Flat The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drops are still weighing on sentiment. Even a large token burn hasn’t been enough to drive a bounce. A few signals suggest SHIB might recover, but there’s not enough strength yet to break out of its narrow range. In XRP’s case, the price is holding near key levels, but the XRP (XRP) price forecast depends on a clear move above $3.18. Without that, both coins remain in uncertain territory with no clear direction for gains. For those seeking bigger returns, the top trending crypto Cold Wallet is getting attention. At $0.00942 in Stage 16, it’s one of the lowest-priced assets right now. With a launch price confirmed at $0.3517, that could mean a 4,900% return for early buyers. More than $5.7 million has already come in, and whales are starting to take notice. As each stage raises the price, the best entry points are closing fast. Those aiming for strong upside might not want to wait much longer.

While crypto heavyweights battle it out for payment supremacy, a new altcoin called DeSoc is focused on decentralized social infrastructure and is quietly going viral. This project isn’t merely social media; it’s building the backbone of Web3 identity, reputation, and monetization. With developers, creators, and even crypto influencers taking notice, momentum is rapidly building. And with early investors already pouring millions into its presale, analysts are now following it as the next 100x crypto contender. Meanwhile, another familiar face, Stellar, is making bullish moves of its own. Stellar’s Bullish Rebound Draws Eyes, But Is It Enough? Stellar (XLM) is back in the game, trading at $0.420 after a massive 70% gain in price in the last 30 days. Its market cap stands at $12.8 billion, with a modest 4.4% rise in trading volume at $816.56 million. The platform, which has traditionally been recognized for providing fast, cheap cross-border payments, is once again attracting fintech communities and investors seeking stability. Here’s the thing, however: Stellar solves fundamental payment issues, but it’s finance-only. The crypto space is also evolving beyond transactions into identity ownership, creator monetization, and Web3 social tools, a realm Stellar isn’t built for. That’s where DeSoc comes in. Why DeSoc Is Getting Viral Traction DeSoc (short for Decentralized Social) is also getting viral traction because it’s tackling one of the most overlooked frontiers in crypto: building a shared social layer between Web2 and Web3. Its native SOCS token powers a growing ecosystem that helps developers and creators bridge identity, data, and influence across platforms like Twitter, Farcaster, Lens, and others. It’s not another token, it’s infrastructure, and investors are taking note. DeSoc has already passed $10 million in its ongoing presale, and momentum is growing by the second. Here’s why SOCS is turning heads: Cross-platform compatibility: Identity sync between Web2 & Web3 Web3 developer-friendly API infrastructure Privacy-first user data architecture Creator monetization tools across platforms Crypto staking rewards for long-term SOCS holders This is Web3 social without the fragmentation, just seamless connection and value transfer. XLM vs. SOCS: Two Different Visions Of Utility Stellar is a veteran in financial inclusion that’s well-suited for individuals and institutions looking for quick remittances and stable payments. However, its growth trajectory could already be factored in. After all, how far can Stellar fly without breaking beyond the financial industry? DeSoc , however, is solving Web3’s biggest issue, interoperability and ownership in the social space. Just like Stellar changed how money moves, DeSoc is changing how influence, identity, and content move. The market seems to agree. With XLM already nearing its short-term resistance, SOCS tokens are being unloaded swiftly while still at presale rates, providing a first-mover advantage for early buyers. Final Word: The Next Big Crypto Might Not Be A Payments Token Stellar is rising and deservedly so. But if you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now, DeSoc offers something more exciting than a price pump: infrastructure that enables the next generation of Web3 applications. As decentralized identity, creator economies, and social tokens explode in 2025 and beyond, projects like DeSoc won’t just participate, they’ll lead.

While global players are already adapting to the changes, which require serious investments in legal and technological capacity, small domestic platforms in Poland find compliance costs prohibitive. MiCA may push Polish exchanges out of business Poland’s cryptocurrency market, one of the largest in Central and Eastern Europe, is preparing for an unprecedented transformation that has the potential to seriously affect local businesses, the Bitcoin.pl portal noted in an article this week. As many as 90% of cryptocurrency exchanges in the country could cease operations by the end of 2025, the crypto news outlet warned, quoting industry watchers. MiCA, the European Union’s common regulatory framework for crypto assets, and the “astronomical costs of complying” with the new requirements, including Polish ones, will cause a “wave of closures” in the sector, the website predicted. Under the EU regulation, providers of crypto-related services across the bloc are now obliged to abide by strict unified rules, but the associated expenses may vary significantly from one member state to another. Obtaining a license in Poland would cost an applicant between 1.5 and 3 million Polish złoty (roughly $400,000 – $800,000), and that’s not even the full bill yet. Crypto firms must also raise at least €500,000 (over $580,000) in the form of initial capital and implement advanced compliance and reporting systems, the report highlighted. These requirements are impossible to meet for small to medium-sized crypto exchange offices that have until now operated on the fringes of the financial market, the author insisted. The owner of one such office in Warsaw, who asked not to be named, put it even more bluntly: “This is a death sentence for local players. We can’t afford millions of złotys for licenses and an army of lawyers.” Big players are likely to benefit, both in Poland and the EU At the same time, large international players in the crypto trading space, and those funded by foreign capital, are well-positioned to weather the upcoming regulatory change. Global platforms, the likes of Binance and Coinbase, are already adapting to the new MiCA regulations which surely involves investing in legal and tech teams, Bitcoin.pl remarked. And while investors will gain greater protection for their interests and funds, under the watchful eye of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority ( KNF ), the market consolidation will certainly result in less competition and higher fees, if not limited access to services. This is, in fact, a pan-European trend, with similar developments in leading EU economies such as Germany and France, where smaller market participants are also going out of business, although the lack of clear regulations in Poland is exacerbating the process. Polish lawmakers are currently debating a controversial bill that has been criticized by the local crypto community as going beyond the MiCA standards. The draft law, submitted by the government in early July, was recently passed by the Sejm on first reading. A dedicated committee is now being formed in the lower house to oversee the regulatory effort. The crypto task force comprises members of various political parties and deputy ministers responsible for digital affairs and technology development. Avoiding overregulation and reducing the burden of fees for entities engaged in the industry are among its main goals, along with removing barriers to cryptocurrency investment and attracting crypto capital to the country that will translate into bigger budget receipts. In any case, Poland’s “crypto Wild West,” with its large number of businesses operating in the shadow economy, seems to be coming to an end. The transition period for MiCA compliance is set to expire at the end of December when Polish crypto platforms will have to decide whether to stay or leave. And not all see that as a negative. “This isn’t the end … We will finally be able to compete with traditional financial institutions on an equal footing,” argued a representative of a major Polish exchange which is planning to remain in the country.

According to posts on X, Brandt, a septuagenarian with more than 800,000 followers, lashed out at those who “hodl” through thick and thin.

Some praised his honesty. Others snapped back with equally harsh words. Others defended Bitcoin as more than charts and price swings. The back-and-forth underscored a split: traders who focus on risk and charts versus holders who see crypto as a movement. Community Pushback On X Across the crypto world, Brandt’s comments stirred a wave of reactions. According to data on social media engagement, his post attracted hundreds of replies within hours. Many messages mixed humor and anger, with memes featuring pizza and margin calls. Others pointed to Bitcoin’s gains this year, noting it has climbed more than 50% since January. That rise fueled confidence among hodlers—and a readiness to push back against Brandt’s barbs. Despite the heat, Brandt held his ground. He pressed on, saying that tying one’s identity too closely to Bitcoin’s price is a mistake. His warning was an echo of a broader caution in trading circles: markets can turn on a dime. Brandt’s straight talk cut through hype and spin, but it also risked widening the gap between chart watchers and true believers.

Zuccàra’s post suggested that a new decision from Judge Analisa Torres was still pending and framed August 15 as a definitive legal deadline. Morgan explained that Judge Torres’ role in the case has concluded, and the remaining steps are procedural matters between Ripple and the SEC, no longer involving the court. Clearing Up the Confusion Morgan emphasized that there is no decision left for Judge Torres to make. “Judge Torres’ role is over,” he wrote, addressing the widespread misconception. According to Morgan, the only action pending is for the SEC commissioners to vote on dismissing their appeal. Ripple has already publicly committed to dismissing its appeal. The contains inaccuracies. There is no decision pending from the Court. Judge Torres’ role is over.

Ripple already… https://t.co/ZTQozwlVv9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) August 5, 2025 Previously, both the SEC and Ripple had signed a conditional settlement agreement that required the mutual withdrawal of appeals. However, when the court declined to approve the parties’ request to modify the injunction and reduce the civil penalty, the terms of the agreement were not satisfied. While both appeals are still technically active, they are expected to be withdrawn. What August 15 Really Means Morgan also clarified that August 15 is not a deadline for dismissing the appeals , as Zuccàra’s post had implied. Rather, it’s the date by which both parties are expected to submit a joint status report to the appeals court. He noted that while it is more likely than not that the appeals will be dismissed before that date, the parties could request another extension, although he considers that unlikely. “The dismissal of the appeals may happen before August 15,” Morgan explained, “but 15 August is not a deadline on the parties to dismiss their respective appeals.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Path to Final Resolution With Ripple having paid its $125 million penalty into escrow and stating its intent to end its appeal, all eyes are now on the SEC’s internal vote. Once that occurs, the parties can file the paperwork necessary to formally end the long-running case. Until then, both appeals remain legally active. Morgan’s clarification directly contradicts the framing in Zuccàra’s post and helps refocus public understanding of where things stand. He stressed that any remaining developments are purely procedural, hinging on the SEC’s next move. Legal Closure Nears While many in the XRP community had anticipated that August 15 might bring the final word from the court, Morgan’s update serves as an important reminder that the court’s role is finished, and formal closure now rests with the SEC and Ripple. If the SEC votes to drop its appeal—as is widely expected —the parties could file dismissal notices well before the August 15 status report. Bill Morgan’s post provides much-needed clarity and corrects the misleading narrative. Until those final steps are taken, both appeals remain on foot—but the path to resolution appears closer than ever.

Just as market dynamics influence crypto adoption, the flow of website traffic dictates the health of online content. Recent reports have sparked concern across the internet, suggesting that Google’s advanced AI search features and the proliferation of AI chatbots are significantly impacting content creators and digital publishers . However, Google recently offered a counter-narrative, challenging these widespread anxieties. Google’s Stance: Debunking the Decline in Website Traffic ? Google, the undisputed titan of online search, has directly addressed claims that its integration of AI is “killing” traffic to publisher sites. Liz Reid, Google’s VP and Head of Search, asserted in a recent blog post that total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has remained “relatively stable” year-over-year. Furthermore, Google suggests that the average click quality has even seen a slight increase. This statement directly contradicts numerous third-party studies that point to dramatic declines, often attributing discrepancies to “flawed methodologies” or data preceding the full rollout of AI features. While Google hasn’t provided specific data to substantiate these claims, the narrative focuses on a shift rather than a collapse. Reid acknowledges that “user trends are shifting traffic to different sites,” leading to both gains and losses for individual publishers. The key takeaway from Google’s perspective is that the aggregate volume remains steady, even if the distribution changes. Are AI Search Features Reshaping Content Consumption? The core of the debate lies in how AI search features , particularly Google’s “AI Overviews,” are changing user behavior. These AI-generated summaries appear at the top of search results, often providing answers directly on the search page, potentially reducing the need for users to click through to external websites. Google also allows direct interaction with an AI chatbot for certain queries, further internalizing the search experience. Critics argue that these features cannibalize clicks that would otherwise go to publishers. While Google denies a significant reshaping of the search landscape due to AI alone, it points to broader user shifts. For instance, Google notes an increasing trend where users seek out forums, videos, podcasts, and posts for “authentic voices and first-hand perspectives.” This suggests a migration of initial queries away from Google.com itself. Consider these points on evolving search behavior: Direct Answers: AI Overviews provide immediate answers, potentially reducing click-through rates. Chatbot Interaction: Users can get information directly from Google’s AI chatbot. Platform Preference: Users increasingly start their information-seeking journey on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, and Reddit for specific types of queries (e.g., lunch spots, shopping, product reviews). The Broader Context: Google Search ‘s Evolving Role Google’s current defense isn’t entirely new. The company has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the results page. This long-term strategy predates the widespread integration of generative AI. As early as 2022, a Google SVP admitted that social platforms like TikTok and Instagram were already eating into Google’s core products, including Search and Maps, especially among younger demographics. Similarly, Amazon has long been the go-to for shopping searches, and Reddit for niche research. Google’s efforts to retain users, such as making Shopping listings free for merchants or adding a “forums” filter (originally “Reddit”), demonstrate a proactive response to these shifting user habits. It suggests that while AI is a new variable, the challenges to traditional Google Search traffic have been brewing for some time. Perhaps AI is accelerating an existing trend rather than initiating a new one. The Impact on Digital Publishers : Quality Over Quantity? Google’s new narrative also attempts to shift the goalposts from click quantity to “click quality.” The company claims it’s sending “slightly more quality clicks” to websites than a year ago. A “quality click” is defined as one where users don’t quickly bounce back, indicating they stayed and engaged with the content. While Google hasn’t specified the exact increase, it suggests that clicks originating from an AI response, when they do occur, are more valuable because users are more likely to “dive deeper.” This perspective, however, faces scrutiny from digital publishers . Reports like one from Similarweb indicate a concerning trend: the number of news searches resulting in zero clicks to news websites rose from 56% (when AI Overviews launched in May 2024) to 69% by May 2025. This suggests a significant portion of users are getting their answers without leaving Google, regardless of the “quality” of the few clicks that do go through. Google attempts to frame AI as an opportunity, stating that “with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before,” implying “more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.” Yet, the data from publishers often tells a different story. Navigating the Future: Opportunities Beyond Traditional AI Overviews Recognizing the challenges faced by publishers, Google has also launched initiatives to help them monetize their traffic in ways that don’t solely rely on advertising, such as micropayments or direct sign-ups. This move, ironically, could be seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the pressure on traditional ad-supported models due to declining click-through rates, even if Google denies a drastic aggregate traffic decline. For digital publishers , the situation necessitates adaptation. Diversifying traffic sources, focusing on unique, in-depth content that AI struggles to replicate, and building direct audience relationships become more critical than ever. The future of online content may hinge less on volume of clicks from search engines and more on direct engagement and value creation for a loyal audience. Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of Online Discovery Google’s denial regarding the impact of AI search features on aggregate website traffic presents a complex picture. While Google asserts stability and increased click quality, the concerns from digital publishers and third-party data highlight a significant shift in how users discover and consume information. The rise of AI Overviews , coupled with pre-existing trends of users starting queries on social media or e-commerce sites, suggests that the traditional search landscape is indeed undergoing a profound transformation. Publishers must continue to innovate and adapt, building robust strategies that transcend sole reliance on conventional search engine referrals, ensuring their content reaches audiences in an increasingly fragmented digital world.

But Pump.fun’s recent resurgence shows that competition remains unpredictable. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko acknowledged the shift on X, writing, “Competition never ends.

Their rise has turned Solana into one of the most active chains for community-driven token creation, pushing daily on-chain volumes and user activity to new highs. The question now is whether Pump.fun can hold the lead. While its latest numbers are strong, the meme coin launchpad space remains volatile, and dominance can change in a matter of days. For now, Pump.fun has pulled ahead, but as the last month has shown, in Solana’s meme coin wars, nothing stays still for long. Pump.fun Token Outpaces letsBONK.fun Token Amid Shifting Sentiment in Solana Meme Coin Market Pump.fun is showing signs of renewed momentum in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, with its $PUMP token emerging as one of the market’s top performers.

At $3.04, having fallen 5.63% over the last 24 hours, XRP nevertheless holds a monstrous $180 billion market cap firmly in the top tier of digital assets. Possessing legal certainty on its side and global banking interest still accumulating, some analysts have $5 in their sights by the end of the year. But while XRP holders debate timelines and price limits, the next train of interest is looking to a newer altcoin called DeSoc , which has quietly amassed more than $10 million in weeks. And for once, this one is working on a genuine Web3 utility problem, not another copycat payments solution. XRP Still Dominates the Banking Narrative Ripple’s focus on cross-border payments and banking infrastructure gives it a unique use case that few projects are able to match. It is cheaper and quicker than SWIFT, and its XRPLedger continues to improve. But where XRP excels in transaction utility, it lags in ecosystem diversity. It is not going to revolutionize Web3 identity, content ownership, or platform interoperability the spaces many believe will define the next crypto wave. And that’s where a fresh project is truly gaining traction. The Emergence of SOCS: A Token With Real Utility While XRP keeps the fintech world on its toes, DeSoc is quickly making waves in the Web3 infrastructure space. Its native token, SOCS, is currently in the middle of a nascent presale that has already surpassed the $10 million mark. Rather than trying to be another payments layer, DeSoc is building something different: a universal API for interfacing decentralized and centralized social platforms. That means: Developers write once and deploy to many platforms Users control their social data, followers, and digital identity Platforms plug in easily without user silos It’s Web3 glue, and SOCS is the fuel that makes it possible. Why SOCS Is Getting International Notice Unlike most altcoins that are built on hype cycles, SOCS is gaining momentum for what it really delivers. It is being referred to as one of the best cryptos to buy today by analysts, who appreciate the unique combination of technical foundations and quickly gaining presale traction. Here’s why SOCS is gaining traction: Cross-platform sync: Content, identity, and followers unified API-first design: Devs’ first, traders’ second Web3-native innovation: Not just solving problems, but creating solutions Efficient low gas fee crypto model for fast, effective interactions Potential for crypto staking and potential future network rewards While platforms like Lens and Farcaster build in silos, DeSoc is offering a bridge that brings them all together. The $5 XRP Dream vs. The Early Entry SOCS Opportunity Yes, XRP could hit $5 if the macro is positive. But for most crypto investors, the real alpha lies in early-stage entries, especially those that have product-market fit. SOCS is in presale, meaning that early adopters have room to position before listings and wider exchange exposure. And while XRP’s growth may be tied to institutional adoption, SOCS is tapping into grassroots Web3 devs, DApps, and creator tools, the crowd that made Ethereum and Solana household names. Final Word: Two Paths, One Future XRP and SOCS represent two powerful, but very different crypto visions. One is built for banks. The other is built for builders. If you’re bullish on crypto that powers global payments, XRP still has room to grow. But if you’re looking for the next 100x crypto one designed to unify the decentralized web then SOCS might just be the token worth watching in 2025 and beyond.

He says the court has no legal authority over him because he lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). CZ’s Defence According to a Bloomberg report, his legal team submitted the motion on Monday to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that the accusations fall outside the court’s reach. “The claims are so far removed from Delaware and even the United States that the statutes at issue, which lack extraterritorial application, do not even apply,” his lawyers wrote in the filing. Lodged in November 2024, the lawsuit accuses Zhao, Binance, and several former executives of receiving billions of dollars in funds that were wrongfully moved by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). It focuses on a July 2021 deal where the exchange sold back its equity in FTX’s international and US-based entities. According to the trust, Binance held a 20% stake in FTX’s international unit and 18.4% in the U.S. arm. Court records show that Alameda Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, transferred the funds for FTX. On the other hand, the Binance entities involved were registered in Ireland, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands. CZ’s legal team argues this makes the transaction foreign and outside the reach of U.S. bankruptcy laws. They also claim he was a “nominal counterparty” in the deal, meaning he was not deeply involved in the process. Zhao’s submission also described the relationship between FTX and Binance as only temporary. They ended their partnership due to personal disagreements, after which Binance’s equity in Bankman-Fried’s business was exchanged for cryptocurrency. The crypto entrepreneur claims the lawsuit unfairly blames him and Binance for the collapse of FTX, which he described came about as a result of SBF’s misconduct. He also argued that serving legal papers through U.S.-based lawyers is not valid under bankruptcy law when the defendant lives abroad. His team says the trust is trying to stretch its claims beyond U.S. borders in ways that are not supported by the law. They say the fraud claims do not meet the standards required for protection under federal rules tied to securities contracts. Former Binance Executives Also Seeking Dismissal This development follows similar motions filed last month by former Binance executives Samuel Wenjun Lim and Dinghua Xiao, who are also named in the FTX suit and are seeking to be removed from the case. CZ completed a four-month prison sentence in September last year after pleading guilty to U.S. anti-money-laundering violations. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is serving 25 years for fraud and conspiracy. Elsewhere, the defunct exchange announced it will start distributing the next batch of creditor claims on September 30. As of August 2025, it has returned approximately $6.2 billion to former customers across two major rounds.

Expert Reveals Strategy’s Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-the-bitcoin-bull-run-in-jeopardy-expert-reveals-strategys-alleged-plan-to-sell-all-btc-holdings/,"Despite the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price correction after a significant rally that propelled the cryptocurrency to a record high of $123,000, some analysts remain optimistic about the potential for a renewed bull run. However, one expert has raised a concerning warning that could signal the end of this bullish cycle. Fears Of Mass Sell-Off According to market expert OxArtikal’s thesis shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Michael Saylor’s Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is reportedly planning to sell all of its Bitcoin holdings by 2025. This revelation comes amid movements of their substantial Bitcoin reserves to different wallets, raising alarms about the potential implications for the market. Related Reading: XRP Soars 35% in a Month: Will Ripple’s Legal Win and Whale Activity Send Price to New Highs? Strategy currently controls over 628,000 BTC, representing more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. For context, the collapse of FTX, which held approximately 20,000 BTC, triggered a significant downturn in the market. The expert believes that the potential sale of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings could have a dramatically larger impact, estimated to be 30 times more severe. Notably, Saylor has long maintained that Strategy would never sell its Bitcoin. However, the expert identified that in late June, the company quietly transferred 7,382 BTC—valued at nearly $800 million—out of its wallets and into three new wallets with no prior transaction history. This Bitcoin was subsequently sent to Coinbase Prime, a sell-side custodian, without any public announcement or clarification during the company’s Q2 earnings report. If Strategy were to liquidate even a small portion of its holdings, the psychological ramifications could be profound, OxArtikal further stated. He shared that this could lead to a mass sell-off, while institutional investors could reconsider their BTC allocations. Bitcoin Could Crash Below $70,000 Historically, Strategy’s actions have coincided with significant market shifts. In 2022, the company transferred 34,000 BTC to secure a loan, shortly before a major market crash. Now, as they appear to be moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin again, the expert fears that a similar scenario could unfold. OxArtikal asserts that sell-off by Strategy could potentially drive the price below $70,000 within days, undermining the retail comeback and deterring new investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term safe haven. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory—Top Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust While it is not confirmed that Saylor will sell his holdings, the signs are troubling: the recent wallet movements, the involvement of Coinbase Prime, and a lack of transparency during earnings calls all point to a potential shift in strategy. If Strategy were to exit the Bitcoin market, the expert claims that it wouldn’t merely result in a correction; it could trigger a market-wide reset, erasing years of built-up trust and confidence in Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto news|cryptocurrency|Microstrategy|MicroStrategy bitcoin holdings|MicroStrategy news|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-06 21:01:52

Drawing attention to the long-term potential of Bitcoin, Krueger also shared his views on Ethereum and Solana. Krueger noted that Ethereum's market capitalization is one-fifth that of Bitcoin, adding, “It's possible that Ethereum could perform as well as Bitcoin or even surpass it in the next 12 months.” However, he added that Solana, despite having a smaller market capitalization (one-25th that of Bitcoin), has a stronger active user base than ETH. Related News: Details About Ripple-South Korea Partnership Revealed - Ripple Asia President Makes Statement The analyst stated that Bitcoin has a “clear roadmap” to reach $1 million and that he will stick to his strategy in this area. Krueger, taking a more reserved stance on ETH, said, “I don't necessarily have an opinion on Ethereum.” Krueger, who thinks that Solana will stand out especially when it comes to the mass adoption of stablecoins, said: “When stablecoins truly become mainstream, it will be on Solana, not ETH. No one uses MetaMask to switch between Ethereum layer 2s to get coffee at Starbucks. But I can see them using Solana with USDC.” *This is not investment advice.

49657101,550026,1754514190,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49657101.jpeg,Is The Era Of Bitcoin Treasuries Coming To An End? Galaxy Digital CEO Weighs In,https://bitcoinist.com/is-the-era-of-bitcoin-treasuries-coming-to-an-end/,"In the wake of recent regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration, Bitcoin Treasury companies have surged to prominence in the cryptocurrency landscape. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin proxy firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), both publicly traded and private firms have increasingly adopted this approach. As of now, Strategy is the public company with the largest Bitcoin stash, with over 600,000 coins. However, not all industry experts share an optimistic outlook. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, recently suggested that the peak of treasury company issuance may already be behind. Challenges Ahead For New Bitcoin And Crypto Treasury Entrants During Galaxy Digital’s second-quarter earnings call, Galaxy Digital CEO stated , “We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” raising questions about the future landscape of these firms. Novogratz, who took its company public back in May in the US, emphasized that attention should now shift to which existing companies could emerge as significant players in the market. Highlighting the growth of Ethereum, the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Novogratz pointed to two major treasury holders: Tom Lee’s BitMine and Joe Lubin’s SharpLink. BitMine Immersion Technologies, for instance, has made headlines with its substantial ETH holdings, which recently surpassed $2.9 billion. As of August 3rd, BitMine reported a total of 833,137 ETH, valued at approximately $3,491.86 per token, making it the largest Ethereum treasury globally and the third largest crypto treasury overall. Thomas Lee, Chairman of BitMine’s Board of Directors, noted the firm’s rapid ascent in the crypto space, stating, “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’.” In parallel, SharpLink Gaming has also made significant strides in Ethereum accumulation, purchasing an additional 83,561 ETH for $303.7 million between July 28 and August 3. This acquisition raised SharpLink’s total ETH holdings to 521,939 tokens, valued at over $1.9 billion. The firm successfully raised $264.5 million from the sale of 13.6 million shares, following a prior raise of $279.2 million the week before. SharpLink has also reported a notable increase in its ETH Concentration metric, which rose by 7.6% week-over-week and an impressive 83% since June. Novogratz anticipates that these firms will continue to expand, although he cautioned that new entrants might face significant challenges in gaining traction in an increasingly competitive environment. Galaxy Digital’s $2 Billion Crypto Treasury Galaxy Digital has positioned itself as a key player in this emerging sector, collaborating with over 20 crypto treasury investment firms . This network has contributed approximately $2 billion in assets to Galaxy’s platform, generating recurring income that Novogratz describes as sustainable. Despite the growing interest in crypto treasury companies fueled by a more favorable regulatory climate in the US, Novogratz’s cautionary perspective raises important questions about the sustainability of this trend. While pro-crypto legislation continues to evolve, fostering a wave of bullish sentiment, the market has also recently experienced price corrections following earlier rallies. This is also an important topic as experts have cautioned that substantial corrections in crypto prices could pose additional challenges for Bitcoin and crypto treasury companies.

Apple’s 5% rally helped pull the indexes into positive territory, but AMD, Snapchat, and Super Micro Computer all crashed after disappointing earnings. The S&P 500 surged by 0.73% to 6,345.06, pushing the Nasdaq to 21,169.42 after a 1.21% climb. The Dow Jones barely moved, though, rising 81.38 points, or 0.18%, to settle at 44,193.12. That bounce came after a series of red days. Before Wednesday, the S&P 500 had dropped in five of its last six sessions. The Dow was also coming off six losses in the past seven trading days. But the boost from Apple flipped the narrative, at least at the index level. AMD falls after weak numbers and China worries Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) dropped more than 6% on Wednesday after it posted earnings that came in below what analysts had predicted. The chipmaker said it earned 48 cents per share on an adjusted basis. That missed the 49-cent forecast by analysts tracked by LSEG. AMD also didn’t give any solid timeline on when it would restart shipments to China, which added more pressure. Over in Santa Clara, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got hit even harder. The server and hardware firm saw its stock nosedive 18% after it missed both revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Super Micro said it pulled in 41 cents per share, down from the 44 cents analysts had expected. Revenue came in at $5.76 billion, falling short of the $5.89 billion Wall Street was looking for. CEO Charles Liang told investors that they’ve already “taken measures to reduce the impact” of tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump. During the earnings call, David Weigand, Super Micro’s CFO, said, “With respect to the tariffs, the situation is dynamic. We’re actively monitoring the tariff environment. We know there’s news coming out next week. If we have any updates, we’ll share them with you, but we can only watch and react as every other business is.” That didn’t calm the selloff. Snap loses 18% as ad revenue disappoints Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, also had a rough day. The stock dropped 18% after reporting second-quarter numbers on Tuesday evening. The company said advertising revenue rose just 4% year-over-year to $1.17 billion, falling below the $1.22 billion that Bloomberg said Wall Street was expecting. Snap’s leadership admitted that a technical problem hit their ad auction system, which sets prices for campaigns. During the investor call, the team said the issue caused many campaigns to be sold at “substantially reduced prices.” That glitch cost them real money. Investors weren’t patient. Even though these tech names were crashing, other corners of the market looked stronger. McDonald’s rose nearly 3% after delivering second-quarter earnings that beat both top and bottom line estimates. The company reported that same-store sales increased at the fastest rate in almost two years. Arista Networks also had a strong day, jumping 17% after beating expectations. Still, earnings season has been off to a good start overall, so far. Out of all the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 81% have beaten Wall Street’s expectations. That stat came from FactSet, and it helped explain why the broader market managed to finish higher, even with major losers in the mix. Bank stocks also got a small boost after reports about a potential executive action from Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the president is planning to sign an executive order this week that targets “debanking.” The rule would make it illegal for banks to drop clients because of political views, and could come with penalties for doing so.

According to CasiTrades, this support has proven resilient, with buyers stepping in repeatedly to defend it. XRP Approaching Breakout – What to Watch For! $XRP is currently hovering just below the key $2.96 level. The .382 Fibonacci retracement. For about 20 hours, this level has been strong resistance, capping all bullish attempts. Local support is at $2.915, which marks the… pic.twitter.com/Kli21RvZSA — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) August 6, 2025 Structurally, there has been no breakdown in price action . Instead, the chart continues to suggest that the market is consolidating just under resistance, building momentum for what could be a sharp upside move. Importantly, short-term charts are still printing bullish divergence on the RSI. This indicates that, despite a minor lower low, sellers are losing strength and a new downtrend is not yet forming. The RSI signal, coupled with strong support at the .5 retracement, suggests that bullish energy is accumulating. The $2.96 resistance level has thus become the fulcrum of attention. A confirmed breakout above this line, particularly if retested and held as support, would be a strong technical signal that the bulls have regained control. Momentum Building Ahead of Key Breakout Zones If $2.96 is reclaimed and flipped to support, traders and analysts alike will turn their focus to the next upside targets—$3.21 and $3.41. These levels represent historical resistance and Fibonacci extension areas from previous impulse legs. A clean break of these points could open the door to higher targets, with $3.65 and even $4.40 seen as potential medium-term objectives, especially if ETF narratives and broader market sentiment continue to turn in XRP’s favor. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding to the bullish case is the broader context of strong whale accumulation and reduced exchange inflows, signaling long-term confidence among large holders. Over the past month, XRP has gained nearly 35%, supported by legal clarity surrounding Ripple’s operations and increasing speculation around institutional interest, particularly following SBI Japan’s recent filing for an ETF that includes XRP exposure. The Moment of Truth Despite the bullish momentum, the market remains at a decision point. Failure to reclaim $2.96 would likely result in more range-bound trading, and a breakdown below $2.915 could expose the token to further retracement towards $2.80 and $2.65. These lower zones align with key volume-weighted average price (VWAP) levels and longer-term trend support, making them critical to maintaining XRP’s broader bullish structure. XRP’s price is approaching a crucial inflection point. The market has consolidated within a narrow range, with bulls defending support and repeatedly testing resistance. According to CasiTrades, all signs point to a potential breakout if $2.96 can be reclaimed and held. With bullish RSI divergence, structural integrity, and growing institutional interest , XRP’s next move could define the direction of its next major leg. For now, all eyes remain on whether the bulls can flip resistance into support and ignite the rally toward the next key levels at $3.21 and $3.41.

In recent market news, low-gas-fee crypto and social-heavy protocols have caught attention, signaling a strong shift toward projects that go beyond hype. With crypto trends today favoring user-owned ecosystems that reward engagement and data ownership, major players are pushing towards gas-efficient chains and governance-driven networks. But the most exciting opportunities lie in platforms that blend real-world utility with robust token incentives. That’s where DeSoc enters the spotlight. Avalanche (AVAX) Is Still On Course For 2x In 2025 Avalanche’s low transaction fees and sub-2-second finality continue to attract DeFi builders. Avalanche (AVAX) continues bragging about a robust path towards a possible 2x reward later this 2025, as the price continues to trade near $25.90. AVAX recently surged past key support at $21.40, with analysts forecasting a trading range of $37.70–$41.10 before the end of the year. The Avalanche 9000 mainnet upgrade, 45 million unique addresses , and a record 18.1M daily transactions highlight AVAX’s scalability and low fees, boosting its status as a top Ethereum rival. Cardano: Smart Contracts & Ecosystem Growth Cardano’s Alonzo upgrade and Hydra scaling plans are pushing its utility forward. ADA has climbed 4% this week after announcing partnerships for on-chain identity services in Africa. ADA is consolidating above $0.76, with traders eyeing a bullish move toward $0.82. As long as it holds above $0.74 and volume builds, the uptrend looks set to continue. Price forecasts suggest ADA could hit $1.80 by late 2025, thanks to rising smart contract adoption and the upcoming Hydra rollout. Cardano’s emphasis on formal verification and academic rigor continues to attract quality developers. Social-First Innovation with $SOCS: Is DeSoc the Best Crypto to Buy Now?

The bidding flopped just enough to shake confidence. The yield on the 10-year climbed to 4.24%, up three basis points from the previous session, and even spiked to 4.28% about 90 minutes before the auction ended, before slipping back down. The actual result of the auction didn’t help. The new 10-year note printed a yield of 4.255%, which was 1.1 basis points above its pre-auction trading level. That difference, known as a “tail,” was the largest tail since last year’s botched 10-year auction, where it missed by more than three basis points. That kind of gap is seen as a red flag, especially when investor nerves are already high. The size of the tail also meant the coupon landed at 4.25%, instead of the expected 4.125%, giving the note a slightly better payout. Rate cut hopes pull yields lower, but belly stays rich Despite the weak turnout, this auction still resulted in the lowest 10-year yield since December, according to data from Bloomberg. That drop is tied to rising bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts , especially after last Friday’s weak jobs data. July’s employment numbers came in softer than expected, and the previous two months were also revised lower. That shift in labor momentum pushed more traders into betting on rate cuts by year-end. On Wednesday, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed, said the US economy is slowing and “a rate cut may be appropriate in the near term.” Neel still expects two cuts before the end of 2025. Traders are now pricing in nearly 60 basis points of easing by December, and market odds for a move in September hit 85%, reflecting growing confidence in an earlier cut. Still, auctions don’t care about weekly news. They happen every month on a fixed schedule. Even when 10-year Treasury yields were approaching 3.85% in early April, the calendar didn’t shift. This week’s auction series wraps up on Thursday with a $25 billion 30-year note, which is expected to come in with the lowest yield since March. Five-year notes trade rich as Fed expectations build While the 10-year drama played out, traders also noticed how strange the five-year note looks right now. It’s rarely been this expensive compared to other maturities unless the Fed had rates pinned at zero, which it doesn’t. Today, the five-year yield sat around 3.78%, near the top of its range since early 2022, the last time the Fed’s overnight rate floor was at 0%. Goldman Sachs strategists William Marshall and Bill Zu highlighted just how off-balance the five-year zone is. They used a valuation method called a butterfly spread, where the five-year yield is doubled and the combined yield of the two- and 30-year notes is subtracted. Right now, that number is near -100 basis points, which is the lowest it’s been since early 2021. “The defining feature of the Treasuries market has been and remains how rich the belly is,” William and Bill said . They added that this pricing is based on expectations that the Fed will cut rates more quickly and by larger amounts, but they don’t think it’ll last. They explained that since the start of the year, traders have been betting on more near-term cuts and deeper overall cuts, which has pulled extra demand into the belly of the curve, especially the five-year. But they warned that the only way that valuation will start to unwind is if the market moves toward front-loaded cuts. Despite the overvaluation, the five-year has been the top-performing part of the yield curve this year. It’s benefited from the same rate-cut optimism that has kept longer-term yields from falling. Meanwhile, inflation that refuses to fully ease and the growing US budget deficit continue to apply pressure to long-maturity yields, including the 30-year.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Its trading volume, however, fell by 13.42% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling waning retail interest. The coin has registered negative momentum through August. ORDI’s 24-hour surge is likely driven by Bitcoin’s surge to $115,000. The MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator iis above zero, signaling a bullish market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 50.40. It is overbought when the RSI rises above 70. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $9 mark, with bullish RSI (53.69) and MACD confirmation.

ORDI is bullish at current levels, with the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $116,000. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI up? ORDI is in a bull run this month. The rise in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s sentiment. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-06 21:20:00

Floki also holds steady amid a bull market, while interest is growing in tokens beyond the usual suspects. Recent data shows Bonk and Floki each moving on ecosystem upgrades. Reliable developments point to potential gains. These trends provide a backdrop that highlights DeSoc as a strong alternative with real user‑focused utility, staking features, and low gas fees. Bonk’s Momentum: Community‑Fuelled Spike After Solana Meme Rally Bonk is trading around $0.0000325 with a week‑long volume of $1.6 billion on Kraken, which reflects a 151% jump over the past month and a recent 11% drop from local highs. On‑chain data shows strong support around $0.000033 and near‑term resistance at $0.000037. The Bonk DAO has funded over 131 Solana DApps and integrations, boosting its DeFi profile. Analysts have observed that BONK is making a descending triangle pattern , and is showing pressure at this level. With this, BONK price is expected to open a long position after a clear structure above $0.00037. Floki on the Rise: FLOKI Breakout Nears $0.00022 After NFT Launch Floki is priced at $0.000134 today as it approaches a key resistance near $0.0001404. Trading volume hit $425 million, with a market cap of about $1.27 billion. Technical indicators suggest a bullish continuation toward $0.0002278. Experts have also noticed that Floki is finally starting to break out . It has consistently been trending higher, with the last HL tagging weekly open with a buy signal at that point. Analysts project Floki to reach $0.00022 by Q4 if utility gains pace, making it one of the top crypto under $1 to watch. DeSoc: Best Crypto Presale to Buy for Real Social Media Use DeSoc merges decentralized social media activity with DeFi. Its $SOCS token powers interactions through API links to Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and others. It enables low-gas-fee crypto transactions, passive income from staking, and decentralized exchange activity within its platform. This crosses social engagement with financial utility in a way few tokens do. Compared to Bonk and Floki, DeSoc offers a clearer path to utility. Its tech stack supports social reward systems and staking, and governance is on‑chain and community-driven. That makes it the next big altcoin 2025 contender with crypto with real utility and cross‑chain DeFi project appeal. DeSoc is rightly tagged the best crypto presale to buy, since it targets early-stage crypto investment and brings passive income potential. As one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, it lets investors buy the DeSoc token under $1 with strong upside. It’s not just hype, but rather, it answers the demand for crypto to solve real-world problems. Final Call: DeSoc, Social Crypto with Substance DeSoc combines true social media utility and crypto staking into a unified ecosystem. With centralized exchanges facing scrutiny, networks that reward actual user activity will stand out. Investors hunting for the next 100x crypto and the best long-term crypto investment should consider buying the $SOCS token now. This token launch ties social engagement to tangible rewards.

Multiple large-volume transfers caught investors' attention. A PumpFun (PUMP) presale investor transferred 1.25 billion PUMP ($4.09 million) to the Kraken exchange. This transfer means the whale realized a loss of approximately $910,000 (-18.2%). It is known that the whale purchased 1.25 billion PUMP for 5 million USDC in the public sale on July 12 and accumulated the tokens in 5 different wallets. Another whale unstaking 30,010 SOL ($4.9 million) and depositing 30,050 SOL to Binance after two months of inactivity. Over the last four months, the same whale has demonstrated significant activity, unstaking a total of 205,072 SOL ($30.07 million) after four years of staking.

Major market sentiment this week has focused on low gas fee crypto and the next big altcoin in 2025 , especially as AI chatter and smart contract fatigue grow. Projects gaining momentum now are those building social-first economies, blockchains that reward actual user activity, not just passive holding. And among them, one token is beginning to rise above the noise. Cardano Price Predictions Hint At Slow Climb Cardano (ADA) has climbed 15% on the back of EMURGO’s cross-chain plans and the rollout of the Cardano Card, a Visa-powered feature allowing ADA spending. This move, along with support for BTC, SOL, USDC, and USDT, has renewed bullish interest in the ecosystem. ADA’s open interest is now over $1.4 billion, which indicates the increased confidence in the asset by both traders and institutions. Despite these developments, analysts remain cautious. ADA’s long-term outlook includes a price prediction of $1.80 by late 2025, assuming sustained growth in the digital ID and education sectors. However, Cardano still faces challenges in DeFi traction compared to faster-moving Layer 1 networks. XLM Looks To Become Cross-Border Payments Giant, Again Stellar (XLM) has gained momentum in recent weeks, fueled by PayPal’s integration of PYUSD on its blockchain and a surge in network activity, with over 2 million daily transactions. This helped XLM break key resistance levels, reaching highs above $0.42 before experiencing a mild correction. The release of Stellar Core v23.0.0rc2 has renewed developer and institutional confidence, adding optimism to the network’s roadmap. Analysts now eye a potential breakout toward $0.63, especially given XLM’s correlation with XRP’s performance. Still, long-term projections remain cautious, with some estimates keeping XLM under $0.60 for the rest of 2025. While Stellar’s tech remains solid, limited new developer growth may hinder it from keeping pace with top DeFi projects and newer social-driven tokens. Ethereum: Growth Slows Under Its Own Weight Ethereum remains a major force in DeFi and NFTs, with a strong foundation backed by its smart contract dominance and expanding ecosystem. The network’s recent 20% price surge and nearly $900 million in ETF inflows highlight growing investor confidence, even as Bitcoin’s market dominance slightly declines. At the price of around $3,655, ETH is close to a yearly high, and most analysts believe that it can reach 3,800 to 4,500 by the end of 2025, particularly in the event of rollup solutions taking off. Top Analysts Tip DeSoc As The Best Crypto To Buy Now DeSoc is a social-first blockchain platform designed to power decentralized communities through its $SOCS token. It runs a fully self-custodial system, meaning users own their identities and data while engaging in spam-resistant messaging, tipping, and algorithm voting. Its wallet-native UX, zero-gas posting, and SoulScore reputation model give it true on-chain usability, perfect for a new wave of Web3 creators and communities. Unlike Cardano or Ethereum, DeSoc isn’t bogged down by smart contract bloat or generic L1 competition. Instead, it’s focused on interaction: how people build social capital and trust on-chain. The tokenomics directly reward value-added activity, not just holding. It offers governance rights and reputation-building tools in a way few top DeFi projects do today. For those asking what the best crypto to buy now is, DeSoc makes a strong case. It’s not a bet on hype, it’s a commitment to ownership, privacy, and community in a way traditional platforms can’t deliver. As more users seek authentic engagement over speculation, $SOCS may emerge as the new standard in decentralized interaction. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

If you are working with huge capital, you can spread your investment across all four tokens, but if you want to invest in just one, then it has to be the very best crypto to buy right now. Solana (SOL) Is Fast But Faces Network Risks Solana is known for fast and cheap transactions. NFT projects often prefer it over Ethereum. However, Solana has had multiple network outages. These issues worry big investors. Chart showing the price of SOL SOL could still reach $300 in 2025 if crypto markets stay bullish. But the network’s past failures might limit this growth. Overall, it is a fairly good investment that promises a 1.5x profit within the next few months. Cardano (ADA) Is Too Slow For Fast Gains Cardano uses a secure proof-of-stake system. Just like Solana, it’s also seen as an “Ethereum alternative.” Despite its use case, Cardano’s progress is painfully slow. Upgrades take too long as a result, developers are losing patience. ADA is still stuck below $1. Many investors want faster returns and are moving to newer projects. Chart showing the price of ADA Litecoin (LTC) Has Lost Its Spark Litecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies. It’s often called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” But LTC has no real-world use cases driving demand. It’s mostly used for payments. Litecoin halving did little to boost prices. Most traders now see it as a store of value, not a growth altcoin. Buying LTC for profit this July is not a good investment. Chart showing the price of LTC DeSoc (SOCS): The Viral Altcoin Experts Are Watching DeSoc is a new decentralized social media platform. It rewards real users for posting, sharing, and engaging. Everything is recorded on-chain. This stops bots and fake followers from faking numbers. In July, DeSoc raised over $10 million. Early buyers are rushing in before the wallet app launches. There are a lot of reasons why DeSoc is the best crypto to buy this July; however, below are the top six: ● Pays users for every social media action● $SOCS token has a real use case● Over $10M raised and growing● Whales are quietly buying $SOCS● Token bonuses are live for early buyers● Solves the bot problem on social media Which Altcoin Should You Buy Now? Solana is strong but risky, Cardano is too slow, while Litecoin has lost momentum. On the other hand, DeSoc stands out because it solves a real problem. Fake engagement has hurt trust in social media. DeSoc fixes that by paying real users, thereby minimizing the use of bots. The $SOCS token could surge over 10x as more people join the platform. If you’re looking for the next viral altcoin with real-world use, DeSoc might be your best shot. To get started, Click This Link To Check Out The Desoc Presale .

Among a variety of options, four cryptocurrencies stand out this August: DeSoc, Solana, Cardano, and Litecoin. Each offers unique advantages and risks. The Rapid Rise of Solana Solana has distinguished itself with its high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it a preferred platform for many NFT projects. Despite its advantages, Solana has experienced several network outages, raising concerns among significant investors about its long-term reliability. While Solana's network issues are a cause for concern, its potential to hit a market price of $300 by 2025 remains if the crypto market conditions remain favorable. It offers a potential 1.5x return in the coming months, assuming stability in its network performance. Cardano's Slow and Steady Approach Cardano operates on a secure proof-of-stake model and is often seen as an alternative to Ethereum. However, its slow development pace has caused frustration among developers and investors alike. Despite its robust security features, Cardano's slow progress and the prolonged implementation of upgrades have led to its stagnation below the $1 mark, prompting investors to look for quicker gains elsewhere. Litecoin: Losing its Luster? Once hailed as the 'silver to Bitcoin's gold,' Litecoin has struggled to find a compelling use case beyond basic transactions. Its recent halving event did little to boost investor confidence or its market price. As it stands, Litecoin is more frequently viewed as a stable store of value rather than a growth investment, making it less attractive for those seeking quick profits in the dynamic crypto market. DeSoc: A New Contender in the Crypto Arena The new kid on the block, DeSoc, is gaining traction with its innovative approach to decentralized social media. By rewarding users for engagement, DeSoc directly addresses the issue of fake followers and bot-driven engagement that plagues traditional social media platforms. Decentralized social media platform DeSoc Pays users for social interactions Real-world utility of the $SOCS token Significant early-stage funding over $10M High interest from large-scale buyers Active token bonuses for early investors Effective solution to social bots problem Given its novel approach and potential for rapid adoption, DeSoc stands out as potentially the most promising buy this August in the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Which Cryptocurrency to Invest in This Month? While each cryptocurrency has its merits, DeSoc presents an intriguing option due to its innovative solution to a real-world problem and potential for rapid growth. For those looking to invest in a project that offers more than just speculative value, DeSoc might be the right choice.

The document, which was made publicly available on July 30, outlines policy recommendations for regulating crypto in the U.S. The report includes recommendations on crypto market structure, jurisdictional oversight, banking regulations, promoting U.S. dollar hegemony through stablecoins, and taxation of cryptocurrencies. Today the White House is releasing its comprehensive report on digital assets, providing long-awaited regulatory clarity for innovators in a cutting-edge industry. President Trump is delivering on his promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. pic.twitter.com/hrp8uQwf76 — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) July 30, 2025 President Trump is also reportedly planning to sign an executive order directing banking regulators to investigate claims of debanking made by the crypto sector . Grassroots Organizations Play Key Role In Shaping Legislation While the recent efforts from President Trump and his team are clear, grassroots organizations are also playing a key role in advancing crypto legislation in the U.S. Michael Cameron, co-founder of decentralized exchange Superb, told Cryptonews that most people underestimate how the future of crypto in the U.S. is being shaped by passionate groups of lawyers, developers, anonymous people, and others. “People think it’s lobbyists in suits doing the heavy lifting,” Cameron said. “While they certainly are—crypto firms spent over $18 million on federal lobbying in early 2025—behind the scenes, there are discord groups reading draft bills at 2 a.m. and DAO treasurers fervently calling congressional staffers.” Given this, it’s important to understand how specific grassroots organizations are helping influence crypto legislation in the U.S. Stand With Crypto Helps Voters Get Their Voices Heard Mason Lynaugh, community director at Stand With Crypto (SWC)—a nonprofit advocacy organization backed by Coinbase —told Cryptonews that he was fortunate to join top industry leaders and advocates at the White House for the release of Trump’s recent crypto report. Lynaugh elaborated that not only was the report monumental for the entire crypto sector, but it was the first time that SWC was represented as part of an important legislative effort. “Policy makers and regulators in the White House finally see strength in the Stand With Crypto community,” Lynaugh said. “The recommendations that our working group put forward and the impact from pro-crypto voters have demonstrated a big win here.” Digital asset advocate and @stcloudfcu Chief Lending Officer Chase Larson met with his senator in D.C. last month! Hear what Chase has to say about removing ambiguity and unleashing innovation when it comes to crypto regulation: pic.twitter.com/GxhpvQAjyn — Stand With Crypto (@standwithcrypto) August 5, 2025 According to Lynaugh, SWC is one of the most engaged, organized, and fastest-growing grassroots political forces in America. The organization has more than 2.3 million crypto advocates across the country and is on track to exceed 2.5 million. SWC’s goal is to have a footprint in all 50 states by the end of this year. “Stand With Crypto has built an engaged voting bloc that is mobilizing at every level of the U.S. government: from the steps of Capitol Hill to state legislatures,” Lynaugh said. More than 600,000 crypto voters registered to vote in 2024 with SWC’s support. Lynaugh believes that SWC drove a majority of crypto voters to the polls last year, noting that this further proves how crypto votes matter for determining election outcomes. Lynaugh added that SWC sent out around 70,000 emails to senators when the GENIUS Act was being voted on. “We also organized a coalition letter signed by 65 crypto-focused orgs, representing 6,100 jobs across 21 states, to every member of the House in support of the CLARITY Act,” he said. Grassroots Organizations Influence State-Level Policy Grassroots organizations at the state level are also helping shape crypto policy . For example, the North American Blockchain Association (NABA) is building a state-by-state network to advance blockchain policy across North America. Wade Preston, director of community outreach for NABA, told Cryptonews that he specifically serves as the bridge between NABA’s member states and federal policy developments. “I help member states navigate the complexities to implement their policy initiatives. We’re empowering grassroots advocates in every state to make their voices heard and give them the tools they need to succeed in their jurisdictions,” Preston said. NABA has also encouraged the rise of other state-level organizations. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC), told Cryptonews that the TBC coordinates industry voices, educates policymakers, and drafts model legislation. For instance, Bratcher noted that TBC helped draft Texas’ HB 1666, along with the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation, SB 21 . “Our advocacy in Texas has led to one of the most favorable regulatory environments for digital assets in the U.S.,” Bratcher said. He added that while TBC was not directly involved in drafting the recent White House crypto report, the organization has actively contributed to the national policy dialogue. “This has been through invited testimony, public comment on proposed rules, and meetings with federal agencies. Our efforts have helped shape a more informed and nuanced approach to crypto regulation,” Bratcher commented. Crypto-friendly states like Florida also have communities helping to ensure that lawmakers understand Web3 technology to pass better policies. James Slusser, a Polkadot Senior Ambassador, told Cryptonews that Polkadot plays a key role in shaping crypto-friendly legislation by offering lawmakers a direct line to the technology’s builders. “Polkadot is in a unique position to educate and inform public policy. We support state-level engagement through organizations like the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) and the Texas Blockchain Council, while also contributing to national efforts through groups like the Blockchain Association and the North American Blockchain Association,” Slusser explained. He added that these platforms allow Polkadot to collaborate with policymakers and industry peers to advocate for clear, innovation-friendly regulation. “For example, this year I represented Polkadot during FBBA’s Blockchain Day at the Florida Capitol, where we met directly with lawmakers to discuss how Web3 technology can support economic growth, digital infrastructure, and citizen empowerment in the state of Florida,” Slusser said. Education Remains Key While it’s clear that grassroots organizations are helping influence crypto policies in the U.S., a key challenge remains education. Slusser pointed out that he believes the biggest issue here is bridging the gap between complex technical systems and public policy frameworks. “Many lawmakers are eager to learn but lack structured, neutral resources that explain blockchain technology in a meaningful way,” he said. Echoing this, Bratcher noted that overcoming misinformation and political inertia in Washington remains problematic. “Many lawmakers still misunderstand the technology or associate it with illicit activity,” he said. Education remains key to combat these challenges, which is why groups like TBC and Polkadot are focused on new initiatives. For instance, Slusser shared that earlier this year, Polkadot launched a “Blockchain Basics for Policymakers.” The course was led by Dr. Lisa Cameron, founder of the UKUS Crypto Alliance and a former Member of the British Parliament. “The course was held in Zug, Switzerland—often called Crypto Valley—and was attended by a cross-party delegation of British MPs, equipping them with practical knowledge about blockchain and Web3 technologies,” Slusser said. Bratcher added that TBC regularly hosts educational summits, like The North American Blockchain Summit and USSAIC in Washington, D.C. “This helps us maintain a constant presence with both state and federal policymakers.” Lynaugh further remarked that SWC has plans to launch college chapters in the future. “SWC has only been around for 2 years now, so we need more people to continue to join us and take action when the time comes,” he said.

Among the various players, DeSoc emerges as a prominent project, poised to capitalize on this shift with its innovative approach to social media and content monetization. DeSoc's introduction into the crypto market at just $0.01 per token positions it not just as an affordable investment but as a potential revolutionary force in the digital content sphere. The project's integration of social features and robust tokenomics could potentially trigger a significant surge in its valuation. What Makes DeSoc Stand Out? Unlike traditional social platforms, DeSoc offers a decentralized solution that empowers users by allowing them to maintain ownership and control over their content. This system not only enhances transparency but also ensures that creators are fairly compensated. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeSoc facilitates a more equitable content distribution mechanism that stands in stark contrast to the practices of existing social media giants. Furthermore, DeSoc is not short of strategic implementations. It has set aside a substantial portion of its tokens for presale investors, ensuring they have a stake in the project's success. 45% of all $SOCS tokens are dedicated to this phase, underlining the project's commitment to its early supporters. Market Dynamics and Future Potential As the Bitcoin dominance index shows signs of a potential downturn, alternative cryptocurrencies like DeSoc could see increased investor interest. Historical trends suggest that periods following a decline in Bitcoin's market dominance correlate with significant altcoin rallies. This potential market shift coincides with increasing institutional support for Bitcoin, as evidenced by entities like Quantum Solutions planning significant purchases. While this reinforces Bitcoin's position as a 'digital gold,' it also highlights the shifting focus towards more utility-driven crypto projects like DeSoc. Enhanced Features and Investor Confidence DeSoc's platform architecture promotes a holistic ecosystem for content creation and distribution. Creators can syndicate their content seamlessly across various platforms without sacrificing ownership, a feat made possible through DeSoc's decentralized framework. To bolster investor confidence, DeSoc has implemented a 12-hour refund policy and maintains transparency through audited smart contracts. These steps reflect a mature approach to addressing potential investor concerns and enhancing the project's credibility. With these robust strategies and a community-centric approach, DeSoc not only aims to redefine user interaction within social platforms but also sets itself up as a potentially lucrative investment ahead of Bitcoin’s next halving.

A draft executive order under review would direct financial regulators to examine banks for “politicized or unlawful debanking” practices , according to a Reuters report. It could give authorities the power to impose fines or other penalties on any institution found in breach of the policy. Two industry insiders say the order may be unveiled as soon as this week. The White House has declined to comment. Trump’s public criticism of major lenders has intensified scrutiny on the country’s biggest banks and highlights how his personal grievances can shape policy under his administration. Although his business interests are held in a trust, he remains the ultimate owner, prompting accusations of conflicts of interest. “While other moves reflect his own economic assessment, this seems to reflect his personal beefs,” said Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business. He added that if the order is used as retribution against specific banks, it could spark fresh turmoil in financial markets. On Wednesday, Bank of America’s stock didn’t move while JPMorgan’s stock slipped 0.4%, following declines of 0.6% and 1% respectively on Tuesday. Trump says banks refused his money The proposed order comes after Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that both banks had turned him away. Without presenting any evidence, he claimed the Biden administration asked regulators to “destroy” him. “They did discriminate,” he said of actions by JPMorgan once his first term ended. “I had hundreds of millions, I had many, many accounts loaded up with cash … and they told me, ‘I’m sorry sir, we can’t have you. You have 20 days to get out.’” He went on to say that the banks “totally discriminate against, I think, me maybe even more, but they discriminate against many conservatives.” Trump said he then tried to place money with Bank of America, but was refused again. “I ended up going to small banks all over the place,” he said. “I was putting $10 million here, $10 million there, did $5 million, $10 million, $12 million,” though he did not name those smaller banks. JPMorgan issued a statement that did not reply directly to Trump’s account. “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” the bank said. “We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.” Bank of America also declined to address Trump’s specific allegations. Under President Joe Biden, regulators had been allowed to consider “reputational risk”, the chance that bad publicity could harm the bank or lead to lawsuits, when deciding whether to take on certain clients. Sources say banks felt pressure to weigh that risk when handling Trump, given his ongoing legal battles. JPMorgan, for example, has long-standing ties to the Trump family and holds several of its campaign accounts. In June, after Trump returned to office, the Federal Reserve told its supervisors to stop using reputational risk as a factor in bank reviews, an issue that banks had complained about for years. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo says the upcoming order would make clear that banks cannot use such rules as a shield. “Banks can use their normal underwriting standards and deny services, but not blame regulators or use reputational risk as a justification,” he said. Bank of America responded that it “welcomed the administration’s efforts to clarify the policies,” adding that it has “provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As of now, the Bitcoin price sits around $118,370 , but recent market activity suggests that may not hold for long. Meanwhile, one of the best-performing new viral presales, DeSoc, continues to gain traction as investors seek out higher upside plays. This shift in attention comes as macro factors, technical setups and presale momentum collide. And while Bitcoin remains the market anchor, the capital rotation into promising altcoins like $SOCS is becoming impossible to ignore. Bitcoin News Today: Whale Transfers Spark Panic Galaxy Digital, a firm often seen as a long-term holder of Bitcoin, has raised eyebrows after transferring 2,850 BTC (worth over $330 million) to exchanges. This move, coupled with a rapid 10,000 BTC transfer over just 8 hours, sparked a 3% price drop in a matter of hours. Adding to the bearish narrative, Bitcoin dominance is on the verge of a three-week MACD bearish cross, the first since January 2020. The last time it happened, Bitcoin dominance dropped significantly and the altcoin market saw a 100+ day surge. Even bullish headlines can’t offset the unease. Japanese AI firm Quantum Solutions recently announced plans to acquire 3,000 BTC over the next year While this shows institutional confidence, the market reacted cautiously as Quantum’s stock recently fell by 9.2% on the news The Bitcoin news today mostly revolves around instability. And investors now look for the next best place to park capital. That’s where DeSoc comes in. DeSoc: The New Viral Presale Catching Serious Momentum While BTC traders grapple with volatility, DeSoc’s $SOCS token is quietly gaining ground as a new viral presale . With a price fixed at $0.01 and a unique use case at the intersection of blockchain, content creation, and social media, it’s quickly separating itself from the noise. DeSoc’s standout feature is its content syndication model. Users can create posts on DeSoc and automatically publish across platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. This function preserves visibility while decentralizing control a combination that creators have been asking for and which Web3 hasn’t truly delivered until now. Behind the scenes, DeSoc is built for scale and stability. Out of its 3 billion $SOCS supply, 1.35 billion (45%) is allocated for presale. Another 20% supports development, with 5% locked forthe team for two years. A 30-year liquidity lock, a 12-hour refund policy, and a completed audit round out a model built for long-term trust. The platform’s integration capabilities are driven by smart contracts and a flexible API, allowing seamless data transfer and content syncing across social platforms. Every user action, from tipping to content promotion, is logged on-chain, offering unmatched transparency in a social media ecosystem. Why DeSoc May Outperform As Bitcoin Stalls For those tracking Bitcoin news today, most updates point to price pressure and uncertain institutional behavior. That doesn’t mean the crypto market is losing steam, it's just evolving. As capital rotates out of mega-caps, tokens like $SOCS early-stage, low-cost and feature-rich tend to attract attention. DeSoc’s incentivization model goes deeper than speculation. Users are rewarded for engagement, content quality and participation. Tipping, content gating, subscription models and ad-space boosting all run on $SOCS, making it a true utility token in a creator-driven ecosystem. And then there’s governance. Token holders can submit proposals, vote, and steer platform development through smart contract execution. It’s a fully user-led experience from day one, a contrast to platforms where users are the product. Why DeSoc Deserves Your Attention Bitcoin price jitters, whale dumps, and a shaky dominance chart are enough to make even seasoned investors second-guess their next move. And while the headlines around Bitcoin news today keep shifting, one thing feels steady: capital is drifting toward smaller, smarter opportunities with real-world potential. DeSoc’s presale is one of them. With a low $0.01 entry, real utility and strong fundamentals, it’s quickly emerging as the new viral presale to watch. If you’re looking for a project that’s doing more than promising hype, it might be worth getting into $SOCS presale before this window closes. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity.

The new entity will be called Parataxis Holdings Inc. and aims to trade under the ticker “PRTX” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). At a $10 share price, the deal values the combined company at $400 million, with the potential to double that figure if Parataxis exercises the right to raise an additional $400 million through a share purchase agreement. About $31 million has already been raised and earmarked for purchasing bitcoin (BTC), giving future shareholders immediate exposure to the asset. Parataxis manages bitcoin in an active strategy that blends market exposure with yield-generating techniques. Unlike firms that simply hold BTC, Parataxis seeks to generate income through low-volatility trading and treasury-style operations. The platform is run by veterans from Parataxis Capital Management and serves institutional client, including pension firms and family offices. In June, Parataxis made its first international move by acquiring a controlling stake in Bridge Biotherapeutics , a healthcare firm listed on South Korea’s KOSDAQ. That firm will be renamed Parataxis Korea and serve as a regional base for its bitcoin treasury strategy. Since the announcement, Bridge shares have jumped 350%, showing strong investor demand for the bitcoin-proxy play. South Korea offers a large user base, political support for digital assets, and notably, no spot Bitcoin ETF — making the market fertile ground for BTC-focused public firms, the company said. Similar strategies have gained traction in Japan, where companies like Metaplanet have seen share prices surge after pivoting to bitcoin. The Parataxis-SPAC deal will also allow the firm to expand its U.S. treasury operations and explore other “special situations” investments. If successful, Parataxis could become one of the few publicly listed companies offering direct and active exposure to bitcoin outside of an ETF structure.

Both parties are expected to submit a joint status update by August 15, with sources indicating that a $50 million settlement is on the table. If approved, this would lift the restriction on institutional sales of XRP—an event that could send shockwaves through the market. Smart money is already positioning ahead of the news. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star in the altcoin space, has also started catching attention as investors search for the next big opportunity while XRP builds momentum. Whale Accumulation Hits Record Levels Beyond the regulatory clarity in sight, on-chain data shows 280 million XRP (worth $858M) was scooped up by large wallets in July. The number of addresses holding over 1 million XRP surged to an all-time high of 2,743, according to recent blockchain analytics. This isn’t retail noise—these are serious players building positions ahead of expected market-moving developments. The hype surrounding the potential approval of XRP ETF applications by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton is gaining steam. These filings are reportedly being timed around the outcome of the SEC settlement, creating a perfect storm for bullish speculation in August. A New 35x Contender Emerges While XRP is preparing for a potential surge to new highs, another altcoin is taking the spotlight for a different reason. MAGACOIN FINANCE has analysts predicting a surge of up to 35x returns as its early stages gather pace. With real scarcity and limited allocations remaining, demand has skyrocketed . Whales have already begun circling the project, treating it as a high-upside hedge while other coins await regulatory clarity. The current surge mirrors early signs seen in coins like Shiba Inu—but with stronger tokenomics and real ecosystem utility, according to experts. Why XRP Could Explode in August There are now multiple catalysts aligning for XRP: Legal clarity likely by August 15, ending the Ripple-SEC saga Institutional restrictions lifted, opening the gates to bigger players ETF filing momentum, following BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin success Whale accumulation reaching record highs in July Technical upside: if the $3.10 level breaks, momentum could test $4 Strong support zone between $2.55 and $2.40 if the rally falters Conclusion XRP is entering a make-or-break month, with key developments that could redefine its trajectory. If Ripple finalizes its deal with the SEC and ETF applications, a breakout is not just possible—it may be inevitable. For investors watching the broader market, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the next high-ROI contender, with many now comparing its current cycle to some of crypto’s biggest historical runs.

Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid, Caroline Crenshaw Says According to Crenshaw’s Tuesday statement, the federal regulator slammed the division’s statement, alleging that certain liquid staking activities do not constitute securities, claiming that “some things are better left unsaid.” “The Liquid Staking Statement stacks factual assumption on top of factual assumption on top of factual assumption, resulting in a wobbly wall of facts without an anchor in industry reality,” Crenshaw said. “Given its unsupported factual assumptions and circumscribed legal analysis, the Liquid Staking Statement should provide little comfort to entities engaged in liquid staking—especially since, as the statement rightly notes, it only ‘represents the views of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance,’ not the views of this or any future Commission,” she added. SEC Chair Paul Atkins Backs Division’s Statement Crenshaw’s statement is a scathing retort to the SEC Division of Corporation Finance’s liquid staking statement published earlier on August 5. The statement expressed the division’s views that certain liquid staking activities do not qualify as securities in a bid to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets.” Newly appointed SEC Chair Paul Atkins also published his own statement on Tuesday backing the division’s decision, stating that “the SEC is committed to providing clear guidance on the application of the federal securities laws to emerging technologies and financial activities.” Under my leadership, the SEC is committed to providing clear guidance on the application of the federal securities laws to emerging technologies and financial activities. https://t.co/KdIA8RAbVq pic.twitter.com/inUB1asKay — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) August 5, 2025 “Today’s staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff’s view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction,” Chairman Paul Atkins said . “I am pleased that the SEC’s Project Crypto initiative is already producing results for the American people.” The post SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Pushes Back On Liquid Staking Statement appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Paul atkins|SEC|SEC Chair,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-06 21:50:17

Former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly indicated a plan to impose a staggering 100% Trump semiconductor tariff on all imported semiconductors and chips entering the United States. This news, initially reported by the reputable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, has sent ripples across various sectors, particularly within the tech industry and global trade circles. For those tracking the broader financial markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, such a dramatic policy shift warrants close attention, as it could reshape supply chains, consumer prices, and even international relations. What is the Proposed Trump Semiconductor Tariff? According to reports, the proposal involves a sweeping 100% tariff. This means that for every dollar’s worth of imported semiconductors or chips, an additional dollar would be added as a tax at the border. This kind of measure is designed to significantly increase the cost of foreign-made components, theoretically making domestically produced alternatives more competitive. The sheer scale of a 100% tariff is unprecedented in modern trade policy for such a critical commodity. Semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of almost all modern technology, from smartphones and computers to cars and advanced military equipment. Therefore, any disruption to their supply or cost structure has far-reaching consequences. Why Consider a 100% US Chip Tariff? The motivation behind such a drastic US chip tariff is multifaceted. Historically, proponents of high tariffs argue they protect domestic industries, encourage local manufacturing, and create jobs. In the context of semiconductors, there’s also a significant national security dimension. Key reasons often cited include: Boosting Domestic Production: To incentivize chip manufacturers to build and expand facilities within the United States. National Security: Reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for critical components, especially from geopolitical rivals. Trade Leverage: Using tariffs as a bargaining chip in broader trade negotiations. This move aligns with an “America First” economic policy, aiming to reshore vital manufacturing capabilities. Potential Tech Industry Impact and Consumer Costs A 100% tariff would undoubtedly have a profound tech industry impact . Companies relying heavily on imported chips would face a massive increase in their production costs. These costs would likely be passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices for a vast array of electronic goods. Consider the ripple effect: Higher Consumer Prices: Smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles, and even cars could become significantly more expensive. Innovation Challenges: Increased costs could stifle research and development, making it harder for US companies to compete globally. Supply Chain Restructuring: Companies would scramble to find domestic suppliers or relocate production, a complex and costly endeavor. This could also impact the competitiveness of American tech giants in international markets. How Would Global Chip Trade React to This? The proposed tariff would inevitably reshape global chip trade dynamics. Other nations, particularly major chip-producing countries, would likely react. Retaliatory tariffs are a common response in trade disputes, potentially escalating into a broader trade war. Such a scenario could lead to: Trade Tensions: Increased friction between the U.S. and its trading partners. Diversification of Supply Chains: Countries and companies might seek to reduce their dependence on the U.S. market. Geopolitical Shifts: The global technology landscape could become more fragmented, with regionalized supply networks. The interconnected nature of the semiconductor industry means that unilateral actions can have widespread, unpredictable consequences. Navigating the Semiconductor Import Tax Landscape If the semiconductor import tax comes into effect, businesses will need robust strategies to navigate the new landscape. This includes exploring domestic sourcing options, adjusting pricing models, and potentially advocating for policy adjustments. The long-term implications for the global economy, and by extension, the stability of financial assets like cryptocurrencies, remain a topic of intense speculation. This potential policy highlights the ongoing tension between national economic interests and the benefits of globalized trade. Stakeholders across the technology sector and beyond are closely monitoring developments, understanding that the future of digital innovation and consumer access to technology could hinge on these crucial decisions. In conclusion, the prospect of a 100% Trump semiconductor tariff represents a monumental potential shift in U.S. trade policy. While aiming to bolster domestic manufacturing and national security, such a measure could trigger significant price increases for consumers, disrupt established global supply chains, and ignite international trade disputes. The tech industry, a cornerstone of modern economies, stands at a critical juncture, poised to adapt to or challenge these formidable economic headwinds. The ultimate impact will depend on the final policy details and the subsequent reactions from global players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a 100% Trump semiconductor tariff? A 100% tariff means that an import tax equal to the value of the imported semiconductor or chip would be applied, effectively doubling its cost upon entry into the U.S. 2. How would this tariff affect the price of electronics in the U.S.? It would likely lead to significant price increases for consumer electronics, vehicles, and other goods that rely heavily on imported chips, as companies pass on the increased costs. 3. Will this tariff lead to more chip manufacturing in the U.S.? The primary goal is to incentivize domestic manufacturing by making foreign-made chips much more expensive, potentially encouraging companies to build or expand production facilities within the U.S. 4. What are the potential global reactions to such a tariff? Other nations, especially major chip-producing countries, might implement retaliatory tariffs, leading to increased trade tensions and potentially a broader trade war. 5. How might this impact industries beyond tech, like automotive? Industries like automotive, healthcare, and defense, which are increasingly reliant on advanced semiconductors, would also face higher component costs and potential supply chain disruptions, affecting their production and pricing.

Even though the project’s results are significant, it can’t seem to return to its prior feats, and there are growing concerns about governance. More Room to Grow Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, the largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds with more than $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM), made a bold statement on X earlier today. “Uniswap at $6 billion feels too small. If it were a company, it would be the 400th largest financial services business in the world — roughly the same size as Storebrand, a savings and insurance business in Norway.” Members of the crypto space commented with a mixture of agreeing and disagreeing statements, with the majority of the input relating to the protocol’s revenue. Another point was that the native governance token, UNI, does not inherently provide value to investors. Still, given that a decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) governs how the protocol will operate, a market capitalization of $6.15 billion, as per the most recent data from CoinMarketCap, is impressive. The native token is also up over 30% for the month, and over 100% year-to-date (YTD). Trading volume on the decentralized exchange is also noteworthy, with the last three months alone bringing in over $280 billion, according to data from Token Terminal at the time of printing. Still Struggling Despite the impressive numbers posted, Uniswap’s price appears to be stuck around the $10 mark, with no significant movement for some time now. Throughout July, the resistance level seemed to be around $11, while support was between $6 and $8. Following the token reaching a high of $19 on December 8th last year, analysis firm Lookonchain detected a massive move of 989,520 UNI ($16.73 M) from trading company Cumberland into various exchanges. Shortly after, the price plummeted and has not been able to regain its strength since. A research-sharing platform, arXiv, has posted an interesting paper on Uniswap’s Network, and the findings on the governance model are worrisome. Despite being promoted as decentralized, a small group of large UNI token holders (including early investors and the Uniswap Foundation) control most of the voting power, and users with small balances of the token have minimal influence on key decisions. Moreover, essential proposals tend to get delayed or are based on the interests of larger holders. There are even reports about a lack of transparency, with some off-chain coordination being noted.

49659251,https://cryptonews.com/?p=404715,1754517600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49659251.jpeg,"Pi Coin Price Prediction: Weak Rebound, No Volume – Is Pi Coin Going to Zero?",https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-price-prediction-weak-rebound-no-volume-is-pi-coin-going-to-zero/,"Pi (PI) has experienced one of the most dramatic drops among cryptos valued at over $1 billion as its year-to-date losses climbed to 80% recently. Combined with a strong decline in trading volumes, this favors a bearish Pi Coin price prediction. PI is, by far, the worst-performing asset of the top 40 cryptos in the past 30 days with a 26% loss, while other tokens with similar market caps like Mantle (MNT) and Ondo (ONDO) have delivered gains of 53% and 16% respectively. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that trading volumes for Pi have declined severely, moving from a recent peak of $140 million on August 2 to just $43 million yesterday. This 70% drop in trading activity occurred as Pi made a new all-time low of $0.335. Pi’s negative momentum has accelerated lately at a point when most cryptos are rallying. This antagonist performance is the result of disappointing ecosystem growth initiatives that have led to a disgruntled community. Delays in token migrations to the public mainnet and failing to secure top CEX listings by the Pi Core Team have undermined the project’s credibility and favor a bearish Pi Coin prediction. Pi Coin Price Prediction: PI Seems Poised to Retest Its All-Time Low as Willing Buyers are AWOL The 4-hour chart shows that PI broke below a key trend line support on August 1 with some strong volumes. During that specific 4-hour period, the price made an all-time low of $0.3220. Although it rapidly bounced off that level, it has been progressively moving toward that area again and could soon retest it. In the absence of good news, little seems to stand in the way of PI to hit that all-time low again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flat-lined just above the 30 threshold, meaning that negative momentum is at a high point. Even if the price bounces off $0.3220, low trading volumes indicate little to no interest from buyers to buy the token at these levels. Hence, the price may need to move even lower to find willing buyers. Only an unexpected listing at a big CEX could save PI from collapsing to $0.10 or even lower at this point. PI failed to capitalize on the latest wave of positive momentum that cryptos have experienced, but top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) have done the opposite. In just a month or so, this project has raised more than $7 million to launch its ambitious Bitcoin L2 chain. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Could Kickstart a New Era for BTC’s DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyp er (HYPER) is a Solana-based layer-2 chain that will allow BTC holders to earn passive income on their assets by bridging the two networks. The Hyper Bridge will act as the gateway to a growing DeFi ecosystem powered by the Bitcoin Hyper L2. A canonical Bitcoin address will be designated to receive BTC tokens so users don’t have to transfer their assets out of this network. Once the origin transaction is confirmed, the corresponding amount of tokens will be minted on the Hyper L2 with near-instant finality. As top wallets and exchanges embrace this protocol, the demand for its utility token, $HYPER, will skyrocket. To buy $HYPER at its discounted presale price and reap the highest returns, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT, SOL, or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

The project is priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. The 7th phase will appreciate by 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are expecting a 71.43% return when the token is launched at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $14.1 million in funding and has received over 14,800 investors. While Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, its current price consolidation appears to be opening doors for emerging protocols like Mutuum Finance to capture liquidity and momentum in the DeFi market. Ethereum Faces Resistance Near $3,460 While Looking at Wider DeFi Rotation Ethereum is currently trading around $3,463, holding just above its critical support zone around $3,515–$3,550, following a sharp decline from July’s peak near $3,940 due to a market-wide cooldown and whale-driven selling pressure. Technically, ETH is still forming a bullish structure, a cup‑and‑handle breakout above $3,800–$3,941 could pave the way toward targets in the $4,000 to $4,400+ range this cycle. That said, as Ethereum stalls near resistance, capital appears to be gently rotating into emerging protocols focused on utility and credit infrastructure, such as Mutuum Finance. Investors Eye 71% Gains in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at $0.035 in presale stage 6 due to a presale stage 5 sell-out. Phase 6 investors will enjoy a 71.43% return on investment at token launch. More than $14.1 million has been raised, and over 14,800 early investors have joined the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is an increase of 14.23% over Stage 6. Mutuum Finance Boosts Protocol Security with Bug Bounty Supported by CertiK Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with security and transparency partner CertiK. Users will be rewarded 50,000 USDT in value for reporting probable bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four severity classes; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Mass MUTM Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway in which individuals who take part in the contest will be rewarded in the form of MUTM tokens, with each token being worth $10,000. Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending revolution that offers the maximum level of asset control to customers. It is an open multi-purpose double-lending platform developed by combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Access to the P2C lending pool comes through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the prevailing sentiment of the market, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic risk of lending. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, creating room for direct lending, which is appropriate for volatile assets like other coins. While Ethereum continues to face tough resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the smart money’s next target. Already in presale phase 6 at $0.035, the token offers a 71.43% return for early investors when it launches at $0.06. With over $14.1 million raised, 14,800+ participants, a CertiK-backed bug bounty, and a $100K token giveaway, Mutuum is checking all the right boxes for long-term growth.

The crypto-investment and data-center company reported earnings per share of $0.8 for the second quarter, falling short of Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $0.18. Galaxy Digital Shares Plunge 10% Revenue for the period totaled $9.1 billion, markedly below analysts’ expectations of $13.9 billion. Consequently, Galaxy’s stock, GLXY, plummeted by 10%, settling at $27.68. According to Barron’s, the downturn can be attributed to a broader trend affecting the cryptocurrency sector, where trading volumes have waned significantly since spring, pushing digital assets like Bitcoin to retrace 7% below its record price peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory—Top Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust Galaxy reported a 22% decrease in digital-asset trading volumes from the first quarter, primarily driven by reduced spot-trading activity. The firm’s crypto sales, which represent its largest revenue stream, fell to $8.6 billion in the second quarter, down from $12.8 billion in the first quarter and $8.8 billion a year prior. Despite the disappointing earnings report, there was some positive news on the horizon. Galaxy announced that CoreWeave has committed to utilizing all the electrical power approved at its Helios data-center campus in West Texas, where construction is reportedly proceeding on schedule. Additionally, Galaxy has agreed to acquire an extra 160 acres of land and a 1 gigawatt load interconnection request adjacent to the campus. CEO Mike Novogratz expressed optimism about the Helios project, stating, “Helios will be a top five data center in the world if we get that fully built out.” The company anticipates generating revenue from its data-center operations in the first half of 2026. In light of the CoreWeave announcement and the expanded capacity potential at Helios, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley noted that shares might be undervalued, suggesting they should trade higher. The firm has rated Galaxy stock as Overweight, with a price target of $36. Coinbase Unveils $2 Billion Senior Notes Offering In related news, Coinbase Global also experienced a slight dip in its stock, which fell by 1% on Tuesday following the announcement of a $2 billion offering of convertible senior notes aimed at qualified institutional buyers. This offering includes $1 billion in notes maturing in 2029 and another $1 billion due in 2032. Additionally, initial purchasers will have the option to acquire up to $150 million more of each series.

These notes will be senior, unsecured obligations with interest payable semi-annually, and they can be converted into cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of both at Coinbase’s discretion. To minimize potential dilution resulting from these conversions, Coinbase plans to engage in capped call transactions, partially funded by the proceeds from the offering. The remaining funds will be allocated to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, and potential debt repurchases.

Dogecoin Whales Have Increased Holdings By 1 Billion DOGE In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the Dogecoin whales. The “Supply Distribution” here refers to an indicator from on-chain analytics firm Santiment that tells us about the total amount of the asset that a given wallet group is holding right now. Related Reading: Binance Inflows A Leading Indicator For Altcoins? Analyst Explains How Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for example, includes all holders owning between 1 and 10 DOGE. In the context of the current topic, the whales are the cohort of interest. These investors are typically defined as holding more than 1 billion DOGE, with there being no upper end to the range. At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for the group converts to almost $200 million. Given the massive size of holdings involved, whales can carry some degree of influence in the market. This can make their on-chain behavior worth keeping an eye on. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of Dogecoin whales over the past couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin investors carrying more than 1 billion DOGE saw their Supply Distribution plunge near the end of July, indicating that big-money entities exited from the market. What followed the selling was an extension of bearish price action for the asset. The mood among the whales appears to have turned around in the past day, however, as the indicator’s value has seen a sharp surge instead. “Whales bought over one billion Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 24 hours!” notes Martinez. Given the timing of the buys, it’s possible that these humongous investors believe the current lows to be offering a profitable entry point into the memecoin. It only remains to be seen, though, whether this bet would pay off for the whales.

This significant movement, valued at approximately $403 million, immediately captured the attention of traders and analysts alike. When such a substantial amount of Bitcoin changes hands, especially moving to a major exchange like Bitfinex, it often signals potential shifts in the broader crypto market dynamics. What Does This Enormous Bitcoin Transfer Mean? The transfer of 3,500 BTC from an unknown wallet directly to Bitfinex is not an everyday occurrence. This large BTC movement could signify several things, each with its own implications for the market: Preparation for Sale: Whales often move funds to exchanges when they intend to sell. This could lead to increased selling pressure and potential price volatility. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The funds might be intended for a large OTC transaction, which would have less direct impact on immediate exchange prices but still represents a significant liquidity event. Rebalancing or Diversification: The whale might be rebalancing their portfolio or preparing to allocate funds into other assets. Custodial Services: The wallet could belong to an institution or fund utilizing Bitfinex for custodial services, though direct transfers from ‘unknown’ wallets usually imply individual or less transparent entities. Understanding the destination, in this case, Bitfinex , provides crucial context. Bitfinex is known for its high liquidity and active trading environment, making it a prime location for large transactions. How Does This Bitfinex Transaction Impact the Crypto Market ? Whenever a large BTC movement occurs, particularly one of this magnitude, the crypto market tends to react. Traders closely monitor such on-chain activities as potential indicators of future price action. A sudden influx of Bitcoin onto an exchange can sometimes be perceived as a bearish signal, as it suggests a potential increase in supply available for sale. However, it is not always straightforward. The immediate impact often manifests as increased volatility. Short-term traders might adjust their positions based on speculation, while long-term investors typically watch for confirmation of a trend. It is crucial to remember that one transaction, even a large one, does not solely dictate market direction. However, it certainly adds a layer of intrigue and observation to current market conditions. Who is This Mysterious BTC Whale ? The identity of the wallet holder remains unknown, as is common with many large blockchain transactions. This anonymity adds to the mystery and fuels speculation. Could it be an early Bitcoin adopter, an institutional investor, or perhaps a large trading firm? The ‘unknown wallet’ tag means we lack direct insight into their motivations. While the blockchain provides transparency regarding the transaction itself, the ‘who’ behind it often stays hidden. On-chain analytics firms continuously track these movements, trying to decipher patterns and potential identities, but often, the precise reasoning behind such a significant Bitcoin transfer remains speculative. Navigating Large Bitcoin Movement s: What Should You Consider? For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, how should one approach news of a massive Bitcoin transfer like this? It is important to: Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and on-chain analytics platforms to understand significant movements. Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive trading decisions based solely on one whale transaction. Markets are complex and influenced by many factors. Conduct Your Own Research: Investigate the context. Is this part of a larger trend? What is the overall market sentiment? Manage Risk: Always employ sound risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your portfolio. Ultimately, while a 3,500 BTC transfer to Bitfinex is a noteworthy event, it serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Observing such a Bitfinex transaction helps us better understand the movements of major players and their potential influence. Conclusion: A Watchful Eye on Whale Activity The recent 3,500 BTC transfer from an unknown wallet to Bitfinex underscores the constant ebb and flow of significant capital within the crypto ecosystem. While the precise intentions of this BTC whale remain shrouded in mystery, the sheer volume of this large BTC movement ensures it will be a focal point for market observers. Staying informed about these substantial transactions provides valuable insights into potential market shifts and helps investors navigate the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a BTC whale ? A BTC whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. Their movements are closely watched by other market participants. Why are large Bitcoin movement s significant? Large Bitcoin movement s, especially to or from exchanges, are significant because they can signal potential buying or selling pressure, which may lead to increased volatility or price shifts in the crypto market . What is Bitfinex? Bitfinex is a prominent cryptocurrency exchange known for its high liquidity, advanced trading features, and ability to handle large volume transactions. It is a popular platform for professional traders and institutions. How does a Bitcoin transfer to an exchange affect the crypto market ? A Bitcoin transfer to an exchange can increase the available supply for trading, potentially leading to selling pressure if the whale intends to liquidate their holdings. Conversely, withdrawals from exchanges can signal a desire to hold, potentially reducing selling pressure. Should I be concerned about this specific Bitfinex transaction ? While a Bitfinex transaction of this size is notable, it’s not necessarily a cause for immediate concern. It is one data point among many. Investors should always consider the broader market context and their own risk tolerance before making any decisions.

However, in 2025, this landscape is subtly shifting. Bitcoin, once considered a speculative asset, has gradually entered the mainstream consciousness, becoming not only a candidate for reserve asset but also being designated as a strategic asset by a growing number of countries.

49659236,550031,1754517651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49659236.jpeg,Major Win For Crypto: SEC Rules Liquid Staking Activities Outside Securities Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sec-rules-liquid-staking-outside-securities/,"In what could mark a significant advancement for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued new guidance regarding liquid staking activities. This development follows a concerted effort by industry leaders, including Jito Labs, Bitwise Asset Management, Multicoin Capital, VanEck, and the Solana Institute, who recently urged the SEC to allow the use of liquid staking tokens in proposed exchange-traded products (ETPs) for Solana (SOL). SEC Clarifies Liquid Staking Regulations The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a statement clarifying how federal securities laws apply to liquid staking. This process involves staking crypto assets via a software protocol, which in turn generates a “liquid staking receipt token.” This token serves as proof of ownership for the staked assets and any rewards generated. Importantly, the SEC indicated that under certain conditions, the activities associated with liquid staking may not constitute the offer or sale of securities, as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The recently appointed Chairman Paul S. Atkins emphasized the SEC’s commitment to providing clear regulatory guidance for emerging technologies and financial practices. He described the staff statement on liquid staking as a crucial step in delineating which crypto asset activities fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. This effort aligns with the SEC’s broader initiative, dubbed “ Project Crypto ,” which aims to position the US as a global leader in the crypto landscape, echoing President Donald Trump’s commitment to fostering the industry. Atkins remarked on the importance of a regulatory framework that encourages innovation rather than stifles it. He pointed out that a balanced regulatory approach enhances America’s leadership in the digital asset space. Project Crypto The SEC’s goals include bringing digital asset activities back to the US, modernizing custody requirements for digital assets, and promoting experimentation with innovative technologies—such as tokenizing equities . Since taking office, Atkins has already begun to reverse some of the more stringent measures implemented by his predecessor, Gary Gensler. This shift has been supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known affectionately in the industry as “crypto mom” for her pro-crypto stance. Among the notable actions taken under Atkins’ leadership is the withdrawal of lawsuits against several prominent companies in the sector, including Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, as well as initiating new rulemaking efforts to adapt to the evolving landscape of digital finance. Overall, the SEC’s recent guidance on liquid staking and the broader Project Crypto initiative signal a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry, potentially fostering an environment ripe for innovation and growth.

In a post on the social media platform X, James Howells – a man who mistakenly threw away his crypto wallet containing the BTC nearly a decade ago – says he’s not giving up despite being rejected numerous times by the Newport City Council to launch a search to find the coins. “For over 12 years, I tried everything to engage with Newport City Council: public proposals, percentages, mediation, legal action, and a formal $25 million offer. $1 Billion and they ignored it all. No response. No logic. No leadership. They want me to give up, but I am done asking for permission.” Howells says he’s going to tokenize the entire missing wallet, which contains 8,000 BTC, by launching a new blockchain called Ceiniog Coin (INI) that is set to launch in late 2025. “I’m tokenizing the entire wallet – 8,000 BTC – into 800 billion Ceiniog Coin (INI) – 1:1 satoshi value match. • Built on Bitcoin • Powered by OP_RETURN • Integrates with Stacks, Runes, Ordinals • Launching Late-2025 To the established and distinguished gatekeepers who blocked me for over a decade: You can block the gates. You can pack the courts. But you cannot block the blockchain. Crypto already won. Ceiniog is coming – and your world is collapsing.” According to previous reports, Howells offered the city council $70 million in 2021 for permission to search the landfill to recover his hard drive, but was rejected due to environmental concerns. In February, the city council announced that the landfill was formally closing down sometime during the 2025-2026 fiscal year. BTC is trading for $115,429 at time of writing, a 2% gain on the day.
