You might also like: DOGE, PEPE, XYZ: Analyzing the leader of the 2025 meme coin race Cardano Cardano is a big name in the world of cryptocurrencies. It’s a flexible and scalable platform designed for smart contracts. This means developers can build apps, tokens, and games on its blockchain. The native coin of Cardano is ADA. Like Ethereum’s ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and support the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being environmentally friendly. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which saves energy compared to other methods that use lots of power. The crypto market is paying attention to green technologies. Thus, Cardano’s eco-friendly approach gives it an edge over other coins. Additionally, its unique design allows for fast transactions, possibly up to a million per second. This is much quicker than many other blockchains. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and smart contracts, ADA could become even more important. While the market keeps changing, Cardano’s strong technology and focus on sustainability make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Toncoin Toncoin is the digital currency of The Open Network (TON), an open-source blockchain aiming for fast, secure payments with low fees. Initially developed by Telegram as the ‘Gram’ token for the Telegram Open Network, the project was halted in 2020 due to legal issues with the SEC. Since then, the non-profit TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over. The network uses proof-of-stake, enhancing its scalability and reliability. TON is building a full ecosystem with decentralized storage services, domain names, private networking, and efficient payment systems. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows great potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate Toncoin could reach up to $30.30 by 2025, a significant increase from today’s price. In the current market, where fast and secure payment solutions are in demand, Toncoin’s technology could make it stand out. Its focus on a comprehensive ecosystem and minimal fees might attract more users. Conclusion While ADA and TON are solid, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for 20,000% growth in the 2024 bull run.

According to reports, the move comes with a clear caveat: tax exemptions will not be part of the package. This development was revealed by Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum recently hosted by Ekonomichna Pravda. Crypto Legalisation Timeline and Legislative Progress Hetmantsev announced that a draft law, developed in close collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is nearing completion. He mentioned that the draft is expected to be ready after the New Year, and the crypto legalization will be passed after that. This draft law builds on a milestone in November 2023, when Ukraine’s parliament introduced legislation on taxing virtual asset transactions. The passage of this new bill will mark the final step in creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. Similarly, Russia recently introduced a new crypto bill that focuses on crypto transactions. The bill aims to regulate digital assets and ensure compliance with financial laws. If Ukraine legalizes crypto in 2025, it will join countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. These nations have embraced virtual assets and implemented rules to manage risks and ensure compliance with tax and financial laws. The Taxation Model: No Special Privileges While legalizing digital assets is a significant move, the absence of tax exemptions reflects a cautious and practical approach. According to Hetmantsev, profits from crypto will be taxed under the same model applied to securities. Taxes will only be levied when assets are converted into traditional currency. This cautious approach aligns with international best practices, ensuring digital assets do not create loopholes in Ukraine’s tax system. Many countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Germany, have adopted a similarly cautious approach to the taxation of digital assets. Ukraine in the Crypto Space Ukraine has been a prominent player in the global crypto landscape, making consistent strides toward integrating digital assets into its economy. In 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” law , which provided a legal definition for cryptocurrencies and recognized them as an asset class. This law laid the groundwork for the current efforts toward full-scale legalization. Also, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has actively collaborated with international blockchain companies and tech giants to develop a robust digital economy. During the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine embraced crypto donations. This move showcased the practical utility of digital assets during crises. The initiative raised millions to support defense and humanitarian efforts. As the first quarter of 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on Ukraine as it navigates the challenges and opportunities of becoming a fully crypto-legal nation.

For example, according to Etherscan , one whale moved coins worth over $1.7 million from Coinbase on Thursday. In line with this, tokens on exchanges have dropped to 254.4 million in the last seven days. They have been in a steady downward trend in the past few months. Second, Chainlink has forged significant partnerships in recent months. Earlier this week, the developers announced collaborations with Coinbase and Emirates NBD, a bank with over $200 billion in assets. Chainlink has also partnered with organizations like Swift Network. Notably, Swift recently conducted a large-scale tokenization trade with UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager. Swift plans to integrate Chainlink’s technology into its money movement business, which processes over $150 trillion annually. On top of this, Chainlink has become the biggest oracle network in terms of total value secured. The $38 billion it has secured is higher than the other ten oracles, combined. Chainlink price has strong technicals Chainlink price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that LINK has maintained a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. It recently crossed the critical resistance level at $22.85, its highest swing in March of this year. The coin has also moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level, and the percentage price oscillator has risen above the zero line. The next key level to watch is $52, Chainlink’s all-time high, which is about 88% above the current price. A decline below the support level of $22.85 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

This shift comes as these experienced players look beyond established tokens to capitalize on undervalued assets with game-changing potential. With projections of a massive 29,000% return, PCHAIN could outshine major cryptocurrencies and redefine what it means to invest early in a high-utility project. Cardano Whales Shift Focus: Why PropiChain is Their Next Big Target Cardano has long been a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space, with its innovative proof-of-stake protocol and focus on sustainability. It’s no surprise that whales continue to see its value. However, even as Cardano holds strong, these experienced investors are looking for opportunities to deliver more explosive returns, which is where PropiChain enters the picture. The whales’ interest in PropiChain is a clear indicator of its potential. Large-scale investors often have access to advanced analytics and industry insights, meaning their moves can serve as a beacon for others. PropiChain addresses inefficiencies in property transactions and captures attention in ways most altcoins can’t. For everyday investors, following the money might be the smartest move yet. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate Through Blockchain PropiChain stands out by addressing one of the world’s most lucrative markets through blockchain technology. PropiChain is redefining how people access and invest in property at its core by offering a suite of innovative features tailored to modern investment needs. Tokenized Real Estate : You can own a fraction of a high-end property without spending millions in capital. PropiChain’s tokenization model converts these properties into tokens, allowing you to buy small shares. This levels the playground for smaller investors to get in. This feature is perfect for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of traditional property ownership. Fractional Ownership : Gone are the days when real estate investing required hefty down payments and complex legal processes. With fractional ownership, an investor can own a percentage of a property for as little as a few thousand dollars, earning proportional returns from rent or value appreciation. AI-Powered Insights : PropiChain doesn’t just provide access to real estate, it equips investors with the tools to make smarter decisions. Its AI analytics platform offers predictive market trends, helping users identify high-growth areas before they explode in value. For example, the system might highlight a suburban market on the verge of a boom, giving early investors an edge. Metaverse Integration : Taking innovation further, PropiChain lets users explore properties virtually in its metaverse platform. This adds an interactive layer that traditional real estate platforms can’t match. PropiChain Presale’s 29,000% Growth Potential PropiChain is in its presale phase, offering a rare opportunity for early adopters to enter at a ground-floor price. The initial token price started at just $0.004 and has now risen to $0.011 in stage two. This structured presale model, combined with projections of 29,000% ROI, makes it an incredibly attractive proposition. Let’s break this down with a practical example: If you invested $1,000 in PropiChain during its presale, and the token hits its projected value, your investment could turn to $290,000. Compare this to Cardano, where similar returns are highly improbable due to its established market positions and limited room for explosive growth. PropiChain’s presale credibility is strengthened by its CMC listing and rigorous audits by BlockAudit, ensuring security and transparency. Moreover, the project has already raised over $1 million, with its first stage selling out rapidly. This demonstrates the immense interest and confidence in PropiChain’s vision. Conclusion PropiChain is rapidly becoming the talk of the crypto world, and for good reason. With the first presale already filled, it’s clear that this project is gaining traction and that it is time to act. Each passing day brings PropiChain closer to its next pricing stage, where early adopters will already see gains while new investors pay more. Secure your spot in the PropiChain presale today.

Earlier this week, a Dogecoin monitoring platform noticed that the number of DOGE nodes dipped from 647 to just 205, a decrease of about 69%. “Our monitoring made us aware that the vulnerability appears to have been exploited, and almost 69% of the Dogecoin network has crashed. Blockchair shows the number of public nodes. Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205.” However, according to Blockchair, some DOGE nodes have since recovered as there are currently 331 active nodes around the world at time of writing. In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Bitcoin ( BTC ) sidechain developer Andreas Kohl says that he was the one who took down most of the DOGE network using an old laptop. “I used a publicly disclosed vulnerability [by BTC developer Tobias Ruck] to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural El Salvador.” According to Kohl, most DOGE users didn’t even notice . “Only nodes that weren’t on the latest version were affected – which was the majority of the network, excluding CEXs (centralized exchanges) and most other major custodians – hence why most doge users never noticed, not that many understand self-custody.” News of the exploit had little impact on the price of DOGE as the meme asset is trading for $0.413 at time of writing, a 4.7% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Instead, it offers a high-capacity network that attracts developers and investors looking to host products and services with high activity. SOL is Solana’s native cryptocurrency. It is important in the ecosystem because it helps with transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards people who support the network. The coin has value because it underpins how Solana works and lets users access various projects on the platform.

Let’s understand why. The crypto market in 2024 has been nothing short of transformative, with major milestones taking center stage throughout the year. Against this backdrop, Bitwise has made a series of bold predictions for 2025, bringing into focus the next big trends in the industry. Let’s dive into the details of each prediction and unravel the market conditions to assess how realistic these forecasts are and what they could mean for the future of the industry. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Stablecoins and tokenized assets The road ahead Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption The first of these claims is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar beyond $200,000 in 2025. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin is trading at $100,500 levels as of Dec. 12, a minor step back from its all-time high of $103,900 achieved just a week ago on Dec. 5. BTC Price Chart | Source: crypto.news This dip, marking a 3.5% retreat, comes on the heels of a broader market correction following an extraordinary bull run earlier in the year. Bitcoin first broke its previous all-time high of $73,000 in March, setting off a wave of optimism that reached a crescendo in November when Donald Trump was elected the 47th President of the U.S. His administration’s perceived pro-crypto stance has injected fresh confidence into the market. While the recent pullback may have tempered the frenzy, the overarching bullish sentiment remains intact. Adding fuel to this optimism is the explosive growth in Bitcoin ETFs , which Bitwise predicts will attract even more inflows in 2025 than they did in 2024. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of this year, total assets under management across these ETFs have reached an astonishing $113 billion as of Dec. 12, according to CoinGlass. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner, drawing in the lion’s share of inflows. In just the past week, a record-breaking $3.85 billion flowed into digital asset funds, with BlackRock accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. Bitwise’s third prediction ties closely to the first two, forecasting that the number of countries holding Bitcoin will double by 2025. The idea of nation-states accumulating Bitcoin is not new, but it is gaining traction as governments recognize its potential as a reserve asset. Currently, eight nations hold Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading the pack with over 207,000 BTC, valued at more than $20.6 billion as of today. China follows closely, holding 194,000 BTC worth $19.3 billion. Other notable holders include the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador, with holdings ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of BTC. Collectively, all these nations control 529,558 BTC, which is roughly 2.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million coins. If the number of countries holding Bitcoin does indeed double, we could see a profound shift in geopolitical strategies, with Bitcoin serving as a new kind of reserve asset. Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Bitwise’s next set of predictions for 2025 claims that Coinbase (COIN) stock will exceed $700 per share by 2025. Currently trading at $313, Coinbase has seen a 100% year-to-date gain. For context, Coinbase’s all-time high was $429.54, achieved during its debut on April 13, 2021, while its lowest point came on January 5, 2023, at $31.55. From its all-time low to today’s price, the stock has surged by over 900%, showing a dramatic turnaround. However, achieving the predicted $700 mark would require an additional 120% increase. Another fascinating prediction centers on Coinbase’s potential entry into the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. For Coinbase, joining the prestigious S&P 500 would signify its maturation as a blue-chip stock, reserved for companies with a market capitalization exceeding $18 billion and meeting specific profitability criteria. While Coinbase has faced volatility since its IPO, its strong recovery in 2023 and consistent performance in 2024 make it a viable candidate for the index. On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s transformation from a business software company to a corporate Bitcoin pioneer has redefined its market presence, with its stock price climbing 500% year-to-date, trading at $411 levels as of this writing, down from its 52-week high of $543. The idea of MicroStrategy joining the Nasdaq-100 and possibly the S&P 500 has generated considerable buzz. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the company is a strong contender for the Nasdaq-100, with an announcement expected soon. $MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic). Below is best guess of adds/drops via @JSeyff . Likely a 0.47% weight (40th biggest holding). There's $550b of ETFs tracking the index. S&P 500 add next yr prob. pic.twitter.com/rmTavtvWQL — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 10, 2024 However, its inclusion in the S&P 500 remains more challenging due to stricter criteria and the index committee’s selective approach. Another exciting prediction for 2025 is that at least five crypto unicorns will go public in the U.S. With around 30 crypto unicorns currently operating in the U.S. — including well-known names like Ripple ( XRP ), OpenSea, and Chainalysis —t he pipeline for potential IPOs is robust. An influx of crypto-related IPOs would not only provide new investment opportunities but also signal the sector’s maturation as it transitions from niche to mainstream. Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Bitwise’s next prediction for 2025 revolves around the U.S. Department of Labor potentially relaxing its current guidance against including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans. To understand the potential impact, it’s important to first unpack the current state of affairs and why crypto in retirement accounts has been a contentious issue. As of now, the Department of Labor maintains a cautious stance toward crypto in retirement plans. In March 2022, the agency issued a compliance bulletin warning fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” when allowing cryptocurrencies in 401(k) offerings. The DOL raised concerns about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, their price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the risks of fraud and theft. The agency argued that these factors make digital assets unsuitable for most retirement savers, whose investment horizons are long and whose risk tolerance is generally low. Under this guidance, the inclusion of crypto in 401(k) plans has been rare. A few instances of integration, such as Fidelity’s introduction of a Bitcoin option for its 401(k) plans in 2022, faced immediate scrutiny. The DOL cautioned Fidelity and other firms offering similar products to ensure compliance with fiduciary duties, effectively discouraging broader adoption. Employers have been hesitant to expose themselves to potential liability, resulting in a limited presence of crypto within retirement portfolios. If the prediction of relaxed guidance in 2025 comes true, it would mark a major policy reversal. Such a shift would likely be driven by growing demand from younger generations of workers who see crypto as a legitimate asset class. Surveys have consistently shown that millennials and Gen Z investors view crypto as a vital component of their long-term financial strategies. For example, a 2023 Charles Schwab study found that 47% of millennials already hold crypto in some capacity, and 45% expressed interest in including it in their retirement accounts if given the option. The potential market impact of this change is enormous. According to the Investment Company Institute, U.S. 401(k) plans held approximately $7.7 trillion in assets as of December 2023. Even a small percentage of this being allocated to cryptocurrencies could inject heavy liquidity into the market and further legitimize the space. Stablecoins and tokenized assets Bitwise’s predictions for 2025 also include a bold outlook on the stablecoin market and the tokenized real-world assets space. The first projection foresees stablecoin assets doubling to over $400 billion, a substantial leap from their current market capitalization of $207 billion as of Dec. 12. Tether ( USDT ) dominates this market with a commanding share of approximately 67.6%, backed by its $140 billion market cap. USDT’s closest competitor, USD Coin ( USDC ), lags behind with a market cap of $41 billion, making it roughly 3.4 times smaller. Stablecoins are frequently used as trading pairs on exchanges, providing a bridge between crypto assets and fiat currencies. Moreover, their role in facilitating cross-border transactions has also gained attention, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. The second prediction centers on the tokenized real-world asset market, which is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025. According to a September 2024 Binance report, the total value of tokenized RWAs hit an all-time high of over $12 billion, excluding stablecoins. On-chain real-world assets (""RWAs"") have reached an all-time high. Our new report explores this recent growth, outlines key RWA categories, and provides a tech-driven tour of some of the most interesting protocols in the space. Read on 🔽 https://t.co/1w8gr3Nrkg — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) September 13, 2024 RWAs refer to blockchain-based representations of physical and financial assets such as real estate, government bonds, commodities, and even fine art. Tokenization allows these assets to be divided into smaller units, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Key categories in the RWA space include tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and real estate, with emerging categories such as carbon credits and air rights also gaining traction. Traditional asset managers have already begun to tokenize illiquid assets like real estate or fine art to offer investors opportunities to diversify their holdings in ways that were previously challenging or cost-prohibitive. A McKinsey report from June 2024 estimates that the tokenized market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030, underpinned by increasing demand for transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership in financial markets. The road ahead The future of the crypto market looks exciting, with Bitwise’s 2025 predictions pointing to major shifts ahead. Bitcoin could hit new highs, stablecoins could double in value, and tokenized real-world assets could gain traction as the next big thing. But these changes will depend on how the market grows, how regulations evolve, and how technology keeps up. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Per the media outlet CoinPost and the official House of Councillors record , the demand came from Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK. A National Bitcoin Reserve for Japan? Hamada submitted a written question to the government “regarding the creation of a reserve fund for cryptoassets.” Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada In the question, the lawmaker noted there moves are now afoot “in Brazil and the United States,” where Treasury officials could soon begin holding Bitcoin (BTC) as a “strategic reserve asset.” Hamada went on to ask the Japanese government to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.” He added that the incoming Donald Trump administration will appoint a so-called crypto “czar” and explained that “similar movements are also underway in Brazil.” The lawmaker mentioned that BTC could soon become a “national strategic asset.” He submitted his request in a document entitled: “Question regarding the status of understanding the movement to introduce a national Bitcoin reserve in the United States and other countries.” Decentralized Solution Hamada’s question also made note of the fact that BTC is “less susceptible to the influence of specific countries or institutions.” And he said that its “neutrality and decentralized nature” allows Bitcoin to support economic activity” without “relying on any specific currency.” The government is set to provide Hamada with a written response in the coming weeks, and will likely publish this on its official website. A new risk for the yen is emerging, with currency strategists in Tokyo warning that there’s a chance the Bank of Japan may stand pat on interest rates until March or later https://t.co/tUNZ6lFvSM — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 12, 2024 Lawmakers Share Sentiment? Hamada represents a political party that only has two seats in parliament. But there is a high probability that other MPs share Hamada’s views. Japan’s relatively restrictive regulations have resulted in a shrinking crypto market. But many top lawmakers still want to turn the nation into a global blockchain hotspot. They have urged Tokyo to reform crypto tax laws and prevent promising crypto startups from relocating overseas. Meanwhile, the business sector is growing increasingly Bitcoin-keen, with some Japanese firms using their balance sheet to buy BTC and altcoins . Many regulatory bodies appear ready to make the necessary reforms. But the nation’s new Prime Minister has expressed a more cautious view on crypto regulation reform .

This is significant, considering how it could set Shiba Inu on a path to higher prices. Most SHIB Holders In The Green As Shiba Inu Price Rebounds IntoTheBlock data shows that most SHIB holders are in the green as the Shiba Inu price rebounds towards $0.00003. 69% of these SHIB holders are now in the money, while 24% are out of the money, and 6% are currently in the money. This could be bullish for the Shiba Inu price, considering that holders are less likely to sell when they are in the money. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 This could reduce the selling pressure on SHIB and sustain the Shiba Inu price recovery. The meme coin has recovered towards $0.00003. The ‘In the Money’ metric shows that the next significant resistance level that Shiba Inu needs to break above is $0.000033. 130,620 wallet addresses bought 15.06 trillion SHIB tokens around this level. However, on-chain metrics still paint a bearish picture for Shiba Inu, which is undoubtedly concerning. IntoTheBlock data shows that the ‘Concentration’ metric is in the red, indicating that SHIB whales currently have a bearish sentiment towards the meme coin and are opting against accumulating more coins. This large transaction metric is also bearish at the moment as Shiba Inu whales are opting against accumulating more coins. The net network growth also paints a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu price, as there is currently a low influx of new addresses buying the meme coin. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also remained inconsistent, further presenting a bearish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. Shibburn data shows that the burn rate is down over 79% in the last 24 hours, with three million coins burned during this period. From A Technical Analysis Perspective Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu from a technical analysis perspective. In an X post, he stated that Shiba Inu recently confirmed another bullish pattern, which could lead to a continuation of its upward trend. The analyst added that another major upside move could be in play for SHIB, with the meme coin possibly rallying to $0.00081 or even higher. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible The crypto analyst further mentioned that with this target at $0.000081, the Shiba Inu price could witness a 180% climb and that this rally may already be in play. A rally to $0.000081 could pave the way for Shiba Inu to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000029, up over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

After months of speculation, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, thrilling both long-time HODLers and fresh investors alike. The cherry on top? Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing a steady influx of funds, showing a renewed wave of institutional confidence. Fidelity, ARK, and Grayscale are leading the charge, with millions flowing into their ETFs as BTC maintains its climb. Meanwhile, Ethereum is quietly but powerfully making its case, with analysts eyeing the $5,000 milestone thanks to growing demand and tightening supply dynamics. It’s a bullish December for crypto, and the buzz is palpable. Amid this surge, Qubetics ($TICS) has been making waves of its own. Unlike many speculative projects, Qubetics aims to solve real-world challenges by bringing asset tokenisation into the mainstream. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is all about solving real-world problems for real people. Ever thought about how clunky and fragmented the process of managing real-world assets can be? That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s all about tokenising real-world assets —from real estate to intellectual property—and making them tradable on the blockchain. Picture this: a small business owner needs to raise capital but doesn’t want to go through the red tape of traditional financing. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their inventory or even future revenue streams. Investors get a piece of the action, and the business gets liquidity. Qubetics lets them do just that, creating a win-win for creators and fans. For more information, check out this exclusive AMA Session . The numbers don’t lie. The Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 313 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 8,700 holders, raising a staggering $5.7 million so far. At just $0.0311 per token, it’s an entry point that screams potential. The prices are set to jump by 10% this weekend. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to dive in, this is it. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto platform; it’s a revolution. By bridging the gap between physical and digital assets, it’s opening doors that were previously bolted shut. Whether you’re a business, a professional, or just someone looking to diversify their portfolio, Qubetics offers a fresh, innovative approach to asset management. And with its presale momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the time to act is now. Bitcoin: The King Reclaims The Crown, Smashes $100K Barrier Bitcoin is smashing through ceilings, and $100,000 isn’t just another number—it’s a statement. After years of scepticism, the flagship cryptocurrency has cemented itself as more than just digital gold. What’s fuelling this latest rally? It’s the ETFs, baby. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have been on fire, pulling in $223 million in just one day. Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC are attracting cash like a magnet, proving institutional investors are in it for the long haul. This ETF frenzy didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s a mix of perfect timing and a maturing market. Inflation data has eased fears of aggressive rate hikes, nudging the Fed toward a potential cut. That’s music to Bitcoin’s ears. Add to that a trading volume of $3.94 billion for BTC investment products, and you’ve got a market roaring with optimism. But let’s keep it real. Bitcoin isn’t just about big-shot ETFs and six-figure price tags. For the everyday investor, it’s about resilience and reliability. Think about it: Bitcoin has outperformed most traditional assets this year. Whether you’re stacking sats or eyeing a long-term hold, Bitcoin’s recent performance is a masterclass in staying power. And if history is any guide, the king’s reign is far from over. Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Big Break While Bitcoin grabs headlines, Ethereum is quietly orchestrating a rally of its own. Hovering around $5,000, ETH is poised for what could be its most significant breakout yet. Why? It’s all about the fundamentals. Since the introduction of spot ETFs in July, institutional demand for Ethereum has surged. Over 3.41 million ETH are now held in these funds, up from 2.716 million just a few months ago. That’s a whole lot of confidence from big-money players. Then there’s Ethereum’s supply story. With every transaction burning ETH, the network is seeing deflationary forces at play. Higher activity on the blockchain means more ETH gets removed from circulation. It’s like a double-edged sword that only sharpens the asset’s scarcity. And speaking of activity, Ethereum’s daily transactions are off the charts, with smart contracts and dApps fuelling the ecosystem like never before. But here’s where Ethereum gets really interesting: its adaptability. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn’t just a store of value; it’s the backbone of decentralised finance, NFTs, and so much more. Whether you’re a DeFi junkie or a casual dApp user, ETH offers a slice of something bigger. With its realised price hovering around $5,200, the stars seem to be aligning for a push past $5K. Could this be the moment Ethereum leaves its mark as more than Bitcoin’s little brother? It sure feels like it. Make Your Move This December, the crypto market is buzzing with opportunities. Bitcoin’s climb past $100K proves it’s still the king of the hill, while Ethereum’s deflationary dynamics set the stage for a major rally. But if you’re looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presale offers a chance to get in early on a project that’s truly breaking new ground. Don’t let this moment pass you by. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes in the crypto waters, these three options are shaping up to be the best cryptos to invest in this month. Act now, and let your portfolio ride the wave.

The books span genres, languages, and authors such as Dickens, Dante, and Shakespeare which are no longer copyright protected because of their age. The new dataset initiative comes as AI training data is naturally pricey and best suited for tech firms with deep pockets. Harvard got financial backing from tech giants According to a TechCrunch article, the initiative is spearheaded by the Harvard’s Institutional Data Initiative (IDI). This initiative contains books derived from Google’s longstanding book-scanning project Google Books . Other books contained in the dataset include Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. The university teased the IDI in March clearly stating its plans to create a “trusted conduit for legal data for AI.” Since then, not much was heard from it until the formal launch on Thursday and tech giants Microsoft and OpenAI funded the project. The dataset is not a preserve of Silicon Valley alone but IDI has opened it to anyone, that is from research labs to AI startups that want to train their large language models. By opening the dataset to anyone, IDI executive director Greg Leppert said the dataset is meant to level the playing field, at a time when the cost of training AI remains high and prohibitive to smaller companies and making it preserve of those with huge budgets. Leppert added that the dataset is “rigorously reviewed,” which according to Fudzilla presumably means someone checked to ensure that Bard was really gone and out of the way. The Harvard dataset will need more resources According to Leppert, who compared the dataset’s potential to Linux, the open source operating system, the success of the Harvard dataset will be hinged on a number of variables. Leppert said its success will require more resources, expertise, and a “sprinkle of magic” from those same deep-pocketed corporations that the initiative is designed to challenge. The million books contained in the dataset were scanned as part of Google Books program. Fudzilla describes the initiative as a digital time capsule from when Google’s ambitions to scan every book seemed quirky rather than dystopian. However, Leppert is upbeat about the project’s potential uses, further suggesting it could a such a treasure trove helping train AI models for everyone from garage startups to the corporate conglomerates. While some have praised the initiative as a revolutionary leap forward in democratizing AI, Fudzilla opines that some might see this as a subtle means of ensuring that any ambitious upstart with a few terabytes of server space can now compete in a race to develop the next ChatGPT. However, they will need more resources to compete and make a dent in the market. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred the race for generative AI models across the globe. However, the development of these models has created a thirst for data to perfect them and this desire for more data has caused problems on how much information they can get, without stealing it. To date, publishers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have sued OpenAI and Perplexity over using their data without permission.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lunex Network, a new protocol, is attracting Avalanche and XRP investors as their prices lose strength. Table of Contents XRP braces for price correction Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Lunex Network to deliver extensive trader benefits Avalanche (AVAX) and Ripple (XRP) have both seen losses this week. This hasn’t come as a shock for Avalanche, as the project has struggled to gain momentum this year. For XRP, this loss could mark the end of the asset’s wild ride, having rallied last month. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been gaining traction in the trading space for its modern approach to crypto. It promises to address long-time trader frustrations by offering low fees, strong interoperability, and powerful trading tools. XRP braces for price correction XRP is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last week. Many experts expect corrective price action as XRP saw wild growth throughout November, rallying by 300%. The XRP price growth likely occurred as a result of Trump’s appointment, pointing towards a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto platforms in the near future. Ripple has also worked hard to improve its ledger and is now seen as a real authority in the cross-border payment space. Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Avalanche added 31% to its value over the year, a level of growth dwarfed by the wider crypto market expansion. AVAX is still slowing down and possibly heading downward after dropping 12% in 24 hours and 13% in the last week. Despite the underwhelming price performance, Avalanche has released some well received updates. Specifically, the Avalanche9000 upgrade was recently released on the testnet and is set to bring flexibility and scalability to the network. This will make Avalanche a more hospitable place for developers looking to build intelligent and scalable decentralized applications.

At the core of Lunex Network is the LNEX token, designed for long-term stability and growth. With a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, scarcity may drive value higher as adoption increases. Notably, LNEX holders will receive 18% of the platform’s profits from transaction fees, promoting sustained investment and ecosystem expansion. Lunex Network is currently generating major hype in the crypto space, with tokens available at $0.0044. Analysts anticipate an 1,800% increase in the value of LNEX in the near future, suggesting a promising opportunity for those looking to benefit from the next wave of DeFi.

This activity is part of Ripple’s intensified testing phase for its stablecoin, which is set to launch soon following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple Mints Over 13M RLUSD Amid Imminent Launch Data from Ripple’s Stablecoin Tracker reveals the minting of 13.9 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network. On the XRP Ledger, Ripple minted 2.6 million RLUSD, followed by three additional mints of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. Concurrently, the Ethereum Network recorded mints of 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. The stablecoin, which is fully backed by onshore U.S. assets, has been undergoing rigorous tests involving minting and transfers across these networks. Ripple confirmed that these tests are aimed at ensuring the stablecoin’s functionality before its official debut. Moreover, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on X (formerly Twitter), saying, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” Regulatory Approval Sets RLUSD Apart from Competitors Ripple has secured NYDFS approval, making RLUSD one of the few U.S.-regulated stablecoins. Unlike competitors like USDT and USDC, RLUSD meets strict requirements under U.S. financial regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III standards. The stablecoin is fully collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and held in regulated custody, ensuring compliance with Federal Reserve and FDIC guidelines. US banks can hold #RLUSD on the XRPL/ETH ledger, and why USDC and USDT cannot. Here's an explanation of why RLUSD is so special and why it took years to get approved… READ ON Regulations Summary: U.S. GAAP/IFRS: Assets must have clear value, reliable measurement, and meet… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 11, 2024 This regulatory approval positions RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. According to Ripple, its transparent operations, including real-time audits, differentiate it from other stablecoins. USDT, for example, has faced scrutiny for inconsistent audits, while USDC operates partially offshore, making compliance with certain U.S. standards challenging. Analysts Assess XRP Price Movement Amid RLUSD Developments The approval and testing of RLUSD have coincided with a notable increase in XRP’s market value. XRP has risen from $1.90 to $2.35, with some analysts describing this as a “speculative pump.” Software engineer Vincent Van Code stated that XRP’s price could see further gains if RLUSD enters decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Van Code emphasized that liquidity pool (LP) and automated market maker (AMM) features for RLUSD on the XRP Ledger could drive demand. He suggested that users earning returns through LPs might contribute to increased XRP adoption. Additionally, the ability to swap RLUSD with other stablecoins or use it for on-chain staking could further integrate RLUSD into DeFi activities. Amid RLUSD-related developments, significant XRP transactions have been observed. Over 39.43 million XRP, valued at $95.5 million, was moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Separately, a whale transferred approximately 99.99 million XRP worth $234.4 million between unknown wallets.

Climbing by over 298% to trade at just over $2.30 from about $0.57, XRP is reigniting investor interest in altcoins. As Ripple’s token solidifies its position, a new competitor is quietly emerging: RCO Finance (RCOF) . This overlooked altcoin is making a name for itself with its 16,509% growth potential, unique features and scalable ecosystem. RCOF is quickly establishing itself, offering a unique opportunity for quick-witted investors looking to capitalize on high-growth opportunities. XRP Price Rally: Key Drivers Behind Its Growth The resurgence of Ripple’s native token is driven by increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and its established role in the payment sector. These factors have propelled the XRP price to new highs, promising more returns. The most notable factor driving the XRP price up is Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC. This ruling clarified XRP’s status and helped remove the uncertainty clouded the altcoin since 2020. This favorable ruling has fueled a wave of adoption, especially by institutional investors, positioning XRP as a reliable asset that drives XRP price appreciation. As a pioneer in cross-border payment, XRP’s ability to facilitate fast and cost-effective international payments has made it the go-to solution for financial institutions. With XRP upgrading its XRP ledger, it has enhanced its utility in facilitating and streamlining global transactions, increasing demand for XRP tokens. This has, in turn, reinforced its market value, driving up the XRP price. Lastly, the XRP price rises as it rides the tailwinds of Bitcoin’s impressive performance. BTC’s gains and positive sentiment have spilled over, creating a conducive environment for altcoins like XRP to thrive. RCO Finance, The Overlooked Altcoin With 16,509% Growth Potential Following the impressive performance of the XRP price, savvy investors are now looking for other altcoins with similar growth potential.

That emerged recently when CZ’s tweet about a leading crypto-centered travel platform saw its token rise exponentially within an hour. The crypto billionaire’s tacit endorsement of Travala on X spurred a 300% spike in the platform’s AVA token price. CZ was responding to Travala’s post celebrating a significant milestone in its revenues. His tweet came out as a tacit endorsement of Travala renewing interest in it. His post went: We invested in this crypto travel platform pre-COVID, pre-crypto winter, and held on. BUILD. ~Changpeng Zhao In 2024, Travala grew its 2023 gross revenue by over 67% Travala has made big strides in consolidating its position within the crypto-travelling/hospitality niche. In 2024, for instance, it recorded annual revenues of over $100 million, a massive jump from the $59.6 million it earned in 2023. The firm attributes that spike to an uptick in flight and accommodation bookings on its platform. Users can make reservations for these services in 100+ cryptocurrencies. Buoyed by this result, Travala announced it would be setting up its Bitcoin and AVA reserves. It says that the move was vital in expanding its financial muscle. With these additional funds, the company intends to strengthen its foothold within the blockchain-based travel industry and enhance its incentives program. The firm has pushed innovation in the travel sector Travala has always championed innovation in the travel sector. For instance, it pioneered crypto bookings using different digital assets. It also introduced Dtravel, a decentralized alternative to Airbnb. Unlike other P2P travel market services, Dtravel hosts have a share in the platform. Meanwhile, Binance is ramping up its blockchain investments. This year alone, its investment arm Binance Labs, undertook various major projects. One of these is its collaboration with Kernel to develop restaking infrastructure on its BNB Chain. This infrastructure will support the integration of tokens like BTC and BNB. Again, Binance pivoted into decentralized scientific research by investing in the BIO Protocol to expand funding in the area. It also funded Lombard, which specializes in Bitcoin liquid staking. These developments highlight its commitment to supporting new projects across the blockchain ecosystem.

Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings are now following the playbook, issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Clearly, these guys are no longer satisfied with just validating transactions and earning rewards. Instead, they’re mimicking MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor’s tactic of turning corporate resources into a Bitcoin stockpile machine. Wall Street’s obsession with the skyrocketing MSTR—up over 600% this year—is impossible to ignore. Hedge funds are loving the opportunity, deploying arbitrage strategies that take advantage of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility. Miners can’t keep up with MicroStrategy’s pace Despite the hype, Riot and MARA aren’t seeing the same success as MicroStrategy. Since the software company started its Bitcoin-buying spree in 2020, Riot and MARA shares have underperformed. Both remain far below their 2021 highs. The April Bitcoin halving event didn’t help. It slashed the rewards miners earn for adding new blocks to the blockchain, putting a major dent in profits. Throw in increased competition, and miners are now fighting an uphill battle to stay relevant. Riot’s convertible notes have raised eyebrows though. The notes came with a 32.5% conversion premium, lower than MicroStrategy’s November issuance, which had a 55% premium. Riot is also facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value, which recently took a stake in the company. Starboard is pushing the miner to shift some of its operations toward hyperscalers—large-scale data center users—rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, analysts are questioning the long-term viability of using convertible debt to stockpile Bitcoin. Stephen Glagola from JonesTrading has expressed doubts about this strategy, saying, “We would prefer the company to increase BTC held per share organically with its mining operations.” Meanwhile, investment giant BlackRock is cautiously endorsing Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The firm suggests investors allocate up to 2% to Bitcoin but only if they’re prepared to stomach its wild volatility. MicroStrategy on its way to Nasdaq 100, critics weigh in MicroStrategy is now eyeing a spot in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a move that could trigger massive passive inflows into its stock. Exchange-traded funds worth $451 billion track the index, and inclusion would mean huge stock purchases. But not everyone is sold on the idea. Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin makes it more of a financial entity than a technology company. Michael Lebowitz from RIA Advisors went as far as calling it “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin holdings. Despite the criticisms, MicroStrategy has amassed a $98 billion market cap, largely due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now holds over $40 billion in Bitcoin, but its core software business isn’t doing so hot. It reported a $340 million net loss in Q3 this year. Still, its Bitcoin-focused strategy has kept its stock soaring, even as skeptics question its sustainability. MicroStrategy has branded itself as a “Bitcoin Treasury Company.” This identity could work in its favor for Nasdaq inclusion, as the index excludes financial companies. Its classification as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark might be its saving grace. But Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has warned that a reclassification could be on the horizon, jeopardizing its eligibility.

With this decision, crypto exchanges can now list Pump.fun memecoins on their portfolio with full compliance coverage, and even governments can check for scams or rug pulls. Chainalysis will offer full compliance coverage for Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins Chainalysis has extended its coverage to Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins. Chainalysis Product Director Matthew Wilson even commented on the support extension, saying: Today, Chainalysis extended our Solana coverage to include every Solana token in KYT and Reactor. From the moment an SPL contract is deployed, Chainalysis offers complete alerting, exposure and tracing. ~ Director Matthew Wilson He added that exchanges can add Solana’s memecoins to their portfolio, arguing that compliance support is guaranteed. He even said governments could monitor the tokens for fraud. Schwartz Associates director Christopher Roberts has congratulated Chainalysis on the update, saying it’s “one of the many reasons” they are happy to work with the data analytic platform. A compliance consultant on LinkedIn named Stephen Sergent, on Chainalysis’s move, jokingly remarked how he can now lose his shirt on these meme coins compliantly. Pump.fun lost the British market following the FCA’s operational ban in the UK While Chainalysis’s move to support Solana memecoins promises that governments can easily track scams and fraud involving these tokens, some governments have already lost trust in the Solana meme coin launchpad. For starters, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has restricted the use of Pump.fun in the country. The FCA first cautioned users against the platform on December 3, warning them of potential scams. The agency said the platform targeted UK crypto consumers despite being unauthorized to operate. Currently, UK-based users can no longer access Pump.fun. Any user who tries to use the Pump.fun website from the UK is notified of the instituted restricted access . However, the FCA did provide a link for users to withdraw their coins in their private wallets. The regulatory authority still maintains that customers using unauthorized firms like Pump.fun risk losing their funds.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 00:28:24

Among the skeptics is Atomic Wallet, a decentralized non-custodial wallet, which has drawn attention for its recent remarks criticizing XRP and its investors. Concerns Over Sustainability of Gains The asset recently achieved a milestone by hitting a seven-year high of $2.87, following an impressive 485% surge over four weeks. However, this upward trajectory faced a setback during a market-wide correction, with the token’s value dropping to $2.34—over 32% below its peak. While XRP supporters celebrated the significant gains, critics, including Atomic Wallet, raised doubts about the sustainability of the asset’s rally. They pointed to the token’s historical pattern of sharp corrections following rapid price increases. Atomic Wallet’s Bold Prediction In a controversial tweet, Atomic Wallet questioned whether XRP holders are prepared for the asset’s value potentially declining to $0.50. The wallet further asserted that the asset would not reach $3 again and committed to deleting its X account if the token surpassed that level in the future. This criticism comes after it previously made sarcastically bullish remarks about the token. For instance, on December 2, the wallet jokingly stated it would not sell its XRP holdings until the price reached $300. Community Responds Atomic Wallet’s statements have sparked a backlash from XRP supporters. Community members have accused the wallet provider of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent voices within the community, such as Panos Mekras , have called for a complete boycott of Atomic Wallet and urged users to switch to alternative platforms. Critics have also highlighted Atomic Wallet’s security record, referencing a multi-million-dollar hack in 2023 as evidence that the company should focus on securing its services rather than commenting on market trends. The backlash has also drawn attention to Atomic Wallet’s seemingly contradictory stance on XRP. Previously, the wallet encouraged its users to buy the asset and had shared positive commentary about it. Despite the controversy, the asset remains a topic of interest in the cryptocurrency space. While skeptics warn of extended downturns, supporters believe in its long-term potential, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments and blockchain technology.

That makes for a good title, but actually, that only amounts to tokens worth around $500 being burnt. That’s pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of things, with Shiba Inu’s market cap around $16.58 billion as of Thursday. Still, in a world dominated by highly inflationary fiat currencies, where the M2 US dollar money supply is up by around 50% since 2020 per TradingEconomics data , it’s a reminder of the benefits of non-inflationary cryptocurrencies. Of course, protection against inflation isn’t really a narrative for meme coins like Shiba Inu, that’s more the realm of Bitcoin (BTC) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a much more speculative bet, a meme coin that relies upon hype cycles, and its ever-growing and highly dedicated community of followers, investors and aficionados. While the latest deflation figures from shibburn.com are unlikely to move the needle for Shiba Inu, there are plenty of other reasons for investors to be excited right now. Shiba Inu – Could a Parabolic Rally Be Next? $SHIB was last trading just above $0.000028, within recent ranges and close to its 21DMA. The stunning rally in early November thanks to President Trump’s US Presidential election victory has mostly petered out at this point. But Shiba Inu’s strong bounce from its 50DMA earlier this week suggests the bulls remain in control of this market and price predictions remain bullish. And that should come as no surprise, given all the positive developments going on in the USA right now. The incoming US administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, and the new Congress, also very pro-crypto, is expected to deliver regulatory certainty to the industry next year. Trump was literally jawboning about how he will “do something great with crypto” during his upcoming term.

But that won’t mean a gradual grind higher. Meme coins like Shiba Inu tend to experience rapid parabolic moves higher.

So, if parabolic rallies are right around the corner for Shiba Inu, how high could the meme coin go. Well, once the meme coin breaks above its prior record levels of just under $0.000090 and enters price discovery, it’s really anyone’s guess. But a rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see $SHIB attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. Either way, the near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Solana ( SOL )-based GIGA, a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, is up more than 39% from its $0.04911 low on Tuesday, the day it was listed on Coinbase. GIGA is trading for $0.06844 at time of writing. With a market cap of $657.9 million, Gigachad is the 183rd largest crypto project. Coinbase also added support for Magic Eden ( ME ) on the Solana network, a utility token for the Magic Eden non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. Users can list their Solana-based NFTs for sale in ME and earn tokens from the sales as well, says the project. ME is trading for $5.15 at time of writing, down 12% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $673.5 million, ME is the 178th largest market cap. Lastly, Coinbase added support for Ethereum ( ETH )-based Turbo ( TURBO ), a GPT-4 created memecoin inspired by a toad character. The project celebrated the support on the social media platform X. “TURBO is now live on Coinbase! The toad has emerged – a monstrous, relentless symbol of power and community-driven potential.

The real estate industry has been plagued with several problems since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which plummeted homes and commercial space. However, with AI technology, the real estate market can tackle inefficiencies and fraud risks and simplify complex transaction processes for users. Expert analysts believe this AI innovation could redefine how investors engage with Real Estate markets globally. Therefore, this article will explore how these AI technologies impact RWA investment in blockchain and what investors will gain when participating in its presale. How is PropiChain AI Technology Creating A Pathway in Real Estate Investment? The importance of AI in the 21st century cannot be understated, as it helps manage and automate processes that reduce the risk of human error, speed up complex processes, and minimize the need for manual intervention. PropiChain uses these AI integrations to address major loopholes and inefficiencies in traditional Real Estate investment by democratizing access to global markets and reducing lengthy settlement times. Below is a detailed narrative of PropiChain AI implementations and how they assist users in making better investment decisions. Automated Valuation Model (AVM): This AI tool assists users by bringing unparalleled accuracy to property valuations as they navigate the platform. Its sophisticated algorithm also helps analyze vast amounts of data, including historical sales reports, market conditions, and economic indicators, to reflect the actual value of a real estate asset.This AI tool offers insights beyond analyzing reports. It also detects patterns and trends that might elude human analysts, identifying major and minor shifts in neighborhood dynamics. AI-powered Chatbots: For users having challenges navigating the PropiChain platform, these AI-powered chatbots provide support and guidance, simplifying experiences and making them more intuitive and user-friendly for novice and experienced investors. Its virtual assistance tools also help break down complex processes, such as understanding legal contracts and financial terms, providing easy-to-understand explanations without any financial or legal background. Property Filtering & Suggestions: This AI-powered filtering system filters real estate assets based on market growth/trends, historical performance, and investment potential. This advanced AI also extends to filtering options for small-scale investors working on a budget who would also love to participate in managing multiple investment properties. In addition, these property suggestions allow AI to assess risks in real-time, safeguarding investors against potential losses and ensuring optimal asset allocation. Statistical Market Analysis: The PropiChain market analysis tool uses AI to analyze market data to identify high-yield real estate opportunities, enabling smarter investments. It also provides real-time evaluation of market trends and offers statistical insight into a real estate asset’s future price predictions, ensuring investors position themselves and avoid potential market risks. Other Key Features: Metaverse Integrations and RWA Tokenization Other features of PropiChain are its Metaverse integrations, which allow international investors to experience an immersive 3D virtual environment through tours, stagings, and meetings. Likewise, PropiChain bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds by tokenizing Real Estate and introducing the fractional ownership of assets. Through asset fractionalization, investors can own portions of high-value properties, democratizing access to Real Estate wealth rather than limiting it to top-scale investors. Expert analysts and top crypto whales believe this innovative approach opens new opportunities for investors and developers as these features cement its reputation as a secure and promising investment opportunity. Conclusion PropiChain stands out as a leader in the real estate industry because of its ability to combine the power of AI, RWA tokenization, and the Metaverse, which creates a groundbreaking platform for real estate investment. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and security review on BlockAudit are testaments to its transparency and credibility as it projects significant growth potential. In addition, its presale price of $0.004 is the lowest it will ever be, as its current round two presale stage still offers investors the opportunity to experience significant growth from $500 to over $100,000 when it launches into the mainstream market. Avoid FOMO and invest today to be a part of this revolutionary project shaping the future of Real Estate investment.

As of now, Bitcoin is reportedly within a bull market phase, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope. This phase, termed the “Orange Zone,” indicates that upward momentum is prevailing, although the market has not yet reached its peak. datascope’ analysis sheds light on the evolving Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, a tool designed to help investors identify key market trends and make informed decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market at a Crossroads: Are Long-Term Holders Signalling a Correction or a Rally? Bitcoin Market Cycle: Current Status And Investor Outlook The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator relies on two moving averages: a short-term 30-day average and a long-term 365-day average. A crossover of the short-term average above the long-term average is seen as a critical signal, potentially marking the transition to the market’s peak period. However, the absence of such a crossover, as revealed by datascope currently suggests that while the market is on an upward trajectory, there is still room for significant growth before reaching a potential top. The analyst elaborated that in the current bull market, Bitcoin’s price movements reflect strong momentum, signalling opportunities for investors. However, with this phase also comes the necessity for strategic vigilance. datascope analysis also highlights the importance of preparing for corrections as prices approach the “red zone” (in the chart attached above), a stage associated with heightened risks. The analyst noted: As long as the 30-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average remains above the 365-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average, the long-term outlook will stay positive. However, as prices approach the red zone, the risk of corrections may increase. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to remain cautious during this period and consider taking profits when necessary. Key Takeaways For Investors datascope suggested that investors aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market should focus on strategic entry and exit points. The analyst added: Although the current bull market shows strong momentum, it is vital to take market fluctuations into account and monitor price movements strategically. Following critical signals such as the crossover of moving averages can help investors identify opportunities more effectively during this period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently seen a noticeable rebound in its price after reclaiming the $100,000 price mark yesterday. At the time of writing, the asset trades at a price of $101,639 increasing by 1.9% in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000?

Solana’s recent 6% price surge has spotlighted its innovative developments, while Ethereum continues to gain traction thanks to improved regulatory sentiment and high-profile investments. Amidst all this action, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a groundbreaking presale that promises to revolutionise how blockchain addresses real-world challenges. While Solana and Ethereum have paved the way for decentralised technology, Qubetics steps in to fill the gaps they’ve left behind. Let’s dive into why these three projects are the best cryptos to invest in right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Real-World Solutions Qubetics is already making gains, thanks to its cutting-edge, solution-oriented products for addressing real-life business issues. By introducing the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , Qubetics addresses privacy concerns and scalability in a way that its predecessors couldn’t. In its 12th presale stage, this project has already sold over 313 million tokens to more than 8,700 holders, raising an impressive $5.7 million. The presale is hot, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0311, set to increase by 10% this weekend. But beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics so special? Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can browse securely without fearing data breaches or censorship. That’s the promise of Qubetics dVPN. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on central servers prone to hacking or outages, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a distributed network. This means no single point of failure and unprecedented levels of security. For more information, watch this AMA Session that’s creating a buzz in the crypto world. Picture this: a journalist in a country with heavy censorship uses Qubetics’ dVPN to access and share critical information safely. Or consider a startup protecting sensitive customer data from cyberattacks while saving on infrastructure costs. Even everyday users can enjoy unrestricted streaming or protect their browsing habits from prying eyes. It’s privacy and freedom wrapped into one seamless experience. The FOMO around Qubetics is real, and for a good reason. With its practical applications and an active community backing its growth, $TICS could redefine how we think about blockchain utility. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now, jumping into Qubetics before the presale price hike seems like a no-brainer. Solana (SOL): Scaling New Heights with Innovation Solana has been a force to reckon with in the crypto world, and its latest 6% price jump to over $230 proves it’s not slowing down. Over the past year, SOL has skyrocketed by 220%, cementing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, now at a jaw-dropping $109 billion. But what’s fuelling this meteoric rise? A major catalyst is Solana’s integration of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technological leap that enhances privacy and scalability. Projects like ArciumHQ and Bonsol are pioneering encrypted on-chain computations, making Solana more appealing to developers and end-users alike. This isn’t just geeky blockchain jargon—it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build or use decentralised applications. Economic metrics also tell a compelling story. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) soared from $5.6 billion in November to an all-time high of $9.5 billion in early December. That’s a 70% increase in just over a month! It’s not just TVL, though; real monthly economic activity jumped from $158 million to $409 million, proving that Solana is more than hype. Solana’s ecosystem is also thriving. Binance Labs recently invested in Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure project, boosting capital efficiency within the network. Meanwhile, Solana’s first AI Hackathon, offering $185,000 in prizes, showcases its commitment to innovation. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Issues like sandwich attacks and concerns over validator mechanisms have sparked debates about network integrity. Still, Solana’s proactive community and proposed solutions, like reintroducing a public mempool, reflect a blockchain unafraid to confront challenges head-on. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in right now, Solana’s mix of innovation and resilience makes it a top contender. Ethereum (ETH): The Crypto Giant that keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top of the crypto pyramid for nothing. Despite the initial hype around its ETF launch fading, Ethereum has emerged stronger with a more grounded market outlook. It’s this ability to adapt and grow that makes ETH one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. One big boost to Ethereum’s reputation is the improved regulatory environment. With new SEC and CFTC chair nominations supportive of decentralised finance (DeFi), Ethereum is gaining credibility in mainstream finance. High-profile moves, like former President Trump’s WLFI profits being channelled into ETH, further underscore its appeal. Ethereum’s real strength lies in its versatility. From NFTs to DeFi protocols, it remains the go-to platform for developers and users. The network’s layer-2 solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, are easing congestion and reducing fees, making Ethereum more accessible than ever. However, Ethereum’s ETHBTC trading pair has been a topic of discussion. Critics once argued that it was overhyped, but shifting perspectives now highlight its stability and potential. As the crypto market matures, Ethereum’s foundational role becomes even more evident, offering long-term value that’s hard to beat. Ethereum’s community and ecosystem are its secret weapons. Whether it’s developers creating groundbreaking dApps or institutional investors recognising its worth, ETH’s network effects are unparalleled. For anyone eyeing the best cryptos to invest in right now, Ethereum’s proven track record and future promise are impossible to ignore. Seize Your Moment Cryptocurrency isn’t just about numbers; it’s about vision, innovation, and solving real-world problems. Qubetics’ transformative dVPN technology, Solana’s relentless push for scalability, and Ethereum’s adaptability make these projects the best cryptos to invest in right now. The clock’s ticking, especially with Qubetics’ presale set to hike prices soon. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the next big thing in blockchain. Act now. Join the Qubetics presale or stack up on Solana and Ethereum while the market’s buzzing. The future’s bright—be a part of it.

Among the myriad options, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Polkadot stand out as innovative projects driving the future of decentralised technology. This article will explore why these cryptos are considered the Best Cryptos to Join Now , highlighting their unique features, ongoing developments, and future potential. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain Interoperability Most networks operate in isolation in the current blockchain ecosystem , creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralised applications (dApps) and hampers the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining this narrative by establishing itself as a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple networks into a cohesive framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality , Qubetics enhances interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. This advancement unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users alike. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers an attractive investment opportunity. With weekly phases driving a 10% price hike and a culminating 20% rise in the final stage, the $TICS token is a valuable addition to any portfolio. Priced at $0.031, the presale has already raised over $5.7 million, boasting over 8,700 holders and 313 million tokens sold. These figures make Qubetics a compelling choice for investors seeking the Best Cryptos to Join Now. The seamless integration of multiple blockchains under Qubetics’ umbrella is expected to catalyse the adoption of decentralised technologies across industries, making it a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche: A Layer-1 Powerhouse with Exponential Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX), one of the leading layer-1 blockchain networks, has captured the attention of analysts and investors with its robust ecosystem and promising growth trajectory. Known for its high throughput and low latency, Avalanche has become a preferred platform for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and gaming. According to crypto analysts, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, has substantial room for growth. Notably, Kong Trading, a prominent figure in the crypto space, predicts that AVAX could rally to $1,000 by 2025. If this prediction comes to fruition, it would represent a staggering 2,027% increase from its current levels. This optimism stems from similar historical rallies in tokens like Mantra, Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Ripple (XRP). The prediction is anchored in the assumption that Ethereum’s price could rise between $10,000 and $20,000, which would likely have a positive ripple effect on other layer-1 networks like Avalanche. With its innovative technology and growing adoption, Avalanche is undeniably among the Best Cryptos to Join Now for long-term investors aiming to capitalise on exponential growth. Polkadot: The Pioneer of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot (DOT) is another standout project that prioritises interoperability and scalability. Created by Dr Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot facilitates the seamless transfer of messages and value across blockchains through its unique parachain architecture. Polkadot also offers lucrative staking opportunities for traders. The token provides a reward rate of 11.43%, an inflation rate of 8.83%, and a real reward rate of 2.38%. Major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken support DOT staking, making it accessible for users worldwide. These platforms also handle the technical complexities, allowing users to enjoy staking rewards without the burdens of managing the process themselves. Conclusion In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market continues to present groundbreaking opportunities, with Qubetics , Avalanche, and Polkadot emerging as key players poised to shape the future of decentralised technology. Qubetics’ innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, Avalanche’s robust growth potential in the layer-1 space, and Polkadot’s pioneering advancements in scalability and cross-chain functionality all position these projects as top choices for investors and blockchain enthusiasts. Whether through Qubetics’ presale momentum, Avalanche’s exponential price predictions, or Polkadot’s lucrative staking opportunities, these cryptocurrencies offer compelling avenues to participate in the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem. As the market evolves, these projects exemplify the transformative potential of decentralised technologies, making them some of the best cryptos to join now.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 01:50:00
37566769,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/Is-the-altcoin-season-still-coming-back-in-2024,1734054896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37566769.jpeg,Is The Altcoin Season still coming back in 2024,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/Is-the-altcoin-season-still-coming-back-in-2024,"Mixed Signals in the Crypto Landscape The crypto market braces for an eventful weekend, teetering between optimism and uncertainty after a whirlwind week of mixed signals. CPI data hit the 2.7% mark as expected—neutral, stable, unexciting—but Thursday’s PPI at 0.4% raised eyebrows, doubling the forecast. Persistent producer price pressures are like termites—they won’t collapse the house overnight, but their presence gnaws away at the foundations of stability. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank decided to add a splash of liquidity with a 0.25% rate cut, a move that’s more band-aid than cure-all for the eurozone’s sluggish growth. These developments played their part in lifting the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which closed strong at 107 on Thursday. A resilient dollar might keep crypto inflows on a tight leash, cooling the risk-on narrative. Sure, a weak dollar boosts crypto optimism, but this isn’t that story—not yet. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the extreme greed lingered far too long, stretching nearly a month before being smacked down abruptly in Monday and Tuesday’s brutal crashes. But here’s the twist: extreme greed didn’t take long to resurface, climbing back to 80 yesterday. Today’s reading (Friday, December 13) shows this: If this all sounds familiar, it should. Two weeks ago, I explored in my article, ‘ Altcoin Season on the Horizon ?’, whether Ethereum could complete its “tasks” to confirm an altseason. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Instead, the rally fizzled, and altcoins never got their full confirmation. Let’s go back to some of these charts to check on our main hero—or villain—in this latest altcoin debacle. Ethereum (ETH): Weekly Insight Weekly Chart Highlights: Ethereum ($ETH ) remains in a critical consolidation pattern starting before Christmas last year within the rectangle top at $4,092, while strong supporting confluences align around $3,021 at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week MA. The recent weekly candle hints at potential exhaustion, marked by a possible hanging man pattern. Better not, still time. It’s a strong reversal candle pattern. Nie fajnie. No bueno. Traders should watch the weekly close carefully to confirm or invalidate this signal. But for now, to keep an eye on: Resistance Levels: $4,092 (rectangle top, critical breakout zone) $6,050 (rectangle breakout target and Fib extension) Key Support: $3,021 (golden pocket 0.618 Fibonacci + 50-week MA + … the rectangle mid-point ) Observations: The recent rally from $3,500 highlights buyer confidence, but RSI divergence suggests weakening momentum. A deeper correction could retest fib levels between $3,226 (0.5 Fib) and $3,021 (0.618). This week’s correction of 14.5% from the yearly high of $4,092 to $3,511 was shallow by crypto standards. However, dropping below the golden pocket at $3,021 would indicate a much more significant shift in market sentiment. This majestic rectangle continues to dominate Ethereum's macro outlook and, by extension, casts its influence over the entire altcoin market. It’s a battleground not unlike what we see in Total2, where resilience and rejection at key levels define the broader altcoin narrative. Let’s explore what Total2 reveals about the state of the altcoin market. Total2: Altcoin Market Cap Recovery 3-Day Chart Insights: Total2 paints a clear picture of resilience. Following its $1.65T rejection near the 2021 ATH, the altcoin market cap dropped 17.5% but rapidly rebounded to $1.53T. Notably, the cup-and-handle breakout remains intact, with a long-term target extending above $2T. Key Observations: Dip-buying culture is alive and well, as evidenced by the rapid rebound from recent lows. The resilience tells the story of how traders continue to seize opportunities during pullbacks. Markets are as much about psychology as they are about price action. The velocity of this rebound underscores how swiftly sentiment can pivot, flipping bullish for altcoins the moment a dip looks enticing. ETH to BTC: 12-Hour Structure Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) reflects broader altcoin momentum. Currently, ETH/BTC sits at 0.0384, just below the prior rectangle's top. While the head-and-shoulders pattern on lower timeframes highlights bearish risks, the market structure shift (higher low) offers a bullish possibility. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: 0.0403 (invalidate H&S, potential breakout level) Support: 0.0370 (critical zone to maintain higher low structure) 0.0346 (final support before breakdown towards the lows at 0.032) ETH/BTC’s relative strength is often a leading indicator of altseason’s health. A breakout above 0.0403, particularly if accompanied by volume, is crucial to confirm the narrative shift towards altcoin dominance. However, meeting this target alone won’t be enough. A simultaneous close above $4,100 for Ethereum and Total2 surpassing the 2021 blow-off top levels will be the ultimate confirmation. With all three conditions fulfilled, BTC dominance (BTC.D) should also trend lower, finally signaling the true start of an altcoin season. Failure to align these conditions would leave the market vulnerable to Bitcoin’s ( $BTC ) continued grip. Conclusion: Is the Nightmare Over? Despite a turbulent start to the week, altcoin fundamentals remain intact. Ethereum’s resilience above $3,500 and the rapid recovery in Total2 highlight renewed buy-the-dip enthusiasm. However, the next leg depends heavily on macro catalysts, particularly CPI and the FOMC decision. For now, traders should focus on critical resistance levels like $4,092 for ETH (plus 0.04 road-block on eth/btc ) and $1.65T for Total2 , while monitoring volume and RSI for confirmation. A breakout above these levels could mark the return of a full-fledged altcoin season.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, altcoins may underperform due to factors such as reduced capital rotation from BTC to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Likely To Continue Its Momentum Into 2025 In a report titled Crypto Market Outlook 2025, asset manager Sygnum outlined multiple factors that are likely to further push BTC price upwards next year. The report highlights new capital inflows into the market – particularly institutional inflows – as the primary driver for the crypto bull market in 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000? Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation The analysis highlights a ‘multiplier effect’ caused by institutional inflows combined with Bitcoin’s limited liquid supply. For instance, every $1 billion of net inflows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly triggers a 3-6% price increase. Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. 2025: A Watershed Year For BTC The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range. Related Reading: Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025 Further, BTC may benefit from central banks and local governments considering setting aside some part of their funds for BTC reserves. Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1734058828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ukraine To Legalize Crypto: Lawmakers Preparing Bill For Early 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/ukraine-to-legalize-crypto-lawmakers-preparing-bill-for-early-2025/,"As the market continues its massive rally, Ukrainian lawmakers are preparing to legalize crypto soon officially. Local reports revealed that the parliament is working on a draft law but is not considering tax exemptions for digital assets. Ukraine Prepares To Legalize Crypto During a “Domestic Investment Opportunities” forum, Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, revealed that Ukraine aims to legalize digital assets in the coming months. Hetmantsev stated that the parliament’s working group is working alongside the National Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a draft law to pass the legislation in early 2025, news media outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported : If we’re talking about cryptocurrency, the [parliament’s] working group is finalizing a draft law for its first reading. I believe the text, developed in collaboration with the National Bank and the IMF, will be ready after the New Year. We aim to pass this law and legalize cryptocurrency in the [2025’s] first quarter. The head of the Committee also noted that tax exemptions won’t be applied to digital assets. Instead, they plan to follow the model used for securities, meaning that profits will be taxed when the assets are converted into currency. Hetmantsev also explained that they will take a “very cautious approach to using cryptocurrencies for tax exemptions” after consulting with the IMF and European experts, “as it could potentially facilitate tax evasion in traditional markets.” Ukraine’s Regulatory Landscape President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the “On Virtual Assets” law in March 2022, setting in motion a legal framework for regulating the digital asset market in Ukraine. However, the law had not been implemented by early 2024, as it awaited the amendments to the country’s Tax Code. This resulted in the loss of millions in potential tax revenue, as the absence of crypto-related regulations meant that exchanges had no legal obligations to pay the Ukrainian authorities taxes for the revenue obtained from digital assets. In April, the IMF asked Ukraine to complete an update on its crypto legislation by the end of 2024. According to a Facebook post from Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov, the IMF noted that the lack of regulation of the new industry posed a threat to “price stability and efficiency of monetary transmission.” Bornyakov noted that the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s team had stressed the need to introduce state regulation in the crypto asset market, pointing to the two draft laws already registered for consideration in the parliament. Additionally, he highlighted that crypto legislation could have a positive financial impact on the country and boost Ukraine’s economic growth, emphasizing that prompt action would also strengthen international confidence in the country: In times of war, we must use the full range of opportunities and develop new sectors of the economy. Legalization of the crypto sector can have a powerful economic effect, generating a turnover of billions of hryvnias.

For example, analyst XO predicts a price target of $300 for Solana (SOL). Furthermore, based on the bullish technical indicators, Cardano (ADA) has started showing promising growth signs. Despite all this, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself as one of the best new ICOs. This presale, now in phase six, has already seen a 500% price surge. Given its potential to dominate the online trading space and tap into the growing $1.4T FX market, experts remain bullish on it. Some even foresee a 5x growth potential for this altcoin in 2025. XO: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Reach $300 Soon Solana (SOL) is seeing some green price charts right now. CoinMarketCap shows that this altcoin saw a price surge of over 5% in the past 30 days, jumping from around $200 to over $250. Crypto analyst XO excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin will see a big jump if it holds the low $200s as support. XO forecasts a potential surge to $300 for Solana (SOL) soon. The technicals show some good signs for the Solana crypto. For example, TradingView shows that its value is above its 50-day EMA ($213). Furthermore, its momentum indicator is at -20, which is in the buy zone and suggests this uptrend may continue. Cardano (ADA) Technicals Remain Bullish As Price Rises Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that is riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the price of Cardano increased from around $0.50 to over $1. In other words, its value skyrocketed over 70% as per CoinMarketCap. The technical analysis for Cardano (ADA) is also bullish. According to TradingView, this crypto currency is trading above its 30-day EMA ($0.95) and its momentum indicator sits at -0.06 which is in the buy zone. Therefore, the Cardano coin may continue this bullish trajectory. Market expert Valeriya remains optimistic about Cardano as well. In her new X post, she stated that a $1.20 or even $1.25 bounce is still possible. This Cardano price prediction captures traders’ attention. DTX Exchange (DTX) Excites Traders With a 500% Surge So Far DTX Exchange (DTX) is a hot altcoin right now. Whoever bought it at the beginning of its crypto ICO event has already received 500% returns. With the addition of a listing on CoinMarketCap, countless traders are now rushing to buy DTX. This token will power the DTX Exchange platform. On this hybrid trading platform, people will get: ● Access to over 120K asset classes like gold, FX, and crypto coins. ● Transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. ● Privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. On the other hand, those who hold the DTX token will get governance voting rights as well as a portion of the trading fee revenue made by the DTX Exchange. This has led to millions of DTX tokens being sold. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, this presale price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Additionally, its expected launch price sits at $0.20, which is a 66% jump from its current price. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Cardano (ADA)? While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are on a rally right now, some analysts are also bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX). This newcomer will have ties to many trillion-dollar markets and a smaller market cap. Therefore, DTX could need less money for its price to rise over time. Because of this, experts foresee a potential 5x growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 03:15:00

The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly preparing multiple charges, but the letter remains vague about the specifics, such as the exact nature of the charges and how many of Musk’s companies are involved. The SEC is investigating his brain-computer interface company Neuralink and the latest letter stated that the SEC had “reopened” its probe into Neuralink this week. It also revealed that Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, was subpoenaed by the SEC, with threats of a process server if he didn’t comply. Amid the chaos, Musk took to his X handle and wrote, “The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.” JUST IN: SEC Chair Gary Gensler has issued a settlement demand to Elon Musk, threatening charges unless Musk paid within 48 hours. Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro accuses the SEC of harassment and politically motivated actions. pic.twitter.com/vjOQGP0UAV — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 13, 2024 For the unversed, the SEC has been investigating Elon Musk for delaying the disclosure of his 9.2% stake in Twitter. He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law. According to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, anyone who acquires at least 5% of a public company must disclose it within ten days. In May 2024, Musk agreed to testify in the SEC’s investigation but failed to comply with their deposition request, leading the SEC to seek sanctions in a San Francisco court. Experts React To Gensler’s Latest Action Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted to the news, saying this is how the SEC treats the richest man in the world. He pointed out that small businesses and entrepreneurs, without the resources Elon Musk has, are likely treated even worse. Deaton brought to attention how the SEC’s actions in the LBRY case show their aggressive tactics, threatening to bankrupt Jeremy Kauffman and LBRY before even filing a lawsuit. He also said that Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse spent over $150 million defending themselves in a case that didn’t involve fraud, but a failure to register and explained how most companies don’t have the resources to fight back like that.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 03:17:45

With the $XPAW token rapidly gaining traction, XRPAW MEME is termed as the next big memecoin phenomenon on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and poised to join the ranks of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk as a community-driven memecoin. The recent approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin by the New York Department of Financial Services marks a pivotal development for the XRPL ecosystem. RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, is designed to maintain a constant value of one U.S. dollar and is fully backed by a segregated reserve of cash and cash equivalents. Its issuance on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains enhances liquidity and provides a stable medium of exchange within the XRP network. For XRPAW MEME, the introduction of RLUSD presents new opportunities for integration and utility within the XRPL ecosystem. The stablecoin’s presence is expected to facilitate smoother transactions and broaden the scope of financial interactions for $XPAW holders.

Real-World Utility: Plans for NFTs, DeFi staking opportunities, and exclusive token-holder benefits are already in progress. “The XRP Ledger provides the technological backbone that allows us to scale without compromise,” added Mr. Paw.

Investors are flocking to secure their share of $XPAW tokens, driven by a mix of FOMO (fear of missing out) and genuine belief in the project’s potential to bring real world impact and charitable causes to the memecoin space.

Klein, who is currently serving as the chairman of the nuclear reform monitoring committee for Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), said nuclear energy is essential for long-term sustainability. However, he noted that these power sources would need time to scale up their infrastructure. Meeting immediate energy demands As data centers, the backbone of artificial intelligence operations, are built in countries like Japan and the US, natural gases have become necessities to meet surging power demands. Data centers are heavily reliant on energy, and the global boom of AI is pushing power grids to their limits. Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel in the US, and it is expected to account for up to 60% of new-generation projects in the coming years. While natural gas is cleaner than coal, this reliance on natural gases comes with its own set of environmental concerns, particularly related to methane emissions and long-term carbon commitments. In other places, fossil fuels are an immediate solution to the rising electricity demand brought on by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology. However, Klein sees these fossil fuel power sources as short-term solutions, especially because existing renewable energy and nuclear capabilities cannot be scaled up quickly enough to meet the demand. The timeline for nuclear energy According to Klein, gas will be used to assuage the boom in energy demand from AI until small modular reactors and larger plants can be built to enable nuclear energy to take its place. Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have invested in nuclear solutions to power their AI operations. Meta recently announced plans to partner with developers for nuclear energy projects capable of delivering up to 4 gigawatts of power by the early 2030s. Similarly, Microsoft has secured nuclear power commitments, including a deal to purchase energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Meanwhile, Google is investing in small modular reactors (SMRs) However, their methods cannot be applied universally or immediately. “ We just cannot meet this big demand for these data centers without nuclear plants if we’re going to maintain a reduction in greenhouse gases,” Klein told Bloomberg . Nuclear energy remains a sensitive topic in Japan due to the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The country has also been witnessing a downtrend in energy demands due to depopulation. However, people familiar with the problem have suggested that the situation can be turned around by building more data centers and semiconductor plants.

President-elect Donald Trump’s team is exploring eliminating agencies like the FDIC, sparking a debate that could reshape America’s financial landscape. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC could be a step toward innovation, or are we gambling with stability? What the FDIC Does—and Why It Matters The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC is the authority that keeps banks in check. It makes sure that your money remains safe even if the bank fails. This system was created after the Great Depression to build a secure banking system. People need to know their savings won’t just vanish. Trump’s idea to cut back on such oversight is bold, to say the least. During his first term, he pushed to reduce bureaucracy, saying regulations hold back the economy. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC shows how committed he is to evolve the blockchain technology in America. His team argues that less regulation could boost innovation, especially in areas like cryptocurrency. DFIC secures banks but their recent actions show they don’t like cryptocurrencies. Crypto Dreams or Banking Nightmare? Here’s the twist: Trump wants America to lead the cryptocurrency revolution. Bitcoin, blockchain—all of it. He believes that cutting federal oversight could open the door for crypto startups and investors. He wants the U.S to become the hub for decentralized finance and outpace competitors like China. However, not everyone is in favor of closing down the regulatory authority. According to critics, shutting down the regulations could leave the banks in a vulnerable state and people will lose faith as their money will not be secured anymore. Supporters say crypto’s decentralized nature could offer a safety net—but is that really enough? What’s at Stake Traditional banks might struggle without the FDIC. People could lose confidence, and that’s dangerous. For consumers, weaker protections might leave them exposed to fraud or loss. The crypto advocates see this as an opportunity as this will give a chance to Bitcoin adoption and blockchain innovation. This could encourage global investors to shift their focus towards the U.S., which aligns perfectly with Trump’s vision to make America great. Of course, there’s a catch. Congress needs to approve any major changes, and bipartisan resistance is likely. Financial experts point to the 2008 crisis as a cautionary tale. Back then, deregulation played a big role. Could history repeat itself? What to Expect Trump’s deregulation plan is ambitious, no doubt. It’s about cutting red tape and betting on crypto as the future of finance. But the risks are real. Will the U.S. become the world’s crypto capital, or are we opening the door to financial chaos? The coming months will reveal whether this vision leads to innovation or instability. Only time will tell if Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC works or will it backfire.",News|Crypto news|US Elections 2024,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 03:42:49

This bull run is a once-in-a-lifetime memecoin supercycle, and it’s your chance to turbo-crank the risk and chase unprecedented gains. But instead of sifting through hundreds of meme pretenders, what if you could rely on a coin to do all the hard work for you—like a stock index, only with performance that isn’t going to have you less animated than Terri Schiavo? That’s what you get with Vantard and its proprietary Memecoin Portfolio: a basket of the hottest property in the entire sector bought before they pump. In the battle to find the next meme moonshot, Vantard’s team of quants is a day early and a dollar in credit. The Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP) already loaded up on ZEREBRO , MOODENG , and AI16Z nice and early, locking in some serious gains for early VTARD investors. But with The Don on his victory lap and global liquidity flooding the crypto market like Noah’s on a comeback tour, what meme monstrosity in the skyrocketing $140 billion market will the VMP unearth next? Vantard: Only an actual ‘tard wouldn’t want in Since launching its presale around a month ago, Vantard has already raised $931k, and for good reason: it’s been making TradFi look more lifeless than Simon Cowell’s botoxed bonce. Vantard has defecated all over the NASDAQ, dominating its year-to-date returns like a young, skilled cowboy atop a weary, senile bull. The VMP is getting called the S&P 500 of memecoins for a reason. Vantard offers degens the creature comforts of TradFi with its diversification and the reassurance of an actively managed and frequently rebalanced basket. Still, this team of quants isn’t interested in delivering a paltry 7%—they’ve got their eyes on a parabolic prize, and so far, they’ve given no reason to doubt them. Meme coin madness, but all on autopilot? Now that’s how a Giga Chad rides the supercycle. Further delving into its meme origins, Vantard’s quants recently launched a “ Boomberg Nooz ” segment, which offers some insight into their radical and somewhat unhinged methodology. So, rather than chowing down on the wily nonsense some Bloomberg anchor hack wants you to choke back, why not let Vantard red pill the living daylights out of you? No botox, no corporate bullsh*t. No wonder the smart money’s all over VTARD like a resurrected Hugh Hefner in Margot Robbie’s hot tub. Get gains: Not therapy The VMP could be your secret weapon to obliterate this bull run and finally take the edge off your son’s opulent OnlyFans addiction. We’re talking blue-chip memes, burgeoning runners, and even nano-cap nebulas, each exploding at different times thanks to various catalysts. And each ensures the VMP is consistently delivering the goods—not like your ex-wife with that furry glove. This is memecoin mayhem with none of the legwork—no 3 AM candlestick struggle sessions while your wife loads up Bumble alongside your cold and vacant side of the bed. And no getting screwed by the slippage as you thrash at your mobile, desperately trying to panic sell the latest abominable sh*tcoin to save your daughter’s college fund. The Vantard quants are the ones sobbing in family counseling—they can take the trauma that comes with making this supercycle their b*tch, and their children’s daddy issues are only surpassed by their relentless analytical mastery and their Lannister-esque strategizing. Let them suffer in silence while you 100X and plan an exit— take the kids to Disneyworld, not a Diazepam dispensary. Ready to ride, cowboy? Right now, you can get in on VTARD early at a discounted price of $0.00011 before the six-fingered degenerates get their grubby mitts all over it. But don’t hang around—like an alcoholic at their godchild’s funeral, VTARD’s presale supply is going down faster than the sacramental wine. And soon, these tokens will disappear faster than Diddy on day release. This is your one-stop shop for the memecoin supercycle—your golden ticket to the VIP suite of meme portfolio management. So take a step back, throw your hat into the ring, and let the quants turn decades of loving marriage into a divorce-driven 1000x. Want to ride the Memecoin Supercycle in style?

Some are strategically choosing to divert their funds into a new protocol with the potential for large returns: Lunex Network ($LNEX). This protocol combines low fees with high levels of interoperability, and ties it together with a central focus on privacy to create the ultimate environment for professional trading. So what will the next quarter have in store for these projects? Polkadot Sees Sharp Dip Despite Polkadot 2.0 Announcement Polkadot (DOT) dropped 17% during the last week, which surprised holders, as before that, Polkadot tripled in price over the last year. Strangely enough, that dip in Polkadot’s value came just as Polkadot (DOT) released Polkadot 2.0, which should make the network scalable and also offer developers more access. It will technically involve a few tweaks from Polkadot (DOT) to reduce block times for traders. Cardano Sees Dip Despite Wallet Enhancements Cardano (ADA) has seen an 11% dip in the last week as key whales have sold off large quantities of Cardano (ADA). Cardano’s price outlook is now dwindling despite Cardano achieving a 96% increase over the last 12 months. On the technological front, Cardano has been focused on improving DB Sync and the Cardano wallet. There have also been several refinements made to the Cardano (ADA) ledger in a bit to improve network security. Lunex Network ($LNEX) Provides Powerful Tools for Traders Lunex Network offers a suite of tools for traders and companies and it is fast becoming a leader in the DeFi space. A standout is its broad portfolio tracker that manages stocks and ETFs as well as cryptos. This tool gives traders an overview of their financial state so they can make sound investment decisions at all times. With its apt utilization of the latest blockchain technology, Lunex Network supports swaps of over 50,000 assets. The platform sets a standard for other competing blockchains with ultra low fees and lightning fast transaction speeds, creating a frictionless trading experience. Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) utility extends beyond trading. Its ecosystem is powered by the native $LNEX token, designed to remain stable even in times of market volatility. Token holders enjoy a generous 18% share of platform profits, providing a passive income stream. Additionally, with a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, $LNEX incorporates a deflationary mechanism that rewards long-term investors as adoption increases. Businesses also benefit from Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) features . The platform’s merchant payment gateway simplifies the process of accepting cryptocurrency payments. Transactions are automatically converted into fiat currency, making it easy for companies to integrate digital assets without technical complications. Lunex Network Attracts Strong Interest Investors are flocking in from all over the trading spectrum to secure their share of $LNEX tokens. Currently available at a ripe price of $0.0044, leading analysts have predicted a 1800% price increase before the time of the full launch owing to the protocol’s intelligent design. This is certainly not a project to miss out on.

It trades at $101,805, marking a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Amid this price performance, analysts have closely examined various metrics to gauge potential market movements, including identifying optimal cash-out moments. Meanwhile, recent data reveals intriguing patterns that could guide investor strategies. When Should You Cash Out Your Bitcoin? One key insight shared by a CryptoQuant analyst, Onchain Edge, highlights a critical signal for when investors should consider reducing their Bitcoin holdings. Other metrics suggest a resurgence in buyer activity , reinforcing optimism in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Onchain Edge emphasizes the importance of the BTC supply loss percentage as a marker for peak market phases . He notes that when this metric drops below 4%, it could signify the culmination of a bull market and the beginning of an overheated market phase. Currently, the current supply loss percentage stands at 8.14%, providing room for further price growth before a potential peak. The analyst warns, however, that failing to act at the right time during such peak phases could lead to substantial losses in a subsequent bear market. Elaborating on his analysis, Onchain Edge encourages investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their positions once the supply loss percentage breaches the 4% threshold. It is worth noting that this strategy by Edge could help mitigate the risk of holding through the transition into a bear market. Historically, peak bull run phases are characterized by significant profits among market participants, often followed by sharp corrections . Investors can protect their gains by exiting strategically while preparing for lower entry points during future market downturns. BTC Buyer Activity Resurges Meanwhile, in a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk sheds light on the behavior of takers on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Data from the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio shows a shift toward aggressive buying activity. This metric, which compares the volume of buy orders filled by takers to sell orders, had experienced a period of negative monthly values, indicating a preference for selling among market participants . However, the ratio has recently turned positive, signifying renewed interest from buyers.

Congrats to everyone at @PlayStation and @TeamAsobi ! #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/7CG8McZPbg — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 13, 2024 Out of seven nominations, Astro Bot has won four, including the most prestigious award of the evening, The Game of the Year award. Other titles nominated for the Game of the Year were Black Myth: Wukong, Balatro, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and a controversial entry, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Swen Vincke, director of Baldur’s Gate 3, presented this year’s award. He was the winner of last year’s Game of the Year title. He described it as changing his life. In a lighthearted comment, he said, “Should you be told to wrap it up, you can always come back and chat for three minutes.” Team Asobi’s head, Nicolas Doucet, thanked the team and PlayStation for their support with Astro and acknowledged PlayStation’s 30 years of legacy. He also recalled playing Super Mario Bros. and how Astro Bots’ foundations were based on the game. Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner Astro Bot was nominated in seven categories in The Game Awards 2024, making it the most prominent game. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was the second title, receiving an equal number of nominations. However, it took away only one award in the Best Score and Music category. Meanwhile, Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner. It won Best Narrative, Best RPG, and Best Art Direction. It was unusual for Balatro to be nominated for The Game Awards 2024 platform. So much so the developer found it “completely surreal.” Still, it took the spotlight in the Indie game category, winning the Best Indie and Best Debut Indie categories.

While some attribute this strategic move to the whale’s confidence in 1Fuel as the next big player in the trading industry, some believe it’s due to the platform’s growth potential that might extend to 100x its current price. In this article, we’ll explore why these sentiments hint that 1Fuel may be the best cryptocurrency to buy now. 1FUEL: The Next-Generation Crypto Wallet for Maximum Returns 1Fuel is quickly emerging as the best cryptocurrency now for those seeking substantial returns, and it’s for good reasons. Notably, the innovation behind 1FUEL transcends typical cryptocurrency wallets, as it is designed to simplify and secure the management of digital assets. Imagine being able to conduct transactions across different blockchain networks with just one click. With features like one-click cross-chain transactions, an integrated privacy mixer, cold storage solutions, and peer-to-peer exchanges, 1FUEL is changing how users store, trade, and manage their crypto assets. Additionally, 1FUEL offers staking rewards of up to 30% APR by allowing users to stake their tokens. This means that by simply holding onto their 1FUEL tokens, investors can earn passive income while supporting the security of the network. A total of 75 million tokens are reserved for these rewards, incentivizing users to become long-term holders. Adding to the appeal of 1FUEL is the independent verification of its smart contracts, which provides peace of mind for investors. This audit safeguards your investment, allowing you to enter the market with confidence. Shiba Inu’s Hot Streak: Can It Double Its Price Again? In the last month alone, SHIB’s price jumped 57% to the current $0.00003015. Still, the trend could continue, according to some analysts. On December 7, crypto analyst “Bluntz” suggested SHIB could soar as high as $0.00006 and $0.00009, respectively about 94% and 191% above its value of approximately $0.00003089. Bluntz also noted that for this to happen, SHIB has to complete the breakout, just like in March 2024, when the RSI moved from over 70 to over 90. Currently, the RSI of Shiba Inu is over 70, indicating that the coin might continue surging. Another analyst, “King’s Chart,” offered a more cautious view, predicting a 35% rise in SHIB’s price to around $0.00004518 based on an ascending triangle chart pattern. Dogecoin’s Price Dip: A Temporary Setback or a Sign of Deeper Issues? Dogecoin’s price has fallen over 6% in the past 24 hours, now sitting at $0.43. Recently, negative sentiment around Dogecoin has grown, leading to decreased transaction activity. However, there is some hope: Dogecoin has emerged from a bullish pattern that began in November, suggesting potential for recovery. Experts believe this price drop may test a crucial support level. If it holds, Dogecoin could begin to rise again. Nevertheless, data indicates that more investors are betting against DOGE, reflecting ongoing negative sentiment. If Dogecoin can rise above its current level, it might reach new highs, particularly if an “altcoin season” occurs. Conclusion While popular meme coins like SHIB and DOGE continue to fluctuate, 1FUEL’s innovative ecosystem as well as its enticing crypto presale offerings make it a compelling investment choice for those seeking long-term gains in the crypto market. Predictions suggest that early investors might see gains of up to a staggering 100x by just buying the OFT tokens at a current price of $0.012.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 05:02:11

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $1.180 and $1.200 levels. ADA price started a decent increase from the $0.910 support zone. The price is trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.180 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $1.00 level, Cardano started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $1.050 and $1.120 resistance levels. However, the bears were active below the $1.20 level. A high was formed at $1.1781 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $1.120 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.150 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.180. The next key resistance might be $1.20. If there is a close above the $1.2 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2280 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.180 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.10750 level. The next major support is near the $1.050 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. A downside break below the $1.050 level could open the doors for a test of $1.00. The next major support is near the $0.920 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level.

For instance, Amonyx has predicted that Ripple (XRP) could reach $20 soon. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) now sees bullish indicators suggesting it is primed for a big surge. Investors are also going wild about a new exchange token now in phase six of its presale – DTX Exchange (DTX) . Although still early in development, this rookie has already given early buyers a 500% return while raising over $10M. Since DTX Exchange looks poised to become a fan-favorite in the online trading space, many experts foresee the value of this altcoin potentially soaring by 7,000% in 2025. Amonyx: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Soar to $20 Soon Recently, Amonyx made headlines in the crypto space with his Ripple (XRP) price prediction. In a new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin could reach $20 soon. Although many people found this Ripple price prediction outlandish, XRP has been rising lately. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price jumped from around $0.70 to nearly $3 in the past 30 days. In other words, Ripple (XRP) saw a price surge of over 250% in just a few short weeks. The technicals for the Ripple crypto are also showing some positive signs. TradingView data points to this altcoin trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.33) and 20-day EMA ($2.08). Thanks to these factors, traders consider Ripple one of the altcoins to watch. Solana (SOL) Shows Bullish Indicators Amid Price Growth Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin showing some growth. On the one-month chart, the Solana price increased nearly 5%, per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value moved between almost $220 and over $230. TradingView data points to Solana crypto continuing this bullish momentum. At this time, this altcoin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($229) and its 30-day EMA ($225). Plus, the momentum indicator for Solana sits at 6.50, which is in the buy zone and suggests an upswing. Market analyst Inmortal also excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his recent X post, Solana (SOL) could skyrocket past $440 soon. Therefore, Solana solidifies its position as one of the top 10 altcoins. DTX Exchange (DTX) Looks Positioned for Massive Price Growth DTX Exchange (DTX) is a trailblazing trading platform that could dominate online trading. It will merge the benefits of CEX and DEX and take the trader experience to the next level. The platform will allow the user to trade in global markets from the convenience of one single interface. With DTX Exchange, traders will get access to: Over 120K Asset Classes: The ability to trade crypto coins, stocks, gold, etc. Privacy: No sign-up KYC checks will be required. Up to 1,000x Leverage: High leverage on assets means more reward potential while minimizing risk. Currently valued at $0.12 in phase six of its presale, the DTX token has already shown great growth potential. This is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. Once a Tier-1 crypto exchange lists this token, many traders will be happy to know its listing price will sit at $0.20 – a 66% return for all who buy it now. This growth could make DTX one of the best cryptos to buy now. What May Come for Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) & DTX Exchange (DTX)? Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and DTX Exchange (DTX) look poised to see big price gains. However, DTX has some advantages that could set it apart. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers while tapping into the growing $18T gold market. Therefore, DTX may need less money for its price to surge while being more stable in the long run. Because of this, experts predict a potential 7,000% growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Remember Bonk (BONK)? Early adopters turned pennies into fortunes, riding a wave of meme coin mania. But here’s the twist—history is giving you a second chance, and it’s spelt BTFD Coin (BTFD) . The presale of this powerhouse coin is taking the market by storm, offering entry points that make missing out unforgivable. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin (BTFD) is the best new meme coin presale to join now, and how it’s poised to outshine the meme coin titans of the past, including Bonk. BTFD Coin: Turning Missed Opportunities into Millionaire-Making Moments For anyone who has ever said, “I wish I got in early,” BTFD Coin is your golden ticket. Short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD embodies the fearless mindset that turns market downturns into opportunities. And with over $3.6 million raised in its presale so far, it’s clear the community believes this coin is destined for greatness. The BTFD Presale Numbers You Need to Know The BTFD presale launched at just $0.000004 per coin. Fast forward to today, and the price sits at $0.00012, heading for a listing price of $0.0006. That’s a 5x jump for presale investors before the coin even hits major exchanges. Over 52 billion coins have already been sold to more than 4,700 investors, and the presale is now in its 11th stage. Want to join the action? Here’s what your investment could look like a $3,000 buy-in at today’s presale price of $0.00012 nets you 25 million BTFD coins. Once the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment balloons to $15,000. Miss this chance? That’s on you. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an ecosystem. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already in beta, users can dive into the Bulls Squad universe, unlocking rewards while enjoying cutting-edge gameplay. Though the beta version doesn’t offer rewards, it’s just a taste of what’s to come. What’s more, BTFD offers a staking program with an average APY of 90%, giving hodlers a reason to stick around long-term. The coin is also built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and seamless transactions. This is more than a presale; it’s a movement. Join the Bulls Squad, stack your coins, and ride the wave into the next bull cycle. The next Bonk-style story is unfolding, and it’s spelt BTFD. Bonk: The OG Meme Coin That Got Away Who could forget the Bonk (BONK) phenomenon? Launched as the first Solana-based meme coin, BONK took the crypto world by storm in late 2024. With its whimsical dog-themed branding and community-first approach, BONK quickly became a darling among Gen Z investors and crypto enthusiasts. A Meteoric Rise and Missed Opportunities In November 2024, BONK reached its all-time high of $0.000062, fuelled by its listing on the Upbit exchange and a massive community token burn of 1 trillion BONK tokens. Investors who got in early saw staggering returns, turning pocket change into life-changing wealth. But like all meme coins, volatility reared its head, and BONK’s price experienced sharp fluctuations. For those who missed out, it was a painful lesson: hesitation costs. While early adopters celebrated their gains, latecomers were left wishing they’d acted sooner. Latest Developments in BONK’s Journey Today, BONK trades at $0.00004069, showing a slight upward trend as of December 2024. Its community remains strong, and recent initiatives to reduce supply aim to stabilise the coin for long-term growth. However, for new investors, BONK’s peak profitability may already be in the rear-view mirror. And that’s why BTFD is so exciting. With its presale still underway, you’re getting in at ground zero—no second-guessing, no regrets. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best New Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Bonk taught us that timing is everything here. BTFD isn’t just another opportunity; it’s your shot at being the investor others envy. With its low entry price, innovative ecosystem, and community-driven ethos, BTFD checks all the boxes for a meme coin poised to explode. Consider this: you can buy 30.5 million BTFD coins for just 1 Ethereum or snag 813 million coins with 1 Bitcoin. Even smaller investments pack a punch. With $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. Don’t let these numbers pass you by—this is your Bonk moment, but better. The Road Ahead BTFD’s roadmap is ambitious but achievable. From scaling its P2E game to securing major exchange listings, the project is laser-focused on delivering value to its community. With liquidity locked for three years and a robust tokenomics model, BTFD offers long-term stability in a market known for its unpredictability. And let’s not forget the community. The Bulls Squad is more than just a fan base; it’s a movement of like-minded investors rallying around a shared vision. This isn’t just about profits; it’s about proving that meme coins can be more than a flash in the pan. Don’t Miss the Dip—Join the BTFD Presale Today The crypto market rarely gives second chances, but that’s exactly what BTFD represents. Whether you missed out on Bonk or are looking to amplify your portfolio, the best new meme coin presale to join now is right here, waiting for you. Time is of the essence. With every passing day, the BTFD presale inches closer to its final stages. Don’t let hesitation rob you of another Bonk-style opportunity. Sign up, load up your wallet, and grab your share of the coin that’s destined to make headlines. This is your moment. Will you seize it?

Seems US states are already making Trump’s vision of Bitcoin reserve a reality.

Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, supports the initiative, highlighting its reliance on voluntary Bitcoin donations from residents instead of taxpayer money, fostering a sense of community ownership. Key Features of the Proposal The bill outlines the creation of a secure Bitcoin fund, serving as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Representative Capriglione emphasized its flexibility, leaving room for future expansion based on legislative support. This approach could make Texas a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin into its financial systems. Others Following the League This proposal mirrors similar efforts nationwide, such as Pennsylvania’s recent legislation. Up to ten other states and several countries are reportedly exploring comparable measures. On the federal level, President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance includes plans for a national Bitcoin reserve and the formation of a crypto advisory council. Plus, states like Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Montana have already enacted laws to support mining rights and digital asset innovation. Advocacy groups, such as the Satoshi Action Fund, have introduced over 30 crypto-focused bills across the U.S. Bitcoin is Getting Mainstream Attention The concept of Bitcoin reserves is gaining traction internationally. Following the buzz, Bitcoin prices jumped 45% since the elections. El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin as part of their national strategies, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin as a key asset. However, some resistance remains, as seen in Microsoft’s recent rejection of a Bitcoin investment proposal. Why This Matters If passed it will be effective by September 1, 2025, with expiration on September 1, 2035. Texas’s initiative could lead the way for other states to adopt similar strategies, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. With growing support from state and federal governments, Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream financial systems seems more promising than ever.

In a post on X, Ethena Labs, built on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a possible launch for its stablecoin USDe which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is mainly built as a yield-generating asset rather than an intermediary for a transaction, similar to Tether ( USDT ) or USD Coin ( USDC ). 16.12.2024 pic.twitter.com/zmRQyCFfy9 — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 12, 2024 Ethena Labs announcement of USDe stablecoin on X. In contrast to the traditional fiat-reserve-backed stablecoins , USDe derives its yield based on the staking rewards of Ethereum ( ETH ) and keeps that reward away from the short funding rate for ETH. By doing so, it provides the holder an attractive annual percentage yield of up to 29%. This double-layered yield model makes USDe a high-reward financial instrument in the decentralized finance space. Users have rapidly flocked to USDe, making it the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, overtaking DAI’s $4.7 billion market cap, but is still behind USDT and USDC, which have a market cap of $135 billion and $40 billion, respectively. According to CoinMarketCap , USDe’s trading volume increased by 24.27% in the past 24 hours to reach $171.09 million, indicating high demand for yield-bearing assets.

Ethena’s USDe has been compared to Terra-Luna, whose value also collapsed in 2022 because of its unsustainable growth model, by critics . Terra’s collapse was attributed to its struggles to maintain its peg with the U.S dollar in a bearish market, and experts fear USDe could suffer the same fate. USDe employs a delta-neutral trading strategy, which balances Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH long and short positions to maintain its stability and yield. Ethena hedges the long stETH positions on centralized exchanges. In case a CEX goes down, the hedge may sit there; Ethena’s positions open to unrealized profits and losses. In a bull market, since the funding rate stays positive, this technique will work well; however, in bear markets, once the funding rate becomes negative, the yield can go down.

Secondly, given the growing efficiency of the crypto market, the profit margins, known as the basis spread , could narrow, reducing the profitability of USDe’s high yields in the long run.

Grayscale has launched investment trusts for Lido DAO and Optimism governance tokens, providing exposure to key Ethereum-based protocols. Meanwhile, Spotlight Stock Market has expanded its cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) lineup, adding 20 new listings from Valour, a DeFi Technologies subsidiary, broadening access to a diverse range of digital assets for investors. Grayscale Expands Investment Offerings with Lido and Optimism Governance Token Trusts Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has unveiled two new investment trusts focused on governance tokens for Lido DAO (LDO) and Optimism (OP). The announcement, made on Dec. 12, signals a continued push by Grayscale to broaden its portfolio of crypto-focused investment products while supporting Ethereum’s scaling and staking ecosystem. The newly launched Grayscale Lido DAO Trust and Grayscale Optimism Trust are designed to give investors direct exposure to the native tokens of two influential Ethereum protocols. Lido DAO is the largest liquid staking token (LST) protocol on Ethereum, while Optimism is a prominent layer-2 (L2) scaling solution aimed at improving Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability. “Lido is helping to democratize staking on Ethereum, and Optimism is critical in allowing Ethereum to scale to compete with newer, faster layer-1 blockchains,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research. These trusts are positioned to appeal to investors seeking exposure to protocols driving Ethereum’s broader adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The goal is to offer “exposure to protocols helping to increase Ethereum’s efficiency, security, scalability, and adoption,” Sharif-Askary added. Why Lido and Optimism? Lido’s liquid staking technology has revolutionized staking on Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) while still maintaining liquidity by issuing tradeable tokens representing claims on their staked assets. This innovation has made staking more accessible and flexible for a broader range of users. As of December, Lido boasts nearly $40 billion in total value locked (TVL), securing its position as the largest DeFi protocol by TVL, according to DefiLlama . The protocol’s influence has made its governance token, LDO, a highly sought-after asset in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Optimism , a popular Ethereum layer-2 network, leverages optimistic rollups to improve transaction speed and reduce costs, addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. With approximately $800 million in TVL, Optimism has become a cornerstone of Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Beyond its own network, Optimism’s technology underpins other layer-2 solutions, including Coinbase’s Base and Uniswap’s Unichain, forming what the project describes as a “superchain.” This interconnected network enhances Ethereum’s scalability and facilitates a seamless user experience across various layer-2 ecosystems. The launch of the Lido and Optimism trusts is the latest in a series of initiatives by Grayscale to expand its suite of single-asset crypto investment products. Aave Governance Token Fund: In October, Grayscale introduced a trust dedicated to Aave (AAVE), a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Additional Assets Under Consideration: Grayscale has added 35 altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Worldcoin (WLD), and Pyth (PYTH), to its list of assets under consideration for future investment products. Other Recent Trusts: In August, Grayscale launched three separate trusts targeting Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Bittensor, and Sui, further diversifying its offerings. Grayscale’s Dominance in the Crypto Investment Space Grayscale manages nearly $35 billion in assets as of Dec. 11, cementing its reputation as a dominant force in the crypto investment industry. Its flagship products include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), both of which are industry benchmarks for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. US regulators are also evaluating Grayscale’s proposal to convert its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC)—a fund holding a mix of cryptocurrencies—into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, this move could further solidify Grayscale’s role as a leader in crypto financial products. Grayscale’s new trusts bring attention to the growing importance of Ethereum-based protocols in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. By focusing on Lido and Optimism, Grayscale is betting on Ethereum’s ability to address its scalability and usability challenges, which are crucial for its long-term adoption and success. The investments also highlight the rising demand for products that offer exposure to governance tokens—critical assets that give holders a say in the development and direction of blockchain protocols. As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, the success of projects like Lido and Optimism could pave the way for further institutional interest in DeFi and layer-2 solutions. Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market Expands Crypto ETP Offerings with 20 New Listings by Valour The Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden has significantly bolstered its cryptocurrency-focused investment offerings by listing 20 new digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs). All the newly introduced ETPs were issued by Valour, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, marking another major milestone in bringing blockchain technology to traditional investors. With the new listings, Spotlight now hosts 45 ETPs, all of which are issued by Valour. These ETPs provide investors with regulated access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects without needing to manage the complexities of holding digital assets directly. Of the 45 products, four are denominated in euros, while the remainder are priced in Swedish kronor. Valour’s expansion on Spotlight began in June with the launch of ETPs for Core (CORE) and Hedera (HBAR). The company’s latest offering includes a mix of well-established and emerging blockchain projects, reflecting Valour’s goal of broadening access to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Johan Wattenström, co-founder of Valour, emphasized the significance of the new launches, stating, “By simultaneously introducing such a diverse range of innovative products, we are not merely expanding our portfolio — we are offering investors access to the forefront of blockchain technology.” The Assets Behind the New ETPs The 20 new ETPs feature an eclectic mix of cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols , including: Aave (AAVE): A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Aerodrome Finance (AERO): A platform focused on liquidity and DeFi innovation. Akash Network (AKT): A decentralized cloud computing marketplace. Aptos (APT): A next-generation layer-1 blockchain. Arweave (AR): A blockchain solution for permanent data storage. Fetch.ai (FET): An AI-driven blockchain platform. Fantom (FTM): A scalable blockchain for DeFi and enterprise applications. Injective (INJ): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for decentralized finance. Jupiter (JUP): A platform for decentralized applications and token utilities. Kaspa (KAS): A layer-1 blockchain with a focus on speed and security. Lido DAO (LDO): A liquid staking protocol for Ethereum. Metis (METIS): A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Pendle (PENDLE): A protocol for trading tokenized yield. Pyth Network (PYTH): A decentralized oracle solution. Render (RNDR): A blockchain for decentralized GPU rendering. Sei (SEI): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for trading. Starknet (STRK): A layer-2 scaling solution using zero-knowledge proofs. THORChain (RUNE): A decentralized liquidity network. Worldcoin (WLD): A cryptocurrency with a focus on universal access and identity. Wormhole (W): A cross-chain interoperability protocol. Valour’s Strategic Expansion Valour’s latest listings align with its broader mission to dominate the European ETP market. The company currently manages over 60 ETPs across Europe and has set an ambitious target of reaching 100 ETPs by the end of 2025. In November, Valour and Spotlight introduced the first Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP, capturing attention for its novel approach to meme cryptocurrency investing. In October, Valour also migrated 19 ETPs from the Nordic Growth Market to Spotlight, further consolidating its presence in Sweden’s financial ecosystem. Valour’s reach is not limited to Europe. The company has taken significant steps toward global expansion. In November, it signed a memorandum of understanding with AsiaNext, a Singapore-licensed securities exchange, to list its ETPs for institutional investors in Asia. AsiaNext is a joint venture between Japan’s SBI Digital Asset Holdings and Switzerland’s SIX Group, which operates the SIX Exchange. In August, Valour partnered with Sov.fi and the Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya to explore listing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR) on the exchange. This initiative marked a pioneering move toward introducing digital asset ETPs to African markets. The rapid growth of Valour’s offerings signals increasing institutional and retail interest in cryptocurrency investments. Exchange-traded products simplify access to digital assets, offering a regulated environment for investors who might otherwise be hesitant to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership. Valour’s decision to expand its portfolio with Spotlight shows Sweden’s growing importance as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. Spotlight is one of three major stock markets in the country, alongside Nasdaq Nordic and Nordic Growth Market. By positioning itself as a leader in crypto ETPs, Spotlight aims to attract a new generation of investors looking to diversify their portfolios with blockchain-based assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|LDO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-13 05:30:12

Tipped by insiders to 60x or more in 2025 after the presale finalizes, Rollblock (RBLK) aims to break up the centralized gambling market with democratized access for users through instant crypto deposits and withdrawals, as well as staking APY, revenue sharing, and token burning. The RBLK price is steady at $0.041 in its 9th presale stage, while altcoins are dropping RBLK will increase to $0.047, taking early returns to new highs. Meanwhile, large-cap cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) have both declined by 11%. Ripple Sees Huge Declines Post-Surge The Ripple real-time settlement ecosystem has seen a larger pullback than other tokens. However, the reason for the decline is clear, as it observed an impressive bullish trend in recent months. The Ripple token traded at $0.70 on November 12 and peaked at $2.72 on December 2. Presently, the coin sits at $2.02 after the expected retracement. In three weeks, the price of Ripple has nearly tripled, which was not the case for the majority of other tokens. The pullback was inevitable. Moreover, the token might see even further downside in the coming weeks and months as many investors sell to take out their profits. Binance Coin Falling Along With Wider Crypto Economy The price drop of Binance Coin is less explainable than Ripple and is likely due to a correlation with the wider crypto economy. Binance Coin traded at a low of $550 in early November and peaked at $750 in early December. Binance Coin’s upside was far less impressive than Ripples and it currently trades at around $658. Like Ripple, Binance Coin does provide strong underlying utility. Binance Coin is a huge ecosystem with a variety of products, including a CEX, DEX, wallet, NFT marketplace, P2P marketplace, and more. It provides both DeFi and CeFi operations. But this is still not enough to protect it from the wider market with Bitcoin declines often causing Binance Coin to crash. Rollblock’s GambleFi Protocol Is Crushing the Market Rollblock is an AI-powered GambleFi ecosystem with swift payouts, weekly profit sharing, instant crypto deposits, staking APY, transaction analytics, and a token burn mechanism that takes the native coin out of circulation to increase the price of remaining coins. The Rollblock crypto casino is fully licensed and verified by the Curacao Gaming Authority with an independent third-party audit from SolidProof. Of the 1,000,000,000 RBLK tokens, 60% are available in the presale with 11% allocated to exchange listings, 11% to rewards, 12% to marketing, and 6% to development. Profits are redistributed weekly to players as part of the project’s revenue share model, and other passive income mechanisms include liquidity provision, yield farming, staking, and affiliate programs, along with early bird presale pricing. Given the many passive income mechanisms, it is entirely feasible to see Rollblock 60x or more in 2025, and it targets a highly lucrative online gambling market that is set for change. With tokens currency selling at just $0.041, the RBLK presale could be the perfect option for investors frustrated at an overbought crypto market, including Ripple and Binance tokens with several price increases anticipated before the end of the year!

XRP Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the 4-hour price of XRP has been forming a Bull Flag recently. The “Bull Flag” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a flag on a pole. The pattern forms whenever the asset’s price follows up a sharp uptrend with a period of consolidation towards the downside. The initial upwards move corresponds to the ‘pole,’ while the consolidation period makes up for the ‘flag.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals In flag patterns, this consolidation specifically happens inside a parallel channel. That is, between two parallel trendlines marking successive tops and bottoms in the price. When the trendlines are converging, the pattern is known as a pennant. The upper level of the flag can be likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower level may act as support. A break out of either of these trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. A bull flag is considered to be a continuation pattern, so the probability of a breakout happening above the resistance level may be higher than that of the support line failing. Like the bull flag, there is also a pattern called the bear flag. This one works much in the same way, except for the fact that the pole is made by a sharp move down and the flag represents a brief phase of consolidation towards the upside. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the bull flag that XRP has recently been traveling inside: As displayed in the above graph, the 4-hour XRP price has just seen a rise to the upper level of the bull flag consolidation channel. When the same retest occurred a couple of days ago, the asset found rejection, but it’s possible that this might be the time it finds a break. Martinez has pointed out, however, that the cryptocurrency has witnessed another signal alongside this retest: the completion of a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential sell setup. The TD Sequential is a TA indicator that basically points out probable locations of tops and bottoms in any asset’s value. It involves two phases, with the first, which is known as the setup, occurring after price observes nine candles of the same color. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1.6 Billion Liquidations As XRP, DOGE Down 10% XRP has finished this type of TD Sequential phase with nine green candles, meaning that the indicator is now signaling a potential reversal to the downside for the coin. As such, the analyst thinks a brief correction would happen for the cryptocurrency first, before it manages to find a break above the $0.246 resistance. Bull flag breakouts can be of a similar length as the pole, so based on this, Martinez has chosen the $4 target for XRP. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.42, up more than 4% over the last seven days.

Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro has responded to this by putting out the details of the charges. Gary Gensler Targets Elon Musk In A Neuralink Probe The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be preparing for additional charges against Tesla Chair Elon Musk while also reopening an investigation into his neurotechnology company, Neuralink. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, has responded to the SEC chair Gary Gensler in a letter shared on the social media platform X. The letter notes that the US SEC has given Musk a 48-hour deadline to accept the monetary settlement or face charges on “numerous counts”. However, the securities regulator has failed to mention the exact nature of these charges while referring to a multi-year investigation by the agency. Additionally, the SEC has revived its probe into Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface venture. Musk wrote: “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” Calls for an investigation into Neuralink first surfaced back in 2023. Back then lawmakers raised concerns over Musk’s claims regarding the safety of the company’s brain implant technology. Slamming the SEC, Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro said that the recent SEC actions are nothing but an “endless investigation campaign” targeting the billionaire entrepreneur. US SEC Chair Gary Gensler holds a very bad reputation, especially in the crypto space, for his high-handed regulatory approach. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the company lost more than $150 million in a legal battle with the SEC because of Gensler. Elon Musk’s history with the SEC includes a $20 million settlement in 2018 over his tweets claiming that Tesla would go private and that the necessary funding had been secured. Elon Musk also tasked his AI, Grok, with creating an illustration of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The resulting image depicted a snail in a business suit, referencing Gary the Snail from SpongeBob SquarePants. Asked @Grok to draw a picture of @GaryGensler . Very flattering, I think! https://t.co/NJnAj1nKIS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Will Paul Atkins Transform Crypto The crypto community has been celebrating Gary Gensler’s ouster calling it an end to the tough regulatory regime for the industry. All eyes are on incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins who is set to revive the SEC with friendlier crypto reforms. “Under his leadership, the SEC may move away from aggressive tactics that prioritize headline-grabbing penalties over substantive outcomes,” wrote lawyers at US legal firm Anderson PC. On the other hand, Elon Musk will be working at the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and has recently proposed measures to end US inflation with the focus on cutting the federal spending.

The company recently minted over 13 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network, marking a key phase in its mainnet testing. Ripple Minted 13 Mln RLUSD Token In recent tweet posts, Ripple Stablecoin Tracker highlighted that the company minted 2.6 million RLUSD tokens on the XRP Ledger, along with additional smaller batches of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD. Notably, the XRP Ledger showcased its low-cost efficiency, with minting expenses totaling just 0.00048 XRP . On the Ethereum Network, Ripple minted 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens, with the cost for the largest batch being 0.00161 ETH, or about $6.31. However, these tests showcase the scalability and cost-effectiveness of both networks. Preparing for a Stablecoin Launch Ripple has been carefully testing RLUSD through minting , burning, and transferring processes to ensure it can handle real-world demands upon full launch. With its entry into the competitive stablecoin arena, RLUSD will face strong contenders like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. However, Ripple’s regulatory compliance may give it an edge, positioning RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. Meanwhile, CEO Brad Garlinghouse assured community users, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” XRP Price Update The launch announcement had a bullish impact on XRP, Ripple’s native token. XRP surged by 13%, reaching $2.46 , with potential targets of $2.80 and even $3 if it breaks the $2.50 resistance level. Analysts are closely monitoring the token as it approaches the key resistance level within a descending channel, with the next 48 hours being pivotal for market movements.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|USDT|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 05:56:51

Deaton has slammed the SEC for its aggressive actions against companies and individuals, using Elon Musk’s recent legal clash as an example. Deaton highlighted a report that SEC Chair Gary Gensler had issued a settlement demand to Musk, threatening charges unless he complied within 48 hours. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused the SEC of harassment and politically motivated actions. Elon Musk has had a long-running feud with the SEC, starting in 2018 when the agency charged him with fraud over his “Funding secured” in his X post about taking Tesla private. Musk settled the case, paying $20 million fines for both himself and Tesla, and stepping down as Tesla’s chairman. However, the settlement only fueled his resentment towards the SEC. Musk has repeatedly criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and, since Trump’s election, has continued his public attacks. Musk is now leading a nongovernmental effort, the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), to study federal spending and regulation. John Deaton Took a Jab at SEC’s Actions Having said that, Deaton argued that if the SEC treats the world’s richest man this way, smaller businesses and entrepreneurs face even harsher challenges. He referenced the LBRY case, where the SEC allegedly threatened to bankrupt the company and its founder, Jeremy Kauffman, even before filing a lawsuit. Similarly, Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly spent over $150 million defending against what Deaton described as a “non-fraud” case. Most companies lack such resources, making it nearly impossible to fight back against the SEC. Deaton also pointed to the SEC’s actions against Dragonchain as another example of regulatory overreach. He expressed hope that Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, could reform the agency if given the chance. Community Reaction An X user Nuclear Herbs responded to John Deaton and shared another example of SEC overreach in the SEC v Richard Heart Hearing where the judge struggled to understand the SEC’s fraud allegations. The post suggests that just because the SEC accuses someone of fraud, it doesn’t mean there’s any real fraud. The SEC, according to the post, is using the term “fraud” to unfairly sway public opinion, even when the claims are baseless. This critique adds to growing concerns about the SEC’s enforcement methods, particularly in the crypto space, where companies often face costly and prolonged legal battles.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 05:59:18

Japan's industrial production increased by 2.8% month-over-month in October 2024, below the preliminary estimate of 3.0% growth.

At the conference, officials led by Xi Jinping pledged to adopt a more expansive fiscal and monetary approach, including a larger budget deficit, increased borrowing, and reduced interest rates. Caution mounted ahead of a slew of economic data from China due Monday, including retail sales and industrial output. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -1.71% to 20,077 in early deals on Friday, surrendering gains from the prior session due to steep losses across sectors.

The report highlights a significant shift in the developer landscape, with Solana projected to attract 7,625 new developers by 2024, an 83% increase from the previous year. Of the 39,148 developers who started exploring the crypto space this year, around 20% chose Solana as their platform. This is the first time another blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in growth since its launch in 2016, according to Electric Capital’s findings. Despite Solana’s rapid growth, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain by total number of developers across all major regions, including North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Solana follows closely behind as the second largest ecosystem for developers globally. Related News: Big Bear Analyst il Capo also Stepped Back: Shares His Next Move The report attributes Solana’s developer growth to a variety of factors, including increased network activity and user interest during the recent memecoin rally. Platforms like Pumpfun, which simplify memecoin launches, have played a key role in increasing engagement. “Solana’s growth demonstrates the ecosystem’s ability to attract developers by offering high scalability and an active user base,” the report said. Electric Capital’s analysis also revealed significant growth in other blockchain ecosystems, with Aptos, Base, Bitcoin, Internet Computer, NEAR, Polkadot, Polygon, Starknet, and Sui each adding over 1,000 new developers in 2024. Meanwhile, networks like BNB, Optimism, Scroll, Stellar, and TON added 500 developers each. *This is not investment advice.

But things took a turn when the creator of the character, Philip Banks, strongly objected to the use of his art in the meme coin project. However, a recent Instagram post by Banks indicates that a solution has been reached to settle this issue. Curious to know the details? Read on! Philip Banks Announces Licensing Agreement There were rumors that the CHILLGUY meme coin team would approach Banks seeking his support. In a recent Instagram post, Banks confirms that the team approached him, and they have reached an agreement regarding licensing and IP rights after a long discussion. He officially announces that he has decided to provide licensing and IP rights to the team, putting an end to the uncertainty and questioning the sustainability of the meme coin. Notably, it was through his X handle that Banks initially shared the developments regarding the discussion.

After briefly dropping below $2, XRP now trades at approximately $2.42, marking a steep 19.36% loss over the past week. Despite this downturn, three major developments are poised to drive a rebound in the asset’s price, offering hope to investors and enthusiasts: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Nears Launch: Ripple is preparing to introduce its much-anticipated U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. The stablecoin has secured final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), as confirmed by Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. While the exact launch date is yet to be announced, Ripple is expected to share further updates through its official communication channels soon. RLUSD is designed to enhance Ripple’s ecosystem by facilitating institutional payments and cross-border transactions. By increasing the utility of the token within its network, the stablecoin’s deployment could potentially attract more institutional participation. Analysts predict that this added utility may boost demand for XRP as a bridge currency, further integrating the token into Ripple’s payment infrastructure. Growing Interest: The prospect of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is gaining momentum, with several asset management firms already filing applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notable firms such as WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise have joined the race, alongside Canary Capital, which initiated the process in October. Speculation is also growing that major players like BlackRock could follow suit. Approval of an XRP ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to the token, potentially driving significant capital inflows. Drawing parallels to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions of dollars in investments, an XRP ETF could substantially enhance market liquidity and encourage mainstream adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Developments in Ripple vs. SEC Case: The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC influences the asset’s market performance. However, recent developments suggest a potential resolution may be near. Observers speculate that a settlement could become more likely with the upcoming change in U.S. administration, particularly as SEC Chair Gary Gensler is expected to step down following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. A favorable settlement or resolution would likely remove regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset, reinforcing its classification as a non-security. Such clarity could pave the way for increased investor confidence and institutional engagement, providing a strong foundation for price recovery. While the asset has faced significant market challenges, these three developments—Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch, the growing interest in XRP ETFs, and potential progress in its legal battle with the SEC—offer a path toward recovery and growth. As the market anticipates these events, the coming months could be key for XRP’s trajectory, making it a focal point for investors and analysts.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Crossed The $768 Billion Milestone In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about the latest trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates BTC’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals The previous transfer of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in circulation, it essentially calculates the sum of the cost basis of the Bitcoin supply. In other words, the model measures the total amount of capital that the investors as whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in its value over the entire history of the digital asset: As displayed in the above graph, the BTC Realized Cap has been riding a sharp uptrend during the past year, which suggests capital has rapidly been pouring into the coin. “Bitcoin is attracting $80 billion every month,” notes the CryptoQuant founder. “Nearly half of the capital that has entered the Bitcoin market over the past 15 years was added this year.” Thanks to these impressive inflows, the total BTC investment has almost reached the $769 billion milestone. It’s unclear how long the Realized Cap could continue this sharp trajectory, but for now, it seems there is still plenty of demand for the asset. In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also discussed about the same metric from a different angle. The above chart shows the cumulative data for the Bitcoin “Realized Profit” and “Realized Loss.” These metrics, as their names imply, measure the amount of profit and loss, respectively, that the investors are realizing or harvesting through their selling. Over the history of the cryptocurrency, the difference between the cost basis and selling price for profitable transactions stands at $1.27 trillion, while that for the underwater transfers is at $592 billion.

Following a strong market recovery, Ethereum has outperformed many other cryptocurrencies, gaining 6% in the past day, according to CoinGecko. “The gears and bolts are in place,” Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at Nexo, said in an interview. “Ethereum could skyrocket beyond $5,000 by early 2025.” Ethereum is up 79% since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, but it still lags behind its all-time high of $4,800 set in 2021. Comparatively, Bitcoin is up 62% over the same period, while Solana and XRP have gained 59% and 430%, respectively. Related News: Turkey's SEC Announced the List - Blocked Access to Cryptocurrency Exchanges with Very Familiar Names Carlos Guzman, an analyst at market maker GSR, noted Ethereum’s unique position in the market. “ETH has a huge advantage in that it is the only token in the US that has an ETF, besides BTC,” he explained. “As traditional investors become more invested in crypto, they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Ethereum’s prospects are further supported by institutional interest.

The announcement intends to respond to such queries in regard to the observed unexpected wallet activity in the process. WazirX stated to its users that all the cold wallets and all tokens that are stored in those wallets will be disclosed to the public once the balancing and managing of the pockets are done.

This massive expiration is expected to trigger significant market movement, creating potential volatility as traders and investors prepare for a busy day. Bitcoin Options Expiring: $3.36 Billion at Stake A large portion of the expirations comes from Bitcoin options. According to Deribit , over 217,000 Bitcoin contracts, valued at approximately $3.36 billion, are set to settle today. With a put-to-call ratio of 0.60, there are more long positions (calls) than short ones (puts), indicating overall bullish sentiment. However, the maximum pain point for Bitcoin stands at $98,000, which is slightly below the current spot price of $99,758. While Bitcoin’s recent rise to $103,000 was notable, a recent price dip has caused liquidations of many leveraged positions. Still, solid buying activity in the spot market suggests optimism, though high funding rates for leveraged positions could lead to potential pullbacks. $900 Million Ethereum Options Expiring Ethereum also has a big expiration today, with over 1.7 million contracts worth around $900 million set to expire. Interestingly, Ethereum traders appear more bullish than Bitcoin traders, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.46. However, the max pain point is at $3,700, which mark is crucial for both bulls and bears, as it will likely determine the next price direction for ETH. Is the Christmas Rally Coming? With options expiring, traders are now wondering if a rally could take place before Christmas. The market shows Bitcoin and Ethereum moving in different directions, with Bitcoin holding below $100,000 and Ethereum staying just under $4,000. The next few days could be crucial, as traders adjust their positions and prepare for the end of the year.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 07:13:55

How Gaming and A.I on XRP can Fuel Massive Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is thrilled with the recent approval of RLUSD by New York regulators as they see stablecoins like RLUSD as crucial for improving cross-border payments and simplifying user integration into the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ripple is also focused on enhancing the network’s functionality, driving adoption, and creating liquidity, with a particular emphasis on sectors like gaming. McDonald Talks XRP’s Market Growth Aaron McDonald, CEO of Futureverse, talked about the current XRP market, noting the recent rise in XRP’s price and the strong support from its community. On The Paul Barron Network , he explained that although they joined Ripple during tough times, they believed in the potential of the loyal XRP community. McDonald described the community as a “loaded spring” ready to bounce back once obstacles were gone. He also said the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin backed by Ripple, could help bring more liquidity and support to the market. Stablecoins, he said, are useful for consumers and everyday transactions, especially in gaming. He’s excited about using this technology in Futureverse’s network. McDonald boasted XRP’s growth, with almost 20,000 trust lines now in place, showing XRP’s growing influence in the ecosystem. With Ripple’s stablecoin approval, XRP is set for growth – read XRP price prediction to see what’s next for this rising cryptocurrency! XRP Drives Root Network Success He explained how XRP is used within their network, calling it the “gas token” for the Root Network. This means that XRP powers everything on the network, from transactions to smart contracts . Over the past year, they’ve seen great progress by turning XRP into a valuable utility. In the first year, $13 billion worth of value was transferred on the network. Root Network validators also earned fees, with nearly 13% of the fees burned on the entire XRP ledger. McDonald aims to scale this success further in the coming year, hoping to 10x growth and increase the utility of XRP even more. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BTFD Coin (BTFD): Leading the Meme Market When it comes to meme coins, BTFD Coin is in a league of its own. Built on the ethos of “buy the dip,” it’s rallying investors with its high-stakes presale and vibrant community. Why BTFD is the Star of the Week With its presale already in the 11th stage, BTFD Coin has raised over $3.6 million, selling 52 billion tokens for just $0.00012. A $1,250 investment at this stage would secure over 10.4 million BTFD tokens. When the token hits its anticipated listing price of $0.0006, that investment could soar to $6,250. But BTFD is about more than just profits. Its 90% staking APY and the beta release of its P2E game make it a comprehensive ecosystem for growth and engagement. Why This Week is Crucial? BTFD Coin’s presale momentum is building fast, making this the perfect time to secure your spot before the token’s price climbs further. 2.

Dogwifhat’s blend of humour and forward-thinking strategies positions it as a solid choice for investors looking to diversify. 3. Ponke: The Underdog Rising Ponke has quickly gained traction with its minimalistic approach and focus on grassroots community building. What it lacks in flashy features, it makes up for in sheer dedication. The token has introduced a “Hold-to-Earn” mechanism, rewarding long-term investors with additional tokens. This initiative has resonated well with its community, driving steady growth. Why It’s a Hot Pick? Ponke’s steady rise proves that even underdogs can shine with the right community support. 4. Neiro: The AI-Powered Meme Coin Neiro blends artificial intelligence with meme coin charm, making it a unique player in the space. Its use of AI to generate memes and enhance user experience is both innovative and entertaining. The project recently launched an AI-powered meme generator, enabling users to create and share custom memes directly from its platform. This interactive feature has boosted engagement significantly. Why This Week Matters? Neiro’s tech-driven approach sets it apart from traditional meme coins, making now an excellent time to get in before its user base expands further. 5.

Inspired by viral internet culture, Brett leverages its comedic roots to drive investor interest. The team behind Brett has partnered with several influencers, helping the coin gain visibility across social media platforms. Its quirky appeal has attracted a loyal following that continues to grow.

The discussion centered on technical patterns, breakout points, and strategic price targets, emphasizing the bullish outlook for XRP both in the short term and through 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE FILTHY RICH BECAUSE OF THIS! (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/esdq9eJ6zz — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Technical Overview In the monthly timeframe, Steph highlighted the confirmed breakout of a W formation, a bullish technical pattern. According to his analysis, XRP has retested the neckline of this formation at approximately $1.96, a level not seen since 2021. XRP began forming this pattern after its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. It hit the bottom of the first half in December 2020 when it hit a low of $0.1743, before climbing to the top of the first half in April 2021. The asset began declining after this and hit the bottom of the pattern’s second half in 2024. The asset’s recent rise has completed this pattern, with the retest of the $1.96 level reinforcing the potential for a significant rally. The technical target of the W formation is set at $30–$35, and the asset could hit this level in 2025. XRP has since risen above $1.96 and despite some recent turbulence , the asset is currently trading at $2.36. A rise to $35 represents an increase of over 1,380%. While this target is ambitious, Steph cautioned against relying solely on it, advising XRP holders to lock in profits incrementally during the rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Short-term Targets Zooming into the daily timeframe, XRP has demonstrated strong bullish momentum since October, rallying to a multi-year high of $2.86. The analyst highlighted XRP’s resilience above its EMA ribbons, which have acted as a support level during recent price consolidations. At the time of press, the price is approaching a critical downward-sloping resistance line, established on December 3. Steph noted that a daily candle close above this trendline, or above the December 9 high of $2.6, would confirm the start of the next impulsive move. XRP’s Performance Against Bitcoin Steph also provided a detailed analysis of XRP’s performance against Bitcoin. XRP has been in a long-term downtrend against BTC since 2018. However, a trend reversal has been evident since November, with XRP now retesting a crucial resistance level that dates back to 2020. On the daily timeframe, XRP is consolidating within a bullish flag pattern against Bitcoin. The analyst believes that a breakout from this pattern could result in XRP outperforming Bitcoin by up to 78%. Some experts are already speculating on XRP’s chances to flip Bitcoin , and this surge would set it on that path.

Just a “tiny fraction” of BlackRock users own IBIT and ETHA. Tidal CIO Michael Venuto believes Bitcoin will be tied to “every options strategy.” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, is doubling down on its United States spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), IBIT and ETHA, instead of launching investment products focused on altcoins. Currently, only a small portion of the firm’s customers hold these crypto ETFs, and BlackRock wants to onboard more users. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas discussed the rising popularity and demand for crypto ETFs, referencing quotes from representatives of different digital asset management firms. With recent discussions about XRP and Solana ETFs and the overall market reaching new highs, we can expect more capital inflow.

The resurgence in ETH price to $4,000 and Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policy influenced institutional inflows in Ether ETFs. Market analysts are confident that if this stream of inflows continues, we can see ETH heading to $15,000 within the next 6 to 8 months. BlackRock Ethereum ETF Hits New Milestone BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has witnessed inflows for 10 consecutive days, bringing its net inflows above $1.3 billion in this period. As per the data from Farside Investors , the total inflows into ETHA since inception reached nearly $3.2 billion since inception. This surge in demand highlights the growing interest in Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds, which have collectively attracted more than $2 billion in inflows since their launch in July. This comes despite $3.5 billion in outflows from Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) during the same period. On Thursday, December 12, the BlackRock Ethereum ETF saw an additional $202 million in inflows. The second-best inflows were in Grayscale mini Ether ETF (ETH) which saw more than $73 million in inflows. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FETH has also witnessed strong inflows nearing $1.4 billion since inception. Furthermore, the BlackRock management team also has high hopes for its Ethereum ETF’s future performance. Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs said: “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)”. ETH Price Mega Rally In Making? ETH price bounced back to $4,000 on Thursday, however, it continues to face rejection at these levels. As of press time, price of Ethereum is trading 0.74% down at $3,913 with a market cap of $471 billion. Despite this, market analysts continue to be optimistic about Ethereum expecting a mega rally ahead. Ethereum is poised to close another weekly green candle, provided its price stays above $3,712, according to prominent crypto analyst VentureFounder. The analyst’s long-term outlook places ETH price to reach a target of $15,937 by May 2025. In the short term, VentureFounder suggests Ethereum’s next three-week green candle could push the cryptocurrency to its previous all-time high of $4,900. Courtesy: TradingView Thus, if inflows into BlackRock Ethereum ETF continue at the same pace, it can lead to further gains for ETH. However, the asset needed to first break past its crucial resistance from Ethereum price to target $5,000 and fresh all-time highs ahead.

The attack which affected the older versions of the network has presented the dogecoin community with security and robustness issues. The Extent of the Exploit Data highlighted by blockchain analytics platform Blockchain, the number of active Dogecoin nodes dropped from 647 to 205 earlier this week. Although some nodes have come back online, bumping the total figure back up to 331 as of now, the event exposes a major weakness in the network design. The exploit, known as “ DogeReaper ,” was first reported by security engineer Tobias Ruck. It enables hackers to launch segmentation faults at Dogecoin nodes from a distance, thereby terminating them. Hacker Claims Responsibility On X, Sequentia developer Andreas Kohl confessed to using the DogeReaper vulnerability on a decade-old laptop from El Salvador’s countryside. He said it was only the old nodes and they are the majority of the network while centralised exchanges and major custodians were not impacted. “Many Dogecoin users didn’t pay attention because they can use exchanges or have some kind of third party that holds their coins,” Kohl said. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Weekly Hack Report: Alarming Trends You Should Know , Contracted Dogecoin Network Consequences An attack on this scale shows a crucial vulnerability in Dogecoin’s system of decentralization. In the past, researchers have related the exploit to something like the ‘Death Note’, which is from Japanese manga, where, once someone’s name is written, the character drops dead. Like the case of the DogeReaper flaw, it can paralyze the network, stopping all its transactions and block generation for days. Critics say, however, that the attack presents a more significant problem. Despite the hack, Dogecoin’s price stabilized at $0.4073 at the time of writing, down 2.54% according to data by Coinmarketcap . The team is now under pressure to fix the loophole as soon as possible and rebuild the confidence of their network. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 07:50:00

The man leading Parliament’s work on the digital euro, who became one of its biggest critics, has quit to stop claims he was delaying the project on purpose, POLITICO has learned . Berger, a veteran German lawmaker from the center-right European People’s Party, announced his decision to POLITICO, stating that “it’s time for someone [who] is not coming from Germany and is not under suspicion that he wants to delay the talks.” Markus Ferber, who oversees economic issues for the EPP, will choose Berger’s replacement within a week, the report notes. The digital euro, planned as a virtual version of euro coins and notes, aims to improve payments in the eurozone and reduce dependence on foreign companies like Visa and Mastercard . But it has faced pushback, especially from German banks and citizens worried about its design and financial risks. Berger also raised concerns that it could lead to sudden withdrawals, hurting smaller banks. You might also like: ECB and EU governments reportedly clash over digital euro regulation Although Berger helped create MiCA, which will make the EU the first major region with clear crypto rules, he has faced challenges getting similar support for the digital euro. While MiCA gave crypto firms clear rules across the EU, the digital euro has been met with concerns about privacy and its technical details. Berger had proposed a gradual approach, starting with wholesale transactions for the digital euro. However, critics claimed he missed deadlines and slowed progress, leading rival lawmakers to call for his removal earlier this year. The European Central Bank is currently testing the digital euro’s feasibility, with plans for a pilot program in the coming years. Earlier in December, in a digital euro progress report , the regulator implied that it might drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration.

A Crypto Advocate Takes the Helm French Hill’s track record shows he’s not afraid to tackle tough issues in the financial world. While the draft of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) was being drafted, he played a key role in it. This act puts the foundations of rules for handling digital assets, that’s something the crypto space has been asking for. Hill also worked on legislation for stablecoins and improving the crypto market structure. As Chair, he plans to address claims of “debanking,” where financial institutions cut off services to crypto businesses. That’s a big deal for the industry. His election to this position wasn’t a given, though. He won after competing with other experienced Republican contenders. But his colleagues believed in his vision, and now, he’s ready to lead. After he was elected, he shared his regards to everyone who trusted him. “ I am humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust in me to lead the House Financial Services Committee as their next Chairman.

During the segment, Garlinghouse made​ a strong case for the future​ оf cryptocurrencies. First,​ he addressed the show’s​ 10 million viewers and defended Ripple’s vision.​ He also opened​ up about his ongoing battle with regulators over the XRP token. But while Ripple continues​ tо make headlines, there’s​ a new player​ оn the crypto scene that’s catching eyes: Rollblock.​ As​ a fresh face​ іn the crypto world, Rollblock​ is stepping​ up with​ an innovative GambleFi platform, offering​ a unique blend​ оf gaming and decentralized finance. With growing attention, it’s clear Rollblock ​ is one​ tо watch closely​ since it’s making waves in presale stage 9, available at $0.041. Rollblock: New Crypto That’s Changing iGaming Space While XRP is all over the news, Rollblock is making its own spot as a leader in the fast-growing GambleFi sector. With a huge $7 million raised during its presale and token prices soaring by 310%, Rollblock is on track to disrupt the massive $500 billion global gambling industry. What’s driving Rollblock’s success? It’s all about its innovative ecosystem. The platform offers over 7,000 games, including live casino options and sports betting, all powered by Ethereum-backed smart contracts. This ensures transparency, security, and fairness, setting Rollblock apart from other gaming platforms. Rollblock’s deflationary tokenomics also makes it stand out. The platform uses weekly buybacks and token burns to maintain scarcity and increase value. Plus, investors can stake RBLK tokens for high APY rewards, creating a solid passive income stream. This smart economic model is getting lots of attention and positions Rollblock as a strong contender in the next crypto rally. Rollblock’s appeal is growing fast, attracting both experienced investors and newcomers eager for sustainable gains. It’s not just shaking up the $500 billion iGaming market; it’s tapping into the broader crypto rally, making it a project to keep an eye on. XRP Rally is Strong If we watch closely what happened in this bull market, XRP is surely considered a winner. XRP did jump 253.41% in the last 30 days alone. But, just like that, things have taken a bit of a dip. XRP has dropped some of its recent gains. This shows us that XRP is stabilizing and preparing for a new jump and another XRP rally . So, what might seem like a setback could actually be a sign that XRP is just getting ready for the next big jump. The market’s cooling off for now, but many believe it’s just a breather before another rally kicks in. But another new crypto is causing a real fuss – Rollblock. No matter what happens on the main stage, Rollblock seems to handle everything with ease. Conclusion To sum it up, Ripple is making waves, and XRP’s rally has been strong – though it might be taking a short pause. Meanwhile, Rollblock is a project you definitely don’t want to sleep on. With its unique GambleFi platform and huge potential to shake up the iGaming industry, Rollblock is on track to become one of the next big things in crypto. Don’t miss out – this is the perfect time to jump in before everyone else catches on. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Bitcoin, Ethereum Spot ETFs See Record Inflows Amid Market Momentum Bitcoin Spot ETFs surge with $598 million net inflows. Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a total of $598 million net inflows on Dec. 12, marking an 11-day consecutive inflow streak. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF IBIT led the charge with single-day net inflows of $432 million, reflecting growing investor confidence and institutional adoption. The cumulative net asset value (NAV) of Bitcoin spot ETFs has now reached a record high of $112.546 billion, further cementing their appeal in the market. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Gains with $274 Million Net Inflows Ethereum spot ETFs also attracted significant investment, with net inflows of $274 million on Dec. 12, marking a 14-day streak of uninterrupted inflows. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF ETHA recorded its largest single-day inflow of $202 million, underscoring the asset’s growing appeal to investors. Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF ETH added $73.22 million in single-day inflows, underscoring its strong position in the market. Continued inflows into both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs indicate a growing appetite for cryptocurrency interest among both retail and institutional investors.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Glassnode says that LINK’s fundamentals are improving along with its active address momentum and rising price tag. “While LINK’s price surge was clearly driven by speculative and short-term market activity, its fundamentals are improving too. Active addresses momentum is trending higher, with the short-term SMA (simple moving average) of 6,682 still above the long-term SMA of 5,878. That said, active addresses remain far below their 2021 peak of 23,416.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode goes on to note that LINK hit the highest price it has since 2022 and that its futures open interest has reached a new all-time high, signaling high trading activity. “Chainlink’s token LINK has hit its highest price in nearly two years, and futures open interest (OI) just surged to an all-time high of $770.27 million! For context: LINK OI: $770 million. Toncoin (TON) OI: $259 million. Tron (TRX) OI: $356 million. LINK’s OI is 3x TON and 2x TRX, signaling massive trading activity.” Source: Glassnode/X The crypto analytics firm then breaks down how investors took profits from trading LINK, with ultra short-term and short-term investors realizing the most while long-term holders appeared largely dormant. “We also saw significant profit-taking in the spot market. With $35.57 million in realized profits, yesterday marked the 2nd largest profit-taking event for LINK this year (trailing only Feb 11’s $40.39 million). This profit-taking was driven mostly by speculative market participants: Ultra-short (1 day-1 week): 15.3% Short-term (3-6 months): 22.5%. Long-term holders stayed mostly quiet, except for the 1-2 year cohort (11.6%).” Source: Glassnode/X LINK is trading for $24.96 at time of writing, a 6.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu shows bullish potential despite recent volatility, supported by an active burn mechanism and predictions of significant price spikes. XRP’s price surged over 250% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a new all-time high driven by regulatory progress and market momentum. Pi Network’s Stronghold in South Korea Despite the surrounding controversy, the cryptocurrency project Pi Network continues to amass users. Not long ago, the team revealed the application had exceeded the milestone of 100 million downloads. Pi Network has a solid presence in Asia, creating multi-million communities in countries like China, Vietnam, Singapore, India, Japan, and More. As CryptoPotato recently reported , South Korea is another nation where the project has gained huge popularity. According to Wu Blockchain’s analysis , the number of local Pi Network users has reached 1.34 million, which outnumbers the domestic client base of major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In fact, the only two domestic cryptocurrency-related entities having more users are Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). While the global Pi Network community continues to grow, its native token and open mainnet have yet to see the light of day. The team assured it will set things into motion once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Latest data shows that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only 1 million left to do so. Meanwhile, the Pi Core Team previously promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if there will be further delays. SHIB’s Next Potential Targets The second-largest meme coin experienced a substantial revival at the start of December. However, in the past several days, it witnessed enhanced volatility, with its price plunging by over 10% on a weekly scale . SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the turbulence, numerous analysts remain optimistic that a new rally could be on the horizon . X user JAVON MARKS, for instance, maintained that SHIB has confirmed a bullish pattern, which could be a precursor for “another major upside move.” The trader reiterated their forecast that the price could spike by almost 180% and reach $0.000081. Other market observers predicting good days ahead for the meme coin include Zach Humphries and The Crypto Bull. The former believes that SHIB could chart substantial gains once “Ethereum breaks loose.” The Crypto Bull assumed that Shiba Inu’s chart “looks primed for launch very soon.” The resurgence of the asset’s burning mechanism supports the thesis of a price pump. The burn rate has spiked by almost 300% in the past 24 hours, resulting in 11.8 million tokens sent to a null address. The USD equivalent of the stash might be insignificant, but continuous efforts in that field will make SHIB more scarce and potentially more valuable in time (should demand keep its level or rise). XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s XRP is also in the red on a weekly scale , albeit charting less substantial losses than Shiba Inu. However, the asset remains one of the best performers in the past month, with its price skyrocketing by over 250% and currently trading above $2.30. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some of the factors that have fueled XRP’s impressive spike over the last several weeks include Gary Gensler’s (the current Chairman of the US SEC) announcement that he will step down in January next year and the progress of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. Not long ago, CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the financial product received regulatory approval from the NYDFS. Many industry participants believe XRP is now gearing up for another massive rally. X user Ali Martinez recently noted the emergence of a bull flag on the asset’s price chart, predicting a rise to a new all-time high of $4. However, he believes the road to the peak might be bumpy and include a brief correction. Prior to that, he claimed that XRP “looks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle.” He set a “conservative target” of $8.40 and an “optimistic” one of a staggering $48.12.

Coinbase’s Legal Fight Uncovers Red Flags appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is facing criticism after it heavily redacted documents requested by Coinbase, the popular cryptocurrency exchange. Coinbase had asked for information about the government’s actions against the crypto industry, but the FDIC’s excessive blackouts raised suspicions that they might be hiding important details. JUST IN: Judge Reyes ruled that FDIC didn't do what it was ordered to do. ""The Court is concerned with what appears to be FDICs lack of good-faith effort in making nuanced redactions. Defendant cannot simply blanket redact everything that is not an article or preposition."" 1/3 https://t.co/AX5HCKjrij — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 12, 2024 Judge Criticizes FDIC’s Actions On December 12, 2023, Judge Ana C. Reyes criticized the FDIC for not following a court order and accused the agency of not being transparent. Coinbase had complained that the redactions were so extensive that it was hard to understand what the FDIC was saying about the government’s actions against crypto. This led the judge to rule against the FDIC, suggesting they were not being open with the court. In November of 2021 – banks began receiving instructions from the current administration to disengage from any crypto services.. even went on to “debank” targeted customers / businesses. https://t.co/4HrCMMJVTX pic.twitter.com/fGHngO5FFv — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 1, 2024 Coinbase Questions What’s Being Hidden Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, shared his frustration on social media, asking, “What is the FDIC working so hard to hide?” He pointed out that the redactions made it seem like the agency was trying to cover something up. This legal fight is part of a bigger concern in the crypto community about government actions against the industry, with some seeing this as part of a broader effort to stifle crypto innovation. Crypto Regulations on Check This case has bigger implications for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Many believe it’s connected to a government initiative called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which critics argue is aimed at limiting crypto businesses. With the upcoming leadership changes in the U.S. government, things might settle soon. Donald Trump’s win is a sign of a new beginning for crypto. Moreover, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg have already stepped down, and Paul Atkin, a pro-crypto figure, is set to replace Gruenberg. Brian Quintenz, who has a crypto-friendly background, may head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In this regard, the Coinbase and Ripple vs SEC case will be the best example of fair and transparent judgment. This could lead to less government interference and more concrete regulations for the crypto space.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 08:08:07

A survey conducted by the major crypto exchange Kraken on 2,537 Americans revealed that 55%, whether they own crypto or not, believe that crypto has real-world uses. However, around 29% are still uncertain about its future outlook. Despite this uncertainty, around 73% of respondents who currently hold crypto admitted that they plan to continue investing in digital assets as they enter the new year of 2025. As many as 43% view crypto as being “more secure than the traditional financial system,” compared to the other 30% who disagree. While 52% see it as a promising investment for the long-term. The survey explores how much “crypto myths” still shape people’s perceptions towards investing in crypto and whether attitudes have shifted. One of the most prevailing myths is the belief that crypto is mostly used to facilitate criminal activities. Kraken’s survey revealed 60% of respondents still think crypto fuels illegal acts more than any other asset. Even though the research tells a different story. Read more: Cash, not crypto remains criminal’s preferred tool for illicit finance, study says According to the Chainalysis Crypto Crime 2024 report , only a small portion of crypto-based transactions were found to be linked to criminal activities in 2024, which is around 0.34%. In fact, a study by Crypto ISAC showed that cash is still the preferred tool for criminals engaging in illegal activities. On the other hand, only 8% of respondents believe that crypto is akin to a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud method which uses funds from new inventors to pay existing investors. Meanwhile, 53% of respondents believe negative attitudes towards crypto are fueled by ignorance and a lack of understanding, emphasizing the importance of crypto education for the wider public. Gen X has the most faith in crypto Data from the Kraken survey show that the age group with the most confidence in crypto is Gen X. According to the survey results, 63% of people aged 45 to 60 years old see crypto as a practical investment. It is believe that Gen X’s prior history of living through two economic crises, the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID crisis of 2020, have shaped their disbelief in traditionally-held currencies that failed to hold up against high levels of inflation. Gen X is also the generation that brought in the Cypherpunk movement, which means they have experienced dealing with both the traditional finance and the rise of crypto. This varied perspective could help them contextualize crypto’s practical value. On the other hand, Gen Z appears to have the least confidence in crypto. Only 32% of respondents aged 18 to 29 years old believe crypto has practical uses in the real world. This could indicate that younger investors are still navigating the complexities of crypto and the uncertainty surrounding it.

The plan involves deploying idle stablecoins into yield-generating strategies, potentially earning $91 million annually to fund DeFi development. Despite the ambitious proposal, POL price has dipped 6% in the last 24 hours. However, the token’s recent bullish momentum suggests that a positive outcome from the vote could reignite investor optimism. Polygon’s $1.3B Liquidity Proposal: A Game-Changer for DeFi Growth Polygon’s latest Pre-PIP ( Pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal ) proposes unlocking $1.3 billion in idle stablecoins held in its PoS Bridge to fuel its DeFi ecosystem. Authored by Allez Labs, Morpho Association, and Yearn, the initiative could generate an estimated $70–91 million annually in yield, presenting a massive opportunity for ecosystem development. The proposal suggests deploying stablecoins—USDC, USDT, and DAI—into ERC-4626 vaults, each with the network’s Improvement Proposal (PIP) to manage risk and maximize returns. For example, DAI reserves will be allocated to Maker’s sUSDS, while Morpho Vaults will serve as the yield-generating mechanism for USDC and USDT. The latest pre-PIP proposes to deposit unproductive bridge assets to Morpho. $1.3B idle stablecoins in the PoS Bridge $70M annual yield at current rates The yield will be distributed as incentives to grow the DeFi ecosystems on @0xPolygon and @AggLayer . https://t.co/sTJdtOCqnP — Morpho Labs (@MorphoLabs) December 12, 2024 Yearn will manage the Ecosystem Incentives Program, ensuring the generated yield is redirected to incentivize DeFi projects and boost liquidity. This approach could significantly amplify DeFi activity on Polygon PoS and the upcoming AggLayer, creating new growth avenues. With a structured plan, the proposal addresses a crucial community demand—turning dormant assets into productive resources to accelerate its expansion in the DeFi space. Risk management and oversight by Allez Labs and the Polygon Protocol Council further strengthen its feasibility. Ecosystem Innovations and Price Movement POL price has experienced a 6% decline in the past 24 hours despite recent bullish trends. The dip comes as the community votes on the $1.3 billion liquidity proposal. However, with POL still up 70% over the past month, investor sentiment remains optimistic, signaling potential for a rebound if the proposal passes. Beyond token performance, the network is advancing its ecosystem through tokenization efforts. Assetera, a non-US-regulated platform, has chosen Polygon to tokenize traditional assets, including NVIDIA stocks and S&P 500 trackers. These fully collateralized, MiFID-compliant assets offer global investors seamless access to tokenized securities, setting a new benchmark for on-chain financial products. Its scalable infrastructure continues to position it as a leader in the tokenization space. In another innovative use case, Courtyard, powered by the network, is bringing Pokemon cards on-chain. This integration ensures greater transparency, security, and liquidity for collectible trading, demonstrating how the network is bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional markets. These developments highlight its commitment to diversifying its ecosystem and unlocking new opportunities for users worldwide.

In a statement released on Dec. 12, the PRA urged firms to outline their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and detail their compliance with the Basel framework for regulating crypto activities. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on cryptoassets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” the PRA stated. The Basel framework, introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022, defines capital and risk management standards for banks exposed to cryptocurrencies. The PRA aims to use the collected data as a foundation for monitoring the financial stability risks posed by crypto assets. Firms are required to account for their crypto-related plans extending through September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire highlights critical areas of interest, including firms’ application of the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. “While there are benefits that these new types of ledgers can bring, they also pose risks such as lack of settlement finality, settlement failure, and no guaranteed link between the intended owner of the asset and the entity that may have control of the authentication, validation mechanism,” the questionnaire states. The PRA emphasized that risks tied to permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated at present” but noted that the classification remains under review. Globally, companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin, spurred by its historic six-figure valuation.

The streamlined architecture incorporates advancements in mathematical problem-solving. Per the reports, the new model, boasting 14 billion parameters, aims to compete with other compact AI models like GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. According to Microsoft’s blog , Phi-4 is available with limited access through Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform and is restricted to research purposes under a Microsoft research license agreement. Phi-4: Enhanced performance in mathematical reasoning Microsoft has positioned Phi-4 as a leader in mathematical problem-solving, citing substantial performance gains over both its predecessors and comparable models. The company is confident about the AI model’s capabilities after Phi-4 reportedly achieved top marks in several standardized benchmarks. Source: Microsoft In the GPQA test, it scored 56.1, outperforming GPT-4o’s 40.9 and Llama-3’s 49.1. On the MATH benchmark, Phi-4 achieved 80.4, reflecting its advanced capabilities in tackling complex mathematical problems. It also excelled in coding benchmarks, achieving a score of 82.6 on HumanEval. Additionally, Phi-4 demonstrated its prowess in real-world scenarios, including high scores on problems from the Mathematical Association of America’s American Mathematics Competitions (AMC-10/12). These results indicate potential applications in scientific research, engineering, and financial modeling, fields where mathematical accuracy and reasoning are critical. Source: Microsoft While larger models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini Ultra operate with hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters, Phi-4 demonstrates that smaller, streamlined architectures can achieve superior performance in specialized tasks. Microsoft credits Phi-4’s advancements to the integration of high-quality synthetic data alongside datasets of human-generated content, as well as undisclosed improvements made during post-training. These efforts reflect a broader trend in the AI industry , where research teams are increasingly focusing on innovations in synthetic data usage and post-training optimization. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently highlighted this shift, remarking that the industry has hit a “pre-training data wall,” adding that companies will now race towards developing more efficient AI models. Compute matters, but so does data, and we have reached a pre-training data wall. Get ready for the post-training data boom. Companies will race to have the best frontier data—multi-modal, agentic, complex reasoning, and more.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|SHIB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 09:09:00

DAOs are organizations represented by rules encoded as computer programs, controlled by the token holders related to that organization and not influenced by a central authority. The plan involves using Morpho Labs' vaults to manage USDC and USDT targeting a conservative 7% annual return through strategies that include high-quality collaterals like USTB, sUSDS, and stUSD. That could make Polygon an additional $70 million yearly from idle assets. The yield generated would be reinvested back into the Polygon ecosystem, supporting growth across the network and its ecosystem. If the idea passes an initial community check, the proposal will aim to generate yield by gradually deploying dai (DAI), USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) from reserves into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Deploying each asset will require a separate proposal to be floated and passed by the community in the future.

Over the years, we’ve seen meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu carve out a permanent place in pop culture and investment portfolios. Now, BTFD Coin is poised to take this explosive sector to the next level with its unique P2E game, staking rewards, and vibrant community power. This new kid on the block isn’t just here to play; it’s here to dominate. BTFD Coin’s highly-anticipated presale launched on November 26, 2024, and the buzz is already massive. With analysts predicting jaw-dropping price growth, investors are scrambling to grab a piece of the action. Let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin and other standout meme coins are the best meme coins to join now. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Riding High on Momentum BTFD Coin is already making waves in the crypto world, and for good reason. The coin’s presale performance has been nothing short of electric. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it reached its fourth stage—one-fourth of the presale journey—within 24 hours. Currently in its 11th stage, BTFD is priced at $0.00012, having raised over $3.6 million so far. With more than 52 billion $BTFD coins sold and 4,700+ bulls backing it, this project is set to disrupt the meme coin space. So, what makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to join now? Let’s talk features. BTFD isn’t your average pump-and-dump meme coin. It’s built for long-term value, with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that adds a layer of utility and excitement. Players can earn rewards while gaming, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Combine that with staking rewards and an active, bullish community, and you’ve got a recipe for explosive growth. Consider this: if you’d invested $5,000 in Stage 5, where BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 100 million coins. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, those coins would be worth $60,000. That’s a 12x return on your initial investment. Not bad for a coin that started as a buzzword. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is also leaning heavily on community engagement. Its “Buy the Dip” philosophy has resonated with younger investors, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, who love a good underdog story. It’s become more than just an investment; it’s a movement. Whether you’re in it for the gains or the camaraderie, BTFD Coin ticks all the boxes. Mog Coin: The Silent Contender Mog Coin might not have the same flashy presale stats as BTFD Coin, but it’s quietly building a reputation as one of the best meme coins to join now. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and focus. Mog doesn’t try to do everything; instead, it focuses on being a meme coin with solid fundamentals. And sometimes, that’s all you need. What sets Mog apart is its transparency and straightforward approach. Unlike many meme coins that overpromise and underdeliver, Mog delivers exactly what it says on the tin: a fun, engaging crypto experience with the potential for big returns. Its community is tight-knit and supportive, creating an environment where holders feel like they’re part of something bigger. One of Mog’s standout features is its liquidity pool, designed to ensure long-term stability. While many meme coins suffer from extreme volatility, Mog has taken steps to reduce price swings and make its token more attractive to risk-averse investors.

Here Are They!,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-analyst-reveals-top-10-altcoins-poised-for-50x-returns-here-are-they/,"The post Crypto Analyst Reveals Top 10 Altcoins Poised for 50x Returns! Here Are They! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent YouTube video, crypto analyst Crypto Banter revealed top 10 altcoins that could soar up to 50x during this market rally. As excitement builds in the crypto space, these coins are drawing massive attention from investors eager for big gains. Here’s a breakdown of the top picks: DogWifhat (WIF): Aiming for 4X Returns First on the list is DogWifhat, which recently flipped a critical resistance level. Analysts predict a 400% surge, targeting the 3.1-3.168 Fibonacci extension. With $2 as the key support, a drop below this level could invalidate the bullish outlook. GOAT: Poised for a Breakout Next, we have GOAT, which reclaimed an essential trading range. The initial target is set at $0.998, with the potential to reach $1.33 and beyond. Bonk (BONK): Eyeing a Bullish Reversal Another token getting the spotlight is Bonk. After losing its range high, it’s cooling off but could surprise investors if it reclaims the 50% Fibonacci level. Brett: Testing New Highs Brett is also catching attention as it backtests its mid-range level. With a possible target of $0.57 (a 223% increase), it’s considered a standout pick for this cycle. Pepe: Staying Strong Pepe continues to outperform many meme coins like Dogecoin. While currently consolidating, its relative strength signals another potential leg up in the near term. Popcat: An Undervalued Gem Another hidden gem is Popcat, holding steady at its mid-range demand zone. Analysts see this as an ideal buying opportunity with significant upside potential in current market conditions. GigaChad: On the Path to Gains Next up is GigaChad, which has been charting a path toward a 280% gain. Currently, in a strong demand zone, it could soar to new ATH, especially with the possibility of a Coinbase listing. Myro: Testing Demand Zones Myro is another token worth watching as it tests key demand zones near $0.085, this entry point could lead to long-term gains. Aptos: Maintaining a Bullish Outlook Aptos has shown strength on the weekly charts, with a slight pullback expected before continuing its uptrend. Its overall trajectory remains positive for the near term. Render (RNDR): Ready for a Breakout Lastly, Render is forming a rounded bottom pattern and looks ready to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Breaking its $1.38 resistance could unlock significant upward movement, making it a token to watch closely. Top Gaming Coins To Pick Crypto Banter’s further analysis spotlighted on gaming coins with significant upside potential. Nakamoto Games (NAKA) is forming a rounded bottom and aims to reach $2.1. Additionally, Seedify.fund (SFUND) has reclaimed its mid-range, setting its sights on $280. Gala, however, needs to reclaim $0.063 to confirm a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, ApeCoin (APE) has broken out of a falling wedge, presenting a 136% potential move above $2. Vulcan Forged (PYR) and other gaming tokens are also expected to gain momentum during gaming rotations.

Its dynamic movements and potential for substantial returns are drawing renewed attention to the broader crypto space. Among the many tokens competing for investor interest, four altcoins to watch-MANTRA (OM), Minotaurus (MTAUR), XRP, and Shiba Inu (SHIB)-stand out as strong candidates for a significant rally. Below is a detailed price analysis for each, showcasing their potential to surge by over 200%. Altcoins to Watch for a Potential 200% Price Rally As Bitcoin trades above $100,000 OM, MTAUR, XRP and SHIB are altcoins to watch for potential 200 in gains. 1. MANTRA (OM): Bullish Outlook Targeted at $11.4 MANTRA’s recent performance has caught the eye of many investors, with its price showing a bull flag pattern, a technical indicator that signals a potential breakout. Reporting monthly gains of 177.13% to trade currently at $3.96, OM records a market cap of $3.74 billion. A consolidation phase between $3.50 and $4.20 suggests an imminent surge, supported by bullish indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 59 and a positive trend in the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Analysts predict a 230% rally if the price clears the resistance zone of $4.23–$4.53. According to Santiment data , OM has been experiencing reduced exchange supply and increasing interest from non-exchange wallets. This could propel the token to reach a conservative target of $11.40 in the near future. Source: Santiment 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): Altcoins to Watch Transforming the Gaming Industry Minotaurus (MTAUR) is an altcoin to watch for transforming the gaming world, by integrating blockchain technology with an engaging gaming experience. Central to this platform is the MTAUR token, created to unlock premium functionalities, allow avatar enhancements, and provide entry to exclusive game areas. This ecosystem links gamers and blockchain fans, fostering a dynamic and engaging community. The current presale presents a time-sensitive chance to obtain MTAUR tokens for 0.00006001 USDT, which is significantly lower than the expected listing price. The initiative has already raised more than 300,000 USDT, showcasing its increasing appeal among buyers preferring early-stage cryptocurrencies . Minotaurus guarantees a secure and transparent environment for its users through audits conducted by reputable firms such as SolidProof and Coinsult. In addition to the token, Minotaurus encourages its community by launching thrilling initiatives like referral and vesting programs, along with a substantial giveaway of 100,000 USDT. By promoting trust and engagement, the initiative is preparing for a revolutionary blockchain gaming experience. 3. XRP (XRP): Altcoins to Watch With a Bullish Breakout Despite XRP price dropping by 3.68% in the past day, the token earned investors and traders over 260% in profits, over the past 30 days. With a market value of $132.62 billion, XRP is on the cusp of breaking its all-time high (ATH) of $3.32, with analysts projecting a short-term target of $5 and a long-term surge to $18. Recent developments, including the approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and speculation about a potential IPO, fuel bullish sentiment. Technical indicators also suggest an uptrend, as XRP is creating a bullish flag pattern and sustaining strength above its 50-day moving average. A surge past $2.90 might elevate XRP to unprecedented levels, positioning it as an ideal contender for a parabolic surge, and one of ideal cryptos to buy for massive gains. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Analysts Predict 1,200% Surge Technical indicators show that Shiba Inu price recently rebounded from a solid support level at $0.0000240tha0, suggesting that a rally could soon happen. Metrics like the RSI (52.49) and a positive divergence in the MACD indicate increasing interest from buyers. Currently, SHIB has a market value of $16.42 billion, with monthly gains of nearly 17.91%, despite dropping in price by 5.12% over the past day, to trade today at $0.00002795. A possible rise above $0.00003100 might initiate a surge towards $0.00003800, as hopeful analysts predict a 1,200% increase in the long run. The persistent interest from investors in SHIB and its recovery trends bolster its optimistic forecast, positioning it as one of the promising meme coins to buy for significant gains. Final Thoughts These four altcoins to watch present compelling cases for significant price rallies in the coming weeks. MANTRA and XRP stand out for their strong technical setups and bullish fundamentals, while Minotaurus offers early entry opportunities with its gaming token presale. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to defy expectations with its vibrant community and recovery potential.

According to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence , a public data application that enables users to analyze blockchain and cryptocurrency activity, Trump’s holdings surged by $6.78 million in just one day as of December 13, 2024. But before you think Trump has fully embraced crypto as his new political weapon, there’s more to the story than meets the eye. Trump crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham Intelligence What’s in Trump’s digital wallet? Trump’s publicly known wallet holds a curious mix of assets, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Wrapped Ethereum ( WETH ), and a slew of meme tokens like TROG and TRUMP. Other smaller holdings include GUA, USDC, TUA, and RIO. On paper, it looks like a bold bet on everything from mainstream crypto to the wild world of internet humor. But don’t let the numbers fool you — not all if any of these tokens were necessarily purchased by Trump himself. In crypto, anyone can send tokens to any known wallet, whether invited or not. This means that while these coins are tied to Trump’s wallet, they haven’t been officially confirmed as his own investments. It’s a classic crypto stunt: creators send tokens to high-profile figures to boost their coin’s credibility. Sometimes, it’s a clever marketing move; other times, it’s just flat-out misleading. Crypto market is bullish on Trump The bulk of Trump’s portfolio is dominated by TROG, which clocks in at $10.49 million. The TRUMP token — yes, named after him — adds another $1.07 million to the mix. But just because these tokens live in his wallet doesn’t mean he’s cashing in on meme coin mania. Interestingly, Trump’s own stance on crypto has taken a turn. On December 12, he made his position clear: “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else, not just China but others, embracing it, and we want to be the head.” Trump seems to be ready to position the U.S. at the forefront of the crypto race, a shift from his previous skepticism.

On-chain data sparks hope,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wazirx-hack-victims-hope/,"The controversial WazirX hack that resulted in the theft of $235 million in crypto sparked discussion about security in the industry. Affected users are demanding robust measures as they are missing out on the selling opportunity amid the bull run. A $200 million fund movement from Binance and WazirX wallets had the crypto world buzzing. Some are suggesting that the world’s biggest crypto exchange might be stepping up to reimburse WazirX users. However, the hacked Indian crypto exchange has temporarily halted withdrawals and seems to be cooperating with authorities. Binance bailout or routine rebalancing? An on-chain Sleuth in an X post flagged $200 million moving to a wallet allegedly controlled by WazirX. This move has sparked theories of what might be a Binance-led bailout. In this pursuit, one user speculated a potential reimbursement deal and suggested “Funding from Binance, likely for equity or token-based compensation.” Others placed 95% odds on a reimbursement announcement. The on-chain investigator mentioned that WazirX consolidated user funds that were untouched during the hack into a wallet two months ago. The funds were shifted from the deposit addresses and hot wallets. It added that the same wallet (labeled 0x305) received $200 million in different tokens from the wallet 0xb03 which was funded by Binance wallets. Squashing all the anticipation and brewing all the conspiracy theories, the hacked exchange posted an asset rebalancing reminder. It highlighted that the exchange is in the process of rebalancing tokens. It added that the users might notice fund movement transactions of various cold wallets. 📢 Update on Asset Rebalancing We are currently in the process of rebalancing tokens.

Zettai Pte seeks creditor approval Zettai Pte Ltd, the parent entity of Zanmai Labs which operates WazirX in India, filed an application with the Singapore High Court on December 6, 2024.

Advisors from the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, are mulling the possibility of abolishing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Will Donald Trump Eliminate FDIC? Advisors from DOGE conducted interviews for roles in the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Besides, they also floated the idea of transferring the responsibilities of deposit insurance to the Treasury Department. However, such an overhaul would need Congressional approval and would be the first time in history that the US government is likely to abolish a legacy agency. On the other hand, bank executives are optimistic that President-elect Trump will roll back stringent regulations on capital requirements and consumer protections. However, some market analysts also believe that FDIC-backed deposit insurance is untouchable and “too big to fail”. While addressing the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, December 12, Donald Trump also said that he has big plans for the crypto market. In a brief interview with Jim Cramer, Trump said: “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else, not just China but others are embracing it, and we want to be the head”. The discussions reflect Donald Trump’s aggressive approach to cutting government size and easing oversight of the heavily regulated financial sector. As a result, his transition team comprising Elon Musk, Scott Bessent, and Vivek Ramaswamy, is reportedly considering merging the FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve nonmonetary functions, and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). On the other hand, crypto leaders like Brain Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, have voiced their opinion on the removal of anti-crypto regulators like Caroline Crenshaw from the Senate Banking Committee . Operation Choke Point, Industry Reactions, and Broader Implications Crypto industry leaders have been calling to eliminate regulators behind Operation Choke Point 2.0. Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini stated: “Eliminating the FDIC would bring us one step closer to ending the weaponization of the US banking system and preventing Operation Choke Point from ever happening again”. On Thursday, pro-crypto Rep. French Hill was chosen to head the House Financial Services Committee, with a focus on stablecoins and cryptocurrency regulations . Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair expressed skepticism about eliminating a bank regulator, noting that banks value maintaining relationships with specific agencies. Speaking to WSJ , she said: “We could use some streamlining on financial regulation. But it is really hard to get done. Banks may complain, but at the end of the day, they like to have their own regulator they have a relationship with. They like the status quo.” In a separate proposal, some transition team members have suggested maintaining only one primary banking regulator, with the others retaining non-regulatory functions. While the proposals signal Donald Trump’s willingness to shake up federal oversight, experts believe these radical changes face significant political and industry resistance.

After the retrace, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has steadily climbed back, recovering the $3,800 support zone on Wednesday afternoon. ETH’s price then rose another 2% in the early hours of Thursday to trade above the $3,900 level again. As Ethereum reclaimed this key zone, Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt noted that the cryptocurrency was trading back above its ascending support trendline, which it had lost during the market correction. Additionally, the King of Altcoins was retesting a six-day downtrend line in the 4-hour chart, which would target a surge toward $4,000 after a successful breakout from the $3,940 mark. Ethereum broke above this resistance in the following hours, surging to a daily high of $3,985 before retracing to $3,945. Per the analyst, holding above this level could propel ETH’s price to $4,100 in the coming days. ETH To $5,000 Soon? According to some analysts, despite reclaiming the $3,900 zone, Ethereum still needs to turn another multi-year resistance into support successfully. Analyst Alex Clay recently pointed out that ETH has been retesting the $9,350 level since 2021, unsuccessfully turning it into support over the past few years. Ethereum has faced rejection at this resistance level on four different occasions. However, when ETH broke and held this level, it rallied toward its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 around three years ago. Crypto analyst Jelle suggested that Ethereum is preparing for massive moves as it recently broke out of a multi-year pennant. ETH-based Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a massive surge since the post-election rally. As Farside Investors data shows, ETH ETFs have seen over $500 million in inflows this week and over $1.3 billion since this month started. This signals increased demand from institutional players, adding to the cryptocurrency’s momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm As Solana (SOL) Retests $210, Rebound Or Retrace Next? Moreover, the Donald Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI) acquired around $10 million in ETH yesterday. Lookonchain said the WLFI wallet bought 2,631 ETH at $3,801 per token. To Jelle, this “looks like ETH season just got the ‘go ahead’ nod from institutions.” If Ethereum reclaims the $3,950 resistance into support, there will be “very little standing in the way of new all-time highs from here,” the analyst added. He forecasted that Ethereum could hit $5,000 after breaking out and that 2025 will be a “comeback year for ETH.” As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,951, a 4.7% surge in the daily timeframe.

For the first time since 2016, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in new developer activity, attracting 7,625 fresh contributors compared to Ethereum’s 6,456. This rise marks an 83% year-over-year growth for the Solana ecosystem, with much of its momentum coming from increased adoption across Asia. Throughout the year, Solana managed to outpace Ethereum in key metrics, including network activity and daily fee generation during certain periods. Notably, on March 18, Solana’s network activity spiked amid a rush for Solana-based memecoins, and on October 28, it briefly outdid Ethereum in 24-hour fee generation. Ethereum Still Dominates in Total Developer Activity Despite losing its top spot for onboarding new developers, Ethereum remains the number one blockchain ecosystem in overall developer activity. The network recorded 6,244 active monthly developers in 2024, representing a 17% drop from the previous year. However, Ethereum continues to lead globally, with the highest number of active developers across all major continents, including Asia, Europe, and North America. Ethereum’s layer-2 networks also saw notable growth, with developer activity rising by 64% since 2021. Additionally, Eigenlayer, Ethereum’s primary restaking protocol, emerged as the fastest-growing ecosystem in 2024, with a staggering 167% increase in active developers. Crypto Broader Adoption Electric Capital’s report highlights that crypto development is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, with activity growing in regions like Africa, South America, and Asia. Asia now hosts one in three crypto developers worldwide, fueled by strong contributions from countries like India, which onboarded the most new developers in 2024. The report also underscores how different regions are driving various use cases. For instance, stablecoin transactions remain consistently active across Asian, European, and African time zones. Meanwhile, NFT trading activity peaks during American work hours, with minting activity predominantly occurring during Asia’s daytime.

The latest pledge forms part of the team’s mission to create a marketplace for “programmable trust” through its decentralized restaking protocol. Eigen Foundation’s 1% Token Pledge The Protocol Guild, which comprises over 180 members from 29 teams, plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum’s decentralized network. Its members focus on key areas such as client development, research, specification design, testing, and coordination. This ensures Ethereum’s continuous evolution and resilience against centralized capture. EigenLayer enables staked ETH to serve as cryptoeconomic security for other protocols, improving Ethereum’s security while supporting innovation. By dedicating a portion of its token supply to the Protocol Guild, the Eigen Foundation aligns its goals with the Guild’s mission of ensuring sustainable incentives for Ethereum’s maintainers. Its official statement read, “This commitment aligns with EigenLayer’s mission: To extend Ethereum’s security through restaking and creating a marketplace for programmable trust. We’re proud to contribute to Ethereum’s growth and long-term sustainability. The latest development comes after the Eigen Foundation announced the EIGEN Season 2 Stakedrop in September. This distribution initiative aimed at recognizing contributors and participants who have supported its development. The entity had then stated that the stakedrop would allocate EIGEN tokens across three categories: stakers and operators who actively participated during the season, ecosystem partners such as rollups and RaaS providers, and community members who have played a pivotal role in advocating for EigenLayer. A month later, EIGEN debuted on several exchanges in one of the most heavily discussed and anticipated token launches of 2024. EigenLayer’s Growth And Two Security Breaches Launched by Sreeram Kannan in early 2021, EigenLayer rose to prominence as a leading DeFi project in 2024, with over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL) as reported by DeFiLlama. However, EigenLayer suffered a $5.7 million hack involving stolen tokens sold via decentralized exchanges. The protocol faced another security breach on October 18 when its official X account was hacked . The attackers used the compromised account to advertise a fake airdrop campaign, directing users to malicious links disguised as part of the concluded Season 2 token distribution. On-chain investigator ZachXBT and Polygon Labs’ Mudit Gupta quickly warned users to avoid these links. Scam Sniffer later confirmed the phishing scheme.

The token recorded a significant 250% surge, signaling heightened investor confidence. Despite market corrections, Ripple continues to demonstrate resilience, maintaining its upward momentum. Analysts suggest this consolidation phase might precede another breakout, potentially driving Ripple toward the $4 level, making the holders rich. XRP Price Holders Could Reap Big Rewards With This Pattern Crypto analyst Ali recently shared a post on X highlighting potential bullish movements for XRP. According to Ali, XRP appears to be forming a bullish flag pattern, suggesting an upward trend in its price. However, he noted that the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart has presented a sell signal, which could point to a brief correction before any significant upward movement. Ali believes that XRP needs to break above the $2.46 resistance level to initiate a potential rally toward the $4 mark. The current chart analysis supports this prediction, showing a clear channel that may guide future price movements. Despite the bullish setup, traders should remain cautious of possible corrections in the short term. The market sentiment could shift depending on how XRP reacts to the $2.46 level. This pattern could make a big reward to XRP holders. Source: X Is XRP Price Ready For The Next Break Out? The XRP price has the potential to hit $4 as market dynamics, Ripple’s RLUSD launch and strategic partnerships fuel optimism. Currently, the value of XRP is trading at $2.29. The token has experienced a slight dip after a massive 251% rally in the past month. Broader crypto prices also support its rise, with Bitcoin surpassing $100K and Ethereum stabilizing near $3,800. Market enthusiasm continues to grow as Ripple’s strategic advancements and the evolving crypto landscape reinforce XRP’s status as a key player. If the bullish momentum continues, the altcoin price could surpass the resistance level at $2.50 and potentially hit $3. With sustained buying pressure, XRP could climb further to reach $4. However, if the bears take control, the price may fall below $2, creating a bearish sentiment in the market. The Relative Strength Index currently sits at 62, showing that XRP is no longer overbought but still leaning toward bullish territory. XRP Price Chart: TradingView XRP’s bullish momentum remains promising despite minor pullbacks. Breaking the $2.46 resistance is crucial for a rally toward $4. Traders should watch key levels closely as market dynamics, strategic developments, and investor confidence continue shaping XRP’s price trajectory.

The platform raised $250M in a private sale, backed by some of the top VC funds. Avalanche (AVAX) extended its relationship with top VC funds, aiming to transform itself from a L2 chain and run an independent new L1. The most recent funding round for $250M was completed as a private placement with some of the leading investors in decentralized projects. The funding was completed after an OTC sale, and was led by DragonFly Capital, Galaxy, and ParaFi Capital. The OTC placement reached up to 40 smaller companies and investors, some seeking to use the services of Avalanche as their native platform. Avalanche achieved its single biggest financing round for $250M. | Source: Cryptorank Since its launch, Avalanche raised more than $577M, including four ICO events, a seed round, and additional undisclosed funding. The recent fundraising effort is the single largest capital injection for Avalanche. Avalanche raised the funds as an addition to its track record of successful funding. The goal is to support the Avalanche9000 upgrade, a new chain that has been tested since the end of November. Avalanche aims to rebrand from Web3 gaming network Avalanche forged its success as one of the leading networks for Web3 and gaming. Avalanche C-Chain was the consumer-oriented L2 network, which carried some of the hottest play-to-earn games. C-Chain was also compatible with DeFi, DEX trading, and general Web3 activities. As a result, Avalanche still retains $1.64B in locked liquidity, though still far from the 2021 levels of over $10B. One of the big obstacles to building on Avalanche was the deposit requirement to build a subnet. Subnets were a technology that proved successful for some of the early Avalanche projects. Games or web projects would launch a subnet when their activity overwhelmed the capacity of C-Chain. Avalanche now aims to build a practically free layer, similar to SUI or Aptos. Previously, subnet builders had to stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX. Instead of a gaming network, Avalanche9000 will aim to position itself as a tokenization hub, with a focus on Web3 and DeFi. The new L1 will aim to retain some of the successful apps from C-Chain, including DEX and GameFi projects. The funding round arrived just days before the intended launch of Avalanche9000. The chain has already onboarded up to 150K potential users and 40K routers in preparation for its December 16 launch. The chain has already partnered with Uplink, a startup for decentralized connectivity, which will build on the new L1. Can AVAX recover to a higher range? AVAX was among the most promising L2 tokens, and the project is one of the best-funded in the Web3 space. However, during the bear market, Avalanche C-Chain lagged behind Arbitrum and Optimism . AVAX is also carrying a backlog of locked tokens, with only 57% of the supply in circulation. Almost all ecosystem participants and early VC backers will continue to unlock their allocation over the next few years. As a result, AVAX spend years trading under $20. The asset was considered a potential competitor to Solana, though it only expanded above $100 for a brief period. In late 2024, AVAX had another rally to a local high of $55.30. AVAX is close to the top 10 of coins and tokens, gaining additional exposure from its recent market rally. AVAX open interest has also recovered above $480M, near the peak of the range for the past three years. The additional exposure from Avalanche9000 and the hype around the main net launch may boost AVAX, as it has shown the ability to outperform. Avalanche C-Chain receives $100M of inflows mainly from Ethereum, with around 7% of that bridged amount in stablecoins. Due to its relatively early launch in 2019, Avalanche is also one of the few chains with 1.6B in native Tether (USDT). As a L1 network, Avalanche may offer additional RWA tokenization to some of its partners. The Avalanche Project is actively curated by the Avalanche Foundation. In the past, the Avalanche team has also worked as an incubator for Web3 projects and games. After the launch of the L1 network, Avalanche may retain some of its top projects.

The report highlights a paradigm shift in the memecoins, which have evolved from short-term speculative assets to a sophisticated market with a total capitalization exceeding $100 billion. The memecoins market has demonstrated significant growth in 2024, with the Benchmark index surging 279.8%, outperforming assets like Bitcoin (118.9%) and gold (27.4%). This growth reflects not merely speculative interest, but a fundamental transformation in how memecoins are perceived and valued in the crypto industry. This notable market expansion has been fueled by two game-changing developments: breakthroughs in infrastructure and an explosion in memecoins cultural diversity. The emergence of specialized platforms like Pump.fun has dramatically simplified memecoins creation and trading, sustaining market momentum throughout this cycle. In this flourishing landscape, Solana and Ethereum have become the go-to destinations for memecoins. Ethereum remains the bedrock for established memecoins, and Solana has become the platform for new launches due to its agility in capturing market momentum. The numbers speak volumes: the market capitalization of Ethereum’s memecoins reached $34 billion, and Solana’s at $20.4 billion. Together, they account for nearly 47% of the total memecoin market. Alongside infrastructure advancement, the diversification of memecoins culture has emerged as another powerful market driver. These memecoins generally fall into four main types: Cult memecoins built on strong community consensus; the Animal memecoins that started it all; Trending event memecoins that capture hype; and the AI-themed memecoins that combine technology. Notably, these categories have begun to overlap as the market matures, creating more sophisticated memecoins narratives. This maturation has sparked a dramatic shift in market sentiment. What began as a retail-driven phenomenon has gained institutional traction, with major players like DWF Ventures, Pantera Capital, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck embracing the value of memecoins and adopting a more open attitude toward the memecoins market. Cryptocurrency exchanges have pivoted in response, racing to capture the memecoins market. In the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency exchanges, LBank cryptocurrency exchange has shown strong performance in the memecoins market through strategic timing and efficient execution. The numbers reflect this approach: with 281 memecoins listings in 2024 accounting for 34% of its total listings, followed by Gate.io (62) and Bitget (46). Notably, all top 10 trending memecoins identified in LBank's previous "" Top 10 Trending Memecoins of 2024 "" report were successfully listed on the platform. The performance of GOAT (29,900%), MOODENG (6,746%), and ACT (7,860%) on LBank reflect its ability to identify and support promising projects at their earliest stages. Analysis of major meme projects reveals LBank's competitive positioning in the market. While established exchanges like Binance and OKX command larger trading volumes, LBank's strategy of early listing and active support has created significant value for traders. This is particularly evident in projects like GOAT and MOODENG, where LBank's early market entry and trading metrics have matched or exceeded those of larger exchanges, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and supporting emerging projects. LBank's strategic focus on the memecoins market has proven effective, contributing to its milestone achievement of reaching 15 million global users. The launch of its slogan ""Discover The Era of Meme Legends"" in early 2024 has resonated strongly with the market evolution. As memecoins continue to mature, LBank cryptocurrency exchange remains committed to its strategic approach, introducing innovative initiatives and fostering market development to drive the next phase of industry growth. About LBank Founded in 2015, LBank is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, serving over 15 million registered users in more than 210 countries and regions. With a daily derivatives trading volume of more than $67 billion and support for over 800 cryptocurrencies, LBank is committed to delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly trading experience.

The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Ethereum’s Upward Momentum Tests Key Resistance Levels Ethereum is currently trading between $3643.14 and $4232.62, showing strong momentum with a 16.52% increase over the past month. The cryptocurrency is approaching its nearest resistance level at $4457.83. Technical indicators like the MACD at 57.06 suggest bullish momentum, but the RSI at 70.90 and Stochastic at 91.50 indicate overbought conditions. If the upward trend continues, Ethereum could potentially rise to the second resistance level at $5047.32, representing an increase of about 19%. However, if the price fails to break the resistance, it may retrace to the nearest support level at $3278.88. Conclusion In the midst of the 2024 bull run, established assets like Ethereum may offer less short-term potential compared to emerging platforms.

Its debt-financed bitcoin purchase strategy was tremendously successful. Now, the total value of its BTC holdings stands at $42,450,183,305. Reports indicate that MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael J. Saylor’s BTC purchase strategy has inspired prominent Bitcoin mining companies, including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. Let’s explore. MicroStrategy’s Influence on Bitcoin Mining Companies Reports say that Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are preparing to issue convertible notes to purchase Bitcoin. What this indicates is that these mining companies are planning to shift from traditional mining to accumulating Bitcoin for long-term gains. MARA currently has around 40,435 BTC, worth $4,051,630,265, and RIOT holds at least 10,019 BTC, valued at $1,003,914,520. MicroStrategy has almost turned completely into a bitcoin treasury company. It has successfully executed the debt-financed bitcoin purchase strategy. Since November 5, the MSTR price has surged by over 71.71%. Challenges for MARA and RIOT Firstly, as MARA and RIOT are majorly mining companies, the latest Bitcoin halving event considerably reduced what they could earn from their business activities. Secondly, mining is now a highly competitive business. Reports indicate that MARA and RIOT face tough competition. Finally, both are not as compelling as MicroStrategy in terms of stock performance. This year, MSTR has grown by over 474.13%, while MARA and RIOT have declined by over -1.5% and -19.88%, respectively. Recently, activist investor Starboard Value advised Riot to diversify their business activities, suggesting it to reduce reliance on Bitcoin mining. Debt-Financed Bitcoin Strategy: Concerns of Investors Interestingly, Riot’s convertible notes issuance has a lower premium than MicroStrategy’s. However, not many experts support the debt-financed bitcoin strategy. Some strongly question the long-term viability of the strategy. Reports suggest that many want mining companies to increase Bitcoin holdings originally rather than rely on the debt strategy. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy inspires others but faces scrutiny. With RIOT and MARA adopting similar tactics, the success of these strategies remains uncertain.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 09:57:30

Crypto ETFs offer exposure by investing directly in the assets and/or companies involved in the digital economy. Crypto has been considered a higher-risk investment. Yet, as more regulatory acceptance is achieved, exposure to crypto may offer investors an opportunity to capitalize on the growth of digital assets. Three crypto-focused ETFs, with an average one-year return of +146%, possess incredible momentum and offer investors exposure to a diverse range of crypto and crypto-linked assets. Based on SA’s Quant Ratings, these ETFs possess incredible momentum. Christmas Comes Early for Crypto Fans Every year, investors hope for a 'Santa Claus Rally' – the historical (but never guaranteed) phenomenon in which the stock market jolts in value during the last week of December and the first few trading days of the new year. Cryptocurrency holders need not wait. Christmas has come early for crypto enthusiasts as the presidential victory of Donald Trump, who has pledged to make America “the crypto capital of the planet,” has sent the prices of digital coins soaring. According to crypto data provider CoinGecko, the global cryptocurrency market's value eclipsed $3T for the first time in three years last month, as investors rejoiced at the potential of easing regulatory restrictions on the industry in U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to an all-time high of over $100,000 on December 5, topping only its previous record from the day after election day. The Total Market Value of All Cryptocurrencies Exploded in November Seeking Alpha Premium Meanwhile, the resignation of SEC chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump plans to replace with crypto bull Paul Atkins, is set to shift the balance of power at the securities watchdog to a Republican majority – another reason for Wall Street to celebrate as Trump taps financiers like hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as Treasury pick. Regardless of how many crypto campaign promises Trump manages to keep, many analysts believe that crypto’s bull run will continue well into 2025. One such expert is Geoff Kendrick, head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, who recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of next year. Digital assets could offer an opportunity for investors looking to gain in a unique space achieving more regulatory acceptance “fairly quickly.” Investing in Cryptocurrency As Bitcoin and other digital currencies benefit from the global artificial intelligence push and crypto gains regulatory acceptance, investors wanting some exposure to the space may want a more accessible solution than navigating the complex universe of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. Crypto ETFs, which track the performance of one or more digital currencies and are traded on traditional stock exchanges, which can help with some of the regulatory risks associated with trading on unregulated crypto exchanges, though market risk is still involved. Some key features of crypto ETFs include: Accessibility - Crypto ETFs are traded like stocks on traditional exchanges and can therefore be accessed through brokerage accounts. Regulation - Trading through traditional exchanges offers greater regulation by financial authorities than directly holding crypto, subject to less security and oversight. Diversification - ETFs often include multiple cryptocurrencies and holdings, offering diversification rather than single-asset investments. Seeking Alpha’s Quant ETF Grades are generated by a proprietary system that aims to provide investors with an instant characterization of each ETF. The SA quant system grades organize the market’s Top ETFs by five factors: Momentum, Expenses, Dividends, Risk, and Liquidity. Key ETF metrics are systematically gathered and compared to the median of all ETFs, then assigned a grade from A+ to F. Investors can also use advanced filters to view various ETF asset classes and subclasses, including digital assets. Cryptocurrency-focused ETFs invest directly in digital assets or indirectly in miners and stocks involved in crypto. Although crypto ETFs have strong momentum, investors should realize they are also highly volatile, as demonstrated by their ‘F’ Risk Grades, and subject to expenses, which typically include management fees, custodian charges for holding the fund’s assets, and fees and expenses from fund administrators, auditors, etc. Seeking Alpha Premium The SA Quant Team identified three ETFs that expose investors to a wide range of crypto assets. All of them have ‘Strong Buy’ or ‘Buy’ ratings and excellent momentum, evidenced by a market-crushing average one-year price performance of +146%.

Let’s dive into the first ETF. 1. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF Assets ((AUM)): $1.44B Quant Rating: Strong Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 12/12/24): 2 out of 257 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 12/12/24): 2 out of 38 Ranked number two in both the Alternative asset class and Digital sub class, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF offers a diversified mix of 10 crypto holdings .

Seeking Alpha Premium 3. CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF Assets ((AUM)): $236.73M Quant Rating: Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 12/12/24): 17 out of 258 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 12/12/24): 17 out of 38 CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF invests in the B itcoin mining industry. Bitcoin mining is an interesting option for investors looking to back the cryptocurrency industry without direct exposure to Bitcoin itself. The fund invests in nine companies , with more than 50% of its portfolio concentrated within its top four holdings: IREN Ltd, Core Scientific Inc, Cipher Mining Inc, and Cleanspark Inc. WGMI Holdings (as of 12/11/24) Seeking Alpha Premium Up 123.62% over the past 12 months and making SA’s list of Best-Performing Actively Managed ETFs , WGMI has consistently charted strong total return and price performance, contributing to its ‘A+’ Momentum Score . WGMI also demonstrates strong liquidity , with an average daily dollar volume of 12.36M, 778.23% higher than the sector median of 1.4m, and an average daily share volume of 512.52K, a noteworthy 1,316.45% higher than the 36.18K sector median. While all three of these ETFs make for compelling choices according to SA’s Quant system, investing in crypto comes with serious risks that every investor should consider. Risks While 2025 will inevitably be an exciting year for cryptocurrency, it is important to consider the risks involved, as these assets are highly volatile and can often be extremely speculative. The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy “ continues to urge investors to be cautious if considering an investment involving crypto asset securities.” Where mainstream adoption has catapulted many digital assets to new highs, as Seeking Alpha analyst Joseph Calhoun said , “In today's wild west of finance, even conservative investors can get taken,"" so always invest knowing the possibility that your holdings could decline swiftly and without warning. Concluding Summary Cryptocurrencies have seen historic growth in recent months, with more rallying forecasted as a crypto-friendly regulatory regime prepares to take up residency in Washington D.C. Three crypto-focused ETFs, hand-selected using SA’s Quant ratings provide investors with exposure to a diverse range of digital assets through direct investments or investments in companies involved in the broader crypto economy.

Unlike traditional stablecoins like USDT or USDC, USDe is designed as a yield-generating asset rather than just a transaction tool. USDe has quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, with its trading volume jumping by over 24% in a single day to $171.09 million. This shows a strong demand for yield-generating assets, especially in a bullish market. With a $200B market cap, stablecoins are here to change the crypto game. JUST IN: ETHENA LABS HINTS AT LAUNCHING ITS NEW STABLECOIN, USDE, PEGGED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, ON DEC. 16 — BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) December 13, 2024 Let’s see what makes it so appealing. What Makes USDe Different? USDe’s innovative model sets it apart from typical fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead of relying on reserves, it uses a delta-neutral trading strategy, balancing long and short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum to maintain stability. This strategy has helped USDe become the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, surpassing DAI in market cap. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this model, especially in a bear market. On the brighter side, Wintermute now uses it for trading, and it’s become the fastest-growing asset on Aave, a major DeFi platform. Ethena made $200 million in fees this year and is sharing some of that with token holders. Meanwhile, its native token, ENA, has jumped in value by five times since June. However, competitors like MakerDAO, which recently rebranded its stablecoin Dai to USDS, are adding pressure. Analyst Raises Doubts Despite its success, experts have raised concerns about USDe’s resilience, and security concerns. Andre Cronje, CTO of Fantom Foundation, has warned that USDe’s model might only work well in bullish markets. If market conditions turn bearish, the funding rates could drop, reducing yields and potentially destabilizing the coin. This has drawn comparisons to the collapse of Terra-Luna in 2022, which also struggled to maintain its peg during market downturns. Looking Ahead While USDe offers attractive returns and innovative strategies, its long-term stability is yet to be tested in volatile or bearish markets. The crypto community is watching closely to see if Ethena Labs can sustain USDe’s growth and avoid the pitfalls faced by previous high-yield stablecoins.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FTM|MARKET|TRADING|ENA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 10:01:58

By combining a decentralized cloud network with a scarcity-driven tokenomics model, NXQ offers a secure, growth-oriented investment opportunity inspired by the principles that propelled Bitcoin’s success. Understanding the Project NexQloud provides a decentralized cloud infrastructure that outperforms traditional data centers on cost, efficiency, and security. Instead of relying on energy-hungry facilities, NexQloud uses QloudNodes—specialized devices set up by contributors—to create a secure, distributed cloud network. This model significantly reduces costs for businesses while enhancing data security and environmental sustainability. NXQ Tokens: The Backbone of NexQloud NXQ Tokens are rewarded to hardware contributors who power NexQloud’s network. As NexQloud generates revenue from cloud services sold to enterprise clients, that revenue is used to buy NXQ Tokens on the open market. This creates an organic and recurring demand cycle. The more successful NexQloud becomes, the greater the demand for NXQ Tokens, benefiting token holders through potential price appreciation. Tokenomics: Built for Long-Term Value NXQ’s value proposition lies in its scarcity and utility. With a total supply capped at 21 million tokens and a daily distribution of 3600 tokens to contributors, NXQ operates on a deflationary model. Every four years, the token distribution rate is halved, mirroring Bitcoin’s halving mechanism. This structured reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand from enterprise customers, sets the stage for steady, long-term growth. How Demand Drives Value NXQ Tokens are more than a speculative asset. As NexQloud’s client base expands, businesses require more NXQ Tokens to access cloud services. As they consume more computing resources, token demand rises. With new QloudNodes coming online and competing for daily token distribution, the scarcity effect intensifies, further driving value. Investment Potential NXQ’s real-world utility, backed by the growth of NexQloud’s cloud platform, makes it a compelling investment for hardware providers and crypto speculators. Unlike many tokens that rely purely on hype, NXQ is tied to a profitable, enterprise-driven model, providing investors with confidence in the token’s long-term prospects. The balance of supply and demand ensures that NXQ’s value is both sustainable and growth-oriented. Secure Your Investment in the Future NXQ Tokens offer a unique blend of security, scarcity, and real-world utility. As NexQloud’s network continues to grow, the potential for token appreciation remains strong. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this innovative cloud and crypto revolution. Buy NXQ Tokens on P2B today and position yourself for Bitcoin-level growth with maximum security.

However, selling pressure forced BTC below $100,000, with the cryptocurrency down 1.24% and trading at $99,750. The crash earlier in the week liquidated over 100,000 traders, leading to a total of $298.5 million in total liquidations. The crypto market cap, which registered a dramatic increase when markets recovered, is down by 1.33% and currently sits at $3.6 trillion. Most cryptocurrencies have started the day in the red, with Ethereum (ETH) down marginally and trading just below $4,000. Solana (SOL) is down by 1.36% and trading at $227, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 2% and trading at $0.408. Notable declines have also been registered by Cardano (ADA) , Shiba Inu (SHIB), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT). However, Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have defied the broader market, registering gains of 5.97% and 10.90%. Japanese Lawmaker Proposes National Bitcoin Reserve A Japanese lawmaker has asked the government to create a national Bitcoin reserve, following similar calls by lawmakers in Argentina and Russia. Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, made the proposal. Hamada presented a written request to the Japanese government regarding the creation of a reserve for cryptocurrencies. The lawmaker pointed out similar plans have been proposed in Brazil and the United States, where Treasury officials could hold Bitcoin (BTC) as a strategic reserve. The lawmaker asked the government to consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies like BTC. Hamada pointed out that BTC is less susceptible to the influence of countries and institutions, and its neutrality and decentralized nature allow it to support economic activity without relying on a specific currency. The government will present Hamada with a written response, which is also likely to be published on its website. Oddo To Enter Stablecoin Market With Fireblocks Asset manager and private banking services provider Oddo is collaborating with Fireblocks to crack the stablecoin market. The project will launch as early as next year. Stablecoins have become popular among traders thanks to their low volatility. The project comes after Societe Generale SA’s crypto asset unit in France, which uses the euro-dominated stablecoin (EUR). Ethereum (ETH) Could Catapult Beyond $5,000 The crypto markets have bounced back after experiencing a spate of liquidations during the week. However, none have rebounded as strongly as Ethereum (ETH). The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is on the brink of moving past $4,000, a key resistance level, and is up almost 24$ over the past month, with its gains surpassing even BTC. An analyst from Nexo predicted ETH could cross $5,000 as early as 2025 and set a new all-time high. “The cogs and bolts are in place. Ethereum could catapult beyond $5,000 as early as 2025.” Some analysts believe ETH has an edge because it is the only token other than BTC with a US-based ETF. “ETH has a big advantage in that it’s the only token besides BTC to have a US ETF. As traditional investors allocate more to crypto they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Trump Believes US Is Going To Do Something Great With Crypto President-elect Donald Trump has said the US will do great things with crypto during his upcoming term and become the global leader for cryptocurrency in the next four years. Trump made the comments in response to a question about setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve, stating, “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else. But others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” Trump’s views on crypto are a welcome change for the industry and investors from the current administration, which led a crackdown on the industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) went above the $100,000 mark again late on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $102,507. The jump came after the release of November's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came along expected lines. The data reinforced optimism about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut next week. However, BTC couldn't maintain its momentum for long, as it dipped below $100,000 and is currently trading around the $99,900 mark. BTC’s latest price action marks a strong recovery from the market crash earlier in the week when BTC dipped below $95,000. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered a substantial price drop. However, BTC’s recovery following the crash also led to a recovery in the broader market, with prominent altcoins notching up double-digit gains. ETFs registered record-breaking inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares ETFs accounting for a staggering $3.2 billion. Now, let’s take a look at BTC’s price chart. BTC set a new all-time high last week as it surged past $100,000 and peaked at $103,900. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price plummeted, falling to a low of $92,279 before settling at $97,094. However, the price picked up on Friday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $99,695. Buyers retained control over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising by 1.32% to go above $100,000 and settle at $101,043. However, selling pressure increased significantly on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, BTC dropped by 3.57%, going below the 20-day SMA to a low of $94,185. However, buyers propped up the price from this level, and it recovered to settle at $97.434. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC dropped to a low of $94,313 before settling at $96,912, registering a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC recovered, rising over 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,900. Buyers pushed BTC to an intraday high of $102,530 on Thursday before losing momentum. As a result, sellers drove BTC down by 0.97% as it slipped below $100,000 and settled at $99,923. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers take control, BTC could attempt to reclaim $100,000 and push toward its all-time high. Surpassing this level could push BTC to $105,000. If sellers take control, BTC could drop to $97,000 before finding support. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery over the past few sessions as it looks to go above the resistance at $4,000. However, it faces an uphill task to overcome this level, with sellers active. ETH faced considerable volatility last Thursday, which saw the price rise to an intraday high of $3,957 and drop to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787. However, it recovered strongly on Friday as ETH rose almost 6% to move above $4,000 and settled at $4,003. The weekend saw a tussle between buyers and sellers, and ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday to drop below $4,000 and settle at $3,999. However, buyers pushed ETH above $4,000 on Sunday as it settled at $4,007 after a marginal increase. Source: TradingView The current week began with a substantial increase in bearish sentiment as ETH dropped over 7%, reaching an intraday low of $3,504 before reclaiming $3,700 and settling at $3,719. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dipped to a low of $3,519 before ultimately settling at $3,630, registering a decline of 2.32%. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as ETH made a strong recovery, rising almost 6% to go above $3,800 and settling at $3,834. Buyers attempted a move past $4,000 on Thursday. However, ETH lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $3,988 and settled at $3,882, registering an increase of 1.26%. The current session sees ETH up just over 1% as it looks to retest the resistance at $4,000. Some analysts are confident ETH will surpass $4,000 and possibly surge beyond $5,000 as early as 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s struggles to go above the 20-day SMA continue as sellers repelled another attempt to go above it. SOL has witnessed considerable volatility as buyers struggle to push toward $250 and sellers look to lower the price. SOL reached an intraday high of $246 last Friday as it briefly went past the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum, and SOL ultimately settled at $237, registering only a marginal increase. The weekend was mixed as SOL registered a marginal rise on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to end the weekend on a bearish note. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure intensified considerably on Monday as SOL plummeted 8.55%, falling to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $203. However, buyers propped up the price, and SOL ultimately settled at $213 after a drop of 1.47%. Despite considerable bearish sentiment, SOL recovered on Wednesday, rising over 6% and settling at $227. Buyers attempted to go above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as SOL reached an intraday high of $234. However, they lost momentum in the face of selling pressure at this level, and SOL fell back, dropping to $227 and registering a marginal decline. Sellers have retained control during the current session, with SOL down 1.51% and trading at $223. If sellers retain control, SOL could drop to $215. If this level is breached, the price could drop to $200. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) declined considerably during the week, as selling pressure registered a notable increase, and bearish sentiment dominated the market. TAO was bullish towards the end of last week, rising to an intraday high of $725 on Friday before settling at $705, registering an increase of almost 4%. However, momentum waned on Saturday as TAO dropped 0.95%, falling below $700 and settling at $699. In a sign of things to come, the price fell to an intraday low of $675 on Sunday before recovering to register an increase of 2.03% and go above $700 to settle at $713. Source: TradingView Markets collapsed on Monday and TAO plummeted almost 16%, going below the 20-day SMA and 50-day SMA to drop to a low of $504. However, with buyers active at lower levels, the price recovered partially and settled at $600. Sellers continued to dominate the market on Tuesday as TAO dropped over 4% to settle at $575, but not before recovering from a low of $529. Wednesday witnessed a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and TAO registered an increase of 4.34% and settled at $600. Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Thursday as TAO reached an intraday high of $645. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take over. As a result, TAO dropped almost 4% to $577. The current session sees TAO down by 1.32%, as sellers look to lower the price toward the $550 support level. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) was quite bullish towards the end of the previous week as it registered an increase of 7.31% on Friday and settled at $8.84. However, It failed to stay above the resistance at $9 as sellers drove the price lower. As a result, TIA dropped over 4% on Saturday and 1.11% on Sunday to end the weekend at $8.37. Bearish sentiment increased substantially on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, TIA plummeted over 20%, going below the 20-day SMA, and settled at $6.68. Source: TradingView Tuesday saw a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, TIA rose to an intraday high of $7.31 and fell to an intraday low of $6.24 before settling at $6.64 after a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as TIA registered an increase of 8.49% to go above $7 and settle at $7.20. Buyers attempted to drive TIA above $7.50 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $7.65. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $7.20. The current session sees TIA down by almost 1% as sellers look to drive it towards $7. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) has recovered during recent sessions after plummeting below $1 at the beginning of the week. ARB reached an intraday high of $1.24 on Friday before settling at $1.13. However, sentiment changed over the weekend, dropping by 0.89% on Saturday and 0.43% on Sunday to settle at $1.15. Bearish sentiment increased significantly on Monday as ARB plummeted over 17%, going below the 20-day SMA to an intraday low of $0.84. However, it recovered from this level to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.96. Selling pressure persisted on Tuesday as ARB went below the 20-day SMA after a drop of just over 2% and settled at $0.93. Source: TradingView Despite considerable selling pressure, ARB recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 6.51% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.99. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ARB surged to an intraday high of $1.11. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $1.02, registering an increase of almost 3%. The current session sees ARB up by 2.57% and trading at $1.05 as buyers look to consolidate above $1. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis Hedera (HBAR) is attempting to reclaim $0.30 after suffering a dramatic collapse at the beginning of the week. Sentiment around HBAR changed over the weekend as it dropped almost 10% on Saturday after failing to go above $0.40. The price registered a marginal increase on Sunday before falling back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 16% to an intraday low of $0.236 before settling at $0.280. Despite starting the week on a negative note, HBAR recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 3.33% after falling to an intraday low of $0.252 and settling at $0.289. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as HBAR registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $0.298.

In this, BlackRock, a multinational management corporation, has played a major role with the IBIT ETFs and ETHA ETFs inflows that have brought the world’s attention to the Exchange Traded Funds. However, despite the demand and success with these, the firm is holding back on other crypto ETFs, and there is a simple but serious reason behind that. BlackRock Executive Revealed ‘Why No New Crypto ETFs’ BlackRock has a 99.9% ETF approval rate, and because of this, investors and delegates have demanded a few more altcoin ETFs. However, the firm is likely to put a hold on that, as they have focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. The senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchuna, revealed this through a recent X post, sharing a statement of Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs, BlackRock. As per the post, the firm is just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they need to explore and develop more with these ETFs. More importantly, Jay claimed that only a fraction of the clients own IBIT and ETHA. As a result, they are more focused on improving that instead of new crypto ETFs. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 BlackRock’s approach to holding on to further Crypto ETFs has also received appreciation from investors. One commented on the post, saying that a step-by-step approach is better, as launching a new ETF too soon will only exacerbate volatility. A step-by-step approach is much better for crypto in general. Launching new ETF too quickly will only exacerbate volatility more and not bring an educated adoption of crypto. In contrast, Bitwise has recently filed for 10 Crypto Index ETFs with US SEC , bringing the adoption to a new level. Bitcoin and ETFs Days Long Imports Making Waves With the Bitcoin ETFs receiving massive success, the ETF demand has grown impressively. In November alone, global investors contributed $204.6B to global ETFs collectively. The iShares report claims that this is almost three-quarters of the money that has gone to U.S. equity funds. This is a clear representation of the demand for these exchange-traded funds among investors who are looking for secure investment options. At present, the spot Bitcoin ETF is in net inflows for 11 days, gaining $598M on December 12, per Coingalss data. Even in this, IBIT contributed $432M, bringing the total net asset of Bitcoin ETF to $112.546 billion. Interestingly, the spot Ethereum ETF is also on the same track. It is in net inflows for 14 consecutive days, bringing $274M on December 12, 2024. In this, ETHA received $202M, hitting ETH ETF milestones over time. With that, demand for altcoin ETFs like Solana, XRP, and Shiba Inu is also high. The popular ETF launcher white label Tidal’s, Mike Venuto revealed that they often witness people pitching random exchange-traded fund ideas like ‘bitcoin + something else’ ETFs.” Interestingly, he also revealed that every thinkable option strategy will soon be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming” – Mike Venuto of Tidal. BlackRock Set Slow Pace For Crypto ETFs BlackRock has probably decided to implement a cautious approach for the new crypto ETFs as they wish to go for sustainable growth and educated adoption. As per Bloomberg analyst’s revelation, the firm is focusing on currently established Spot ETFs like Bitcoin and Ethereum rather than expanding to more altcoin ETFs. This decision has also received investors’ support as people wish to see broader financial stability rather than volatility. More importantly, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF’s success has led to increased demand for more launches, revealing the impact these two have created on investors and Bitcoin price , currently nearing the $100K mark.
