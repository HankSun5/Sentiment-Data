You might also like: DOGE, PEPE, XYZ: Analyzing the leader of the 2025 meme coin race Cardano Cardano is a big name in the world of cryptocurrencies. It’s a flexible and scalable platform designed for smart contracts. This means developers can build apps, tokens, and games on its blockchain. The native coin of Cardano is ADA. Like Ethereum’s ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and support the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being environmentally friendly. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which saves energy compared to other methods that use lots of power. The crypto market is paying attention to green technologies. Thus, Cardano’s eco-friendly approach gives it an edge over other coins. Additionally, its unique design allows for fast transactions, possibly up to a million per second. This is much quicker than many other blockchains. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and smart contracts, ADA could become even more important. While the market keeps changing, Cardano’s strong technology and focus on sustainability make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Toncoin Toncoin is the digital currency of The Open Network (TON), an open-source blockchain aiming for fast, secure payments with low fees. Initially developed by Telegram as the ‘Gram’ token for the Telegram Open Network, the project was halted in 2020 due to legal issues with the SEC. Since then, the non-profit TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over. The network uses proof-of-stake, enhancing its scalability and reliability. TON is building a full ecosystem with decentralized storage services, domain names, private networking, and efficient payment systems. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows great potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate Toncoin could reach up to $30.30 by 2025, a significant increase from today’s price. In the current market, where fast and secure payment solutions are in demand, Toncoin’s technology could make it stand out. Its focus on a comprehensive ecosystem and minimal fees might attract more users. Conclusion While ADA and TON are solid, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for 20,000% growth in the 2024 bull run.

According to reports, the move comes with a clear caveat: tax exemptions will not be part of the package. This development was revealed by Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum recently hosted by Ekonomichna Pravda. Crypto Legalisation Timeline and Legislative Progress Hetmantsev announced that a draft law, developed in close collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is nearing completion. He mentioned that the draft is expected to be ready after the New Year, and the crypto legalization will be passed after that. This draft law builds on a milestone in November 2023, when Ukraine’s parliament introduced legislation on taxing virtual asset transactions. The passage of this new bill will mark the final step in creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. Similarly, Russia recently introduced a new crypto bill that focuses on crypto transactions. The bill aims to regulate digital assets and ensure compliance with financial laws. If Ukraine legalizes crypto in 2025, it will join countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. These nations have embraced virtual assets and implemented rules to manage risks and ensure compliance with tax and financial laws. The Taxation Model: No Special Privileges While legalizing digital assets is a significant move, the absence of tax exemptions reflects a cautious and practical approach. According to Hetmantsev, profits from crypto will be taxed under the same model applied to securities. Taxes will only be levied when assets are converted into traditional currency. This cautious approach aligns with international best practices, ensuring digital assets do not create loopholes in Ukraine’s tax system. Many countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Germany, have adopted a similarly cautious approach to the taxation of digital assets. Ukraine in the Crypto Space Ukraine has been a prominent player in the global crypto landscape, making consistent strides toward integrating digital assets into its economy. In 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” law , which provided a legal definition for cryptocurrencies and recognized them as an asset class. This law laid the groundwork for the current efforts toward full-scale legalization. Also, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has actively collaborated with international blockchain companies and tech giants to develop a robust digital economy. During the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine embraced crypto donations. This move showcased the practical utility of digital assets during crises. The initiative raised millions to support defense and humanitarian efforts. As the first quarter of 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on Ukraine as it navigates the challenges and opportunities of becoming a fully crypto-legal nation.

For example, according to Etherscan , one whale moved coins worth over $1.7 million from Coinbase on Thursday. In line with this, tokens on exchanges have dropped to 254.4 million in the last seven days. They have been in a steady downward trend in the past few months. Second, Chainlink has forged significant partnerships in recent months. Earlier this week, the developers announced collaborations with Coinbase and Emirates NBD, a bank with over $200 billion in assets. Chainlink has also partnered with organizations like Swift Network. Notably, Swift recently conducted a large-scale tokenization trade with UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager. Swift plans to integrate Chainlink’s technology into its money movement business, which processes over $150 trillion annually. On top of this, Chainlink has become the biggest oracle network in terms of total value secured. The $38 billion it has secured is higher than the other ten oracles, combined. Chainlink price has strong technicals Chainlink price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that LINK has maintained a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. It recently crossed the critical resistance level at $22.85, its highest swing in March of this year. The coin has also moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level, and the percentage price oscillator has risen above the zero line. The next key level to watch is $52, Chainlink’s all-time high, which is about 88% above the current price. A decline below the support level of $22.85 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

This shift comes as these experienced players look beyond established tokens to capitalize on undervalued assets with game-changing potential. With projections of a massive 29,000% return, PCHAIN could outshine major cryptocurrencies and redefine what it means to invest early in a high-utility project. Cardano Whales Shift Focus: Why PropiChain is Their Next Big Target Cardano has long been a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space, with its innovative proof-of-stake protocol and focus on sustainability. It’s no surprise that whales continue to see its value. However, even as Cardano holds strong, these experienced investors are looking for opportunities to deliver more explosive returns, which is where PropiChain enters the picture. The whales’ interest in PropiChain is a clear indicator of its potential. Large-scale investors often have access to advanced analytics and industry insights, meaning their moves can serve as a beacon for others. PropiChain addresses inefficiencies in property transactions and captures attention in ways most altcoins can’t. For everyday investors, following the money might be the smartest move yet. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate Through Blockchain PropiChain stands out by addressing one of the world’s most lucrative markets through blockchain technology. PropiChain is redefining how people access and invest in property at its core by offering a suite of innovative features tailored to modern investment needs. Tokenized Real Estate : You can own a fraction of a high-end property without spending millions in capital. PropiChain’s tokenization model converts these properties into tokens, allowing you to buy small shares. This levels the playground for smaller investors to get in. This feature is perfect for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of traditional property ownership. Fractional Ownership : Gone are the days when real estate investing required hefty down payments and complex legal processes. With fractional ownership, an investor can own a percentage of a property for as little as a few thousand dollars, earning proportional returns from rent or value appreciation. AI-Powered Insights : PropiChain doesn’t just provide access to real estate, it equips investors with the tools to make smarter decisions. Its AI analytics platform offers predictive market trends, helping users identify high-growth areas before they explode in value. For example, the system might highlight a suburban market on the verge of a boom, giving early investors an edge. Metaverse Integration : Taking innovation further, PropiChain lets users explore properties virtually in its metaverse platform. This adds an interactive layer that traditional real estate platforms can’t match. PropiChain Presale’s 29,000% Growth Potential PropiChain is in its presale phase, offering a rare opportunity for early adopters to enter at a ground-floor price. The initial token price started at just $0.004 and has now risen to $0.011 in stage two. This structured presale model, combined with projections of 29,000% ROI, makes it an incredibly attractive proposition. Let’s break this down with a practical example: If you invested $1,000 in PropiChain during its presale, and the token hits its projected value, your investment could turn to $290,000. Compare this to Cardano, where similar returns are highly improbable due to its established market positions and limited room for explosive growth. PropiChain’s presale credibility is strengthened by its CMC listing and rigorous audits by BlockAudit, ensuring security and transparency. Moreover, the project has already raised over $1 million, with its first stage selling out rapidly. This demonstrates the immense interest and confidence in PropiChain’s vision. Conclusion PropiChain is rapidly becoming the talk of the crypto world, and for good reason. With the first presale already filled, it’s clear that this project is gaining traction and that it is time to act. Each passing day brings PropiChain closer to its next pricing stage, where early adopters will already see gains while new investors pay more. Secure your spot in the PropiChain presale today.

Earlier this week, a Dogecoin monitoring platform noticed that the number of DOGE nodes dipped from 647 to just 205, a decrease of about 69%. “Our monitoring made us aware that the vulnerability appears to have been exploited, and almost 69% of the Dogecoin network has crashed. Blockchair shows the number of public nodes. Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205.” However, according to Blockchair, some DOGE nodes have since recovered as there are currently 331 active nodes around the world at time of writing. In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Bitcoin ( BTC ) sidechain developer Andreas Kohl says that he was the one who took down most of the DOGE network using an old laptop. “I used a publicly disclosed vulnerability [by BTC developer Tobias Ruck] to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural El Salvador.” According to Kohl, most DOGE users didn’t even notice . “Only nodes that weren’t on the latest version were affected – which was the majority of the network, excluding CEXs (centralized exchanges) and most other major custodians – hence why most doge users never noticed, not that many understand self-custody.” News of the exploit had little impact on the price of DOGE as the meme asset is trading for $0.413 at time of writing, a 4.7% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Instead, it offers a high-capacity network that attracts developers and investors looking to host products and services with high activity. SOL is Solana’s native cryptocurrency. It is important in the ecosystem because it helps with transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards people who support the network. The coin has value because it underpins how Solana works and lets users access various projects on the platform.

Let’s understand why. The crypto market in 2024 has been nothing short of transformative, with major milestones taking center stage throughout the year. Against this backdrop, Bitwise has made a series of bold predictions for 2025, bringing into focus the next big trends in the industry. Let’s dive into the details of each prediction and unravel the market conditions to assess how realistic these forecasts are and what they could mean for the future of the industry. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Stablecoins and tokenized assets The road ahead Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption The first of these claims is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar beyond $200,000 in 2025. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin is trading at $100,500 levels as of Dec. 12, a minor step back from its all-time high of $103,900 achieved just a week ago on Dec. 5. BTC Price Chart | Source: crypto.news This dip, marking a 3.5% retreat, comes on the heels of a broader market correction following an extraordinary bull run earlier in the year. Bitcoin first broke its previous all-time high of $73,000 in March, setting off a wave of optimism that reached a crescendo in November when Donald Trump was elected the 47th President of the U.S. His administration’s perceived pro-crypto stance has injected fresh confidence into the market. While the recent pullback may have tempered the frenzy, the overarching bullish sentiment remains intact. Adding fuel to this optimism is the explosive growth in Bitcoin ETFs , which Bitwise predicts will attract even more inflows in 2025 than they did in 2024. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of this year, total assets under management across these ETFs have reached an astonishing $113 billion as of Dec. 12, according to CoinGlass. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner, drawing in the lion’s share of inflows. In just the past week, a record-breaking $3.85 billion flowed into digital asset funds, with BlackRock accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. Bitwise’s third prediction ties closely to the first two, forecasting that the number of countries holding Bitcoin will double by 2025. The idea of nation-states accumulating Bitcoin is not new, but it is gaining traction as governments recognize its potential as a reserve asset. Currently, eight nations hold Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading the pack with over 207,000 BTC, valued at more than $20.6 billion as of today. China follows closely, holding 194,000 BTC worth $19.3 billion. Other notable holders include the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador, with holdings ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of BTC. Collectively, all these nations control 529,558 BTC, which is roughly 2.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million coins. If the number of countries holding Bitcoin does indeed double, we could see a profound shift in geopolitical strategies, with Bitcoin serving as a new kind of reserve asset. Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Bitwise’s next set of predictions for 2025 claims that Coinbase (COIN) stock will exceed $700 per share by 2025. Currently trading at $313, Coinbase has seen a 100% year-to-date gain. For context, Coinbase’s all-time high was $429.54, achieved during its debut on April 13, 2021, while its lowest point came on January 5, 2023, at $31.55. From its all-time low to today’s price, the stock has surged by over 900%, showing a dramatic turnaround. However, achieving the predicted $700 mark would require an additional 120% increase. Another fascinating prediction centers on Coinbase’s potential entry into the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. For Coinbase, joining the prestigious S&P 500 would signify its maturation as a blue-chip stock, reserved for companies with a market capitalization exceeding $18 billion and meeting specific profitability criteria. While Coinbase has faced volatility since its IPO, its strong recovery in 2023 and consistent performance in 2024 make it a viable candidate for the index. On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s transformation from a business software company to a corporate Bitcoin pioneer has redefined its market presence, with its stock price climbing 500% year-to-date, trading at $411 levels as of this writing, down from its 52-week high of $543. The idea of MicroStrategy joining the Nasdaq-100 and possibly the S&P 500 has generated considerable buzz. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the company is a strong contender for the Nasdaq-100, with an announcement expected soon. $MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic). Below is best guess of adds/drops via @JSeyff . Likely a 0.47% weight (40th biggest holding). There's $550b of ETFs tracking the index. S&P 500 add next yr prob. pic.twitter.com/rmTavtvWQL — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 10, 2024 However, its inclusion in the S&P 500 remains more challenging due to stricter criteria and the index committee’s selective approach. Another exciting prediction for 2025 is that at least five crypto unicorns will go public in the U.S. With around 30 crypto unicorns currently operating in the U.S. — including well-known names like Ripple ( XRP ), OpenSea, and Chainalysis —t he pipeline for potential IPOs is robust. An influx of crypto-related IPOs would not only provide new investment opportunities but also signal the sector’s maturation as it transitions from niche to mainstream. Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Bitwise’s next prediction for 2025 revolves around the U.S. Department of Labor potentially relaxing its current guidance against including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans. To understand the potential impact, it’s important to first unpack the current state of affairs and why crypto in retirement accounts has been a contentious issue. As of now, the Department of Labor maintains a cautious stance toward crypto in retirement plans. In March 2022, the agency issued a compliance bulletin warning fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” when allowing cryptocurrencies in 401(k) offerings. The DOL raised concerns about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, their price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the risks of fraud and theft. The agency argued that these factors make digital assets unsuitable for most retirement savers, whose investment horizons are long and whose risk tolerance is generally low. Under this guidance, the inclusion of crypto in 401(k) plans has been rare. A few instances of integration, such as Fidelity’s introduction of a Bitcoin option for its 401(k) plans in 2022, faced immediate scrutiny. The DOL cautioned Fidelity and other firms offering similar products to ensure compliance with fiduciary duties, effectively discouraging broader adoption. Employers have been hesitant to expose themselves to potential liability, resulting in a limited presence of crypto within retirement portfolios. If the prediction of relaxed guidance in 2025 comes true, it would mark a major policy reversal. Such a shift would likely be driven by growing demand from younger generations of workers who see crypto as a legitimate asset class. Surveys have consistently shown that millennials and Gen Z investors view crypto as a vital component of their long-term financial strategies. For example, a 2023 Charles Schwab study found that 47% of millennials already hold crypto in some capacity, and 45% expressed interest in including it in their retirement accounts if given the option. The potential market impact of this change is enormous. According to the Investment Company Institute, U.S. 401(k) plans held approximately $7.7 trillion in assets as of December 2023. Even a small percentage of this being allocated to cryptocurrencies could inject heavy liquidity into the market and further legitimize the space. Stablecoins and tokenized assets Bitwise’s predictions for 2025 also include a bold outlook on the stablecoin market and the tokenized real-world assets space. The first projection foresees stablecoin assets doubling to over $400 billion, a substantial leap from their current market capitalization of $207 billion as of Dec. 12. Tether ( USDT ) dominates this market with a commanding share of approximately 67.6%, backed by its $140 billion market cap. USDT’s closest competitor, USD Coin ( USDC ), lags behind with a market cap of $41 billion, making it roughly 3.4 times smaller. Stablecoins are frequently used as trading pairs on exchanges, providing a bridge between crypto assets and fiat currencies. Moreover, their role in facilitating cross-border transactions has also gained attention, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. The second prediction centers on the tokenized real-world asset market, which is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025. According to a September 2024 Binance report, the total value of tokenized RWAs hit an all-time high of over $12 billion, excluding stablecoins. On-chain real-world assets (""RWAs"") have reached an all-time high. Our new report explores this recent growth, outlines key RWA categories, and provides a tech-driven tour of some of the most interesting protocols in the space. Read on 🔽 https://t.co/1w8gr3Nrkg — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) September 13, 2024 RWAs refer to blockchain-based representations of physical and financial assets such as real estate, government bonds, commodities, and even fine art. Tokenization allows these assets to be divided into smaller units, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Key categories in the RWA space include tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and real estate, with emerging categories such as carbon credits and air rights also gaining traction. Traditional asset managers have already begun to tokenize illiquid assets like real estate or fine art to offer investors opportunities to diversify their holdings in ways that were previously challenging or cost-prohibitive. A McKinsey report from June 2024 estimates that the tokenized market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030, underpinned by increasing demand for transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership in financial markets. The road ahead The future of the crypto market looks exciting, with Bitwise’s 2025 predictions pointing to major shifts ahead. Bitcoin could hit new highs, stablecoins could double in value, and tokenized real-world assets could gain traction as the next big thing. But these changes will depend on how the market grows, how regulations evolve, and how technology keeps up. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Per the media outlet CoinPost and the official House of Councillors record , the demand came from Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK. A National Bitcoin Reserve for Japan? Hamada submitted a written question to the government “regarding the creation of a reserve fund for cryptoassets.” Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada In the question, the lawmaker noted there moves are now afoot “in Brazil and the United States,” where Treasury officials could soon begin holding Bitcoin (BTC) as a “strategic reserve asset.” Hamada went on to ask the Japanese government to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.” He added that the incoming Donald Trump administration will appoint a so-called crypto “czar” and explained that “similar movements are also underway in Brazil.” The lawmaker mentioned that BTC could soon become a “national strategic asset.” He submitted his request in a document entitled: “Question regarding the status of understanding the movement to introduce a national Bitcoin reserve in the United States and other countries.” Decentralized Solution Hamada’s question also made note of the fact that BTC is “less susceptible to the influence of specific countries or institutions.” And he said that its “neutrality and decentralized nature” allows Bitcoin to support economic activity” without “relying on any specific currency.” The government is set to provide Hamada with a written response in the coming weeks, and will likely publish this on its official website. A new risk for the yen is emerging, with currency strategists in Tokyo warning that there’s a chance the Bank of Japan may stand pat on interest rates until March or later https://t.co/tUNZ6lFvSM — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 12, 2024 Lawmakers Share Sentiment? Hamada represents a political party that only has two seats in parliament. But there is a high probability that other MPs share Hamada’s views. Japan’s relatively restrictive regulations have resulted in a shrinking crypto market. But many top lawmakers still want to turn the nation into a global blockchain hotspot. They have urged Tokyo to reform crypto tax laws and prevent promising crypto startups from relocating overseas. Meanwhile, the business sector is growing increasingly Bitcoin-keen, with some Japanese firms using their balance sheet to buy BTC and altcoins . Many regulatory bodies appear ready to make the necessary reforms. But the nation’s new Prime Minister has expressed a more cautious view on crypto regulation reform .

This is significant, considering how it could set Shiba Inu on a path to higher prices. Most SHIB Holders In The Green As Shiba Inu Price Rebounds IntoTheBlock data shows that most SHIB holders are in the green as the Shiba Inu price rebounds towards $0.00003. 69% of these SHIB holders are now in the money, while 24% are out of the money, and 6% are currently in the money. This could be bullish for the Shiba Inu price, considering that holders are less likely to sell when they are in the money. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 This could reduce the selling pressure on SHIB and sustain the Shiba Inu price recovery. The meme coin has recovered towards $0.00003. The ‘In the Money’ metric shows that the next significant resistance level that Shiba Inu needs to break above is $0.000033. 130,620 wallet addresses bought 15.06 trillion SHIB tokens around this level. However, on-chain metrics still paint a bearish picture for Shiba Inu, which is undoubtedly concerning. IntoTheBlock data shows that the ‘Concentration’ metric is in the red, indicating that SHIB whales currently have a bearish sentiment towards the meme coin and are opting against accumulating more coins. This large transaction metric is also bearish at the moment as Shiba Inu whales are opting against accumulating more coins. The net network growth also paints a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu price, as there is currently a low influx of new addresses buying the meme coin. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also remained inconsistent, further presenting a bearish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. Shibburn data shows that the burn rate is down over 79% in the last 24 hours, with three million coins burned during this period. From A Technical Analysis Perspective Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu from a technical analysis perspective. In an X post, he stated that Shiba Inu recently confirmed another bullish pattern, which could lead to a continuation of its upward trend. The analyst added that another major upside move could be in play for SHIB, with the meme coin possibly rallying to $0.00081 or even higher. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible The crypto analyst further mentioned that with this target at $0.000081, the Shiba Inu price could witness a 180% climb and that this rally may already be in play. A rally to $0.000081 could pave the way for Shiba Inu to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000029, up over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

After months of speculation, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, thrilling both long-time HODLers and fresh investors alike. The cherry on top? Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing a steady influx of funds, showing a renewed wave of institutional confidence. Fidelity, ARK, and Grayscale are leading the charge, with millions flowing into their ETFs as BTC maintains its climb. Meanwhile, Ethereum is quietly but powerfully making its case, with analysts eyeing the $5,000 milestone thanks to growing demand and tightening supply dynamics. It’s a bullish December for crypto, and the buzz is palpable. Amid this surge, Qubetics ($TICS) has been making waves of its own. Unlike many speculative projects, Qubetics aims to solve real-world challenges by bringing asset tokenisation into the mainstream. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is all about solving real-world problems for real people. Ever thought about how clunky and fragmented the process of managing real-world assets can be? That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s all about tokenising real-world assets —from real estate to intellectual property—and making them tradable on the blockchain. Picture this: a small business owner needs to raise capital but doesn’t want to go through the red tape of traditional financing. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their inventory or even future revenue streams. Investors get a piece of the action, and the business gets liquidity. Qubetics lets them do just that, creating a win-win for creators and fans. For more information, check out this exclusive AMA Session . The numbers don’t lie. The Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 313 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 8,700 holders, raising a staggering $5.7 million so far. At just $0.0311 per token, it’s an entry point that screams potential. The prices are set to jump by 10% this weekend. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to dive in, this is it. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto platform; it’s a revolution. By bridging the gap between physical and digital assets, it’s opening doors that were previously bolted shut. Whether you’re a business, a professional, or just someone looking to diversify their portfolio, Qubetics offers a fresh, innovative approach to asset management. And with its presale momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the time to act is now. Bitcoin: The King Reclaims The Crown, Smashes $100K Barrier Bitcoin is smashing through ceilings, and $100,000 isn’t just another number—it’s a statement. After years of scepticism, the flagship cryptocurrency has cemented itself as more than just digital gold. What’s fuelling this latest rally? It’s the ETFs, baby. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have been on fire, pulling in $223 million in just one day. Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC are attracting cash like a magnet, proving institutional investors are in it for the long haul. This ETF frenzy didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s a mix of perfect timing and a maturing market. Inflation data has eased fears of aggressive rate hikes, nudging the Fed toward a potential cut. That’s music to Bitcoin’s ears. Add to that a trading volume of $3.94 billion for BTC investment products, and you’ve got a market roaring with optimism. But let’s keep it real. Bitcoin isn’t just about big-shot ETFs and six-figure price tags. For the everyday investor, it’s about resilience and reliability. Think about it: Bitcoin has outperformed most traditional assets this year. Whether you’re stacking sats or eyeing a long-term hold, Bitcoin’s recent performance is a masterclass in staying power. And if history is any guide, the king’s reign is far from over. Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Big Break While Bitcoin grabs headlines, Ethereum is quietly orchestrating a rally of its own. Hovering around $5,000, ETH is poised for what could be its most significant breakout yet. Why? It’s all about the fundamentals. Since the introduction of spot ETFs in July, institutional demand for Ethereum has surged. Over 3.41 million ETH are now held in these funds, up from 2.716 million just a few months ago. That’s a whole lot of confidence from big-money players. Then there’s Ethereum’s supply story. With every transaction burning ETH, the network is seeing deflationary forces at play. Higher activity on the blockchain means more ETH gets removed from circulation. It’s like a double-edged sword that only sharpens the asset’s scarcity. And speaking of activity, Ethereum’s daily transactions are off the charts, with smart contracts and dApps fuelling the ecosystem like never before. But here’s where Ethereum gets really interesting: its adaptability. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn’t just a store of value; it’s the backbone of decentralised finance, NFTs, and so much more. Whether you’re a DeFi junkie or a casual dApp user, ETH offers a slice of something bigger. With its realised price hovering around $5,200, the stars seem to be aligning for a push past $5K. Could this be the moment Ethereum leaves its mark as more than Bitcoin’s little brother? It sure feels like it. Make Your Move This December, the crypto market is buzzing with opportunities. Bitcoin’s climb past $100K proves it’s still the king of the hill, while Ethereum’s deflationary dynamics set the stage for a major rally. But if you’re looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presale offers a chance to get in early on a project that’s truly breaking new ground. Don’t let this moment pass you by. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes in the crypto waters, these three options are shaping up to be the best cryptos to invest in this month. Act now, and let your portfolio ride the wave.

The books span genres, languages, and authors such as Dickens, Dante, and Shakespeare which are no longer copyright protected because of their age. The new dataset initiative comes as AI training data is naturally pricey and best suited for tech firms with deep pockets. Harvard got financial backing from tech giants According to a TechCrunch article, the initiative is spearheaded by the Harvard’s Institutional Data Initiative (IDI). This initiative contains books derived from Google’s longstanding book-scanning project Google Books . Other books contained in the dataset include Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. The university teased the IDI in March clearly stating its plans to create a “trusted conduit for legal data for AI.” Since then, not much was heard from it until the formal launch on Thursday and tech giants Microsoft and OpenAI funded the project. The dataset is not a preserve of Silicon Valley alone but IDI has opened it to anyone, that is from research labs to AI startups that want to train their large language models. By opening the dataset to anyone, IDI executive director Greg Leppert said the dataset is meant to level the playing field, at a time when the cost of training AI remains high and prohibitive to smaller companies and making it preserve of those with huge budgets. Leppert added that the dataset is “rigorously reviewed,” which according to Fudzilla presumably means someone checked to ensure that Bard was really gone and out of the way. The Harvard dataset will need more resources According to Leppert, who compared the dataset’s potential to Linux, the open source operating system, the success of the Harvard dataset will be hinged on a number of variables. Leppert said its success will require more resources, expertise, and a “sprinkle of magic” from those same deep-pocketed corporations that the initiative is designed to challenge. The million books contained in the dataset were scanned as part of Google Books program. Fudzilla describes the initiative as a digital time capsule from when Google’s ambitions to scan every book seemed quirky rather than dystopian. However, Leppert is upbeat about the project’s potential uses, further suggesting it could a such a treasure trove helping train AI models for everyone from garage startups to the corporate conglomerates. While some have praised the initiative as a revolutionary leap forward in democratizing AI, Fudzilla opines that some might see this as a subtle means of ensuring that any ambitious upstart with a few terabytes of server space can now compete in a race to develop the next ChatGPT. However, they will need more resources to compete and make a dent in the market. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred the race for generative AI models across the globe. However, the development of these models has created a thirst for data to perfect them and this desire for more data has caused problems on how much information they can get, without stealing it. To date, publishers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have sued OpenAI and Perplexity over using their data without permission.

Table of Contents XRP braces for price correction Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Lunex Network to deliver extensive trader benefits Avalanche (AVAX) and Ripple (XRP) have both seen losses this week. This hasn’t come as a shock for Avalanche, as the project has struggled to gain momentum this year. For XRP, this loss could mark the end of the asset’s wild ride, having rallied last month. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been gaining traction in the trading space for its modern approach to crypto. It promises to address long-time trader frustrations by offering low fees, strong interoperability, and powerful trading tools. XRP braces for price correction XRP is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last week. Many experts expect corrective price action as XRP saw wild growth throughout November, rallying by 300%. The XRP price growth likely occurred as a result of Trump’s appointment, pointing towards a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto platforms in the near future. Ripple has also worked hard to improve its ledger and is now seen as a real authority in the cross-border payment space. Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Avalanche added 31% to its value over the year, a level of growth dwarfed by the wider crypto market expansion. AVAX is still slowing down and possibly heading downward after dropping 12% in 24 hours and 13% in the last week. Despite the underwhelming price performance, Avalanche has released some well received updates. Specifically, the Avalanche9000 upgrade was recently released on the testnet and is set to bring flexibility and scalability to the network. This will make Avalanche a more hospitable place for developers looking to build intelligent and scalable decentralized applications.

Additionally, the platform will reduce risks by not requiring third-party wallet connections, ensuring user data remains secure. At the core of Lunex Network is the LNEX token, designed for long-term stability and growth. With a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, scarcity may drive value higher as adoption increases. Notably, LNEX holders will receive 18% of the platform’s profits from transaction fees, promoting sustained investment and ecosystem expansion. Lunex Network is currently generating major hype in the crypto space, with tokens available at $0.0044. Analysts anticipate an 1,800% increase in the value of LNEX in the near future, suggesting a promising opportunity for those looking to benefit from the next wave of DeFi.

The measure, introduced by Mayor Ken Sim and passed at the December 11, 2024 Standing Committee meeting, directs staff to investigate accepting BTC for city taxes and fees and the feasibility of incorporating it into the city’s financial reserves. The motion secured support from six councilors, while two opposed and three were absent. The decision represents only the initial step toward assessing Bitcoin’s potential role in safeguarding the City of Vancouver’s purchasing power. Next Bitcoin City? Mayor Ken Sim emphasized that the initiative is exploratory rather than a firm commitment. He stated: “I’m in motion that could help protect Vancouver’s financial future for the next 100 years and keep life affordable for our residents, becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city.” According to Mayor Sim, the move would examine whether Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, issues he highlighted as undermining the long-term value of the city’s traditional reserves. “That means the money we save today will not buy as much in the future,” said Sim. In remarks made prior to the vote, Mayor Sim offered a robust defense of BTC’s attributes: “Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a digital asset that works differently. It’s decentralized, meaning it’s not controlled by any one person, government, or corporation, and its supply is finite.” He went on to note the asset’s historical performance: “Over the last 16 years, Bitcoin has been the best performing financial asset on the planet, and major companies and countries and cities are starting to use it as a way to protect their financial resources.” The mayor referenced diverse global jurisdictions—ranging from El Salvador and Bhutan to Pennsylvania and ongoing considerations at the US federal level—each exploring or adopting Bitcoin-based strategies. He emphasized Vancouver’s unique position given its established blockchain community, noting: “Vancouver is already known for its blockchain community and history with cryptocurrency. This motion allows us to explore whether Bitcoin can help us safeguard our financial resources and offer new options like letting people, unbanked individuals, pay for city fees in Bitcoin.” The motion itself outlines a comprehensive path forward. It instructs city staff to study the implications of accepting BTC for taxes and fees, as well as the possibility of converting a portion of Vancouver’s reserves into Bitcoin. It also mandates consultations with financial advisors, cryptocurrency experts, and other stakeholders. The framework for managing and potentially liquidating BTC, should the city proceed, will be developed with a focus on “full transparency and accountability.” A report on the findings and feasibility is due by the end of Q1 2025. The motion underscores that other jurisdictions have already taken steps toward BTC integration. Examples include Zug, Switzerland —often dubbed “Crypto Valley”—where Bitcoin has been accepted for municipal services and taxes; Seoul, South Korea, which explores blockchain integration in municipal operations; and El Salvador’s decision to adopt BTC as legal tender. The Vancouver motion also emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential environmental and infrastructural contributions. It notes that BTC mining can utilize low-cost, excess renewable energy, stabilizing energy grids and reducing emissions. From a financial perspective, proponents argue that Bitcoin diversification could preserve the value of public funds in times of inflation or economic instability, potentially benefiting taxpayers and signaling Vancouver’s leadership and “willingness to embrace innovation.” In closing, Mayor Sim reiterated the exploratory nature of the initiative: “I do want to stress that this motion does not mean that we are committing to anything today. It’s about studying the possibilities, understanding the risks, and seeing if this could be a smart move for Vancouver’s future.” At press time, BTC traded at $100.817.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Vancouver Bitcoin News|Vancouver Bitcoin-Friendly City,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-13 00:00:07

This activity is part of Ripple’s intensified testing phase for its stablecoin, which is set to launch soon following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple Mints Over 13M RLUSD Amid Imminent Launch Data from Ripple’s Stablecoin Tracker reveals the minting of 13.9 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network. On the XRP Ledger, Ripple minted 2.6 million RLUSD, followed by three additional mints of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. Concurrently, the Ethereum Network recorded mints of 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. The stablecoin, which is fully backed by onshore U.S. assets, has been undergoing rigorous tests involving minting and transfers across these networks. Ripple confirmed that these tests are aimed at ensuring the stablecoin’s functionality before its official debut. Moreover, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on X (formerly Twitter), saying, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” Regulatory Approval Sets RLUSD Apart from Competitors Ripple has secured NYDFS approval, making RLUSD one of the few U.S.-regulated stablecoins. Unlike competitors like USDT and USDC, RLUSD meets strict requirements under U.S. financial regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III standards. The stablecoin is fully collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and held in regulated custody, ensuring compliance with Federal Reserve and FDIC guidelines. US banks can hold #RLUSD on the XRPL/ETH ledger, and why USDC and USDT cannot. Here's an explanation of why RLUSD is so special and why it took years to get approved… READ ON Regulations Summary: U.S. GAAP/IFRS: Assets must have clear value, reliable measurement, and meet… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 11, 2024 This regulatory approval positions RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. According to Ripple, its transparent operations, including real-time audits, differentiate it from other stablecoins. USDT, for example, has faced scrutiny for inconsistent audits, while USDC operates partially offshore, making compliance with certain U.S. standards challenging. Analysts Assess XRP Price Movement Amid RLUSD Developments The approval and testing of RLUSD have coincided with a notable increase in XRP’s market value. XRP has risen from $1.90 to $2.35, with some analysts describing this as a “speculative pump.” Software engineer Vincent Van Code stated that XRP’s price could see further gains if RLUSD enters decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Van Code emphasized that liquidity pool (LP) and automated market maker (AMM) features for RLUSD on the XRP Ledger could drive demand. He suggested that users earning returns through LPs might contribute to increased XRP adoption. Additionally, the ability to swap RLUSD with other stablecoins or use it for on-chain staking could further integrate RLUSD into DeFi activities. Amid RLUSD-related developments, significant XRP transactions have been observed. Over 39.43 million XRP, valued at $95.5 million, was moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Separately, a whale transferred approximately 99.99 million XRP worth $234.4 million between unknown wallets.

Climbing by over 298% to trade at just over $2.30 from about $0.57, XRP is reigniting investor interest in altcoins. As Ripple’s token solidifies its position, a new competitor is quietly emerging: RCO Finance (RCOF) . This overlooked altcoin is making a name for itself with its 16,509% growth potential, unique features and scalable ecosystem. RCOF is quickly establishing itself, offering a unique opportunity for quick-witted investors looking to capitalize on high-growth opportunities. XRP Price Rally: Key Drivers Behind Its Growth The resurgence of Ripple’s native token is driven by increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and its established role in the payment sector. These factors have propelled the XRP price to new highs, promising more returns. The most notable factor driving the XRP price up is Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC. This ruling clarified XRP’s status and helped remove the uncertainty clouded the altcoin since 2020. This favorable ruling has fueled a wave of adoption, especially by institutional investors, positioning XRP as a reliable asset that drives XRP price appreciation. As a pioneer in cross-border payment, XRP’s ability to facilitate fast and cost-effective international payments has made it the go-to solution for financial institutions. With XRP upgrading its XRP ledger, it has enhanced its utility in facilitating and streamlining global transactions, increasing demand for XRP tokens. This has, in turn, reinforced its market value, driving up the XRP price. Lastly, the XRP price rises as it rides the tailwinds of Bitcoin’s impressive performance. BTC’s gains and positive sentiment have spilled over, creating a conducive environment for altcoins like XRP to thrive.

BUILD. ~Changpeng Zhao In 2024, Travala grew its 2023 gross revenue by over 67% Travala has made big strides in consolidating its position within the crypto-travelling/hospitality niche. In 2024, for instance, it recorded annual revenues of over $100 million, a massive jump from the $59.6 million it earned in 2023. The firm attributes that spike to an uptick in flight and accommodation bookings on its platform. Users can make reservations for these services in 100+ cryptocurrencies. Buoyed by this result, Travala announced it would be setting up its Bitcoin and AVA reserves. It says that the move was vital in expanding its financial muscle. With these additional funds, the company intends to strengthen its foothold within the blockchain-based travel industry and enhance its incentives program. The firm has pushed innovation in the travel sector Travala has always championed innovation in the travel sector. For instance, it pioneered crypto bookings using different digital assets. It also introduced Dtravel, a decentralized alternative to Airbnb. Unlike other P2P travel market services, Dtravel hosts have a share in the platform. Meanwhile, Binance is ramping up its blockchain investments. This year alone, its investment arm Binance Labs, undertook various major projects. One of these is its collaboration with Kernel to develop restaking infrastructure on its BNB Chain. This infrastructure will support the integration of tokens like BTC and BNB. Again, Binance pivoted into decentralized scientific research by investing in the BIO Protocol to expand funding in the area. It also funded Lombard, which specializes in Bitcoin liquid staking. These developments highlight its commitment to supporting new projects across the blockchain ecosystem.

Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings are now following the playbook, issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Clearly, these guys are no longer satisfied with just validating transactions and earning rewards. Instead, they’re mimicking MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor’s tactic of turning corporate resources into a Bitcoin stockpile machine. Wall Street’s obsession with the skyrocketing MSTR—up over 600% this year—is impossible to ignore. Hedge funds are loving the opportunity, deploying arbitrage strategies that take advantage of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility. Miners can’t keep up with MicroStrategy’s pace Despite the hype, Riot and MARA aren’t seeing the same success as MicroStrategy. Since the software company started its Bitcoin-buying spree in 2020, Riot and MARA shares have underperformed. Both remain far below their 2021 highs. The April Bitcoin halving event didn’t help. It slashed the rewards miners earn for adding new blocks to the blockchain, putting a major dent in profits. Throw in increased competition, and miners are now fighting an uphill battle to stay relevant. Riot’s convertible notes have raised eyebrows though. The notes came with a 32.5% conversion premium, lower than MicroStrategy’s November issuance, which had a 55% premium. Riot is also facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value, which recently took a stake in the company. Starboard is pushing the miner to shift some of its operations toward hyperscalers—large-scale data center users—rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, analysts are questioning the long-term viability of using convertible debt to stockpile Bitcoin. Stephen Glagola from JonesTrading has expressed doubts about this strategy, saying, “We would prefer the company to increase BTC held per share organically with its mining operations.” Meanwhile, investment giant BlackRock is cautiously endorsing Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The firm suggests investors allocate up to 2% to Bitcoin but only if they’re prepared to stomach its wild volatility. MicroStrategy on its way to Nasdaq 100, critics weigh in MicroStrategy is now eyeing a spot in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a move that could trigger massive passive inflows into its stock. Exchange-traded funds worth $451 billion track the index, and inclusion would mean huge stock purchases. But not everyone is sold on the idea. Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin makes it more of a financial entity than a technology company. Michael Lebowitz from RIA Advisors went as far as calling it “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin holdings. Despite the criticisms, MicroStrategy has amassed a $98 billion market cap, largely due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now holds over $40 billion in Bitcoin, but its core software business isn’t doing so hot. It reported a $340 million net loss in Q3 this year. Still, its Bitcoin-focused strategy has kept its stock soaring, even as skeptics question its sustainability. MicroStrategy has branded itself as a “Bitcoin Treasury Company.” This identity could work in its favor for Nasdaq inclusion, as the index excludes financial companies. Its classification as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark might be its saving grace. But Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has warned that a reclassification could be on the horizon, jeopardizing its eligibility.

With this decision, crypto exchanges can now list Pump.fun memecoins on their portfolio with full compliance coverage, and even governments can check for scams or rug pulls. Chainalysis will offer full compliance coverage for Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins Chainalysis has extended its coverage to Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins. Chainalysis Product Director Matthew Wilson even commented on the support extension, saying: Today, Chainalysis extended our Solana coverage to include every Solana token in KYT and Reactor. From the moment an SPL contract is deployed, Chainalysis offers complete alerting, exposure and tracing. ~ Director Matthew Wilson He added that exchanges can add Solana’s memecoins to their portfolio, arguing that compliance support is guaranteed. He even said governments could monitor the tokens for fraud. Schwartz Associates director Christopher Roberts has congratulated Chainalysis on the update, saying it’s “one of the many reasons” they are happy to work with the data analytic platform. A compliance consultant on LinkedIn named Stephen Sergent, on Chainalysis’s move, jokingly remarked how he can now lose his shirt on these meme coins compliantly. Pump.fun lost the British market following the FCA’s operational ban in the UK While Chainalysis’s move to support Solana memecoins promises that governments can easily track scams and fraud involving these tokens, some governments have already lost trust in the Solana meme coin launchpad. For starters, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has restricted the use of Pump.fun in the country. The FCA first cautioned users against the platform on December 3, warning them of potential scams. The agency said the platform targeted UK crypto consumers despite being unauthorized to operate. Currently, UK-based users can no longer access Pump.fun. Any user who tries to use the Pump.fun website from the UK is notified of the instituted restricted access . However, the FCA did provide a link for users to withdraw their coins in their private wallets. The regulatory authority still maintains that customers using unauthorized firms like Pump.fun risk losing their funds.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 00:28:24

Among the skeptics is Atomic Wallet, a decentralized non-custodial wallet, which has drawn attention for its recent remarks criticizing XRP and its investors. Concerns Over Sustainability of Gains The asset recently achieved a milestone by hitting a seven-year high of $2.87, following an impressive 485% surge over four weeks. However, this upward trajectory faced a setback during a market-wide correction, with the token’s value dropping to $2.34—over 32% below its peak. While XRP supporters celebrated the significant gains, critics, including Atomic Wallet, raised doubts about the sustainability of the asset’s rally. They pointed to the token’s historical pattern of sharp corrections following rapid price increases. Atomic Wallet’s Bold Prediction In a controversial tweet, Atomic Wallet questioned whether XRP holders are prepared for the asset’s value potentially declining to $0.50. The wallet further asserted that the asset would not reach $3 again and committed to deleting its X account if the token surpassed that level in the future. This criticism comes after it previously made sarcastically bullish remarks about the token. For instance, on December 2, the wallet jokingly stated it would not sell its XRP holdings until the price reached $300. Community Responds Atomic Wallet’s statements have sparked a backlash from XRP supporters. Community members have accused the wallet provider of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent voices within the community, such as Panos Mekras , have called for a complete boycott of Atomic Wallet and urged users to switch to alternative platforms. Critics have also highlighted Atomic Wallet’s security record, referencing a multi-million-dollar hack in 2023 as evidence that the company should focus on securing its services rather than commenting on market trends. The backlash has also drawn attention to Atomic Wallet’s seemingly contradictory stance on XRP. Previously, the wallet encouraged its users to buy the asset and had shared positive commentary about it. Despite the controversy, the asset remains a topic of interest in the cryptocurrency space. While skeptics warn of extended downturns, supporters believe in its long-term potential, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments and blockchain technology.

That makes for a good title, but actually, that only amounts to tokens worth around $500 being burnt. That’s pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of things, with Shiba Inu’s market cap around $16.58 billion as of Thursday. Still, in a world dominated by highly inflationary fiat currencies, where the M2 US dollar money supply is up by around 50% since 2020 per TradingEconomics data , it’s a reminder of the benefits of non-inflationary cryptocurrencies. Of course, protection against inflation isn’t really a narrative for meme coins like Shiba Inu, that’s more the realm of Bitcoin (BTC) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a much more speculative bet, a meme coin that relies upon hype cycles, and its ever-growing and highly dedicated community of followers, investors and aficionados. While the latest deflation figures from shibburn.com are unlikely to move the needle for Shiba Inu, there are plenty of other reasons for investors to be excited right now. Shiba Inu – Could a Parabolic Rally Be Next? $SHIB was last trading just above $0.000028, within recent ranges and close to its 21DMA. The stunning rally in early November thanks to President Trump’s US Presidential election victory has mostly petered out at this point. But Shiba Inu’s strong bounce from its 50DMA earlier this week suggests the bulls remain in control of this market and price predictions remain bullish. And that should come as no surprise, given all the positive developments going on in the USA right now. The incoming US administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, and the new Congress, also very pro-crypto, is expected to deliver regulatory certainty to the industry next year. Trump was literally jawboning about how he will “do something great with crypto” during his upcoming term.

But a rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see $SHIB attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. Either way, the near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

The real estate industry has been plagued with several problems since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which plummeted homes and commercial space. However, with AI technology, the real estate market can tackle inefficiencies and fraud risks and simplify complex transaction processes for users. Expert analysts believe this AI innovation could redefine how investors engage with Real Estate markets globally. Therefore, this article will explore how these AI technologies impact RWA investment in blockchain and what investors will gain when participating in its presale. How is PropiChain AI Technology Creating A Pathway in Real Estate Investment? The importance of AI in the 21st century cannot be understated, as it helps manage and automate processes that reduce the risk of human error, speed up complex processes, and minimize the need for manual intervention. PropiChain uses these AI integrations to address major loopholes and inefficiencies in traditional Real Estate investment by democratizing access to global markets and reducing lengthy settlement times. Below is a detailed narrative of PropiChain AI implementations and how they assist users in making better investment decisions. Automated Valuation Model (AVM): This AI tool assists users by bringing unparalleled accuracy to property valuations as they navigate the platform. Its sophisticated algorithm also helps analyze vast amounts of data, including historical sales reports, market conditions, and economic indicators, to reflect the actual value of a real estate asset.This AI tool offers insights beyond analyzing reports. It also detects patterns and trends that might elude human analysts, identifying major and minor shifts in neighborhood dynamics. AI-powered Chatbots: For users having challenges navigating the PropiChain platform, these AI-powered chatbots provide support and guidance, simplifying experiences and making them more intuitive and user-friendly for novice and experienced investors. Its virtual assistance tools also help break down complex processes, such as understanding legal contracts and financial terms, providing easy-to-understand explanations without any financial or legal background. Property Filtering & Suggestions: This AI-powered filtering system filters real estate assets based on market growth/trends, historical performance, and investment potential. This advanced AI also extends to filtering options for small-scale investors working on a budget who would also love to participate in managing multiple investment properties. In addition, these property suggestions allow AI to assess risks in real-time, safeguarding investors against potential losses and ensuring optimal asset allocation. Statistical Market Analysis: The PropiChain market analysis tool uses AI to analyze market data to identify high-yield real estate opportunities, enabling smarter investments. It also provides real-time evaluation of market trends and offers statistical insight into a real estate asset’s future price predictions, ensuring investors position themselves and avoid potential market risks. Other Key Features: Metaverse Integrations and RWA Tokenization Other features of PropiChain are its Metaverse integrations, which allow international investors to experience an immersive 3D virtual environment through tours, stagings, and meetings. Likewise, PropiChain bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds by tokenizing Real Estate and introducing the fractional ownership of assets. Through asset fractionalization, investors can own portions of high-value properties, democratizing access to Real Estate wealth rather than limiting it to top-scale investors. Expert analysts and top crypto whales believe this innovative approach opens new opportunities for investors and developers as these features cement its reputation as a secure and promising investment opportunity. Conclusion PropiChain stands out as a leader in the real estate industry because of its ability to combine the power of AI, RWA tokenization, and the Metaverse, which creates a groundbreaking platform for real estate investment. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and security review on BlockAudit are testaments to its transparency and credibility as it projects significant growth potential. In addition, its presale price of $0.004 is the lowest it will ever be, as its current round two presale stage still offers investors the opportunity to experience significant growth from $500 to over $100,000 when it launches into the mainstream market. Avoid FOMO and invest today to be a part of this revolutionary project shaping the future of Real Estate investment.

As of now, Bitcoin is reportedly within a bull market phase, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope. This phase, termed the “Orange Zone,” indicates that upward momentum is prevailing, although the market has not yet reached its peak. datascope’ analysis sheds light on the evolving Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, a tool designed to help investors identify key market trends and make informed decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market at a Crossroads: Are Long-Term Holders Signalling a Correction or a Rally? Bitcoin Market Cycle: Current Status And Investor Outlook The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator relies on two moving averages: a short-term 30-day average and a long-term 365-day average. A crossover of the short-term average above the long-term average is seen as a critical signal, potentially marking the transition to the market’s peak period. However, the absence of such a crossover, as revealed by datascope currently suggests that while the market is on an upward trajectory, there is still room for significant growth before reaching a potential top. The analyst elaborated that in the current bull market, Bitcoin’s price movements reflect strong momentum, signalling opportunities for investors. However, with this phase also comes the necessity for strategic vigilance. datascope analysis also highlights the importance of preparing for corrections as prices approach the “red zone” (in the chart attached above), a stage associated with heightened risks. The analyst noted: As long as the 30-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average remains above the 365-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average, the long-term outlook will stay positive. However, as prices approach the red zone, the risk of corrections may increase. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to remain cautious during this period and consider taking profits when necessary. Key Takeaways For Investors datascope suggested that investors aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market should focus on strategic entry and exit points. The analyst added: Although the current bull market shows strong momentum, it is vital to take market fluctuations into account and monitor price movements strategically. Following critical signals such as the crossover of moving averages can help investors identify opportunities more effectively during this period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently seen a noticeable rebound in its price after reclaiming the $100,000 price mark yesterday. At the time of writing, the asset trades at a price of $101,639 increasing by 1.9% in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000?

Solana’s recent 6% price surge has spotlighted its innovative developments, while Ethereum continues to gain traction thanks to improved regulatory sentiment and high-profile investments. Amidst all this action, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a groundbreaking presale that promises to revolutionise how blockchain addresses real-world challenges. While Solana and Ethereum have paved the way for decentralised technology, Qubetics steps in to fill the gaps they’ve left behind. Let’s dive into why these three projects are the best cryptos to invest in right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Real-World Solutions Qubetics is already making gains, thanks to its cutting-edge, solution-oriented products for addressing real-life business issues. By introducing the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , Qubetics addresses privacy concerns and scalability in a way that its predecessors couldn’t. In its 12th presale stage, this project has already sold over 313 million tokens to more than 8,700 holders, raising an impressive $5.7 million. The presale is hot, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0311, set to increase by 10% this weekend. But beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics so special? Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can browse securely without fearing data breaches or censorship. That’s the promise of Qubetics dVPN. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on central servers prone to hacking or outages, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a distributed network. This means no single point of failure and unprecedented levels of security. For more information, watch this AMA Session that’s creating a buzz in the crypto world. Picture this: a journalist in a country with heavy censorship uses Qubetics’ dVPN to access and share critical information safely. Or consider a startup protecting sensitive customer data from cyberattacks while saving on infrastructure costs. Even everyday users can enjoy unrestricted streaming or protect their browsing habits from prying eyes. It’s privacy and freedom wrapped into one seamless experience. The FOMO around Qubetics is real, and for a good reason. With its practical applications and an active community backing its growth, $TICS could redefine how we think about blockchain utility. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now, jumping into Qubetics before the presale price hike seems like a no-brainer. Solana (SOL): Scaling New Heights with Innovation Solana has been a force to reckon with in the crypto world, and its latest 6% price jump to over $230 proves it’s not slowing down. Over the past year, SOL has skyrocketed by 220%, cementing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, now at a jaw-dropping $109 billion. But what’s fuelling this meteoric rise? A major catalyst is Solana’s integration of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technological leap that enhances privacy and scalability. Projects like ArciumHQ and Bonsol are pioneering encrypted on-chain computations, making Solana more appealing to developers and end-users alike. This isn’t just geeky blockchain jargon—it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build or use decentralised applications. Economic metrics also tell a compelling story. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) soared from $5.6 billion in November to an all-time high of $9.5 billion in early December. That’s a 70% increase in just over a month! It’s not just TVL, though; real monthly economic activity jumped from $158 million to $409 million, proving that Solana is more than hype. Solana’s ecosystem is also thriving. Binance Labs recently invested in Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure project, boosting capital efficiency within the network. Meanwhile, Solana’s first AI Hackathon, offering $185,000 in prizes, showcases its commitment to innovation. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Issues like sandwich attacks and concerns over validator mechanisms have sparked debates about network integrity. Still, Solana’s proactive community and proposed solutions, like reintroducing a public mempool, reflect a blockchain unafraid to confront challenges head-on. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in right now, Solana’s mix of innovation and resilience makes it a top contender. Ethereum (ETH): The Crypto Giant that keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top of the crypto pyramid for nothing. Despite the initial hype around its ETF launch fading, Ethereum has emerged stronger with a more grounded market outlook. It’s this ability to adapt and grow that makes ETH one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. One big boost to Ethereum’s reputation is the improved regulatory environment. With new SEC and CFTC chair nominations supportive of decentralised finance (DeFi), Ethereum is gaining credibility in mainstream finance. High-profile moves, like former President Trump’s WLFI profits being channelled into ETH, further underscore its appeal. Ethereum’s real strength lies in its versatility. From NFTs to DeFi protocols, it remains the go-to platform for developers and users. The network’s layer-2 solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, are easing congestion and reducing fees, making Ethereum more accessible than ever. However, Ethereum’s ETHBTC trading pair has been a topic of discussion. Critics once argued that it was overhyped, but shifting perspectives now highlight its stability and potential. As the crypto market matures, Ethereum’s foundational role becomes even more evident, offering long-term value that’s hard to beat. Ethereum’s community and ecosystem are its secret weapons. Whether it’s developers creating groundbreaking dApps or institutional investors recognising its worth, ETH’s network effects are unparalleled. For anyone eyeing the best cryptos to invest in right now, Ethereum’s proven track record and future promise are impossible to ignore. Seize Your Moment Cryptocurrency isn’t just about numbers; it’s about vision, innovation, and solving real-world problems. Qubetics’ transformative dVPN technology, Solana’s relentless push for scalability, and Ethereum’s adaptability make these projects the best cryptos to invest in right now. The clock’s ticking, especially with Qubetics’ presale set to hike prices soon. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the next big thing in blockchain. Act now. Join the Qubetics presale or stack up on Solana and Ethereum while the market’s buzzing. The future’s bright—be a part of it.

Among the myriad options, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Polkadot stand out as innovative projects driving the future of decentralised technology. This article will explore why these cryptos are considered the Best Cryptos to Join Now , highlighting their unique features, ongoing developments, and future potential. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain Interoperability Most networks operate in isolation in the current blockchain ecosystem , creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralised applications (dApps) and hampers the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining this narrative by establishing itself as a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple networks into a cohesive framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality , Qubetics enhances interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. This advancement unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users alike. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers an attractive investment opportunity. With weekly phases driving a 10% price hike and a culminating 20% rise in the final stage, the $TICS token is a valuable addition to any portfolio. Priced at $0.031, the presale has already raised over $5.7 million, boasting over 8,700 holders and 313 million tokens sold. These figures make Qubetics a compelling choice for investors seeking the Best Cryptos to Join Now. The seamless integration of multiple blockchains under Qubetics’ umbrella is expected to catalyse the adoption of decentralised technologies across industries, making it a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche: A Layer-1 Powerhouse with Exponential Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX), one of the leading layer-1 blockchain networks, has captured the attention of analysts and investors with its robust ecosystem and promising growth trajectory. Known for its high throughput and low latency, Avalanche has become a preferred platform for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and gaming. According to crypto analysts, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, has substantial room for growth. Notably, Kong Trading, a prominent figure in the crypto space, predicts that AVAX could rally to $1,000 by 2025. If this prediction comes to fruition, it would represent a staggering 2,027% increase from its current levels. This optimism stems from similar historical rallies in tokens like Mantra, Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Ripple (XRP). The prediction is anchored in the assumption that Ethereum’s price could rise between $10,000 and $20,000, which would likely have a positive ripple effect on other layer-1 networks like Avalanche. With its innovative technology and growing adoption, Avalanche is undeniably among the Best Cryptos to Join Now for long-term investors aiming to capitalise on exponential growth. Polkadot: The Pioneer of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot (DOT) is another standout project that prioritises interoperability and scalability. Created by Dr Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot facilitates the seamless transfer of messages and value across blockchains through its unique parachain architecture. Polkadot also offers lucrative staking opportunities for traders. The token provides a reward rate of 11.43%, an inflation rate of 8.83%, and a real reward rate of 2.38%. Major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken support DOT staking, making it accessible for users worldwide. These platforms also handle the technical complexities, allowing users to enjoy staking rewards without the burdens of managing the process themselves. Conclusion In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market continues to present groundbreaking opportunities, with Qubetics , Avalanche, and Polkadot emerging as key players poised to shape the future of decentralised technology. Qubetics’ innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, Avalanche’s robust growth potential in the layer-1 space, and Polkadot’s pioneering advancements in scalability and cross-chain functionality all position these projects as top choices for investors and blockchain enthusiasts. Whether through Qubetics’ presale momentum, Avalanche’s exponential price predictions, or Polkadot’s lucrative staking opportunities, these cryptocurrencies offer compelling avenues to participate in the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 01:50:00

CPI data hit the 2.7% mark as expected—neutral, stable, unexciting—but Thursday’s PPI at 0.4% raised eyebrows, doubling the forecast. Persistent producer price pressures are like termites—they won’t collapse the house overnight, but their presence gnaws away at the foundations of stability. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank decided to add a splash of liquidity with a 0.25% rate cut, a move that’s more band-aid than cure-all for the eurozone’s sluggish growth. These developments played their part in lifting the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which closed strong at 107 on Thursday. A resilient dollar might keep crypto inflows on a tight leash, cooling the risk-on narrative. Sure, a weak dollar boosts crypto optimism, but this isn’t that story—not yet. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the extreme greed lingered far too long, stretching nearly a month before being smacked down abruptly in Monday and Tuesday’s brutal crashes. But here’s the twist: extreme greed didn’t take long to resurface, climbing back to 80 yesterday. Today’s reading (Friday, December 13) shows this: If this all sounds familiar, it should. Two weeks ago, I explored in my article, ‘ Altcoin Season on the Horizon ?’, whether Ethereum could complete its “tasks” to confirm an altseason. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Instead, the rally fizzled, and altcoins never got their full confirmation. Let’s go back to some of these charts to check on our main hero—or villain—in this latest altcoin debacle. Ethereum (ETH): Weekly Insight Weekly Chart Highlights: Ethereum ($ETH ) remains in a critical consolidation pattern starting before Christmas last year within the rectangle top at $4,092, while strong supporting confluences align around $3,021 at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week MA. The recent weekly candle hints at potential exhaustion, marked by a possible hanging man pattern. Better not, still time. It’s a strong reversal candle pattern. Nie fajnie. No bueno. Traders should watch the weekly close carefully to confirm or invalidate this signal. But for now, to keep an eye on: Resistance Levels: $4,092 (rectangle top, critical breakout zone) $6,050 (rectangle breakout target and Fib extension) Key Support: $3,021 (golden pocket 0.618 Fibonacci + 50-week MA + … the rectangle mid-point ) Observations: The recent rally from $3,500 highlights buyer confidence, but RSI divergence suggests weakening momentum. A deeper correction could retest fib levels between $3,226 (0.5 Fib) and $3,021 (0.618). This week’s correction of 14.5% from the yearly high of $4,092 to $3,511 was shallow by crypto standards. However, dropping below the golden pocket at $3,021 would indicate a much more significant shift in market sentiment. This majestic rectangle continues to dominate Ethereum's macro outlook and, by extension, casts its influence over the entire altcoin market. It’s a battleground not unlike what we see in Total2, where resilience and rejection at key levels define the broader altcoin narrative. Let’s explore what Total2 reveals about the state of the altcoin market. Total2: Altcoin Market Cap Recovery 3-Day Chart Insights: Total2 paints a clear picture of resilience. Following its $1.65T rejection near the 2021 ATH, the altcoin market cap dropped 17.5% but rapidly rebounded to $1.53T. Notably, the cup-and-handle breakout remains intact, with a long-term target extending above $2T. Key Observations: Dip-buying culture is alive and well, as evidenced by the rapid rebound from recent lows. The resilience tells the story of how traders continue to seize opportunities during pullbacks. Markets are as much about psychology as they are about price action. The velocity of this rebound underscores how swiftly sentiment can pivot, flipping bullish for altcoins the moment a dip looks enticing. ETH to BTC: 12-Hour Structure Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) reflects broader altcoin momentum. Currently, ETH/BTC sits at 0.0384, just below the prior rectangle's top. While the head-and-shoulders pattern on lower timeframes highlights bearish risks, the market structure shift (higher low) offers a bullish possibility. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: 0.0403 (invalidate H&S, potential breakout level) Support: 0.0370 (critical zone to maintain higher low structure) 0.0346 (final support before breakdown towards the lows at 0.032) ETH/BTC’s relative strength is often a leading indicator of altseason’s health. A breakout above 0.0403, particularly if accompanied by volume, is crucial to confirm the narrative shift towards altcoin dominance. However, meeting this target alone won’t be enough. A simultaneous close above $4,100 for Ethereum and Total2 surpassing the 2021 blow-off top levels will be the ultimate confirmation. With all three conditions fulfilled, BTC dominance (BTC.D) should also trend lower, finally signaling the true start of an altcoin season. Failure to align these conditions would leave the market vulnerable to Bitcoin’s ( $BTC ) continued grip. Conclusion: Is the Nightmare Over? Despite a turbulent start to the week, altcoin fundamentals remain intact. Ethereum’s resilience above $3,500 and the rapid recovery in Total2 highlight renewed buy-the-dip enthusiasm. However, the next leg depends heavily on macro catalysts, particularly CPI and the FOMC decision. For now, traders should focus on critical resistance levels like $4,092 for ETH (plus 0.04 road-block on eth/btc ) and $1.65T for Total2 , while monitoring volume and RSI for confirmation. A breakout above these levels could mark the return of a full-fledged altcoin season.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, altcoins may underperform due to factors such as reduced capital rotation from BTC to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Likely To Continue Its Momentum Into 2025 In a report titled Crypto Market Outlook 2025, asset manager Sygnum outlined multiple factors that are likely to further push BTC price upwards next year. The report highlights new capital inflows into the market – particularly institutional inflows – as the primary driver for the crypto bull market in 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000? Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation The analysis highlights a ‘multiplier effect’ caused by institutional inflows combined with Bitcoin’s limited liquid supply. For instance, every $1 billion of net inflows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly triggers a 3-6% price increase. Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. 2025: A Watershed Year For BTC The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range. Related Reading: Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025 Further, BTC may benefit from central banks and local governments considering setting aside some part of their funds for BTC reserves. Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.
