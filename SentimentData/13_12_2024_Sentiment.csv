You might also like: DOGE, PEPE, XYZ: Analyzing the leader of the 2025 meme coin race Cardano Cardano is a big name in the world of cryptocurrencies. It’s a flexible and scalable platform designed for smart contracts. This means developers can build apps, tokens, and games on its blockchain. The native coin of Cardano is ADA. Like Ethereum’s ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and support the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being environmentally friendly. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which saves energy compared to other methods that use lots of power. The crypto market is paying attention to green technologies. Thus, Cardano’s eco-friendly approach gives it an edge over other coins. Additionally, its unique design allows for fast transactions, possibly up to a million per second. This is much quicker than many other blockchains. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and smart contracts, ADA could become even more important. While the market keeps changing, Cardano’s strong technology and focus on sustainability make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Toncoin Toncoin is the digital currency of The Open Network (TON), an open-source blockchain aiming for fast, secure payments with low fees. Initially developed by Telegram as the ‘Gram’ token for the Telegram Open Network, the project was halted in 2020 due to legal issues with the SEC. Since then, the non-profit TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over. The network uses proof-of-stake, enhancing its scalability and reliability. TON is building a full ecosystem with decentralized storage services, domain names, private networking, and efficient payment systems. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows great potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, some predictions estimate Toncoin could reach up to $30.30 by 2025, a significant increase from today’s price. In the current market, where fast and secure payment solutions are in demand, Toncoin’s technology could make it stand out. Its focus on a comprehensive ecosystem and minimal fees might attract more users. Conclusion While ADA and TON are solid, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for 20,000% growth in the 2024 bull run.

According to reports, the move comes with a clear caveat: tax exemptions will not be part of the package. This development was revealed by Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, during the Domestic Investment Opportunities forum recently hosted by Ekonomichna Pravda. Crypto Legalisation Timeline and Legislative Progress Hetmantsev announced that a draft law, developed in close collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is nearing completion. He mentioned that the draft is expected to be ready after the New Year, and the crypto legalization will be passed after that. This draft law builds on a milestone in November 2023, when Ukraine’s parliament introduced legislation on taxing virtual asset transactions. The passage of this new bill will mark the final step in creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. Similarly, Russia recently introduced a new crypto bill that focuses on crypto transactions. The bill aims to regulate digital assets and ensure compliance with financial laws. If Ukraine legalizes crypto in 2025, it will join countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. These nations have embraced virtual assets and implemented rules to manage risks and ensure compliance with tax and financial laws. The Taxation Model: No Special Privileges While legalizing digital assets is a significant move, the absence of tax exemptions reflects a cautious and practical approach. According to Hetmantsev, profits from crypto will be taxed under the same model applied to securities. Taxes will only be levied when assets are converted into traditional currency. This cautious approach aligns with international best practices, ensuring digital assets do not create loopholes in Ukraine’s tax system. Many countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Germany, have adopted a similarly cautious approach to the taxation of digital assets. Ukraine in the Crypto Space Ukraine has been a prominent player in the global crypto landscape, making consistent strides toward integrating digital assets into its economy. In 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament passed the “On Virtual Assets” law , which provided a legal definition for cryptocurrencies and recognized them as an asset class. This law laid the groundwork for the current efforts toward full-scale legalization. Also, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has actively collaborated with international blockchain companies and tech giants to develop a robust digital economy. During the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine embraced crypto donations. This move showcased the practical utility of digital assets during crises. The initiative raised millions to support defense and humanitarian efforts. As the first quarter of 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on Ukraine as it navigates the challenges and opportunities of becoming a fully crypto-legal nation.

For example, according to Etherscan , one whale moved coins worth over $1.7 million from Coinbase on Thursday. In line with this, tokens on exchanges have dropped to 254.4 million in the last seven days. They have been in a steady downward trend in the past few months. Second, Chainlink has forged significant partnerships in recent months. Earlier this week, the developers announced collaborations with Coinbase and Emirates NBD, a bank with over $200 billion in assets. Chainlink has also partnered with organizations like Swift Network. Notably, Swift recently conducted a large-scale tokenization trade with UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager. Swift plans to integrate Chainlink’s technology into its money movement business, which processes over $150 trillion annually. On top of this, Chainlink has become the biggest oracle network in terms of total value secured. The $38 billion it has secured is higher than the other ten oracles, combined. Chainlink price has strong technicals Chainlink price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that LINK has maintained a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. It recently crossed the critical resistance level at $22.85, its highest swing in March of this year. The coin has also moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level, and the percentage price oscillator has risen above the zero line. The next key level to watch is $52, Chainlink’s all-time high, which is about 88% above the current price. A decline below the support level of $22.85 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

This shift comes as these experienced players look beyond established tokens to capitalize on undervalued assets with game-changing potential. With projections of a massive 29,000% return, PCHAIN could outshine major cryptocurrencies and redefine what it means to invest early in a high-utility project. Cardano Whales Shift Focus: Why PropiChain is Their Next Big Target Cardano has long been a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space, with its innovative proof-of-stake protocol and focus on sustainability. It’s no surprise that whales continue to see its value. However, even as Cardano holds strong, these experienced investors are looking for opportunities to deliver more explosive returns, which is where PropiChain enters the picture. The whales’ interest in PropiChain is a clear indicator of its potential. Large-scale investors often have access to advanced analytics and industry insights, meaning their moves can serve as a beacon for others. PropiChain addresses inefficiencies in property transactions and captures attention in ways most altcoins can’t. For everyday investors, following the money might be the smartest move yet. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate Through Blockchain PropiChain stands out by addressing one of the world’s most lucrative markets through blockchain technology. PropiChain is redefining how people access and invest in property at its core by offering a suite of innovative features tailored to modern investment needs. Tokenized Real Estate : You can own a fraction of a high-end property without spending millions in capital. PropiChain’s tokenization model converts these properties into tokens, allowing you to buy small shares. This levels the playground for smaller investors to get in. This feature is perfect for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of traditional property ownership. Fractional Ownership : Gone are the days when real estate investing required hefty down payments and complex legal processes. With fractional ownership, an investor can own a percentage of a property for as little as a few thousand dollars, earning proportional returns from rent or value appreciation. AI-Powered Insights : PropiChain doesn’t just provide access to real estate, it equips investors with the tools to make smarter decisions. Its AI analytics platform offers predictive market trends, helping users identify high-growth areas before they explode in value. For example, the system might highlight a suburban market on the verge of a boom, giving early investors an edge. Metaverse Integration : Taking innovation further, PropiChain lets users explore properties virtually in its metaverse platform. This adds an interactive layer that traditional real estate platforms can’t match. PropiChain Presale’s 29,000% Growth Potential PropiChain is in its presale phase, offering a rare opportunity for early adopters to enter at a ground-floor price. The initial token price started at just $0.004 and has now risen to $0.011 in stage two. This structured presale model, combined with projections of 29,000% ROI, makes it an incredibly attractive proposition. Let’s break this down with a practical example: If you invested $1,000 in PropiChain during its presale, and the token hits its projected value, your investment could turn to $290,000. Compare this to Cardano, where similar returns are highly improbable due to its established market positions and limited room for explosive growth. PropiChain’s presale credibility is strengthened by its CMC listing and rigorous audits by BlockAudit, ensuring security and transparency. Moreover, the project has already raised over $1 million, with its first stage selling out rapidly. This demonstrates the immense interest and confidence in PropiChain’s vision. Conclusion PropiChain is rapidly becoming the talk of the crypto world, and for good reason. With the first presale already filled, it’s clear that this project is gaining traction and that it is time to act. Each passing day brings PropiChain closer to its next pricing stage, where early adopters will already see gains while new investors pay more. Secure your spot in the PropiChain presale today.

Earlier this week, a Dogecoin monitoring platform noticed that the number of DOGE nodes dipped from 647 to just 205, a decrease of about 69%. “Our monitoring made us aware that the vulnerability appears to have been exploited, and almost 69% of the Dogecoin network has crashed. Blockchair shows the number of public nodes. Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205.” However, according to Blockchair, some DOGE nodes have since recovered as there are currently 331 active nodes around the world at time of writing. In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Bitcoin ( BTC ) sidechain developer Andreas Kohl says that he was the one who took down most of the DOGE network using an old laptop. “I used a publicly disclosed vulnerability [by BTC developer Tobias Ruck] to take down 69% of the Dogecoin network from an old thinkpad in rural El Salvador.” According to Kohl, most DOGE users didn’t even notice . “Only nodes that weren’t on the latest version were affected – which was the majority of the network, excluding CEXs (centralized exchanges) and most other major custodians – hence why most doge users never noticed, not that many understand self-custody.” News of the exploit had little impact on the price of DOGE as the meme asset is trading for $0.413 at time of writing, a 4.7% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Instead, it offers a high-capacity network that attracts developers and investors looking to host products and services with high activity. SOL is Solana’s native cryptocurrency. It is important in the ecosystem because it helps with transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards people who support the network. The coin has value because it underpins how Solana works and lets users access various projects on the platform.

Let’s understand why. The crypto market in 2024 has been nothing short of transformative, with major milestones taking center stage throughout the year. Against this backdrop, Bitwise has made a series of bold predictions for 2025, bringing into focus the next big trends in the industry. Let’s dive into the details of each prediction and unravel the market conditions to assess how realistic these forecasts are and what they could mean for the future of the industry. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Stablecoins and tokenized assets The road ahead Bitcoin’s rise fueled by ETFs and adoption The first of these claims is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar beyond $200,000 in 2025. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin is trading at $100,500 levels as of Dec. 12, a minor step back from its all-time high of $103,900 achieved just a week ago on Dec. 5. BTC Price Chart | Source: crypto.news This dip, marking a 3.5% retreat, comes on the heels of a broader market correction following an extraordinary bull run earlier in the year. Bitcoin first broke its previous all-time high of $73,000 in March, setting off a wave of optimism that reached a crescendo in November when Donald Trump was elected the 47th President of the U.S. His administration’s perceived pro-crypto stance has injected fresh confidence into the market. While the recent pullback may have tempered the frenzy, the overarching bullish sentiment remains intact. Adding fuel to this optimism is the explosive growth in Bitcoin ETFs , which Bitwise predicts will attract even more inflows in 2025 than they did in 2024. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of this year, total assets under management across these ETFs have reached an astonishing $113 billion as of Dec. 12, according to CoinGlass. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner, drawing in the lion’s share of inflows. In just the past week, a record-breaking $3.85 billion flowed into digital asset funds, with BlackRock accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. Bitwise’s third prediction ties closely to the first two, forecasting that the number of countries holding Bitcoin will double by 2025. The idea of nation-states accumulating Bitcoin is not new, but it is gaining traction as governments recognize its potential as a reserve asset. Currently, eight nations hold Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading the pack with over 207,000 BTC, valued at more than $20.6 billion as of today. China follows closely, holding 194,000 BTC worth $19.3 billion. Other notable holders include the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador, with holdings ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of BTC. Collectively, all these nations control 529,558 BTC, which is roughly 2.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million coins. If the number of countries holding Bitcoin does indeed double, we could see a profound shift in geopolitical strategies, with Bitcoin serving as a new kind of reserve asset. Coinbase and MicroStrategy’s market potential Bitwise’s next set of predictions for 2025 claims that Coinbase (COIN) stock will exceed $700 per share by 2025. Currently trading at $313, Coinbase has seen a 100% year-to-date gain. For context, Coinbase’s all-time high was $429.54, achieved during its debut on April 13, 2021, while its lowest point came on January 5, 2023, at $31.55. From its all-time low to today’s price, the stock has surged by over 900%, showing a dramatic turnaround. However, achieving the predicted $700 mark would require an additional 120% increase. Another fascinating prediction centers on Coinbase’s potential entry into the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. For Coinbase, joining the prestigious S&P 500 would signify its maturation as a blue-chip stock, reserved for companies with a market capitalization exceeding $18 billion and meeting specific profitability criteria. While Coinbase has faced volatility since its IPO, its strong recovery in 2023 and consistent performance in 2024 make it a viable candidate for the index. On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s transformation from a business software company to a corporate Bitcoin pioneer has redefined its market presence, with its stock price climbing 500% year-to-date, trading at $411 levels as of this writing, down from its 52-week high of $543. The idea of MicroStrategy joining the Nasdaq-100 and possibly the S&P 500 has generated considerable buzz. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the company is a strong contender for the Nasdaq-100, with an announcement expected soon. $MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic). Below is best guess of adds/drops via @JSeyff . Likely a 0.47% weight (40th biggest holding). There's $550b of ETFs tracking the index. S&P 500 add next yr prob. pic.twitter.com/rmTavtvWQL — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 10, 2024 However, its inclusion in the S&P 500 remains more challenging due to stricter criteria and the index committee’s selective approach. Another exciting prediction for 2025 is that at least five crypto unicorns will go public in the U.S. With around 30 crypto unicorns currently operating in the U.S. — including well-known names like Ripple ( XRP ), OpenSea, and Chainalysis —t he pipeline for potential IPOs is robust. An influx of crypto-related IPOs would not only provide new investment opportunities but also signal the sector’s maturation as it transitions from niche to mainstream. Crypto’s path into 401(k) plans Bitwise’s next prediction for 2025 revolves around the U.S. Department of Labor potentially relaxing its current guidance against including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans. To understand the potential impact, it’s important to first unpack the current state of affairs and why crypto in retirement accounts has been a contentious issue. As of now, the Department of Labor maintains a cautious stance toward crypto in retirement plans. In March 2022, the agency issued a compliance bulletin warning fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” when allowing cryptocurrencies in 401(k) offerings. The DOL raised concerns about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, their price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the risks of fraud and theft. The agency argued that these factors make digital assets unsuitable for most retirement savers, whose investment horizons are long and whose risk tolerance is generally low. Under this guidance, the inclusion of crypto in 401(k) plans has been rare. A few instances of integration, such as Fidelity’s introduction of a Bitcoin option for its 401(k) plans in 2022, faced immediate scrutiny. The DOL cautioned Fidelity and other firms offering similar products to ensure compliance with fiduciary duties, effectively discouraging broader adoption. Employers have been hesitant to expose themselves to potential liability, resulting in a limited presence of crypto within retirement portfolios. If the prediction of relaxed guidance in 2025 comes true, it would mark a major policy reversal. Such a shift would likely be driven by growing demand from younger generations of workers who see crypto as a legitimate asset class. Surveys have consistently shown that millennials and Gen Z investors view crypto as a vital component of their long-term financial strategies. For example, a 2023 Charles Schwab study found that 47% of millennials already hold crypto in some capacity, and 45% expressed interest in including it in their retirement accounts if given the option. The potential market impact of this change is enormous. According to the Investment Company Institute, U.S. 401(k) plans held approximately $7.7 trillion in assets as of December 2023. Even a small percentage of this being allocated to cryptocurrencies could inject heavy liquidity into the market and further legitimize the space. Stablecoins and tokenized assets Bitwise’s predictions for 2025 also include a bold outlook on the stablecoin market and the tokenized real-world assets space. The first projection foresees stablecoin assets doubling to over $400 billion, a substantial leap from their current market capitalization of $207 billion as of Dec. 12. Tether ( USDT ) dominates this market with a commanding share of approximately 67.6%, backed by its $140 billion market cap. USDT’s closest competitor, USD Coin ( USDC ), lags behind with a market cap of $41 billion, making it roughly 3.4 times smaller. Stablecoins are frequently used as trading pairs on exchanges, providing a bridge between crypto assets and fiat currencies. Moreover, their role in facilitating cross-border transactions has also gained attention, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. The second prediction centers on the tokenized real-world asset market, which is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025. According to a September 2024 Binance report, the total value of tokenized RWAs hit an all-time high of over $12 billion, excluding stablecoins. On-chain real-world assets (""RWAs"") have reached an all-time high. Our new report explores this recent growth, outlines key RWA categories, and provides a tech-driven tour of some of the most interesting protocols in the space. Read on 🔽 https://t.co/1w8gr3Nrkg — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) September 13, 2024 RWAs refer to blockchain-based representations of physical and financial assets such as real estate, government bonds, commodities, and even fine art. Tokenization allows these assets to be divided into smaller units, making them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Key categories in the RWA space include tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and real estate, with emerging categories such as carbon credits and air rights also gaining traction. Traditional asset managers have already begun to tokenize illiquid assets like real estate or fine art to offer investors opportunities to diversify their holdings in ways that were previously challenging or cost-prohibitive. A McKinsey report from June 2024 estimates that the tokenized market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030, underpinned by increasing demand for transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership in financial markets. The road ahead The future of the crypto market looks exciting, with Bitwise’s 2025 predictions pointing to major shifts ahead. Bitcoin could hit new highs, stablecoins could double in value, and tokenized real-world assets could gain traction as the next big thing. But these changes will depend on how the market grows, how regulations evolve, and how technology keeps up. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Per the media outlet CoinPost and the official House of Councillors record , the demand came from Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK. A National Bitcoin Reserve for Japan? Hamada submitted a written question to the government “regarding the creation of a reserve fund for cryptoassets.” Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada In the question, the lawmaker noted there moves are now afoot “in Brazil and the United States,” where Treasury officials could soon begin holding Bitcoin (BTC) as a “strategic reserve asset.” Hamada went on to ask the Japanese government to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.” He added that the incoming Donald Trump administration will appoint a so-called crypto “czar” and explained that “similar movements are also underway in Brazil.” The lawmaker mentioned that BTC could soon become a “national strategic asset.” He submitted his request in a document entitled: “Question regarding the status of understanding the movement to introduce a national Bitcoin reserve in the United States and other countries.” Decentralized Solution Hamada’s question also made note of the fact that BTC is “less susceptible to the influence of specific countries or institutions.” And he said that its “neutrality and decentralized nature” allows Bitcoin to support economic activity” without “relying on any specific currency.” The government is set to provide Hamada with a written response in the coming weeks, and will likely publish this on its official website. A new risk for the yen is emerging, with currency strategists in Tokyo warning that there’s a chance the Bank of Japan may stand pat on interest rates until March or later https://t.co/tUNZ6lFvSM — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 12, 2024 Lawmakers Share Sentiment? Hamada represents a political party that only has two seats in parliament. But there is a high probability that other MPs share Hamada’s views. Japan’s relatively restrictive regulations have resulted in a shrinking crypto market. But many top lawmakers still want to turn the nation into a global blockchain hotspot. They have urged Tokyo to reform crypto tax laws and prevent promising crypto startups from relocating overseas. Meanwhile, the business sector is growing increasingly Bitcoin-keen, with some Japanese firms using their balance sheet to buy BTC and altcoins . Many regulatory bodies appear ready to make the necessary reforms. But the nation’s new Prime Minister has expressed a more cautious view on crypto regulation reform .

This is significant, considering how it could set Shiba Inu on a path to higher prices. Most SHIB Holders In The Green As Shiba Inu Price Rebounds IntoTheBlock data shows that most SHIB holders are in the green as the Shiba Inu price rebounds towards $0.00003. 69% of these SHIB holders are now in the money, while 24% are out of the money, and 6% are currently in the money. This could be bullish for the Shiba Inu price, considering that holders are less likely to sell when they are in the money. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Last Phase Of ABC Wave Points To A Bounce To New ATH At $5.85 This could reduce the selling pressure on SHIB and sustain the Shiba Inu price recovery. The meme coin has recovered towards $0.00003. The ‘In the Money’ metric shows that the next significant resistance level that Shiba Inu needs to break above is $0.000033. 130,620 wallet addresses bought 15.06 trillion SHIB tokens around this level. However, on-chain metrics still paint a bearish picture for Shiba Inu, which is undoubtedly concerning. IntoTheBlock data shows that the ‘Concentration’ metric is in the red, indicating that SHIB whales currently have a bearish sentiment towards the meme coin and are opting against accumulating more coins. This large transaction metric is also bearish at the moment as Shiba Inu whales are opting against accumulating more coins. The net network growth also paints a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu price, as there is currently a low influx of new addresses buying the meme coin. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also remained inconsistent, further presenting a bearish outlook for the Shiba Inu price. Shibburn data shows that the burn rate is down over 79% in the last 24 hours, with three million coins burned during this period. From A Technical Analysis Perspective Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu from a technical analysis perspective. In an X post, he stated that Shiba Inu recently confirmed another bullish pattern, which could lead to a continuation of its upward trend. The analyst added that another major upside move could be in play for SHIB, with the meme coin possibly rallying to $0.00081 or even higher. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible The crypto analyst further mentioned that with this target at $0.000081, the Shiba Inu price could witness a 180% climb and that this rally may already be in play. A rally to $0.000081 could pave the way for Shiba Inu to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000029, up over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

After months of speculation, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, thrilling both long-time HODLers and fresh investors alike. The cherry on top? Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing a steady influx of funds, showing a renewed wave of institutional confidence. Fidelity, ARK, and Grayscale are leading the charge, with millions flowing into their ETFs as BTC maintains its climb. Meanwhile, Ethereum is quietly but powerfully making its case, with analysts eyeing the $5,000 milestone thanks to growing demand and tightening supply dynamics. It’s a bullish December for crypto, and the buzz is palpable. Amid this surge, Qubetics ($TICS) has been making waves of its own. Unlike many speculative projects, Qubetics aims to solve real-world challenges by bringing asset tokenisation into the mainstream. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is all about solving real-world problems for real people. Ever thought about how clunky and fragmented the process of managing real-world assets can be? That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s all about tokenising real-world assets —from real estate to intellectual property—and making them tradable on the blockchain. Picture this: a small business owner needs to raise capital but doesn’t want to go through the red tape of traditional financing. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their inventory or even future revenue streams. Investors get a piece of the action, and the business gets liquidity. Qubetics lets them do just that, creating a win-win for creators and fans. For more information, check out this exclusive AMA Session . The numbers don’t lie. The Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 313 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 8,700 holders, raising a staggering $5.7 million so far. At just $0.0311 per token, it’s an entry point that screams potential. The prices are set to jump by 10% this weekend. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to dive in, this is it. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto platform; it’s a revolution. By bridging the gap between physical and digital assets, it’s opening doors that were previously bolted shut. Whether you’re a business, a professional, or just someone looking to diversify their portfolio, Qubetics offers a fresh, innovative approach to asset management. And with its presale momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the time to act is now. Bitcoin: The King Reclaims The Crown, Smashes $100K Barrier Bitcoin is smashing through ceilings, and $100,000 isn’t just another number—it’s a statement. After years of scepticism, the flagship cryptocurrency has cemented itself as more than just digital gold. What’s fuelling this latest rally? It’s the ETFs, baby. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have been on fire, pulling in $223 million in just one day. Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC are attracting cash like a magnet, proving institutional investors are in it for the long haul. This ETF frenzy didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s a mix of perfect timing and a maturing market. Inflation data has eased fears of aggressive rate hikes, nudging the Fed toward a potential cut. That’s music to Bitcoin’s ears. Add to that a trading volume of $3.94 billion for BTC investment products, and you’ve got a market roaring with optimism. But let’s keep it real. Bitcoin isn’t just about big-shot ETFs and six-figure price tags. For the everyday investor, it’s about resilience and reliability. Think about it: Bitcoin has outperformed most traditional assets this year. Whether you’re stacking sats or eyeing a long-term hold, Bitcoin’s recent performance is a masterclass in staying power. And if history is any guide, the king’s reign is far from over. Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Big Break While Bitcoin grabs headlines, Ethereum is quietly orchestrating a rally of its own. Hovering around $5,000, ETH is poised for what could be its most significant breakout yet. Why? It’s all about the fundamentals. Since the introduction of spot ETFs in July, institutional demand for Ethereum has surged. Over 3.41 million ETH are now held in these funds, up from 2.716 million just a few months ago. That’s a whole lot of confidence from big-money players. Then there’s Ethereum’s supply story. With every transaction burning ETH, the network is seeing deflationary forces at play. Higher activity on the blockchain means more ETH gets removed from circulation. It’s like a double-edged sword that only sharpens the asset’s scarcity. And speaking of activity, Ethereum’s daily transactions are off the charts, with smart contracts and dApps fuelling the ecosystem like never before. But here’s where Ethereum gets really interesting: its adaptability. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn’t just a store of value; it’s the backbone of decentralised finance, NFTs, and so much more. Whether you’re a DeFi junkie or a casual dApp user, ETH offers a slice of something bigger. With its realised price hovering around $5,200, the stars seem to be aligning for a push past $5K. Could this be the moment Ethereum leaves its mark as more than Bitcoin’s little brother? It sure feels like it. Make Your Move This December, the crypto market is buzzing with opportunities. Bitcoin’s climb past $100K proves it’s still the king of the hill, while Ethereum’s deflationary dynamics set the stage for a major rally. But if you’re looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presale offers a chance to get in early on a project that’s truly breaking new ground. Don’t let this moment pass you by. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes in the crypto waters, these three options are shaping up to be the best cryptos to invest in this month. Act now, and let your portfolio ride the wave.

The books span genres, languages, and authors such as Dickens, Dante, and Shakespeare which are no longer copyright protected because of their age. The new dataset initiative comes as AI training data is naturally pricey and best suited for tech firms with deep pockets. Harvard got financial backing from tech giants According to a TechCrunch article, the initiative is spearheaded by the Harvard’s Institutional Data Initiative (IDI). This initiative contains books derived from Google’s longstanding book-scanning project Google Books . Other books contained in the dataset include Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. The university teased the IDI in March clearly stating its plans to create a “trusted conduit for legal data for AI.” Since then, not much was heard from it until the formal launch on Thursday and tech giants Microsoft and OpenAI funded the project. The dataset is not a preserve of Silicon Valley alone but IDI has opened it to anyone, that is from research labs to AI startups that want to train their large language models. By opening the dataset to anyone, IDI executive director Greg Leppert said the dataset is meant to level the playing field, at a time when the cost of training AI remains high and prohibitive to smaller companies and making it preserve of those with huge budgets. Leppert added that the dataset is “rigorously reviewed,” which according to Fudzilla presumably means someone checked to ensure that Bard was really gone and out of the way. The Harvard dataset will need more resources According to Leppert, who compared the dataset’s potential to Linux, the open source operating system, the success of the Harvard dataset will be hinged on a number of variables. Leppert said its success will require more resources, expertise, and a “sprinkle of magic” from those same deep-pocketed corporations that the initiative is designed to challenge. The million books contained in the dataset were scanned as part of Google Books program. Fudzilla describes the initiative as a digital time capsule from when Google’s ambitions to scan every book seemed quirky rather than dystopian. However, Leppert is upbeat about the project’s potential uses, further suggesting it could a such a treasure trove helping train AI models for everyone from garage startups to the corporate conglomerates. While some have praised the initiative as a revolutionary leap forward in democratizing AI, Fudzilla opines that some might see this as a subtle means of ensuring that any ambitious upstart with a few terabytes of server space can now compete in a race to develop the next ChatGPT. However, they will need more resources to compete and make a dent in the market. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred the race for generative AI models across the globe. However, the development of these models has created a thirst for data to perfect them and this desire for more data has caused problems on how much information they can get, without stealing it. To date, publishers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have sued OpenAI and Perplexity over using their data without permission.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lunex Network, a new protocol, is attracting Avalanche and XRP investors as their prices lose strength. Table of Contents XRP braces for price correction Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Lunex Network to deliver extensive trader benefits Avalanche (AVAX) and Ripple (XRP) have both seen losses this week. This hasn’t come as a shock for Avalanche, as the project has struggled to gain momentum this year. For XRP, this loss could mark the end of the asset’s wild ride, having rallied last month. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been gaining traction in the trading space for its modern approach to crypto. It promises to address long-time trader frustrations by offering low fees, strong interoperability, and powerful trading tools. XRP braces for price correction XRP is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last week. Many experts expect corrective price action as XRP saw wild growth throughout November, rallying by 300%. The XRP price growth likely occurred as a result of Trump’s appointment, pointing towards a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto platforms in the near future. Ripple has also worked hard to improve its ledger and is now seen as a real authority in the cross-border payment space. Avalanche introduces Avalanche9000 Avalanche added 31% to its value over the year, a level of growth dwarfed by the wider crypto market expansion. AVAX is still slowing down and possibly heading downward after dropping 12% in 24 hours and 13% in the last week. Despite the underwhelming price performance, Avalanche has released some well received updates. Specifically, the Avalanche9000 upgrade was recently released on the testnet and is set to bring flexibility and scalability to the network. This will make Avalanche a more hospitable place for developers looking to build intelligent and scalable decentralized applications.

At the core of Lunex Network is the LNEX token, designed for long-term stability and growth. With a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, scarcity may drive value higher as adoption increases. Notably, LNEX holders will receive 18% of the platform’s profits from transaction fees, promoting sustained investment and ecosystem expansion. Lunex Network is currently generating major hype in the crypto space, with tokens available at $0.0044. Analysts anticipate an 1,800% increase in the value of LNEX in the near future, suggesting a promising opportunity for those looking to benefit from the next wave of DeFi.

This activity is part of Ripple’s intensified testing phase for its stablecoin, which is set to launch soon following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple Mints Over 13M RLUSD Amid Imminent Launch Data from Ripple’s Stablecoin Tracker reveals the minting of 13.9 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network. On the XRP Ledger, Ripple minted 2.6 million RLUSD, followed by three additional mints of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. Concurrently, the Ethereum Network recorded mints of 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens. The stablecoin, which is fully backed by onshore U.S. assets, has been undergoing rigorous tests involving minting and transfers across these networks. Ripple confirmed that these tests are aimed at ensuring the stablecoin’s functionality before its official debut. Moreover, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on X (formerly Twitter), saying, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” Regulatory Approval Sets RLUSD Apart from Competitors Ripple has secured NYDFS approval, making RLUSD one of the few U.S.-regulated stablecoins. Unlike competitors like USDT and USDC, RLUSD meets strict requirements under U.S. financial regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III standards. The stablecoin is fully collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and held in regulated custody, ensuring compliance with Federal Reserve and FDIC guidelines. US banks can hold #RLUSD on the XRPL/ETH ledger, and why USDC and USDT cannot. Here's an explanation of why RLUSD is so special and why it took years to get approved… READ ON Regulations Summary: U.S. GAAP/IFRS: Assets must have clear value, reliable measurement, and meet… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 11, 2024 This regulatory approval positions RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. According to Ripple, its transparent operations, including real-time audits, differentiate it from other stablecoins. USDT, for example, has faced scrutiny for inconsistent audits, while USDC operates partially offshore, making compliance with certain U.S. standards challenging. Analysts Assess XRP Price Movement Amid RLUSD Developments The approval and testing of RLUSD have coincided with a notable increase in XRP’s market value. XRP has risen from $1.90 to $2.35, with some analysts describing this as a “speculative pump.” Software engineer Vincent Van Code stated that XRP’s price could see further gains if RLUSD enters decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Van Code emphasized that liquidity pool (LP) and automated market maker (AMM) features for RLUSD on the XRP Ledger could drive demand. He suggested that users earning returns through LPs might contribute to increased XRP adoption. Additionally, the ability to swap RLUSD with other stablecoins or use it for on-chain staking could further integrate RLUSD into DeFi activities. Amid RLUSD-related developments, significant XRP transactions have been observed. Over 39.43 million XRP, valued at $95.5 million, was moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Separately, a whale transferred approximately 99.99 million XRP worth $234.4 million between unknown wallets.

Climbing by over 298% to trade at just over $2.30 from about $0.57, XRP is reigniting investor interest in altcoins. As Ripple’s token solidifies its position, a new competitor is quietly emerging: RCO Finance (RCOF) . This overlooked altcoin is making a name for itself with its 16,509% growth potential, unique features and scalable ecosystem. RCOF is quickly establishing itself, offering a unique opportunity for quick-witted investors looking to capitalize on high-growth opportunities. XRP Price Rally: Key Drivers Behind Its Growth The resurgence of Ripple’s native token is driven by increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and its established role in the payment sector. These factors have propelled the XRP price to new highs, promising more returns. The most notable factor driving the XRP price up is Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC. This ruling clarified XRP’s status and helped remove the uncertainty clouded the altcoin since 2020. This favorable ruling has fueled a wave of adoption, especially by institutional investors, positioning XRP as a reliable asset that drives XRP price appreciation. As a pioneer in cross-border payment, XRP’s ability to facilitate fast and cost-effective international payments has made it the go-to solution for financial institutions. With XRP upgrading its XRP ledger, it has enhanced its utility in facilitating and streamlining global transactions, increasing demand for XRP tokens. This has, in turn, reinforced its market value, driving up the XRP price. Lastly, the XRP price rises as it rides the tailwinds of Bitcoin’s impressive performance. BTC’s gains and positive sentiment have spilled over, creating a conducive environment for altcoins like XRP to thrive. RCO Finance, The Overlooked Altcoin With 16,509% Growth Potential Following the impressive performance of the XRP price, savvy investors are now looking for other altcoins with similar growth potential.

That emerged recently when CZ’s tweet about a leading crypto-centered travel platform saw its token rise exponentially within an hour. The crypto billionaire’s tacit endorsement of Travala on X spurred a 300% spike in the platform’s AVA token price. CZ was responding to Travala’s post celebrating a significant milestone in its revenues. His tweet came out as a tacit endorsement of Travala renewing interest in it. His post went: We invested in this crypto travel platform pre-COVID, pre-crypto winter, and held on. BUILD. ~Changpeng Zhao In 2024, Travala grew its 2023 gross revenue by over 67% Travala has made big strides in consolidating its position within the crypto-travelling/hospitality niche. In 2024, for instance, it recorded annual revenues of over $100 million, a massive jump from the $59.6 million it earned in 2023. The firm attributes that spike to an uptick in flight and accommodation bookings on its platform. Users can make reservations for these services in 100+ cryptocurrencies. Buoyed by this result, Travala announced it would be setting up its Bitcoin and AVA reserves. It says that the move was vital in expanding its financial muscle. With these additional funds, the company intends to strengthen its foothold within the blockchain-based travel industry and enhance its incentives program. The firm has pushed innovation in the travel sector Travala has always championed innovation in the travel sector. For instance, it pioneered crypto bookings using different digital assets. It also introduced Dtravel, a decentralized alternative to Airbnb. Unlike other P2P travel market services, Dtravel hosts have a share in the platform. Meanwhile, Binance is ramping up its blockchain investments. This year alone, its investment arm Binance Labs, undertook various major projects. One of these is its collaboration with Kernel to develop restaking infrastructure on its BNB Chain. This infrastructure will support the integration of tokens like BTC and BNB. Again, Binance pivoted into decentralized scientific research by investing in the BIO Protocol to expand funding in the area. It also funded Lombard, which specializes in Bitcoin liquid staking. These developments highlight its commitment to supporting new projects across the blockchain ecosystem.

Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings are now following the playbook, issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Clearly, these guys are no longer satisfied with just validating transactions and earning rewards. Instead, they’re mimicking MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor’s tactic of turning corporate resources into a Bitcoin stockpile machine. Wall Street’s obsession with the skyrocketing MSTR—up over 600% this year—is impossible to ignore. Hedge funds are loving the opportunity, deploying arbitrage strategies that take advantage of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility. Miners can’t keep up with MicroStrategy’s pace Despite the hype, Riot and MARA aren’t seeing the same success as MicroStrategy. Since the software company started its Bitcoin-buying spree in 2020, Riot and MARA shares have underperformed. Both remain far below their 2021 highs. The April Bitcoin halving event didn’t help. It slashed the rewards miners earn for adding new blocks to the blockchain, putting a major dent in profits. Throw in increased competition, and miners are now fighting an uphill battle to stay relevant. Riot’s convertible notes have raised eyebrows though. The notes came with a 32.5% conversion premium, lower than MicroStrategy’s November issuance, which had a 55% premium. Riot is also facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value, which recently took a stake in the company. Starboard is pushing the miner to shift some of its operations toward hyperscalers—large-scale data center users—rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, analysts are questioning the long-term viability of using convertible debt to stockpile Bitcoin. Stephen Glagola from JonesTrading has expressed doubts about this strategy, saying, “We would prefer the company to increase BTC held per share organically with its mining operations.” Meanwhile, investment giant BlackRock is cautiously endorsing Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The firm suggests investors allocate up to 2% to Bitcoin but only if they’re prepared to stomach its wild volatility. MicroStrategy on its way to Nasdaq 100, critics weigh in MicroStrategy is now eyeing a spot in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a move that could trigger massive passive inflows into its stock. Exchange-traded funds worth $451 billion track the index, and inclusion would mean huge stock purchases. But not everyone is sold on the idea. Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin makes it more of a financial entity than a technology company. Michael Lebowitz from RIA Advisors went as far as calling it “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin holdings. Despite the criticisms, MicroStrategy has amassed a $98 billion market cap, largely due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now holds over $40 billion in Bitcoin, but its core software business isn’t doing so hot. It reported a $340 million net loss in Q3 this year. Still, its Bitcoin-focused strategy has kept its stock soaring, even as skeptics question its sustainability. MicroStrategy has branded itself as a “Bitcoin Treasury Company.” This identity could work in its favor for Nasdaq inclusion, as the index excludes financial companies. Its classification as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark might be its saving grace. But Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has warned that a reclassification could be on the horizon, jeopardizing its eligibility.

With this decision, crypto exchanges can now list Pump.fun memecoins on their portfolio with full compliance coverage, and even governments can check for scams or rug pulls. Chainalysis will offer full compliance coverage for Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins Chainalysis has extended its coverage to Solana’s Pump.fun memecoins. Chainalysis Product Director Matthew Wilson even commented on the support extension, saying: Today, Chainalysis extended our Solana coverage to include every Solana token in KYT and Reactor. From the moment an SPL contract is deployed, Chainalysis offers complete alerting, exposure and tracing. ~ Director Matthew Wilson He added that exchanges can add Solana’s memecoins to their portfolio, arguing that compliance support is guaranteed. He even said governments could monitor the tokens for fraud. Schwartz Associates director Christopher Roberts has congratulated Chainalysis on the update, saying it’s “one of the many reasons” they are happy to work with the data analytic platform. A compliance consultant on LinkedIn named Stephen Sergent, on Chainalysis’s move, jokingly remarked how he can now lose his shirt on these meme coins compliantly. Pump.fun lost the British market following the FCA’s operational ban in the UK While Chainalysis’s move to support Solana memecoins promises that governments can easily track scams and fraud involving these tokens, some governments have already lost trust in the Solana meme coin launchpad. For starters, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has restricted the use of Pump.fun in the country. The FCA first cautioned users against the platform on December 3, warning them of potential scams. The agency said the platform targeted UK crypto consumers despite being unauthorized to operate. Currently, UK-based users can no longer access Pump.fun. Any user who tries to use the Pump.fun website from the UK is notified of the instituted restricted access . However, the FCA did provide a link for users to withdraw their coins in their private wallets. The regulatory authority still maintains that customers using unauthorized firms like Pump.fun risk losing their funds.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 00:28:24

Among the skeptics is Atomic Wallet, a decentralized non-custodial wallet, which has drawn attention for its recent remarks criticizing XRP and its investors. Concerns Over Sustainability of Gains The asset recently achieved a milestone by hitting a seven-year high of $2.87, following an impressive 485% surge over four weeks. However, this upward trajectory faced a setback during a market-wide correction, with the token’s value dropping to $2.34—over 32% below its peak. While XRP supporters celebrated the significant gains, critics, including Atomic Wallet, raised doubts about the sustainability of the asset’s rally. They pointed to the token’s historical pattern of sharp corrections following rapid price increases. Atomic Wallet’s Bold Prediction In a controversial tweet, Atomic Wallet questioned whether XRP holders are prepared for the asset’s value potentially declining to $0.50. The wallet further asserted that the asset would not reach $3 again and committed to deleting its X account if the token surpassed that level in the future. This criticism comes after it previously made sarcastically bullish remarks about the token. For instance, on December 2, the wallet jokingly stated it would not sell its XRP holdings until the price reached $300. Community Responds Atomic Wallet’s statements have sparked a backlash from XRP supporters. Community members have accused the wallet provider of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent voices within the community, such as Panos Mekras , have called for a complete boycott of Atomic Wallet and urged users to switch to alternative platforms. Critics have also highlighted Atomic Wallet’s security record, referencing a multi-million-dollar hack in 2023 as evidence that the company should focus on securing its services rather than commenting on market trends. The backlash has also drawn attention to Atomic Wallet’s seemingly contradictory stance on XRP. Previously, the wallet encouraged its users to buy the asset and had shared positive commentary about it. Despite the controversy, the asset remains a topic of interest in the cryptocurrency space. While skeptics warn of extended downturns, supporters believe in its long-term potential, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments and blockchain technology.

That makes for a good title, but actually, that only amounts to tokens worth around $500 being burnt. That’s pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of things, with Shiba Inu’s market cap around $16.58 billion as of Thursday. Still, in a world dominated by highly inflationary fiat currencies, where the M2 US dollar money supply is up by around 50% since 2020 per TradingEconomics data , it’s a reminder of the benefits of non-inflationary cryptocurrencies. Of course, protection against inflation isn’t really a narrative for meme coins like Shiba Inu, that’s more the realm of Bitcoin (BTC) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a much more speculative bet, a meme coin that relies upon hype cycles, and its ever-growing and highly dedicated community of followers, investors and aficionados. While the latest deflation figures from shibburn.com are unlikely to move the needle for Shiba Inu, there are plenty of other reasons for investors to be excited right now. Shiba Inu – Could a Parabolic Rally Be Next? $SHIB was last trading just above $0.000028, within recent ranges and close to its 21DMA. The stunning rally in early November thanks to President Trump’s US Presidential election victory has mostly petered out at this point. But Shiba Inu’s strong bounce from its 50DMA earlier this week suggests the bulls remain in control of this market and price predictions remain bullish. And that should come as no surprise, given all the positive developments going on in the USA right now. The incoming US administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, and the new Congress, also very pro-crypto, is expected to deliver regulatory certainty to the industry next year. Trump was literally jawboning about how he will “do something great with crypto” during his upcoming term.

But that won’t mean a gradual grind higher. Meme coins like Shiba Inu tend to experience rapid parabolic moves higher.

So, if parabolic rallies are right around the corner for Shiba Inu, how high could the meme coin go. Well, once the meme coin breaks above its prior record levels of just under $0.000090 and enters price discovery, it’s really anyone’s guess. But a rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see $SHIB attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. Either way, the near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Solana ( SOL )-based GIGA, a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, is up more than 39% from its $0.04911 low on Tuesday, the day it was listed on Coinbase. GIGA is trading for $0.06844 at time of writing. With a market cap of $657.9 million, Gigachad is the 183rd largest crypto project. Coinbase also added support for Magic Eden ( ME ) on the Solana network, a utility token for the Magic Eden non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. Users can list their Solana-based NFTs for sale in ME and earn tokens from the sales as well, says the project. ME is trading for $5.15 at time of writing, down 12% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $673.5 million, ME is the 178th largest market cap. Lastly, Coinbase added support for Ethereum ( ETH )-based Turbo ( TURBO ), a GPT-4 created memecoin inspired by a toad character. The project celebrated the support on the social media platform X. “TURBO is now live on Coinbase! The toad has emerged – a monstrous, relentless symbol of power and community-driven potential.

The real estate industry has been plagued with several problems since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which plummeted homes and commercial space. However, with AI technology, the real estate market can tackle inefficiencies and fraud risks and simplify complex transaction processes for users. Expert analysts believe this AI innovation could redefine how investors engage with Real Estate markets globally. Therefore, this article will explore how these AI technologies impact RWA investment in blockchain and what investors will gain when participating in its presale. How is PropiChain AI Technology Creating A Pathway in Real Estate Investment? The importance of AI in the 21st century cannot be understated, as it helps manage and automate processes that reduce the risk of human error, speed up complex processes, and minimize the need for manual intervention. PropiChain uses these AI integrations to address major loopholes and inefficiencies in traditional Real Estate investment by democratizing access to global markets and reducing lengthy settlement times. Below is a detailed narrative of PropiChain AI implementations and how they assist users in making better investment decisions. Automated Valuation Model (AVM): This AI tool assists users by bringing unparalleled accuracy to property valuations as they navigate the platform. Its sophisticated algorithm also helps analyze vast amounts of data, including historical sales reports, market conditions, and economic indicators, to reflect the actual value of a real estate asset.This AI tool offers insights beyond analyzing reports. It also detects patterns and trends that might elude human analysts, identifying major and minor shifts in neighborhood dynamics. AI-powered Chatbots: For users having challenges navigating the PropiChain platform, these AI-powered chatbots provide support and guidance, simplifying experiences and making them more intuitive and user-friendly for novice and experienced investors. Its virtual assistance tools also help break down complex processes, such as understanding legal contracts and financial terms, providing easy-to-understand explanations without any financial or legal background. Property Filtering & Suggestions: This AI-powered filtering system filters real estate assets based on market growth/trends, historical performance, and investment potential. This advanced AI also extends to filtering options for small-scale investors working on a budget who would also love to participate in managing multiple investment properties. In addition, these property suggestions allow AI to assess risks in real-time, safeguarding investors against potential losses and ensuring optimal asset allocation. Statistical Market Analysis: The PropiChain market analysis tool uses AI to analyze market data to identify high-yield real estate opportunities, enabling smarter investments. It also provides real-time evaluation of market trends and offers statistical insight into a real estate asset’s future price predictions, ensuring investors position themselves and avoid potential market risks. Other Key Features: Metaverse Integrations and RWA Tokenization Other features of PropiChain are its Metaverse integrations, which allow international investors to experience an immersive 3D virtual environment through tours, stagings, and meetings. Likewise, PropiChain bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds by tokenizing Real Estate and introducing the fractional ownership of assets. Through asset fractionalization, investors can own portions of high-value properties, democratizing access to Real Estate wealth rather than limiting it to top-scale investors. Expert analysts and top crypto whales believe this innovative approach opens new opportunities for investors and developers as these features cement its reputation as a secure and promising investment opportunity. Conclusion PropiChain stands out as a leader in the real estate industry because of its ability to combine the power of AI, RWA tokenization, and the Metaverse, which creates a groundbreaking platform for real estate investment. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and security review on BlockAudit are testaments to its transparency and credibility as it projects significant growth potential. In addition, its presale price of $0.004 is the lowest it will ever be, as its current round two presale stage still offers investors the opportunity to experience significant growth from $500 to over $100,000 when it launches into the mainstream market. Avoid FOMO and invest today to be a part of this revolutionary project shaping the future of Real Estate investment.

As of now, Bitcoin is reportedly within a bull market phase, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope. This phase, termed the “Orange Zone,” indicates that upward momentum is prevailing, although the market has not yet reached its peak. datascope’ analysis sheds light on the evolving Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, a tool designed to help investors identify key market trends and make informed decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market at a Crossroads: Are Long-Term Holders Signalling a Correction or a Rally? Bitcoin Market Cycle: Current Status And Investor Outlook The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator relies on two moving averages: a short-term 30-day average and a long-term 365-day average. A crossover of the short-term average above the long-term average is seen as a critical signal, potentially marking the transition to the market’s peak period. However, the absence of such a crossover, as revealed by datascope currently suggests that while the market is on an upward trajectory, there is still room for significant growth before reaching a potential top. The analyst elaborated that in the current bull market, Bitcoin’s price movements reflect strong momentum, signalling opportunities for investors. However, with this phase also comes the necessity for strategic vigilance. datascope analysis also highlights the importance of preparing for corrections as prices approach the “red zone” (in the chart attached above), a stage associated with heightened risks. The analyst noted: As long as the 30-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average remains above the 365-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average, the long-term outlook will stay positive. However, as prices approach the red zone, the risk of corrections may increase. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to remain cautious during this period and consider taking profits when necessary. Key Takeaways For Investors datascope suggested that investors aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market should focus on strategic entry and exit points. The analyst added: Although the current bull market shows strong momentum, it is vital to take market fluctuations into account and monitor price movements strategically. Following critical signals such as the crossover of moving averages can help investors identify opportunities more effectively during this period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently seen a noticeable rebound in its price after reclaiming the $100,000 price mark yesterday. At the time of writing, the asset trades at a price of $101,639 increasing by 1.9% in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000?

Solana’s recent 6% price surge has spotlighted its innovative developments, while Ethereum continues to gain traction thanks to improved regulatory sentiment and high-profile investments. Amidst all this action, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a groundbreaking presale that promises to revolutionise how blockchain addresses real-world challenges. While Solana and Ethereum have paved the way for decentralised technology, Qubetics steps in to fill the gaps they’ve left behind. Let’s dive into why these three projects are the best cryptos to invest in right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Real-World Solutions Qubetics is already making gains, thanks to its cutting-edge, solution-oriented products for addressing real-life business issues. By introducing the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , Qubetics addresses privacy concerns and scalability in a way that its predecessors couldn’t. In its 12th presale stage, this project has already sold over 313 million tokens to more than 8,700 holders, raising an impressive $5.7 million. The presale is hot, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0311, set to increase by 10% this weekend. But beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics so special? Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can browse securely without fearing data breaches or censorship. That’s the promise of Qubetics dVPN. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on central servers prone to hacking or outages, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a distributed network. This means no single point of failure and unprecedented levels of security. For more information, watch this AMA Session that’s creating a buzz in the crypto world. Picture this: a journalist in a country with heavy censorship uses Qubetics’ dVPN to access and share critical information safely. Or consider a startup protecting sensitive customer data from cyberattacks while saving on infrastructure costs. Even everyday users can enjoy unrestricted streaming or protect their browsing habits from prying eyes. It’s privacy and freedom wrapped into one seamless experience. The FOMO around Qubetics is real, and for a good reason. With its practical applications and an active community backing its growth, $TICS could redefine how we think about blockchain utility. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now, jumping into Qubetics before the presale price hike seems like a no-brainer. Solana (SOL): Scaling New Heights with Innovation Solana has been a force to reckon with in the crypto world, and its latest 6% price jump to over $230 proves it’s not slowing down. Over the past year, SOL has skyrocketed by 220%, cementing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, now at a jaw-dropping $109 billion. But what’s fuelling this meteoric rise? A major catalyst is Solana’s integration of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technological leap that enhances privacy and scalability. Projects like ArciumHQ and Bonsol are pioneering encrypted on-chain computations, making Solana more appealing to developers and end-users alike. This isn’t just geeky blockchain jargon—it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build or use decentralised applications. Economic metrics also tell a compelling story. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) soared from $5.6 billion in November to an all-time high of $9.5 billion in early December. That’s a 70% increase in just over a month! It’s not just TVL, though; real monthly economic activity jumped from $158 million to $409 million, proving that Solana is more than hype. Solana’s ecosystem is also thriving. Binance Labs recently invested in Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure project, boosting capital efficiency within the network. Meanwhile, Solana’s first AI Hackathon, offering $185,000 in prizes, showcases its commitment to innovation. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Issues like sandwich attacks and concerns over validator mechanisms have sparked debates about network integrity. Still, Solana’s proactive community and proposed solutions, like reintroducing a public mempool, reflect a blockchain unafraid to confront challenges head-on. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in right now, Solana’s mix of innovation and resilience makes it a top contender. Ethereum (ETH): The Crypto Giant that keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top of the crypto pyramid for nothing. Despite the initial hype around its ETF launch fading, Ethereum has emerged stronger with a more grounded market outlook. It’s this ability to adapt and grow that makes ETH one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. One big boost to Ethereum’s reputation is the improved regulatory environment. With new SEC and CFTC chair nominations supportive of decentralised finance (DeFi), Ethereum is gaining credibility in mainstream finance. High-profile moves, like former President Trump’s WLFI profits being channelled into ETH, further underscore its appeal. Ethereum’s real strength lies in its versatility. From NFTs to DeFi protocols, it remains the go-to platform for developers and users. The network’s layer-2 solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, are easing congestion and reducing fees, making Ethereum more accessible than ever. However, Ethereum’s ETHBTC trading pair has been a topic of discussion. Critics once argued that it was overhyped, but shifting perspectives now highlight its stability and potential. As the crypto market matures, Ethereum’s foundational role becomes even more evident, offering long-term value that’s hard to beat. Ethereum’s community and ecosystem are its secret weapons. Whether it’s developers creating groundbreaking dApps or institutional investors recognising its worth, ETH’s network effects are unparalleled. For anyone eyeing the best cryptos to invest in right now, Ethereum’s proven track record and future promise are impossible to ignore. Seize Your Moment Cryptocurrency isn’t just about numbers; it’s about vision, innovation, and solving real-world problems. Qubetics’ transformative dVPN technology, Solana’s relentless push for scalability, and Ethereum’s adaptability make these projects the best cryptos to invest in right now. The clock’s ticking, especially with Qubetics’ presale set to hike prices soon. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the next big thing in blockchain. Act now. Join the Qubetics presale or stack up on Solana and Ethereum while the market’s buzzing. The future’s bright—be a part of it.

Among the myriad options, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Polkadot stand out as innovative projects driving the future of decentralised technology. This article will explore why these cryptos are considered the Best Cryptos to Join Now , highlighting their unique features, ongoing developments, and future potential. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain Interoperability Most networks operate in isolation in the current blockchain ecosystem , creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralised applications (dApps) and hampers the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining this narrative by establishing itself as a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple networks into a cohesive framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality , Qubetics enhances interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. This advancement unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users alike. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers an attractive investment opportunity. With weekly phases driving a 10% price hike and a culminating 20% rise in the final stage, the $TICS token is a valuable addition to any portfolio. Priced at $0.031, the presale has already raised over $5.7 million, boasting over 8,700 holders and 313 million tokens sold. These figures make Qubetics a compelling choice for investors seeking the Best Cryptos to Join Now. The seamless integration of multiple blockchains under Qubetics’ umbrella is expected to catalyse the adoption of decentralised technologies across industries, making it a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche: A Layer-1 Powerhouse with Exponential Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX), one of the leading layer-1 blockchain networks, has captured the attention of analysts and investors with its robust ecosystem and promising growth trajectory. Known for its high throughput and low latency, Avalanche has become a preferred platform for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and gaming. According to crypto analysts, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, has substantial room for growth. Notably, Kong Trading, a prominent figure in the crypto space, predicts that AVAX could rally to $1,000 by 2025. If this prediction comes to fruition, it would represent a staggering 2,027% increase from its current levels. This optimism stems from similar historical rallies in tokens like Mantra, Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Ripple (XRP). The prediction is anchored in the assumption that Ethereum’s price could rise between $10,000 and $20,000, which would likely have a positive ripple effect on other layer-1 networks like Avalanche. With its innovative technology and growing adoption, Avalanche is undeniably among the Best Cryptos to Join Now for long-term investors aiming to capitalise on exponential growth. Polkadot: The Pioneer of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot (DOT) is another standout project that prioritises interoperability and scalability. Created by Dr Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot facilitates the seamless transfer of messages and value across blockchains through its unique parachain architecture. Polkadot also offers lucrative staking opportunities for traders. The token provides a reward rate of 11.43%, an inflation rate of 8.83%, and a real reward rate of 2.38%. Major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken support DOT staking, making it accessible for users worldwide. These platforms also handle the technical complexities, allowing users to enjoy staking rewards without the burdens of managing the process themselves. Conclusion In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market continues to present groundbreaking opportunities, with Qubetics , Avalanche, and Polkadot emerging as key players poised to shape the future of decentralised technology. Qubetics’ innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, Avalanche’s robust growth potential in the layer-1 space, and Polkadot’s pioneering advancements in scalability and cross-chain functionality all position these projects as top choices for investors and blockchain enthusiasts. Whether through Qubetics’ presale momentum, Avalanche’s exponential price predictions, or Polkadot’s lucrative staking opportunities, these cryptocurrencies offer compelling avenues to participate in the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem. As the market evolves, these projects exemplify the transformative potential of decentralised technologies, making them some of the best cryptos to join now.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 01:50:00
37566769,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/Is-the-altcoin-season-still-coming-back-in-2024,1734054896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37566769.jpeg,Is The Altcoin Season still coming back in 2024,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/Is-the-altcoin-season-still-coming-back-in-2024,"Mixed Signals in the Crypto Landscape The crypto market braces for an eventful weekend, teetering between optimism and uncertainty after a whirlwind week of mixed signals. CPI data hit the 2.7% mark as expected—neutral, stable, unexciting—but Thursday’s PPI at 0.4% raised eyebrows, doubling the forecast. Persistent producer price pressures are like termites—they won’t collapse the house overnight, but their presence gnaws away at the foundations of stability. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank decided to add a splash of liquidity with a 0.25% rate cut, a move that’s more band-aid than cure-all for the eurozone’s sluggish growth. These developments played their part in lifting the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which closed strong at 107 on Thursday. A resilient dollar might keep crypto inflows on a tight leash, cooling the risk-on narrative. Sure, a weak dollar boosts crypto optimism, but this isn’t that story—not yet. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the extreme greed lingered far too long, stretching nearly a month before being smacked down abruptly in Monday and Tuesday’s brutal crashes. But here’s the twist: extreme greed didn’t take long to resurface, climbing back to 80 yesterday. Today’s reading (Friday, December 13) shows this: If this all sounds familiar, it should. Two weeks ago, I explored in my article, ‘ Altcoin Season on the Horizon ?’, whether Ethereum could complete its “tasks” to confirm an altseason. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Instead, the rally fizzled, and altcoins never got their full confirmation. Let’s go back to some of these charts to check on our main hero—or villain—in this latest altcoin debacle. Ethereum (ETH): Weekly Insight Weekly Chart Highlights: Ethereum ($ETH ) remains in a critical consolidation pattern starting before Christmas last year within the rectangle top at $4,092, while strong supporting confluences align around $3,021 at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week MA. The recent weekly candle hints at potential exhaustion, marked by a possible hanging man pattern. Better not, still time. It’s a strong reversal candle pattern. Nie fajnie. No bueno. Traders should watch the weekly close carefully to confirm or invalidate this signal. But for now, to keep an eye on: Resistance Levels: $4,092 (rectangle top, critical breakout zone) $6,050 (rectangle breakout target and Fib extension) Key Support: $3,021 (golden pocket 0.618 Fibonacci + 50-week MA + … the rectangle mid-point ) Observations: The recent rally from $3,500 highlights buyer confidence, but RSI divergence suggests weakening momentum. A deeper correction could retest fib levels between $3,226 (0.5 Fib) and $3,021 (0.618). This week’s correction of 14.5% from the yearly high of $4,092 to $3,511 was shallow by crypto standards. However, dropping below the golden pocket at $3,021 would indicate a much more significant shift in market sentiment. This majestic rectangle continues to dominate Ethereum's macro outlook and, by extension, casts its influence over the entire altcoin market. It’s a battleground not unlike what we see in Total2, where resilience and rejection at key levels define the broader altcoin narrative. Let’s explore what Total2 reveals about the state of the altcoin market. Total2: Altcoin Market Cap Recovery 3-Day Chart Insights: Total2 paints a clear picture of resilience. Following its $1.65T rejection near the 2021 ATH, the altcoin market cap dropped 17.5% but rapidly rebounded to $1.53T. Notably, the cup-and-handle breakout remains intact, with a long-term target extending above $2T. Key Observations: Dip-buying culture is alive and well, as evidenced by the rapid rebound from recent lows. The resilience tells the story of how traders continue to seize opportunities during pullbacks. Markets are as much about psychology as they are about price action. The velocity of this rebound underscores how swiftly sentiment can pivot, flipping bullish for altcoins the moment a dip looks enticing. ETH to BTC: 12-Hour Structure Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) reflects broader altcoin momentum. Currently, ETH/BTC sits at 0.0384, just below the prior rectangle's top. While the head-and-shoulders pattern on lower timeframes highlights bearish risks, the market structure shift (higher low) offers a bullish possibility. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: 0.0403 (invalidate H&S, potential breakout level) Support: 0.0370 (critical zone to maintain higher low structure) 0.0346 (final support before breakdown towards the lows at 0.032) ETH/BTC’s relative strength is often a leading indicator of altseason’s health. A breakout above 0.0403, particularly if accompanied by volume, is crucial to confirm the narrative shift towards altcoin dominance. However, meeting this target alone won’t be enough. A simultaneous close above $4,100 for Ethereum and Total2 surpassing the 2021 blow-off top levels will be the ultimate confirmation. With all three conditions fulfilled, BTC dominance (BTC.D) should also trend lower, finally signaling the true start of an altcoin season. Failure to align these conditions would leave the market vulnerable to Bitcoin’s ( $BTC ) continued grip. Conclusion: Is the Nightmare Over? Despite a turbulent start to the week, altcoin fundamentals remain intact. Ethereum’s resilience above $3,500 and the rapid recovery in Total2 highlight renewed buy-the-dip enthusiasm. However, the next leg depends heavily on macro catalysts, particularly CPI and the FOMC decision. For now, traders should focus on critical resistance levels like $4,092 for ETH (plus 0.04 road-block on eth/btc ) and $1.65T for Total2 , while monitoring volume and RSI for confirmation. A breakout above these levels could mark the return of a full-fledged altcoin season.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, altcoins may underperform due to factors such as reduced capital rotation from BTC to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Likely To Continue Its Momentum Into 2025 In a report titled Crypto Market Outlook 2025, asset manager Sygnum outlined multiple factors that are likely to further push BTC price upwards next year. The report highlights new capital inflows into the market – particularly institutional inflows – as the primary driver for the crypto bull market in 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000? Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation The analysis highlights a ‘multiplier effect’ caused by institutional inflows combined with Bitcoin’s limited liquid supply. For instance, every $1 billion of net inflows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly triggers a 3-6% price increase. Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. 2025: A Watershed Year For BTC The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range. Related Reading: Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025 Further, BTC may benefit from central banks and local governments considering setting aside some part of their funds for BTC reserves. Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1734058828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ukraine To Legalize Crypto: Lawmakers Preparing Bill For Early 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/ukraine-to-legalize-crypto-lawmakers-preparing-bill-for-early-2025/,"As the market continues its massive rally, Ukrainian lawmakers are preparing to legalize crypto soon officially. Local reports revealed that the parliament is working on a draft law but is not considering tax exemptions for digital assets. Ukraine Prepares To Legalize Crypto During a “Domestic Investment Opportunities” forum, Danylo Hetmantsev, Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee for Finances, Tax and Customs Policy, revealed that Ukraine aims to legalize digital assets in the coming months. Hetmantsev stated that the parliament’s working group is working alongside the National Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a draft law to pass the legislation in early 2025, news media outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported : If we’re talking about cryptocurrency, the [parliament’s] working group is finalizing a draft law for its first reading. I believe the text, developed in collaboration with the National Bank and the IMF, will be ready after the New Year. We aim to pass this law and legalize cryptocurrency in the [2025’s] first quarter. The head of the Committee also noted that tax exemptions won’t be applied to digital assets. Instead, they plan to follow the model used for securities, meaning that profits will be taxed when the assets are converted into currency. Hetmantsev also explained that they will take a “very cautious approach to using cryptocurrencies for tax exemptions” after consulting with the IMF and European experts, “as it could potentially facilitate tax evasion in traditional markets.” Ukraine’s Regulatory Landscape President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the “On Virtual Assets” law in March 2022, setting in motion a legal framework for regulating the digital asset market in Ukraine. However, the law had not been implemented by early 2024, as it awaited the amendments to the country’s Tax Code. This resulted in the loss of millions in potential tax revenue, as the absence of crypto-related regulations meant that exchanges had no legal obligations to pay the Ukrainian authorities taxes for the revenue obtained from digital assets. In April, the IMF asked Ukraine to complete an update on its crypto legislation by the end of 2024. According to a Facebook post from Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov, the IMF noted that the lack of regulation of the new industry posed a threat to “price stability and efficiency of monetary transmission.” Bornyakov noted that the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s team had stressed the need to introduce state regulation in the crypto asset market, pointing to the two draft laws already registered for consideration in the parliament. Additionally, he highlighted that crypto legislation could have a positive financial impact on the country and boost Ukraine’s economic growth, emphasizing that prompt action would also strengthen international confidence in the country: In times of war, we must use the full range of opportunities and develop new sectors of the economy. Legalization of the crypto sector can have a powerful economic effect, generating a turnover of billions of hryvnias.

For example, analyst XO predicts a price target of $300 for Solana (SOL). Furthermore, based on the bullish technical indicators, Cardano (ADA) has started showing promising growth signs. Despite all this, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself as one of the best new ICOs. This presale, now in phase six, has already seen a 500% price surge. Given its potential to dominate the online trading space and tap into the growing $1.4T FX market, experts remain bullish on it. Some even foresee a 5x growth potential for this altcoin in 2025. XO: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Reach $300 Soon Solana (SOL) is seeing some green price charts right now. CoinMarketCap shows that this altcoin saw a price surge of over 5% in the past 30 days, jumping from around $200 to over $250. Crypto analyst XO excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin will see a big jump if it holds the low $200s as support. XO forecasts a potential surge to $300 for Solana (SOL) soon. The technicals show some good signs for the Solana crypto. For example, TradingView shows that its value is above its 50-day EMA ($213). Furthermore, its momentum indicator is at -20, which is in the buy zone and suggests this uptrend may continue. Cardano (ADA) Technicals Remain Bullish As Price Rises Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that is riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the price of Cardano increased from around $0.50 to over $1. In other words, its value skyrocketed over 70% as per CoinMarketCap. The technical analysis for Cardano (ADA) is also bullish. According to TradingView, this crypto currency is trading above its 30-day EMA ($0.95) and its momentum indicator sits at -0.06 which is in the buy zone. Therefore, the Cardano coin may continue this bullish trajectory. Market expert Valeriya remains optimistic about Cardano as well. In her new X post, she stated that a $1.20 or even $1.25 bounce is still possible. This Cardano price prediction captures traders’ attention. DTX Exchange (DTX) Excites Traders With a 500% Surge So Far DTX Exchange (DTX) is a hot altcoin right now. Whoever bought it at the beginning of its crypto ICO event has already received 500% returns. With the addition of a listing on CoinMarketCap, countless traders are now rushing to buy DTX. This token will power the DTX Exchange platform. On this hybrid trading platform, people will get: ● Access to over 120K asset classes like gold, FX, and crypto coins. ● Transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. ● Privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. On the other hand, those who hold the DTX token will get governance voting rights as well as a portion of the trading fee revenue made by the DTX Exchange. This has led to millions of DTX tokens being sold. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, this presale price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Additionally, its expected launch price sits at $0.20, which is a 66% jump from its current price. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Cardano (ADA)? While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are on a rally right now, some analysts are also bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX). This newcomer will have ties to many trillion-dollar markets and a smaller market cap. Therefore, DTX could need less money for its price to rise over time. Because of this, experts foresee a potential 5x growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 03:15:00

The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly preparing multiple charges, but the letter remains vague about the specifics, such as the exact nature of the charges and how many of Musk’s companies are involved. The SEC is investigating his brain-computer interface company Neuralink and the latest letter stated that the SEC had “reopened” its probe into Neuralink this week. It also revealed that Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, was subpoenaed by the SEC, with threats of a process server if he didn’t comply. Amid the chaos, Musk took to his X handle and wrote, “The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.” JUST IN: SEC Chair Gary Gensler has issued a settlement demand to Elon Musk, threatening charges unless Musk paid within 48 hours. Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro accuses the SEC of harassment and politically motivated actions. pic.twitter.com/vjOQGP0UAV — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 13, 2024 For the unversed, the SEC has been investigating Elon Musk for delaying the disclosure of his 9.2% stake in Twitter. He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law. According to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, anyone who acquires at least 5% of a public company must disclose it within ten days. In May 2024, Musk agreed to testify in the SEC’s investigation but failed to comply with their deposition request, leading the SEC to seek sanctions in a San Francisco court. Experts React To Gensler’s Latest Action Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted to the news, saying this is how the SEC treats the richest man in the world. He pointed out that small businesses and entrepreneurs, without the resources Elon Musk has, are likely treated even worse. Deaton brought to attention how the SEC’s actions in the LBRY case show their aggressive tactics, threatening to bankrupt Jeremy Kauffman and LBRY before even filing a lawsuit. He also said that Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse spent over $150 million defending themselves in a case that didn’t involve fraud, but a failure to register and explained how most companies don’t have the resources to fight back like that.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 03:17:45

With the $XPAW token rapidly gaining traction, XRPAW MEME is termed as the next big memecoin phenomenon on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and poised to join the ranks of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk as a community-driven memecoin. The recent approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin by the New York Department of Financial Services marks a pivotal development for the XRPL ecosystem. RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, is designed to maintain a constant value of one U.S. dollar and is fully backed by a segregated reserve of cash and cash equivalents. Its issuance on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains enhances liquidity and provides a stable medium of exchange within the XRP network.

Klein, who is currently serving as the chairman of the nuclear reform monitoring committee for Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), said nuclear energy is essential for long-term sustainability. However, he noted that these power sources would need time to scale up their infrastructure. Meeting immediate energy demands As data centers, the backbone of artificial intelligence operations, are built in countries like Japan and the US, natural gases have become necessities to meet surging power demands. Data centers are heavily reliant on energy, and the global boom of AI is pushing power grids to their limits. Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel in the US, and it is expected to account for up to 60% of new-generation projects in the coming years. While natural gas is cleaner than coal, this reliance on natural gases comes with its own set of environmental concerns, particularly related to methane emissions and long-term carbon commitments. In other places, fossil fuels are an immediate solution to the rising electricity demand brought on by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology. However, Klein sees these fossil fuel power sources as short-term solutions, especially because existing renewable energy and nuclear capabilities cannot be scaled up quickly enough to meet the demand. The timeline for nuclear energy According to Klein, gas will be used to assuage the boom in energy demand from AI until small modular reactors and larger plants can be built to enable nuclear energy to take its place. Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have invested in nuclear solutions to power their AI operations. Meta recently announced plans to partner with developers for nuclear energy projects capable of delivering up to 4 gigawatts of power by the early 2030s. Similarly, Microsoft has secured nuclear power commitments, including a deal to purchase energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Meanwhile, Google is investing in small modular reactors (SMRs) However, their methods cannot be applied universally or immediately. “ We just cannot meet this big demand for these data centers without nuclear plants if we’re going to maintain a reduction in greenhouse gases,” Klein told Bloomberg . Nuclear energy remains a sensitive topic in Japan due to the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The country has also been witnessing a downtrend in energy demands due to depopulation. However, people familiar with the problem have suggested that the situation can be turned around by building more data centers and semiconductor plants.

President-elect Donald Trump’s team is exploring eliminating agencies like the FDIC, sparking a debate that could reshape America’s financial landscape. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC could be a step toward innovation, or are we gambling with stability? What the FDIC Does—and Why It Matters The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC is the authority that keeps banks in check. It makes sure that your money remains safe even if the bank fails. This system was created after the Great Depression to build a secure banking system. People need to know their savings won’t just vanish. Trump’s idea to cut back on such oversight is bold, to say the least. During his first term, he pushed to reduce bureaucracy, saying regulations hold back the economy. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC shows how committed he is to evolve the blockchain technology in America. His team argues that less regulation could boost innovation, especially in areas like cryptocurrency. DFIC secures banks but their recent actions show they don’t like cryptocurrencies. Crypto Dreams or Banking Nightmare? Here’s the twist: Trump wants America to lead the cryptocurrency revolution. Bitcoin, blockchain—all of it. He believes that cutting federal oversight could open the door for crypto startups and investors. He wants the U.S to become the hub for decentralized finance and outpace competitors like China. However, not everyone is in favor of closing down the regulatory authority. According to critics, shutting down the regulations could leave the banks in a vulnerable state and people will lose faith as their money will not be secured anymore. Supporters say crypto’s decentralized nature could offer a safety net—but is that really enough? What’s at Stake Traditional banks might struggle without the FDIC. People could lose confidence, and that’s dangerous. For consumers, weaker protections might leave them exposed to fraud or loss. The crypto advocates see this as an opportunity as this will give a chance to Bitcoin adoption and blockchain innovation. This could encourage global investors to shift their focus towards the U.S., which aligns perfectly with Trump’s vision to make America great. Of course, there’s a catch. Congress needs to approve any major changes, and bipartisan resistance is likely. Financial experts point to the 2008 crisis as a cautionary tale. Back then, deregulation played a big role. Could history repeat itself? What to Expect Trump’s deregulation plan is ambitious, no doubt. It’s about cutting red tape and betting on crypto as the future of finance. But the risks are real. Will the U.S. become the world’s crypto capital, or are we opening the door to financial chaos? The coming months will reveal whether this vision leads to innovation or instability. Only time will tell if Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC works or will it backfire.",News|Crypto news|US Elections 2024,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 03:42:49

This bull run is a once-in-a-lifetime memecoin supercycle, and it’s your chance to turbo-crank the risk and chase unprecedented gains. But instead of sifting through hundreds of meme pretenders, what if you could rely on a coin to do all the hard work for you—like a stock index, only with performance that isn’t going to have you less animated than Terri Schiavo? That’s what you get with Vantard and its proprietary Memecoin Portfolio: a basket of the hottest property in the entire sector bought before they pump. In the battle to find the next meme moonshot, Vantard’s team of quants is a day early and a dollar in credit. The Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP) already loaded up on ZEREBRO , MOODENG , and AI16Z nice and early, locking in some serious gains for early VTARD investors. But with The Don on his victory lap and global liquidity flooding the crypto market like Noah’s on a comeback tour, what meme monstrosity in the skyrocketing $140 billion market will the VMP unearth next? Vantard: Only an actual ‘tard wouldn’t want in Since launching its presale around a month ago, Vantard has already raised $931k, and for good reason: it’s been making TradFi look more lifeless than Simon Cowell’s botoxed bonce. Vantard has defecated all over the NASDAQ, dominating its year-to-date returns like a young, skilled cowboy atop a weary, senile bull. The VMP is getting called the S&P 500 of memecoins for a reason. Vantard offers degens the creature comforts of TradFi with its diversification and the reassurance of an actively managed and frequently rebalanced basket. Still, this team of quants isn’t interested in delivering a paltry 7%—they’ve got their eyes on a parabolic prize, and so far, they’ve given no reason to doubt them. Meme coin madness, but all on autopilot? Now that’s how a Giga Chad rides the supercycle. Further delving into its meme origins, Vantard’s quants recently launched a “ Boomberg Nooz ” segment, which offers some insight into their radical and somewhat unhinged methodology. So, rather than chowing down on the wily nonsense some Bloomberg anchor hack wants you to choke back, why not let Vantard red pill the living daylights out of you? No botox, no corporate bullsh*t. No wonder the smart money’s all over VTARD like a resurrected Hugh Hefner in Margot Robbie’s hot tub. Get gains: Not therapy The VMP could be your secret weapon to obliterate this bull run and finally take the edge off your son’s opulent OnlyFans addiction. We’re talking blue-chip memes, burgeoning runners, and even nano-cap nebulas, each exploding at different times thanks to various catalysts. And each ensures the VMP is consistently delivering the goods—not like your ex-wife with that furry glove. This is memecoin mayhem with none of the legwork—no 3 AM candlestick struggle sessions while your wife loads up Bumble alongside your cold and vacant side of the bed. And no getting screwed by the slippage as you thrash at your mobile, desperately trying to panic sell the latest abominable sh*tcoin to save your daughter’s college fund. The Vantard quants are the ones sobbing in family counseling—they can take the trauma that comes with making this supercycle their b*tch, and their children’s daddy issues are only surpassed by their relentless analytical mastery and their Lannister-esque strategizing. Let them suffer in silence while you 100X and plan an exit— take the kids to Disneyworld, not a Diazepam dispensary. Ready to ride, cowboy? Right now, you can get in on VTARD early at a discounted price of $0.00011 before the six-fingered degenerates get their grubby mitts all over it. But don’t hang around—like an alcoholic at their godchild’s funeral, VTARD’s presale supply is going down faster than the sacramental wine. And soon, these tokens will disappear faster than Diddy on day release. This is your one-stop shop for the memecoin supercycle—your golden ticket to the VIP suite of meme portfolio management. So take a step back, throw your hat into the ring, and let the quants turn decades of loving marriage into a divorce-driven 1000x. Want to ride the Memecoin Supercycle in style?

Some are strategically choosing to divert their funds into a new protocol with the potential for large returns: Lunex Network ($LNEX). This protocol combines low fees with high levels of interoperability, and ties it together with a central focus on privacy to create the ultimate environment for professional trading. So what will the next quarter have in store for these projects? Polkadot Sees Sharp Dip Despite Polkadot 2.0 Announcement Polkadot (DOT) dropped 17% during the last week, which surprised holders, as before that, Polkadot tripled in price over the last year. Strangely enough, that dip in Polkadot’s value came just as Polkadot (DOT) released Polkadot 2.0, which should make the network scalable and also offer developers more access. It will technically involve a few tweaks from Polkadot (DOT) to reduce block times for traders. Cardano Sees Dip Despite Wallet Enhancements Cardano (ADA) has seen an 11% dip in the last week as key whales have sold off large quantities of Cardano (ADA). Cardano’s price outlook is now dwindling despite Cardano achieving a 96% increase over the last 12 months. On the technological front, Cardano has been focused on improving DB Sync and the Cardano wallet. There have also been several refinements made to the Cardano (ADA) ledger in a bit to improve network security. Lunex Network ($LNEX) Provides Powerful Tools for Traders Lunex Network offers a suite of tools for traders and companies and it is fast becoming a leader in the DeFi space. A standout is its broad portfolio tracker that manages stocks and ETFs as well as cryptos. This tool gives traders an overview of their financial state so they can make sound investment decisions at all times. With its apt utilization of the latest blockchain technology, Lunex Network supports swaps of over 50,000 assets. The platform sets a standard for other competing blockchains with ultra low fees and lightning fast transaction speeds, creating a frictionless trading experience. Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) utility extends beyond trading. Its ecosystem is powered by the native $LNEX token, designed to remain stable even in times of market volatility. Token holders enjoy a generous 18% share of platform profits, providing a passive income stream. Additionally, with a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, $LNEX incorporates a deflationary mechanism that rewards long-term investors as adoption increases. Businesses also benefit from Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) features . The platform’s merchant payment gateway simplifies the process of accepting cryptocurrency payments. Transactions are automatically converted into fiat currency, making it easy for companies to integrate digital assets without technical complications. Lunex Network Attracts Strong Interest Investors are flocking in from all over the trading spectrum to secure their share of $LNEX tokens. Currently available at a ripe price of $0.0044, leading analysts have predicted a 1800% price increase before the time of the full launch owing to the protocol’s intelligent design. This is certainly not a project to miss out on.

It trades at $101,805, marking a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Amid this price performance, analysts have closely examined various metrics to gauge potential market movements, including identifying optimal cash-out moments. Meanwhile, recent data reveals intriguing patterns that could guide investor strategies. When Should You Cash Out Your Bitcoin? One key insight shared by a CryptoQuant analyst, Onchain Edge, highlights a critical signal for when investors should consider reducing their Bitcoin holdings. Other metrics suggest a resurgence in buyer activity , reinforcing optimism in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Onchain Edge emphasizes the importance of the BTC supply loss percentage as a marker for peak market phases . He notes that when this metric drops below 4%, it could signify the culmination of a bull market and the beginning of an overheated market phase. Currently, the current supply loss percentage stands at 8.14%, providing room for further price growth before a potential peak. The analyst warns, however, that failing to act at the right time during such peak phases could lead to substantial losses in a subsequent bear market. Elaborating on his analysis, Onchain Edge encourages investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their positions once the supply loss percentage breaches the 4% threshold. It is worth noting that this strategy by Edge could help mitigate the risk of holding through the transition into a bear market. Historically, peak bull run phases are characterized by significant profits among market participants, often followed by sharp corrections . Investors can protect their gains by exiting strategically while preparing for lower entry points during future market downturns. BTC Buyer Activity Resurges Meanwhile, in a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk sheds light on the behavior of takers on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Data from the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio shows a shift toward aggressive buying activity. This metric, which compares the volume of buy orders filled by takers to sell orders, had experienced a period of negative monthly values, indicating a preference for selling among market participants . However, the ratio has recently turned positive, signifying renewed interest from buyers. This trend suggests reduced selling pressure and growing optimism among traders about Bitcoin’s potential price increase.

Congrats to everyone at @PlayStation and @TeamAsobi ! #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/7CG8McZPbg — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 13, 2024 Out of seven nominations, Astro Bot has won four, including the most prestigious award of the evening, The Game of the Year award. Other titles nominated for the Game of the Year were Black Myth: Wukong, Balatro, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and a controversial entry, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Swen Vincke, director of Baldur’s Gate 3, presented this year’s award. He was the winner of last year’s Game of the Year title. He described it as changing his life. In a lighthearted comment, he said, “Should you be told to wrap it up, you can always come back and chat for three minutes.” Team Asobi’s head, Nicolas Doucet, thanked the team and PlayStation for their support with Astro and acknowledged PlayStation’s 30 years of legacy. He also recalled playing Super Mario Bros. and how Astro Bots’ foundations were based on the game. Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner Astro Bot was nominated in seven categories in The Game Awards 2024, making it the most prominent game. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was the second title, receiving an equal number of nominations. However, it took away only one award in the Best Score and Music category. Meanwhile, Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner. It won Best Narrative, Best RPG, and Best Art Direction. It was unusual for Balatro to be nominated for The Game Awards 2024 platform. So much so the developer found it “completely surreal.” Still, it took the spotlight in the Indie game category, winning the Best Indie and Best Debut Indie categories.

While some attribute this strategic move to the whale’s confidence in 1Fuel as the next big player in the trading industry, some believe it’s due to the platform’s growth potential that might extend to 100x its current price. In this article, we’ll explore why these sentiments hint that 1Fuel may be the best cryptocurrency to buy now. 1FUEL: The Next-Generation Crypto Wallet for Maximum Returns 1Fuel is quickly emerging as the best cryptocurrency now for those seeking substantial returns, and it’s for good reasons. Notably, the innovation behind 1FUEL transcends typical cryptocurrency wallets, as it is designed to simplify and secure the management of digital assets. Imagine being able to conduct transactions across different blockchain networks with just one click. With features like one-click cross-chain transactions, an integrated privacy mixer, cold storage solutions, and peer-to-peer exchanges, 1FUEL is changing how users store, trade, and manage their crypto assets. Additionally, 1FUEL offers staking rewards of up to 30% APR by allowing users to stake their tokens. This means that by simply holding onto their 1FUEL tokens, investors can earn passive income while supporting the security of the network. A total of 75 million tokens are reserved for these rewards, incentivizing users to become long-term holders. Adding to the appeal of 1FUEL is the independent verification of its smart contracts, which provides peace of mind for investors. This audit safeguards your investment, allowing you to enter the market with confidence. Shiba Inu’s Hot Streak: Can It Double Its Price Again? In the last month alone, SHIB’s price jumped 57% to the current $0.00003015. Still, the trend could continue, according to some analysts. On December 7, crypto analyst “Bluntz” suggested SHIB could soar as high as $0.00006 and $0.00009, respectively about 94% and 191% above its value of approximately $0.00003089. Bluntz also noted that for this to happen, SHIB has to complete the breakout, just like in March 2024, when the RSI moved from over 70 to over 90. Currently, the RSI of Shiba Inu is over 70, indicating that the coin might continue surging. Another analyst, “King’s Chart,” offered a more cautious view, predicting a 35% rise in SHIB’s price to around $0.00004518 based on an ascending triangle chart pattern. Dogecoin’s Price Dip: A Temporary Setback or a Sign of Deeper Issues? Dogecoin’s price has fallen over 6% in the past 24 hours, now sitting at $0.43. Recently, negative sentiment around Dogecoin has grown, leading to decreased transaction activity. However, there is some hope: Dogecoin has emerged from a bullish pattern that began in November, suggesting potential for recovery. Experts believe this price drop may test a crucial support level. If it holds, Dogecoin could begin to rise again. Nevertheless, data indicates that more investors are betting against DOGE, reflecting ongoing negative sentiment. If Dogecoin can rise above its current level, it might reach new highs, particularly if an “altcoin season” occurs. Conclusion While popular meme coins like SHIB and DOGE continue to fluctuate, 1FUEL’s innovative ecosystem as well as its enticing crypto presale offerings make it a compelling investment choice for those seeking long-term gains in the crypto market. Predictions suggest that early investors might see gains of up to a staggering 100x by just buying the OFT tokens at a current price of $0.012.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 05:02:11

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $1.180 and $1.200 levels. ADA price started a decent increase from the $0.910 support zone. The price is trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.180 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $1.00 level, Cardano started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $1.050 and $1.120 resistance levels. However, the bears were active below the $1.20 level. A high was formed at $1.1781 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $1.120 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.150 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.180. The next key resistance might be $1.20. If there is a close above the $1.2 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2280 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.180 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.10750 level. The next major support is near the $1.050 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. A downside break below the $1.050 level could open the doors for a test of $1.00. The next major support is near the $0.920 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level.

For instance, Amonyx has predicted that Ripple (XRP) could reach $20 soon. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) now sees bullish indicators suggesting it is primed for a big surge. Investors are also going wild about a new exchange token now in phase six of its presale – DTX Exchange (DTX) . Although still early in development, this rookie has already given early buyers a 500% return while raising over $10M. Since DTX Exchange looks poised to become a fan-favorite in the online trading space, many experts foresee the value of this altcoin potentially soaring by 7,000% in 2025. Amonyx: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Soar to $20 Soon Recently, Amonyx made headlines in the crypto space with his Ripple (XRP) price prediction. In a new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin could reach $20 soon. Although many people found this Ripple price prediction outlandish, XRP has been rising lately. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price jumped from around $0.70 to nearly $3 in the past 30 days. In other words, Ripple (XRP) saw a price surge of over 250% in just a few short weeks. The technicals for the Ripple crypto are also showing some positive signs. TradingView data points to this altcoin trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.33) and 20-day EMA ($2.08). Thanks to these factors, traders consider Ripple one of the altcoins to watch. Solana (SOL) Shows Bullish Indicators Amid Price Growth Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin showing some growth. On the one-month chart, the Solana price increased nearly 5%, per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value moved between almost $220 and over $230. TradingView data points to Solana crypto continuing this bullish momentum. At this time, this altcoin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($229) and its 30-day EMA ($225). Plus, the momentum indicator for Solana sits at 6.50, which is in the buy zone and suggests an upswing. Market analyst Inmortal also excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his recent X post, Solana (SOL) could skyrocket past $440 soon. Therefore, Solana solidifies its position as one of the top 10 altcoins. DTX Exchange (DTX) Looks Positioned for Massive Price Growth DTX Exchange (DTX) is a trailblazing trading platform that could dominate online trading. It will merge the benefits of CEX and DEX and take the trader experience to the next level. The platform will allow the user to trade in global markets from the convenience of one single interface. With DTX Exchange, traders will get access to: Over 120K Asset Classes: The ability to trade crypto coins, stocks, gold, etc. Privacy: No sign-up KYC checks will be required. Up to 1,000x Leverage: High leverage on assets means more reward potential while minimizing risk. Currently valued at $0.12 in phase six of its presale, the DTX token has already shown great growth potential. This is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. Once a Tier-1 crypto exchange lists this token, many traders will be happy to know its listing price will sit at $0.20 – a 66% return for all who buy it now. This growth could make DTX one of the best cryptos to buy now. What May Come for Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) & DTX Exchange (DTX)? Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and DTX Exchange (DTX) look poised to see big price gains. However, DTX has some advantages that could set it apart. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers while tapping into the growing $18T gold market. Therefore, DTX may need less money for its price to surge while being more stable in the long run. Because of this, experts predict a potential 7,000% growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Remember Bonk (BONK)? Early adopters turned pennies into fortunes, riding a wave of meme coin mania. But here’s the twist—history is giving you a second chance, and it’s spelt BTFD Coin (BTFD) . The presale of this powerhouse coin is taking the market by storm, offering entry points that make missing out unforgivable. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin (BTFD) is the best new meme coin presale to join now, and how it’s poised to outshine the meme coin titans of the past, including Bonk. BTFD Coin: Turning Missed Opportunities into Millionaire-Making Moments For anyone who has ever said, “I wish I got in early,” BTFD Coin is your golden ticket. Short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD embodies the fearless mindset that turns market downturns into opportunities. And with over $3.6 million raised in its presale so far, it’s clear the community believes this coin is destined for greatness. The BTFD Presale Numbers You Need to Know The BTFD presale launched at just $0.000004 per coin. Fast forward to today, and the price sits at $0.00012, heading for a listing price of $0.0006. That’s a 5x jump for presale investors before the coin even hits major exchanges. Over 52 billion coins have already been sold to more than 4,700 investors, and the presale is now in its 11th stage. Want to join the action? Here’s what your investment could look like a $3,000 buy-in at today’s presale price of $0.00012 nets you 25 million BTFD coins. Once the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment balloons to $15,000. Miss this chance? That’s on you. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an ecosystem. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already in beta, users can dive into the Bulls Squad universe, unlocking rewards while enjoying cutting-edge gameplay. Though the beta version doesn’t offer rewards, it’s just a taste of what’s to come. What’s more, BTFD offers a staking program with an average APY of 90%, giving hodlers a reason to stick around long-term. The coin is also built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and seamless transactions. This is more than a presale; it’s a movement. Join the Bulls Squad, stack your coins, and ride the wave into the next bull cycle. The next Bonk-style story is unfolding, and it’s spelt BTFD. Bonk: The OG Meme Coin That Got Away Who could forget the Bonk (BONK) phenomenon? Launched as the first Solana-based meme coin, BONK took the crypto world by storm in late 2024. With its whimsical dog-themed branding and community-first approach, BONK quickly became a darling among Gen Z investors and crypto enthusiasts. A Meteoric Rise and Missed Opportunities In November 2024, BONK reached its all-time high of $0.000062, fuelled by its listing on the Upbit exchange and a massive community token burn of 1 trillion BONK tokens. Investors who got in early saw staggering returns, turning pocket change into life-changing wealth. But like all meme coins, volatility reared its head, and BONK’s price experienced sharp fluctuations. For those who missed out, it was a painful lesson: hesitation costs. While early adopters celebrated their gains, latecomers were left wishing they’d acted sooner. Latest Developments in BONK’s Journey Today, BONK trades at $0.00004069, showing a slight upward trend as of December 2024. Its community remains strong, and recent initiatives to reduce supply aim to stabilise the coin for long-term growth. However, for new investors, BONK’s peak profitability may already be in the rear-view mirror. And that’s why BTFD is so exciting. With its presale still underway, you’re getting in at ground zero—no second-guessing, no regrets. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best New Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Bonk taught us that timing is everything here. BTFD isn’t just another opportunity; it’s your shot at being the investor others envy. With its low entry price, innovative ecosystem, and community-driven ethos, BTFD checks all the boxes for a meme coin poised to explode. Consider this: you can buy 30.5 million BTFD coins for just 1 Ethereum or snag 813 million coins with 1 Bitcoin. Even smaller investments pack a punch. With $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. Don’t let these numbers pass you by—this is your Bonk moment, but better. The Road Ahead BTFD’s roadmap is ambitious but achievable. From scaling its P2E game to securing major exchange listings, the project is laser-focused on delivering value to its community. With liquidity locked for three years and a robust tokenomics model, BTFD offers long-term stability in a market known for its unpredictability. And let’s not forget the community. The Bulls Squad is more than just a fan base; it’s a movement of like-minded investors rallying around a shared vision. This isn’t just about profits; it’s about proving that meme coins can be more than a flash in the pan. Don’t Miss the Dip—Join the BTFD Presale Today The crypto market rarely gives second chances, but that’s exactly what BTFD represents. Whether you missed out on Bonk or are looking to amplify your portfolio, the best new meme coin presale to join now is right here, waiting for you. Time is of the essence. With every passing day, the BTFD presale inches closer to its final stages. Don’t let hesitation rob you of another Bonk-style opportunity. Sign up, load up your wallet, and grab your share of the coin that’s destined to make headlines. This is your moment. Will you seize it?

Seems US states are already making Trump’s vision of Bitcoin reserve a reality.

Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, supports the initiative, highlighting its reliance on voluntary Bitcoin donations from residents instead of taxpayer money, fostering a sense of community ownership. Key Features of the Proposal The bill outlines the creation of a secure Bitcoin fund, serving as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Representative Capriglione emphasized its flexibility, leaving room for future expansion based on legislative support. This approach could make Texas a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin into its financial systems. Others Following the League This proposal mirrors similar efforts nationwide, such as Pennsylvania’s recent legislation. Up to ten other states and several countries are reportedly exploring comparable measures. On the federal level, President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance includes plans for a national Bitcoin reserve and the formation of a crypto advisory council. Plus, states like Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Montana have already enacted laws to support mining rights and digital asset innovation. Advocacy groups, such as the Satoshi Action Fund, have introduced over 30 crypto-focused bills across the U.S. Bitcoin is Getting Mainstream Attention The concept of Bitcoin reserves is gaining traction internationally. Following the buzz, Bitcoin prices jumped 45% since the elections. El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin as part of their national strategies, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin as a key asset. However, some resistance remains, as seen in Microsoft’s recent rejection of a Bitcoin investment proposal. Why This Matters If passed it will be effective by September 1, 2025, with expiration on September 1, 2035. Texas’s initiative could lead the way for other states to adopt similar strategies, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. With growing support from state and federal governments, Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream financial systems seems more promising than ever.

In a post on X, Ethena Labs, built on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a possible launch for its stablecoin USDe which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is mainly built as a yield-generating asset rather than an intermediary for a transaction, similar to Tether ( USDT ) or USD Coin ( USDC ). 16.12.2024 pic.twitter.com/zmRQyCFfy9 — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 12, 2024 Ethena Labs announcement of USDe stablecoin on X. In contrast to the traditional fiat-reserve-backed stablecoins , USDe derives its yield based on the staking rewards of Ethereum ( ETH ) and keeps that reward away from the short funding rate for ETH. By doing so, it provides the holder an attractive annual percentage yield of up to 29%. This double-layered yield model makes USDe a high-reward financial instrument in the decentralized finance space. Users have rapidly flocked to USDe, making it the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, overtaking DAI’s $4.7 billion market cap, but is still behind USDT and USDC, which have a market cap of $135 billion and $40 billion, respectively. According to CoinMarketCap , USDe’s trading volume increased by 24.27% in the past 24 hours to reach $171.09 million, indicating high demand for yield-bearing assets.

Ethena’s USDe has been compared to Terra-Luna, whose value also collapsed in 2022 because of its unsustainable growth model, by critics . Terra’s collapse was attributed to its struggles to maintain its peg with the U.S dollar in a bearish market, and experts fear USDe could suffer the same fate. USDe employs a delta-neutral trading strategy, which balances Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH long and short positions to maintain its stability and yield. Ethena hedges the long stETH positions on centralized exchanges. In case a CEX goes down, the hedge may sit there; Ethena’s positions open to unrealized profits and losses. In a bull market, since the funding rate stays positive, this technique will work well; however, in bear markets, once the funding rate becomes negative, the yield can go down.

Secondly, given the growing efficiency of the crypto market, the profit margins, known as the basis spread , could narrow, reducing the profitability of USDe’s high yields in the long run.

Grayscale has launched investment trusts for Lido DAO and Optimism governance tokens, providing exposure to key Ethereum-based protocols. Meanwhile, Spotlight Stock Market has expanded its cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) lineup, adding 20 new listings from Valour, a DeFi Technologies subsidiary, broadening access to a diverse range of digital assets for investors. Grayscale Expands Investment Offerings with Lido and Optimism Governance Token Trusts Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has unveiled two new investment trusts focused on governance tokens for Lido DAO (LDO) and Optimism (OP). The announcement, made on Dec. 12, signals a continued push by Grayscale to broaden its portfolio of crypto-focused investment products while supporting Ethereum’s scaling and staking ecosystem. The newly launched Grayscale Lido DAO Trust and Grayscale Optimism Trust are designed to give investors direct exposure to the native tokens of two influential Ethereum protocols. Lido DAO is the largest liquid staking token (LST) protocol on Ethereum, while Optimism is a prominent layer-2 (L2) scaling solution aimed at improving Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability. “Lido is helping to democratize staking on Ethereum, and Optimism is critical in allowing Ethereum to scale to compete with newer, faster layer-1 blockchains,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research. These trusts are positioned to appeal to investors seeking exposure to protocols driving Ethereum’s broader adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The goal is to offer “exposure to protocols helping to increase Ethereum’s efficiency, security, scalability, and adoption,” Sharif-Askary added. Why Lido and Optimism? Lido’s liquid staking technology has revolutionized staking on Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) while still maintaining liquidity by issuing tradeable tokens representing claims on their staked assets. This innovation has made staking more accessible and flexible for a broader range of users. As of December, Lido boasts nearly $40 billion in total value locked (TVL), securing its position as the largest DeFi protocol by TVL, according to DefiLlama . The protocol’s influence has made its governance token, LDO, a highly sought-after asset in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Optimism , a popular Ethereum layer-2 network, leverages optimistic rollups to improve transaction speed and reduce costs, addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. With approximately $800 million in TVL, Optimism has become a cornerstone of Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Beyond its own network, Optimism’s technology underpins other layer-2 solutions, including Coinbase’s Base and Uniswap’s Unichain, forming what the project describes as a “superchain.” This interconnected network enhances Ethereum’s scalability and facilitates a seamless user experience across various layer-2 ecosystems. The launch of the Lido and Optimism trusts is the latest in a series of initiatives by Grayscale to expand its suite of single-asset crypto investment products. Aave Governance Token Fund: In October, Grayscale introduced a trust dedicated to Aave (AAVE), a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Additional Assets Under Consideration: Grayscale has added 35 altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Worldcoin (WLD), and Pyth (PYTH), to its list of assets under consideration for future investment products. Other Recent Trusts: In August, Grayscale launched three separate trusts targeting Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Bittensor, and Sui, further diversifying its offerings. Grayscale’s Dominance in the Crypto Investment Space Grayscale manages nearly $35 billion in assets as of Dec. 11, cementing its reputation as a dominant force in the crypto investment industry. Its flagship products include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), both of which are industry benchmarks for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. US regulators are also evaluating Grayscale’s proposal to convert its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC)—a fund holding a mix of cryptocurrencies—into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, this move could further solidify Grayscale’s role as a leader in crypto financial products. Grayscale’s new trusts bring attention to the growing importance of Ethereum-based protocols in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. By focusing on Lido and Optimism, Grayscale is betting on Ethereum’s ability to address its scalability and usability challenges, which are crucial for its long-term adoption and success. The investments also highlight the rising demand for products that offer exposure to governance tokens—critical assets that give holders a say in the development and direction of blockchain protocols. As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, the success of projects like Lido and Optimism could pave the way for further institutional interest in DeFi and layer-2 solutions. Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market Expands Crypto ETP Offerings with 20 New Listings by Valour The Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden has significantly bolstered its cryptocurrency-focused investment offerings by listing 20 new digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs). All the newly introduced ETPs were issued by Valour, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, marking another major milestone in bringing blockchain technology to traditional investors. With the new listings, Spotlight now hosts 45 ETPs, all of which are issued by Valour. These ETPs provide investors with regulated access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects without needing to manage the complexities of holding digital assets directly. Of the 45 products, four are denominated in euros, while the remainder are priced in Swedish kronor. Valour’s expansion on Spotlight began in June with the launch of ETPs for Core (CORE) and Hedera (HBAR). The company’s latest offering includes a mix of well-established and emerging blockchain projects, reflecting Valour’s goal of broadening access to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Johan Wattenström, co-founder of Valour, emphasized the significance of the new launches, stating, “By simultaneously introducing such a diverse range of innovative products, we are not merely expanding our portfolio — we are offering investors access to the forefront of blockchain technology.” The Assets Behind the New ETPs The 20 new ETPs feature an eclectic mix of cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols , including: Aave (AAVE): A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Aerodrome Finance (AERO): A platform focused on liquidity and DeFi innovation. Akash Network (AKT): A decentralized cloud computing marketplace. Aptos (APT): A next-generation layer-1 blockchain. Arweave (AR): A blockchain solution for permanent data storage. Fetch.ai (FET): An AI-driven blockchain platform. Fantom (FTM): A scalable blockchain for DeFi and enterprise applications. Injective (INJ): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for decentralized finance. Jupiter (JUP): A platform for decentralized applications and token utilities. Kaspa (KAS): A layer-1 blockchain with a focus on speed and security. Lido DAO (LDO): A liquid staking protocol for Ethereum. Metis (METIS): A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Pendle (PENDLE): A protocol for trading tokenized yield. Pyth Network (PYTH): A decentralized oracle solution. Render (RNDR): A blockchain for decentralized GPU rendering. Sei (SEI): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for trading. Starknet (STRK): A layer-2 scaling solution using zero-knowledge proofs. THORChain (RUNE): A decentralized liquidity network. Worldcoin (WLD): A cryptocurrency with a focus on universal access and identity. Wormhole (W): A cross-chain interoperability protocol. Valour’s Strategic Expansion Valour’s latest listings align with its broader mission to dominate the European ETP market. The company currently manages over 60 ETPs across Europe and has set an ambitious target of reaching 100 ETPs by the end of 2025. In November, Valour and Spotlight introduced the first Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP, capturing attention for its novel approach to meme cryptocurrency investing. In October, Valour also migrated 19 ETPs from the Nordic Growth Market to Spotlight, further consolidating its presence in Sweden’s financial ecosystem. Valour’s reach is not limited to Europe. The company has taken significant steps toward global expansion. In November, it signed a memorandum of understanding with AsiaNext, a Singapore-licensed securities exchange, to list its ETPs for institutional investors in Asia. AsiaNext is a joint venture between Japan’s SBI Digital Asset Holdings and Switzerland’s SIX Group, which operates the SIX Exchange. In August, Valour partnered with Sov.fi and the Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya to explore listing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR) on the exchange. This initiative marked a pioneering move toward introducing digital asset ETPs to African markets. The rapid growth of Valour’s offerings signals increasing institutional and retail interest in cryptocurrency investments. Exchange-traded products simplify access to digital assets, offering a regulated environment for investors who might otherwise be hesitant to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership. Valour’s decision to expand its portfolio with Spotlight shows Sweden’s growing importance as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. Spotlight is one of three major stock markets in the country, alongside Nasdaq Nordic and Nordic Growth Market. By positioning itself as a leader in crypto ETPs, Spotlight aims to attract a new generation of investors looking to diversify their portfolios with blockchain-based assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|LDO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-13 05:30:12

Tipped by insiders to 60x or more in 2025 after the presale finalizes, Rollblock (RBLK) aims to break up the centralized gambling market with democratized access for users through instant crypto deposits and withdrawals, as well as staking APY, revenue sharing, and token burning. The RBLK price is steady at $0.041 in its 9th presale stage, while altcoins are dropping RBLK will increase to $0.047, taking early returns to new highs. Meanwhile, large-cap cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) have both declined by 11%. Ripple Sees Huge Declines Post-Surge The Ripple real-time settlement ecosystem has seen a larger pullback than other tokens. However, the reason for the decline is clear, as it observed an impressive bullish trend in recent months. The Ripple token traded at $0.70 on November 12 and peaked at $2.72 on December 2. Presently, the coin sits at $2.02 after the expected retracement. In three weeks, the price of Ripple has nearly tripled, which was not the case for the majority of other tokens. The pullback was inevitable. Moreover, the token might see even further downside in the coming weeks and months as many investors sell to take out their profits. Binance Coin Falling Along With Wider Crypto Economy The price drop of Binance Coin is less explainable than Ripple and is likely due to a correlation with the wider crypto economy. Binance Coin traded at a low of $550 in early November and peaked at $750 in early December. Binance Coin’s upside was far less impressive than Ripples and it currently trades at around $658. Like Ripple, Binance Coin does provide strong underlying utility. Binance Coin is a huge ecosystem with a variety of products, including a CEX, DEX, wallet, NFT marketplace, P2P marketplace, and more. It provides both DeFi and CeFi operations. But this is still not enough to protect it from the wider market with Bitcoin declines often causing Binance Coin to crash. Rollblock’s GambleFi Protocol Is Crushing the Market Rollblock is an AI-powered GambleFi ecosystem with swift payouts, weekly profit sharing, instant crypto deposits, staking APY, transaction analytics, and a token burn mechanism that takes the native coin out of circulation to increase the price of remaining coins. The Rollblock crypto casino is fully licensed and verified by the Curacao Gaming Authority with an independent third-party audit from SolidProof. Of the 1,000,000,000 RBLK tokens, 60% are available in the presale with 11% allocated to exchange listings, 11% to rewards, 12% to marketing, and 6% to development. Profits are redistributed weekly to players as part of the project’s revenue share model, and other passive income mechanisms include liquidity provision, yield farming, staking, and affiliate programs, along with early bird presale pricing. Given the many passive income mechanisms, it is entirely feasible to see Rollblock 60x or more in 2025, and it targets a highly lucrative online gambling market that is set for change. With tokens currency selling at just $0.041, the RBLK presale could be the perfect option for investors frustrated at an overbought crypto market, including Ripple and Binance tokens with several price increases anticipated before the end of the year!

XRP Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the 4-hour price of XRP has been forming a Bull Flag recently. The “Bull Flag” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a flag on a pole. The pattern forms whenever the asset’s price follows up a sharp uptrend with a period of consolidation towards the downside. The initial upwards move corresponds to the ‘pole,’ while the consolidation period makes up for the ‘flag.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals In flag patterns, this consolidation specifically happens inside a parallel channel. That is, between two parallel trendlines marking successive tops and bottoms in the price. When the trendlines are converging, the pattern is known as a pennant. The upper level of the flag can be likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower level may act as support. A break out of either of these trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. A bull flag is considered to be a continuation pattern, so the probability of a breakout happening above the resistance level may be higher than that of the support line failing. Like the bull flag, there is also a pattern called the bear flag. This one works much in the same way, except for the fact that the pole is made by a sharp move down and the flag represents a brief phase of consolidation towards the upside. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the bull flag that XRP has recently been traveling inside: As displayed in the above graph, the 4-hour XRP price has just seen a rise to the upper level of the bull flag consolidation channel. When the same retest occurred a couple of days ago, the asset found rejection, but it’s possible that this might be the time it finds a break. Martinez has pointed out, however, that the cryptocurrency has witnessed another signal alongside this retest: the completion of a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential sell setup. The TD Sequential is a TA indicator that basically points out probable locations of tops and bottoms in any asset’s value. It involves two phases, with the first, which is known as the setup, occurring after price observes nine candles of the same color. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1.6 Billion Liquidations As XRP, DOGE Down 10% XRP has finished this type of TD Sequential phase with nine green candles, meaning that the indicator is now signaling a potential reversal to the downside for the coin. As such, the analyst thinks a brief correction would happen for the cryptocurrency first, before it manages to find a break above the $0.246 resistance. Bull flag breakouts can be of a similar length as the pole, so based on this, Martinez has chosen the $4 target for XRP. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.42, up more than 4% over the last seven days.

Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro has responded to this by putting out the details of the charges. Gary Gensler Targets Elon Musk In A Neuralink Probe The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be preparing for additional charges against Tesla Chair Elon Musk while also reopening an investigation into his neurotechnology company, Neuralink. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, has responded to the SEC chair Gary Gensler in a letter shared on the social media platform X. The letter notes that the US SEC has given Musk a 48-hour deadline to accept the monetary settlement or face charges on “numerous counts”. However, the securities regulator has failed to mention the exact nature of these charges while referring to a multi-year investigation by the agency. Additionally, the SEC has revived its probe into Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface venture. Musk wrote: “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” Calls for an investigation into Neuralink first surfaced back in 2023. Back then lawmakers raised concerns over Musk’s claims regarding the safety of the company’s brain implant technology. Slamming the SEC, Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro said that the recent SEC actions are nothing but an “endless investigation campaign” targeting the billionaire entrepreneur. US SEC Chair Gary Gensler holds a very bad reputation, especially in the crypto space, for his high-handed regulatory approach. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the company lost more than $150 million in a legal battle with the SEC because of Gensler. Elon Musk’s history with the SEC includes a $20 million settlement in 2018 over his tweets claiming that Tesla would go private and that the necessary funding had been secured. Elon Musk also tasked his AI, Grok, with creating an illustration of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The resulting image depicted a snail in a business suit, referencing Gary the Snail from SpongeBob SquarePants. Asked @Grok to draw a picture of @GaryGensler . Very flattering, I think! https://t.co/NJnAj1nKIS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Will Paul Atkins Transform Crypto The crypto community has been celebrating Gary Gensler’s ouster calling it an end to the tough regulatory regime for the industry. All eyes are on incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins who is set to revive the SEC with friendlier crypto reforms. “Under his leadership, the SEC may move away from aggressive tactics that prioritize headline-grabbing penalties over substantive outcomes,” wrote lawyers at US legal firm Anderson PC. On the other hand, Elon Musk will be working at the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and has recently proposed measures to end US inflation with the focus on cutting the federal spending.

The company recently minted over 13 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network, marking a key phase in its mainnet testing. Ripple Minted 13 Mln RLUSD Token In recent tweet posts, Ripple Stablecoin Tracker highlighted that the company minted 2.6 million RLUSD tokens on the XRP Ledger, along with additional smaller batches of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD. Notably, the XRP Ledger showcased its low-cost efficiency, with minting expenses totaling just 0.00048 XRP . On the Ethereum Network, Ripple minted 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens, with the cost for the largest batch being 0.00161 ETH, or about $6.31. However, these tests showcase the scalability and cost-effectiveness of both networks. Preparing for a Stablecoin Launch Ripple has been carefully testing RLUSD through minting , burning, and transferring processes to ensure it can handle real-world demands upon full launch. With its entry into the competitive stablecoin arena, RLUSD will face strong contenders like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. However, Ripple’s regulatory compliance may give it an edge, positioning RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. Meanwhile, CEO Brad Garlinghouse assured community users, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” XRP Price Update The launch announcement had a bullish impact on XRP, Ripple’s native token. XRP surged by 13%, reaching $2.46 , with potential targets of $2.80 and even $3 if it breaks the $2.50 resistance level. Analysts are closely monitoring the token as it approaches the key resistance level within a descending channel, with the next 48 hours being pivotal for market movements.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|USDT|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 05:56:51

Deaton has slammed the SEC for its aggressive actions against companies and individuals, using Elon Musk’s recent legal clash as an example. Deaton highlighted a report that SEC Chair Gary Gensler had issued a settlement demand to Musk, threatening charges unless he complied within 48 hours. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused the SEC of harassment and politically motivated actions. Elon Musk has had a long-running feud with the SEC, starting in 2018 when the agency charged him with fraud over his “Funding secured” in his X post about taking Tesla private. Musk settled the case, paying $20 million fines for both himself and Tesla, and stepping down as Tesla’s chairman. However, the settlement only fueled his resentment towards the SEC. Musk has repeatedly criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and, since Trump’s election, has continued his public attacks. Musk is now leading a nongovernmental effort, the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), to study federal spending and regulation. John Deaton Took a Jab at SEC’s Actions Having said that, Deaton argued that if the SEC treats the world’s richest man this way, smaller businesses and entrepreneurs face even harsher challenges. He referenced the LBRY case, where the SEC allegedly threatened to bankrupt the company and its founder, Jeremy Kauffman, even before filing a lawsuit. Similarly, Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly spent over $150 million defending against what Deaton described as a “non-fraud” case. Most companies lack such resources, making it nearly impossible to fight back against the SEC. Deaton also pointed to the SEC’s actions against Dragonchain as another example of regulatory overreach. He expressed hope that Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, could reform the agency if given the chance. Community Reaction An X user Nuclear Herbs responded to John Deaton and shared another example of SEC overreach in the SEC v Richard Heart Hearing where the judge struggled to understand the SEC’s fraud allegations. The post suggests that just because the SEC accuses someone of fraud, it doesn’t mean there’s any real fraud. The SEC, according to the post, is using the term “fraud” to unfairly sway public opinion, even when the claims are baseless. This critique adds to growing concerns about the SEC’s enforcement methods, particularly in the crypto space, where companies often face costly and prolonged legal battles.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 05:59:18

Japan's industrial production increased by 2.8% month-over-month in October 2024, below the preliminary estimate of 3.0% growth.

At the conference, officials led by Xi Jinping pledged to adopt a more expansive fiscal and monetary approach, including a larger budget deficit, increased borrowing, and reduced interest rates. Caution mounted ahead of a slew of economic data from China due Monday, including retail sales and industrial output. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -1.71% to 20,077 in early deals on Friday, surrendering gains from the prior session due to steep losses across sectors.

The report highlights a significant shift in the developer landscape, with Solana projected to attract 7,625 new developers by 2024, an 83% increase from the previous year. Of the 39,148 developers who started exploring the crypto space this year, around 20% chose Solana as their platform. This is the first time another blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in growth since its launch in 2016, according to Electric Capital’s findings. Despite Solana’s rapid growth, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain by total number of developers across all major regions, including North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Solana follows closely behind as the second largest ecosystem for developers globally. Related News: Big Bear Analyst il Capo also Stepped Back: Shares His Next Move The report attributes Solana’s developer growth to a variety of factors, including increased network activity and user interest during the recent memecoin rally. Platforms like Pumpfun, which simplify memecoin launches, have played a key role in increasing engagement. “Solana’s growth demonstrates the ecosystem’s ability to attract developers by offering high scalability and an active user base,” the report said. Electric Capital’s analysis also revealed significant growth in other blockchain ecosystems, with Aptos, Base, Bitcoin, Internet Computer, NEAR, Polkadot, Polygon, Starknet, and Sui each adding over 1,000 new developers in 2024. Meanwhile, networks like BNB, Optimism, Scroll, Stellar, and TON added 500 developers each. *This is not investment advice.

But things took a turn when the creator of the character, Philip Banks, strongly objected to the use of his art in the meme coin project. However, a recent Instagram post by Banks indicates that a solution has been reached to settle this issue. Curious to know the details? Read on! Philip Banks Announces Licensing Agreement There were rumors that the CHILLGUY meme coin team would approach Banks seeking his support. In a recent Instagram post, Banks confirms that the team approached him, and they have reached an agreement regarding licensing and IP rights after a long discussion. He officially announces that he has decided to provide licensing and IP rights to the team, putting an end to the uncertainty and questioning the sustainability of the meme coin. Notably, it was through his X handle that Banks initially shared the developments regarding the discussion.

After briefly dropping below $2, XRP now trades at approximately $2.42, marking a steep 19.36% loss over the past week. Despite this downturn, three major developments are poised to drive a rebound in the asset’s price, offering hope to investors and enthusiasts: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Nears Launch: Ripple is preparing to introduce its much-anticipated U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. The stablecoin has secured final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), as confirmed by Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. While the exact launch date is yet to be announced, Ripple is expected to share further updates through its official communication channels soon. RLUSD is designed to enhance Ripple’s ecosystem by facilitating institutional payments and cross-border transactions. By increasing the utility of the token within its network, the stablecoin’s deployment could potentially attract more institutional participation. Analysts predict that this added utility may boost demand for XRP as a bridge currency, further integrating the token into Ripple’s payment infrastructure. Growing Interest: The prospect of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is gaining momentum, with several asset management firms already filing applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notable firms such as WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise have joined the race, alongside Canary Capital, which initiated the process in October. Speculation is also growing that major players like BlackRock could follow suit. Approval of an XRP ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to the token, potentially driving significant capital inflows. Drawing parallels to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions of dollars in investments, an XRP ETF could substantially enhance market liquidity and encourage mainstream adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Developments in Ripple vs. SEC Case: The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC influences the asset’s market performance. However, recent developments suggest a potential resolution may be near. Observers speculate that a settlement could become more likely with the upcoming change in U.S. administration, particularly as SEC Chair Gary Gensler is expected to step down following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. A favorable settlement or resolution would likely remove regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset, reinforcing its classification as a non-security. Such clarity could pave the way for increased investor confidence and institutional engagement, providing a strong foundation for price recovery. While the asset has faced significant market challenges, these three developments—Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch, the growing interest in XRP ETFs, and potential progress in its legal battle with the SEC—offer a path toward recovery and growth. As the market anticipates these events, the coming months could be key for XRP’s trajectory, making it a focal point for investors and analysts.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Crossed The $768 Billion Milestone In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about the latest trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates BTC’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals The previous transfer of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in circulation, it essentially calculates the sum of the cost basis of the Bitcoin supply. In other words, the model measures the total amount of capital that the investors as whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in its value over the entire history of the digital asset: As displayed in the above graph, the BTC Realized Cap has been riding a sharp uptrend during the past year, which suggests capital has rapidly been pouring into the coin. “Bitcoin is attracting $80 billion every month,” notes the CryptoQuant founder. “Nearly half of the capital that has entered the Bitcoin market over the past 15 years was added this year.” Thanks to these impressive inflows, the total BTC investment has almost reached the $769 billion milestone. It’s unclear how long the Realized Cap could continue this sharp trajectory, but for now, it seems there is still plenty of demand for the asset. In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also discussed about the same metric from a different angle. The above chart shows the cumulative data for the Bitcoin “Realized Profit” and “Realized Loss.” These metrics, as their names imply, measure the amount of profit and loss, respectively, that the investors are realizing or harvesting through their selling. Over the history of the cryptocurrency, the difference between the cost basis and selling price for profitable transactions stands at $1.27 trillion, while that for the underwater transfers is at $592 billion.

Following a strong market recovery, Ethereum has outperformed many other cryptocurrencies, gaining 6% in the past day, according to CoinGecko. “The gears and bolts are in place,” Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at Nexo, said in an interview. “Ethereum could skyrocket beyond $5,000 by early 2025.” Ethereum is up 79% since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, but it still lags behind its all-time high of $4,800 set in 2021. Comparatively, Bitcoin is up 62% over the same period, while Solana and XRP have gained 59% and 430%, respectively. Related News: Turkey's SEC Announced the List - Blocked Access to Cryptocurrency Exchanges with Very Familiar Names Carlos Guzman, an analyst at market maker GSR, noted Ethereum’s unique position in the market. “ETH has a huge advantage in that it is the only token in the US that has an ETF, besides BTC,” he explained. “As traditional investors become more invested in crypto, they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Ethereum’s prospects are further supported by institutional interest.

The announcement intends to respond to such queries in regard to the observed unexpected wallet activity in the process. WazirX stated to its users that all the cold wallets and all tokens that are stored in those wallets will be disclosed to the public once the balancing and managing of the pockets are done.

This massive expiration is expected to trigger significant market movement, creating potential volatility as traders and investors prepare for a busy day. Bitcoin Options Expiring: $3.36 Billion at Stake A large portion of the expirations comes from Bitcoin options. According to Deribit , over 217,000 Bitcoin contracts, valued at approximately $3.36 billion, are set to settle today. With a put-to-call ratio of 0.60, there are more long positions (calls) than short ones (puts), indicating overall bullish sentiment. However, the maximum pain point for Bitcoin stands at $98,000, which is slightly below the current spot price of $99,758. While Bitcoin’s recent rise to $103,000 was notable, a recent price dip has caused liquidations of many leveraged positions. Still, solid buying activity in the spot market suggests optimism, though high funding rates for leveraged positions could lead to potential pullbacks. $900 Million Ethereum Options Expiring Ethereum also has a big expiration today, with over 1.7 million contracts worth around $900 million set to expire. Interestingly, Ethereum traders appear more bullish than Bitcoin traders, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.46. However, the max pain point is at $3,700, which mark is crucial for both bulls and bears, as it will likely determine the next price direction for ETH. Is the Christmas Rally Coming? With options expiring, traders are now wondering if a rally could take place before Christmas. The market shows Bitcoin and Ethereum moving in different directions, with Bitcoin holding below $100,000 and Ethereum staying just under $4,000. The next few days could be crucial, as traders adjust their positions and prepare for the end of the year.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 07:13:55

How Gaming and A.I on XRP can Fuel Massive Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is thrilled with the recent approval of RLUSD by New York regulators as they see stablecoins like RLUSD as crucial for improving cross-border payments and simplifying user integration into the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ripple is also focused on enhancing the network’s functionality, driving adoption, and creating liquidity, with a particular emphasis on sectors like gaming. McDonald Talks XRP’s Market Growth Aaron McDonald, CEO of Futureverse, talked about the current XRP market, noting the recent rise in XRP’s price and the strong support from its community. On The Paul Barron Network , he explained that although they joined Ripple during tough times, they believed in the potential of the loyal XRP community. McDonald described the community as a “loaded spring” ready to bounce back once obstacles were gone. He also said the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin backed by Ripple, could help bring more liquidity and support to the market. Stablecoins, he said, are useful for consumers and everyday transactions, especially in gaming. He’s excited about using this technology in Futureverse’s network. McDonald boasted XRP’s growth, with almost 20,000 trust lines now in place, showing XRP’s growing influence in the ecosystem. With Ripple’s stablecoin approval, XRP is set for growth – read XRP price prediction to see what’s next for this rising cryptocurrency! XRP Drives Root Network Success He explained how XRP is used within their network, calling it the “gas token” for the Root Network. This means that XRP powers everything on the network, from transactions to smart contracts . Over the past year, they’ve seen great progress by turning XRP into a valuable utility. In the first year, $13 billion worth of value was transferred on the network. Root Network validators also earned fees, with nearly 13% of the fees burned on the entire XRP ledger. McDonald aims to scale this success further in the coming year, hoping to 10x growth and increase the utility of XRP even more. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BTFD Coin (BTFD): Leading the Meme Market When it comes to meme coins, BTFD Coin is in a league of its own. Built on the ethos of “buy the dip,” it’s rallying investors with its high-stakes presale and vibrant community. Why BTFD is the Star of the Week With its presale already in the 11th stage, BTFD Coin has raised over $3.6 million, selling 52 billion tokens for just $0.00012. A $1,250 investment at this stage would secure over 10.4 million BTFD tokens. When the token hits its anticipated listing price of $0.0006, that investment could soar to $6,250. But BTFD is about more than just profits. Its 90% staking APY and the beta release of its P2E game make it a comprehensive ecosystem for growth and engagement. Why This Week is Crucial? BTFD Coin’s presale momentum is building fast, making this the perfect time to secure your spot before the token’s price climbs further. 2.

Dogwifhat’s blend of humour and forward-thinking strategies positions it as a solid choice for investors looking to diversify. 3. Ponke: The Underdog Rising Ponke has quickly gained traction with its minimalistic approach and focus on grassroots community building. What it lacks in flashy features, it makes up for in sheer dedication. The token has introduced a “Hold-to-Earn” mechanism, rewarding long-term investors with additional tokens. This initiative has resonated well with its community, driving steady growth. Why It’s a Hot Pick? Ponke’s steady rise proves that even underdogs can shine with the right community support. 4. Neiro: The AI-Powered Meme Coin Neiro blends artificial intelligence with meme coin charm, making it a unique player in the space. Its use of AI to generate memes and enhance user experience is both innovative and entertaining. The project recently launched an AI-powered meme generator, enabling users to create and share custom memes directly from its platform. This interactive feature has boosted engagement significantly. Why This Week Matters? Neiro’s tech-driven approach sets it apart from traditional meme coins, making now an excellent time to get in before its user base expands further. 5.

Inspired by viral internet culture, Brett leverages its comedic roots to drive investor interest. The team behind Brett has partnered with several influencers, helping the coin gain visibility across social media platforms. Its quirky appeal has attracted a loyal following that continues to grow.

The discussion centered on technical patterns, breakout points, and strategic price targets, emphasizing the bullish outlook for XRP both in the short term and through 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE FILTHY RICH BECAUSE OF THIS! (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/esdq9eJ6zz — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Technical Overview In the monthly timeframe, Steph highlighted the confirmed breakout of a W formation, a bullish technical pattern. According to his analysis, XRP has retested the neckline of this formation at approximately $1.96, a level not seen since 2021. XRP began forming this pattern after its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. It hit the bottom of the first half in December 2020 when it hit a low of $0.1743, before climbing to the top of the first half in April 2021. The asset began declining after this and hit the bottom of the pattern’s second half in 2024. The asset’s recent rise has completed this pattern, with the retest of the $1.96 level reinforcing the potential for a significant rally. The technical target of the W formation is set at $30–$35, and the asset could hit this level in 2025. XRP has since risen above $1.96 and despite some recent turbulence , the asset is currently trading at $2.36. A rise to $35 represents an increase of over 1,380%. While this target is ambitious, Steph cautioned against relying solely on it, advising XRP holders to lock in profits incrementally during the rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Short-term Targets Zooming into the daily timeframe, XRP has demonstrated strong bullish momentum since October, rallying to a multi-year high of $2.86. The analyst highlighted XRP’s resilience above its EMA ribbons, which have acted as a support level during recent price consolidations. At the time of press, the price is approaching a critical downward-sloping resistance line, established on December 3. Steph noted that a daily candle close above this trendline, or above the December 9 high of $2.6, would confirm the start of the next impulsive move. XRP’s Performance Against Bitcoin Steph also provided a detailed analysis of XRP’s performance against Bitcoin. XRP has been in a long-term downtrend against BTC since 2018. However, a trend reversal has been evident since November, with XRP now retesting a crucial resistance level that dates back to 2020. On the daily timeframe, XRP is consolidating within a bullish flag pattern against Bitcoin. The analyst believes that a breakout from this pattern could result in XRP outperforming Bitcoin by up to 78%. Some experts are already speculating on XRP’s chances to flip Bitcoin , and this surge would set it on that path.

Just a “tiny fraction” of BlackRock users own IBIT and ETHA. Tidal CIO Michael Venuto believes Bitcoin will be tied to “every options strategy.” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, is doubling down on its United States spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), IBIT and ETHA, instead of launching investment products focused on altcoins. Currently, only a small portion of the firm’s customers hold these crypto ETFs, and BlackRock wants to onboard more users. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas discussed the rising popularity and demand for crypto ETFs, referencing quotes from representatives of different digital asset management firms. With recent discussions about XRP and Solana ETFs and the overall market reaching new highs, we can expect more capital inflow.

The resurgence in ETH price to $4,000 and Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policy influenced institutional inflows in Ether ETFs. Market analysts are confident that if this stream of inflows continues, we can see ETH heading to $15,000 within the next 6 to 8 months. BlackRock Ethereum ETF Hits New Milestone BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has witnessed inflows for 10 consecutive days, bringing its net inflows above $1.3 billion in this period. As per the data from Farside Investors , the total inflows into ETHA since inception reached nearly $3.2 billion since inception. This surge in demand highlights the growing interest in Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds, which have collectively attracted more than $2 billion in inflows since their launch in July. This comes despite $3.5 billion in outflows from Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) during the same period. On Thursday, December 12, the BlackRock Ethereum ETF saw an additional $202 million in inflows. The second-best inflows were in Grayscale mini Ether ETF (ETH) which saw more than $73 million in inflows. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FETH has also witnessed strong inflows nearing $1.4 billion since inception. Furthermore, the BlackRock management team also has high hopes for its Ethereum ETF’s future performance. Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs said: “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)”. ETH Price Mega Rally In Making? ETH price bounced back to $4,000 on Thursday, however, it continues to face rejection at these levels. As of press time, price of Ethereum is trading 0.74% down at $3,913 with a market cap of $471 billion. Despite this, market analysts continue to be optimistic about Ethereum expecting a mega rally ahead. Ethereum is poised to close another weekly green candle, provided its price stays above $3,712, according to prominent crypto analyst VentureFounder. The analyst’s long-term outlook places ETH price to reach a target of $15,937 by May 2025. In the short term, VentureFounder suggests Ethereum’s next three-week green candle could push the cryptocurrency to its previous all-time high of $4,900. Courtesy: TradingView Thus, if inflows into BlackRock Ethereum ETF continue at the same pace, it can lead to further gains for ETH. However, the asset needed to first break past its crucial resistance from Ethereum price to target $5,000 and fresh all-time highs ahead.

The attack which affected the older versions of the network has presented the dogecoin community with security and robustness issues. The Extent of the Exploit Data highlighted by blockchain analytics platform Blockchain, the number of active Dogecoin nodes dropped from 647 to 205 earlier this week. Although some nodes have come back online, bumping the total figure back up to 331 as of now, the event exposes a major weakness in the network design. The exploit, known as “ DogeReaper ,” was first reported by security engineer Tobias Ruck. It enables hackers to launch segmentation faults at Dogecoin nodes from a distance, thereby terminating them. Hacker Claims Responsibility On X, Sequentia developer Andreas Kohl confessed to using the DogeReaper vulnerability on a decade-old laptop from El Salvador’s countryside. He said it was only the old nodes and they are the majority of the network while centralised exchanges and major custodians were not impacted. “Many Dogecoin users didn’t pay attention because they can use exchanges or have some kind of third party that holds their coins,” Kohl said. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Weekly Hack Report: Alarming Trends You Should Know , Contracted Dogecoin Network Consequences An attack on this scale shows a crucial vulnerability in Dogecoin’s system of decentralization. In the past, researchers have related the exploit to something like the ‘Death Note’, which is from Japanese manga, where, once someone’s name is written, the character drops dead. Like the case of the DogeReaper flaw, it can paralyze the network, stopping all its transactions and block generation for days. Critics say, however, that the attack presents a more significant problem. Despite the hack, Dogecoin’s price stabilized at $0.4073 at the time of writing, down 2.54% according to data by Coinmarketcap . The team is now under pressure to fix the loophole as soon as possible and rebuild the confidence of their network. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 07:50:00

The man leading Parliament’s work on the digital euro, who became one of its biggest critics, has quit to stop claims he was delaying the project on purpose, POLITICO has learned . Berger, a veteran German lawmaker from the center-right European People’s Party, announced his decision to POLITICO, stating that “it’s time for someone [who] is not coming from Germany and is not under suspicion that he wants to delay the talks.” Markus Ferber, who oversees economic issues for the EPP, will choose Berger’s replacement within a week, the report notes. The digital euro, planned as a virtual version of euro coins and notes, aims to improve payments in the eurozone and reduce dependence on foreign companies like Visa and Mastercard . But it has faced pushback, especially from German banks and citizens worried about its design and financial risks. Berger also raised concerns that it could lead to sudden withdrawals, hurting smaller banks. You might also like: ECB and EU governments reportedly clash over digital euro regulation Although Berger helped create MiCA, which will make the EU the first major region with clear crypto rules, he has faced challenges getting similar support for the digital euro. While MiCA gave crypto firms clear rules across the EU, the digital euro has been met with concerns about privacy and its technical details. Berger had proposed a gradual approach, starting with wholesale transactions for the digital euro. However, critics claimed he missed deadlines and slowed progress, leading rival lawmakers to call for his removal earlier this year. The European Central Bank is currently testing the digital euro’s feasibility, with plans for a pilot program in the coming years. Earlier in December, in a digital euro progress report , the regulator implied that it might drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration.

A Crypto Advocate Takes the Helm French Hill’s track record shows he’s not afraid to tackle tough issues in the financial world. While the draft of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) was being drafted, he played a key role in it. This act puts the foundations of rules for handling digital assets, that’s something the crypto space has been asking for. Hill also worked on legislation for stablecoins and improving the crypto market structure. As Chair, he plans to address claims of “debanking,” where financial institutions cut off services to crypto businesses. That’s a big deal for the industry. His election to this position wasn’t a given, though. He won after competing with other experienced Republican contenders. But his colleagues believed in his vision, and now, he’s ready to lead. After he was elected, he shared his regards to everyone who trusted him. “ I am humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust in me to lead the House Financial Services Committee as their next Chairman.

During the segment, Garlinghouse made​ a strong case for the future​ оf cryptocurrencies. First,​ he addressed the show’s​ 10 million viewers and defended Ripple’s vision.​ He also opened​ up about his ongoing battle with regulators over the XRP token. But while Ripple continues​ tо make headlines, there’s​ a new player​ оn the crypto scene that’s catching eyes: Rollblock.​ As​ a fresh face​ іn the crypto world, Rollblock​ is stepping​ up with​ an innovative GambleFi platform, offering​ a unique blend​ оf gaming and decentralized finance. With growing attention, it’s clear Rollblock ​ is one​ tо watch closely​ since it’s making waves in presale stage 9, available at $0.041. Rollblock: New Crypto That’s Changing iGaming Space While XRP is all over the news, Rollblock is making its own spot as a leader in the fast-growing GambleFi sector. With a huge $7 million raised during its presale and token prices soaring by 310%, Rollblock is on track to disrupt the massive $500 billion global gambling industry. What’s driving Rollblock’s success? It’s all about its innovative ecosystem. The platform offers over 7,000 games, including live casino options and sports betting, all powered by Ethereum-backed smart contracts. This ensures transparency, security, and fairness, setting Rollblock apart from other gaming platforms. Rollblock’s deflationary tokenomics also makes it stand out. The platform uses weekly buybacks and token burns to maintain scarcity and increase value. Plus, investors can stake RBLK tokens for high APY rewards, creating a solid passive income stream. This smart economic model is getting lots of attention and positions Rollblock as a strong contender in the next crypto rally. Rollblock’s appeal is growing fast, attracting both experienced investors and newcomers eager for sustainable gains. It’s not just shaking up the $500 billion iGaming market; it’s tapping into the broader crypto rally, making it a project to keep an eye on. XRP Rally is Strong If we watch closely what happened in this bull market, XRP is surely considered a winner. XRP did jump 253.41% in the last 30 days alone. But, just like that, things have taken a bit of a dip. XRP has dropped some of its recent gains. This shows us that XRP is stabilizing and preparing for a new jump and another XRP rally . So, what might seem like a setback could actually be a sign that XRP is just getting ready for the next big jump. The market’s cooling off for now, but many believe it’s just a breather before another rally kicks in. But another new crypto is causing a real fuss – Rollblock. No matter what happens on the main stage, Rollblock seems to handle everything with ease. Conclusion To sum it up, Ripple is making waves, and XRP’s rally has been strong – though it might be taking a short pause. Meanwhile, Rollblock is a project you definitely don’t want to sleep on. With its unique GambleFi platform and huge potential to shake up the iGaming industry, Rollblock is on track to become one of the next big things in crypto. Don’t miss out – this is the perfect time to jump in before everyone else catches on. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Bitcoin, Ethereum Spot ETFs See Record Inflows Amid Market Momentum Bitcoin Spot ETFs surge with $598 million net inflows. Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a total of $598 million net inflows on Dec. 12, marking an 11-day consecutive inflow streak. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF IBIT led the charge with single-day net inflows of $432 million, reflecting growing investor confidence and institutional adoption. The cumulative net asset value (NAV) of Bitcoin spot ETFs has now reached a record high of $112.546 billion, further cementing their appeal in the market. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Gains with $274 Million Net Inflows Ethereum spot ETFs also attracted significant investment, with net inflows of $274 million on Dec. 12, marking a 14-day streak of uninterrupted inflows. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF ETHA recorded its largest single-day inflow of $202 million, underscoring the asset’s growing appeal to investors. Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF ETH added $73.22 million in single-day inflows, underscoring its strong position in the market. Continued inflows into both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs indicate a growing appetite for cryptocurrency interest among both retail and institutional investors.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Glassnode says that LINK’s fundamentals are improving along with its active address momentum and rising price tag. “While LINK’s price surge was clearly driven by speculative and short-term market activity, its fundamentals are improving too. Active addresses momentum is trending higher, with the short-term SMA (simple moving average) of 6,682 still above the long-term SMA of 5,878. That said, active addresses remain far below their 2021 peak of 23,416.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode goes on to note that LINK hit the highest price it has since 2022 and that its futures open interest has reached a new all-time high, signaling high trading activity. “Chainlink’s token LINK has hit its highest price in nearly two years, and futures open interest (OI) just surged to an all-time high of $770.27 million! For context: LINK OI: $770 million. Toncoin (TON) OI: $259 million. Tron (TRX) OI: $356 million. LINK’s OI is 3x TON and 2x TRX, signaling massive trading activity.” Source: Glassnode/X The crypto analytics firm then breaks down how investors took profits from trading LINK, with ultra short-term and short-term investors realizing the most while long-term holders appeared largely dormant. “We also saw significant profit-taking in the spot market. With $35.57 million in realized profits, yesterday marked the 2nd largest profit-taking event for LINK this year (trailing only Feb 11’s $40.39 million). This profit-taking was driven mostly by speculative market participants: Ultra-short (1 day-1 week): 15.3% Short-term (3-6 months): 22.5%. Long-term holders stayed mostly quiet, except for the 1-2 year cohort (11.6%).” Source: Glassnode/X LINK is trading for $24.96 at time of writing, a 6.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu shows bullish potential despite recent volatility, supported by an active burn mechanism and predictions of significant price spikes. XRP’s price surged over 250% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a new all-time high driven by regulatory progress and market momentum. Pi Network’s Stronghold in South Korea Despite the surrounding controversy, the cryptocurrency project Pi Network continues to amass users. Not long ago, the team revealed the application had exceeded the milestone of 100 million downloads. Pi Network has a solid presence in Asia, creating multi-million communities in countries like China, Vietnam, Singapore, India, Japan, and More. As CryptoPotato recently reported , South Korea is another nation where the project has gained huge popularity. According to Wu Blockchain’s analysis , the number of local Pi Network users has reached 1.34 million, which outnumbers the domestic client base of major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In fact, the only two domestic cryptocurrency-related entities having more users are Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). While the global Pi Network community continues to grow, its native token and open mainnet have yet to see the light of day. The team assured it will set things into motion once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Latest data shows that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only 1 million left to do so. Meanwhile, the Pi Core Team previously promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if there will be further delays. SHIB’s Next Potential Targets The second-largest meme coin experienced a substantial revival at the start of December. However, in the past several days, it witnessed enhanced volatility, with its price plunging by over 10% on a weekly scale . SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the turbulence, numerous analysts remain optimistic that a new rally could be on the horizon . X user JAVON MARKS, for instance, maintained that SHIB has confirmed a bullish pattern, which could be a precursor for “another major upside move.” The trader reiterated their forecast that the price could spike by almost 180% and reach $0.000081. Other market observers predicting good days ahead for the meme coin include Zach Humphries and The Crypto Bull. The former believes that SHIB could chart substantial gains once “Ethereum breaks loose.” The Crypto Bull assumed that Shiba Inu’s chart “looks primed for launch very soon.” The resurgence of the asset’s burning mechanism supports the thesis of a price pump. The burn rate has spiked by almost 300% in the past 24 hours, resulting in 11.8 million tokens sent to a null address. The USD equivalent of the stash might be insignificant, but continuous efforts in that field will make SHIB more scarce and potentially more valuable in time (should demand keep its level or rise). XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s XRP is also in the red on a weekly scale , albeit charting less substantial losses than Shiba Inu. However, the asset remains one of the best performers in the past month, with its price skyrocketing by over 250% and currently trading above $2.30. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some of the factors that have fueled XRP’s impressive spike over the last several weeks include Gary Gensler’s (the current Chairman of the US SEC) announcement that he will step down in January next year and the progress of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. Not long ago, CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the financial product received regulatory approval from the NYDFS. Many industry participants believe XRP is now gearing up for another massive rally. X user Ali Martinez recently noted the emergence of a bull flag on the asset’s price chart, predicting a rise to a new all-time high of $4. However, he believes the road to the peak might be bumpy and include a brief correction. Prior to that, he claimed that XRP “looks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle.” He set a “conservative target” of $8.40 and an “optimistic” one of a staggering $48.12.

Coinbase’s Legal Fight Uncovers Red Flags appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is facing criticism after it heavily redacted documents requested by Coinbase, the popular cryptocurrency exchange. Coinbase had asked for information about the government’s actions against the crypto industry, but the FDIC’s excessive blackouts raised suspicions that they might be hiding important details. JUST IN: Judge Reyes ruled that FDIC didn't do what it was ordered to do. ""The Court is concerned with what appears to be FDICs lack of good-faith effort in making nuanced redactions. Defendant cannot simply blanket redact everything that is not an article or preposition."" 1/3 https://t.co/AX5HCKjrij — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 12, 2024 Judge Criticizes FDIC’s Actions On December 12, 2023, Judge Ana C. Reyes criticized the FDIC for not following a court order and accused the agency of not being transparent. Coinbase had complained that the redactions were so extensive that it was hard to understand what the FDIC was saying about the government’s actions against crypto. This led the judge to rule against the FDIC, suggesting they were not being open with the court. In November of 2021 – banks began receiving instructions from the current administration to disengage from any crypto services.. even went on to “debank” targeted customers / businesses. https://t.co/4HrCMMJVTX pic.twitter.com/fGHngO5FFv — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 1, 2024 Coinbase Questions What’s Being Hidden Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, shared his frustration on social media, asking, “What is the FDIC working so hard to hide?” He pointed out that the redactions made it seem like the agency was trying to cover something up. This legal fight is part of a bigger concern in the crypto community about government actions against the industry, with some seeing this as part of a broader effort to stifle crypto innovation. Crypto Regulations on Check This case has bigger implications for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Many believe it’s connected to a government initiative called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which critics argue is aimed at limiting crypto businesses. With the upcoming leadership changes in the U.S. government, things might settle soon. Donald Trump’s win is a sign of a new beginning for crypto. Moreover, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg have already stepped down, and Paul Atkin, a pro-crypto figure, is set to replace Gruenberg. Brian Quintenz, who has a crypto-friendly background, may head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In this regard, the Coinbase and Ripple vs SEC case will be the best example of fair and transparent judgment. This could lead to less government interference and more concrete regulations for the crypto space.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 08:08:07

A survey conducted by the major crypto exchange Kraken on 2,537 Americans revealed that 55%, whether they own crypto or not, believe that crypto has real-world uses. However, around 29% are still uncertain about its future outlook. Despite this uncertainty, around 73% of respondents who currently hold crypto admitted that they plan to continue investing in digital assets as they enter the new year of 2025. As many as 43% view crypto as being “more secure than the traditional financial system,” compared to the other 30% who disagree. While 52% see it as a promising investment for the long-term. The survey explores how much “crypto myths” still shape people’s perceptions towards investing in crypto and whether attitudes have shifted. One of the most prevailing myths is the belief that crypto is mostly used to facilitate criminal activities. Kraken’s survey revealed 60% of respondents still think crypto fuels illegal acts more than any other asset. Even though the research tells a different story. Read more: Cash, not crypto remains criminal’s preferred tool for illicit finance, study says According to the Chainalysis Crypto Crime 2024 report , only a small portion of crypto-based transactions were found to be linked to criminal activities in 2024, which is around 0.34%. In fact, a study by Crypto ISAC showed that cash is still the preferred tool for criminals engaging in illegal activities. On the other hand, only 8% of respondents believe that crypto is akin to a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud method which uses funds from new inventors to pay existing investors. Meanwhile, 53% of respondents believe negative attitudes towards crypto are fueled by ignorance and a lack of understanding, emphasizing the importance of crypto education for the wider public. Gen X has the most faith in crypto Data from the Kraken survey show that the age group with the most confidence in crypto is Gen X. According to the survey results, 63% of people aged 45 to 60 years old see crypto as a practical investment. It is believe that Gen X’s prior history of living through two economic crises, the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID crisis of 2020, have shaped their disbelief in traditionally-held currencies that failed to hold up against high levels of inflation. Gen X is also the generation that brought in the Cypherpunk movement, which means they have experienced dealing with both the traditional finance and the rise of crypto. This varied perspective could help them contextualize crypto’s practical value. On the other hand, Gen Z appears to have the least confidence in crypto. Only 32% of respondents aged 18 to 29 years old believe crypto has practical uses in the real world. This could indicate that younger investors are still navigating the complexities of crypto and the uncertainty surrounding it.

The plan involves deploying idle stablecoins into yield-generating strategies, potentially earning $91 million annually to fund DeFi development. Despite the ambitious proposal, POL price has dipped 6% in the last 24 hours. However, the token’s recent bullish momentum suggests that a positive outcome from the vote could reignite investor optimism. Polygon’s $1.3B Liquidity Proposal: A Game-Changer for DeFi Growth Polygon’s latest Pre-PIP ( Pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal ) proposes unlocking $1.3 billion in idle stablecoins held in its PoS Bridge to fuel its DeFi ecosystem. Authored by Allez Labs, Morpho Association, and Yearn, the initiative could generate an estimated $70–91 million annually in yield, presenting a massive opportunity for ecosystem development. The proposal suggests deploying stablecoins—USDC, USDT, and DAI—into ERC-4626 vaults, each with the network’s Improvement Proposal (PIP) to manage risk and maximize returns. For example, DAI reserves will be allocated to Maker’s sUSDS, while Morpho Vaults will serve as the yield-generating mechanism for USDC and USDT. The latest pre-PIP proposes to deposit unproductive bridge assets to Morpho. $1.3B idle stablecoins in the PoS Bridge $70M annual yield at current rates The yield will be distributed as incentives to grow the DeFi ecosystems on @0xPolygon and @AggLayer . https://t.co/sTJdtOCqnP — Morpho Labs (@MorphoLabs) December 12, 2024 Yearn will manage the Ecosystem Incentives Program, ensuring the generated yield is redirected to incentivize DeFi projects and boost liquidity. This approach could significantly amplify DeFi activity on Polygon PoS and the upcoming AggLayer, creating new growth avenues. With a structured plan, the proposal addresses a crucial community demand—turning dormant assets into productive resources to accelerate its expansion in the DeFi space. Risk management and oversight by Allez Labs and the Polygon Protocol Council further strengthen its feasibility. Ecosystem Innovations and Price Movement POL price has experienced a 6% decline in the past 24 hours despite recent bullish trends. The dip comes as the community votes on the $1.3 billion liquidity proposal. However, with POL still up 70% over the past month, investor sentiment remains optimistic, signaling potential for a rebound if the proposal passes. Beyond token performance, the network is advancing its ecosystem through tokenization efforts. Assetera, a non-US-regulated platform, has chosen Polygon to tokenize traditional assets, including NVIDIA stocks and S&P 500 trackers. These fully collateralized, MiFID-compliant assets offer global investors seamless access to tokenized securities, setting a new benchmark for on-chain financial products. Its scalable infrastructure continues to position it as a leader in the tokenization space. In another innovative use case, Courtyard, powered by the network, is bringing Pokemon cards on-chain. This integration ensures greater transparency, security, and liquidity for collectible trading, demonstrating how the network is bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional markets. These developments highlight its commitment to diversifying its ecosystem and unlocking new opportunities for users worldwide.

In a statement released on Dec. 12, the PRA urged firms to outline their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and detail their compliance with the Basel framework for regulating crypto activities. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on cryptoassets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” the PRA stated. The Basel framework, introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022, defines capital and risk management standards for banks exposed to cryptocurrencies. The PRA aims to use the collected data as a foundation for monitoring the financial stability risks posed by crypto assets. Firms are required to account for their crypto-related plans extending through September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire highlights critical areas of interest, including firms’ application of the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. “While there are benefits that these new types of ledgers can bring, they also pose risks such as lack of settlement finality, settlement failure, and no guaranteed link between the intended owner of the asset and the entity that may have control of the authentication, validation mechanism,” the questionnaire states. The PRA emphasized that risks tied to permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated at present” but noted that the classification remains under review. Globally, companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin, spurred by its historic six-figure valuation. On Nov. 29, Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International disclosed a treasury adjustment, swapping $50 million in Ether for Bitcoin.

The streamlined architecture incorporates advancements in mathematical problem-solving. Per the reports, the new model, boasting 14 billion parameters, aims to compete with other compact AI models like GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. According to Microsoft’s blog , Phi-4 is available with limited access through Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform and is restricted to research purposes under a Microsoft research license agreement. Phi-4: Enhanced performance in mathematical reasoning Microsoft has positioned Phi-4 as a leader in mathematical problem-solving, citing substantial performance gains over both its predecessors and comparable models. The company is confident about the AI model’s capabilities after Phi-4 reportedly achieved top marks in several standardized benchmarks. Source: Microsoft In the GPQA test, it scored 56.1, outperforming GPT-4o’s 40.9 and Llama-3’s 49.1. On the MATH benchmark, Phi-4 achieved 80.4, reflecting its advanced capabilities in tackling complex mathematical problems. It also excelled in coding benchmarks, achieving a score of 82.6 on HumanEval. Additionally, Phi-4 demonstrated its prowess in real-world scenarios, including high scores on problems from the Mathematical Association of America’s American Mathematics Competitions (AMC-10/12). These results indicate potential applications in scientific research, engineering, and financial modeling, fields where mathematical accuracy and reasoning are critical. Source: Microsoft While larger models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini Ultra operate with hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters, Phi-4 demonstrates that smaller, streamlined architectures can achieve superior performance in specialized tasks. Microsoft credits Phi-4’s advancements to the integration of high-quality synthetic data alongside datasets of human-generated content, as well as undisclosed improvements made during post-training. These efforts reflect a broader trend in the AI industry , where research teams are increasingly focusing on innovations in synthetic data usage and post-training optimization. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently highlighted this shift, remarking that the industry has hit a “pre-training data wall,” adding that companies will now race towards developing more efficient AI models. Compute matters, but so does data, and we have reached a pre-training data wall. Get ready for the post-training data boom. Companies will race to have the best frontier data—multi-modal, agentic, complex reasoning, and more.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|SHIB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 09:09:00

DAOs are organizations represented by rules encoded as computer programs, controlled by the token holders related to that organization and not influenced by a central authority. The plan involves using Morpho Labs' vaults to manage USDC and USDT targeting a conservative 7% annual return through strategies that include high-quality collaterals like USTB, sUSDS, and stUSD. That could make Polygon an additional $70 million yearly from idle assets. The yield generated would be reinvested back into the Polygon ecosystem, supporting growth across the network and its ecosystem. If the idea passes an initial community check, the proposal will aim to generate yield by gradually deploying dai (DAI), USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) from reserves into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Deploying each asset will require a separate proposal to be floated and passed by the community in the future.

Over the years, we’ve seen meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu carve out a permanent place in pop culture and investment portfolios. Now, BTFD Coin is poised to take this explosive sector to the next level with its unique P2E game, staking rewards, and vibrant community power. This new kid on the block isn’t just here to play; it’s here to dominate. BTFD Coin’s highly-anticipated presale launched on November 26, 2024, and the buzz is already massive. With analysts predicting jaw-dropping price growth, investors are scrambling to grab a piece of the action. Let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin and other standout meme coins are the best meme coins to join now. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Riding High on Momentum BTFD Coin is already making waves in the crypto world, and for good reason. The coin’s presale performance has been nothing short of electric. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it reached its fourth stage—one-fourth of the presale journey—within 24 hours. Currently in its 11th stage, BTFD is priced at $0.00012, having raised over $3.6 million so far. With more than 52 billion $BTFD coins sold and 4,700+ bulls backing it, this project is set to disrupt the meme coin space. So, what makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to join now? Let’s talk features. BTFD isn’t your average pump-and-dump meme coin. It’s built for long-term value, with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that adds a layer of utility and excitement. Players can earn rewards while gaming, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Combine that with staking rewards and an active, bullish community, and you’ve got a recipe for explosive growth. Consider this: if you’d invested $5,000 in Stage 5, where BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 100 million coins. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, those coins would be worth $60,000. That’s a 12x return on your initial investment. Not bad for a coin that started as a buzzword. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is also leaning heavily on community engagement. Its “Buy the Dip” philosophy has resonated with younger investors, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, who love a good underdog story. It’s become more than just an investment; it’s a movement. Whether you’re in it for the gains or the camaraderie, BTFD Coin ticks all the boxes. Mog Coin: The Silent Contender Mog Coin might not have the same flashy presale stats as BTFD Coin, but it’s quietly building a reputation as one of the best meme coins to join now. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and focus. Mog doesn’t try to do everything; instead, it focuses on being a meme coin with solid fundamentals. And sometimes, that’s all you need. What sets Mog apart is its transparency and straightforward approach. Unlike many meme coins that overpromise and underdeliver, Mog delivers exactly what it says on the tin: a fun, engaging crypto experience with the potential for big returns. Its community is tight-knit and supportive, creating an environment where holders feel like they’re part of something bigger. One of Mog’s standout features is its liquidity pool, designed to ensure long-term stability. While many meme coins suffer from extreme volatility, Mog has taken steps to reduce price swings and make its token more attractive to risk-averse investors.

Here Are They!,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-analyst-reveals-top-10-altcoins-poised-for-50x-returns-here-are-they/,"The post Crypto Analyst Reveals Top 10 Altcoins Poised for 50x Returns! Here Are They! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent YouTube video, crypto analyst Crypto Banter revealed top 10 altcoins that could soar up to 50x during this market rally. As excitement builds in the crypto space, these coins are drawing massive attention from investors eager for big gains. Here’s a breakdown of the top picks: DogWifhat (WIF): Aiming for 4X Returns First on the list is DogWifhat, which recently flipped a critical resistance level. Analysts predict a 400% surge, targeting the 3.1-3.168 Fibonacci extension. With $2 as the key support, a drop below this level could invalidate the bullish outlook. GOAT: Poised for a Breakout Next, we have GOAT, which reclaimed an essential trading range. The initial target is set at $0.998, with the potential to reach $1.33 and beyond. Bonk (BONK): Eyeing a Bullish Reversal Another token getting the spotlight is Bonk. After losing its range high, it’s cooling off but could surprise investors if it reclaims the 50% Fibonacci level. Brett: Testing New Highs Brett is also catching attention as it backtests its mid-range level. With a possible target of $0.57 (a 223% increase), it’s considered a standout pick for this cycle. Pepe: Staying Strong Pepe continues to outperform many meme coins like Dogecoin. While currently consolidating, its relative strength signals another potential leg up in the near term. Popcat: An Undervalued Gem Another hidden gem is Popcat, holding steady at its mid-range demand zone. Analysts see this as an ideal buying opportunity with significant upside potential in current market conditions. GigaChad: On the Path to Gains Next up is GigaChad, which has been charting a path toward a 280% gain. Currently, in a strong demand zone, it could soar to new ATH, especially with the possibility of a Coinbase listing. Myro: Testing Demand Zones Myro is another token worth watching as it tests key demand zones near $0.085, this entry point could lead to long-term gains. Aptos: Maintaining a Bullish Outlook Aptos has shown strength on the weekly charts, with a slight pullback expected before continuing its uptrend. Its overall trajectory remains positive for the near term. Render (RNDR): Ready for a Breakout Lastly, Render is forming a rounded bottom pattern and looks ready to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Breaking its $1.38 resistance could unlock significant upward movement, making it a token to watch closely. Top Gaming Coins To Pick Crypto Banter’s further analysis spotlighted on gaming coins with significant upside potential. Nakamoto Games (NAKA) is forming a rounded bottom and aims to reach $2.1. Additionally, Seedify.fund (SFUND) has reclaimed its mid-range, setting its sights on $280. Gala, however, needs to reclaim $0.063 to confirm a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, ApeCoin (APE) has broken out of a falling wedge, presenting a 136% potential move above $2. Vulcan Forged (PYR) and other gaming tokens are also expected to gain momentum during gaming rotations.

Its dynamic movements and potential for substantial returns are drawing renewed attention to the broader crypto space. Among the many tokens competing for investor interest, four altcoins to watch-MANTRA (OM), Minotaurus (MTAUR), XRP, and Shiba Inu (SHIB)-stand out as strong candidates for a significant rally. Below is a detailed price analysis for each, showcasing their potential to surge by over 200%. Altcoins to Watch for a Potential 200% Price Rally As Bitcoin trades above $100,000 OM, MTAUR, XRP and SHIB are altcoins to watch for potential 200 in gains. 1. MANTRA (OM): Bullish Outlook Targeted at $11.4 MANTRA’s recent performance has caught the eye of many investors, with its price showing a bull flag pattern, a technical indicator that signals a potential breakout. Reporting monthly gains of 177.13% to trade currently at $3.96, OM records a market cap of $3.74 billion. A consolidation phase between $3.50 and $4.20 suggests an imminent surge, supported by bullish indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 59 and a positive trend in the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Analysts predict a 230% rally if the price clears the resistance zone of $4.23–$4.53. According to Santiment data , OM has been experiencing reduced exchange supply and increasing interest from non-exchange wallets. This could propel the token to reach a conservative target of $11.40 in the near future. Source: Santiment 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): Altcoins to Watch Transforming the Gaming Industry Minotaurus (MTAUR) is an altcoin to watch for transforming the gaming world, by integrating blockchain technology with an engaging gaming experience. Central to this platform is the MTAUR token, created to unlock premium functionalities, allow avatar enhancements, and provide entry to exclusive game areas. This ecosystem links gamers and blockchain fans, fostering a dynamic and engaging community. The current presale presents a time-sensitive chance to obtain MTAUR tokens for 0.00006001 USDT, which is significantly lower than the expected listing price. The initiative has already raised more than 300,000 USDT, showcasing its increasing appeal among buyers preferring early-stage cryptocurrencies . Minotaurus guarantees a secure and transparent environment for its users through audits conducted by reputable firms such as SolidProof and Coinsult. In addition to the token, Minotaurus encourages its community by launching thrilling initiatives like referral and vesting programs, along with a substantial giveaway of 100,000 USDT. By promoting trust and engagement, the initiative is preparing for a revolutionary blockchain gaming experience. 3. XRP (XRP): Altcoins to Watch With a Bullish Breakout Despite XRP price dropping by 3.68% in the past day, the token earned investors and traders over 260% in profits, over the past 30 days. With a market value of $132.62 billion, XRP is on the cusp of breaking its all-time high (ATH) of $3.32, with analysts projecting a short-term target of $5 and a long-term surge to $18. Recent developments, including the approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and speculation about a potential IPO, fuel bullish sentiment. Technical indicators also suggest an uptrend, as XRP is creating a bullish flag pattern and sustaining strength above its 50-day moving average. A surge past $2.90 might elevate XRP to unprecedented levels, positioning it as an ideal contender for a parabolic surge, and one of ideal cryptos to buy for massive gains. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Analysts Predict 1,200% Surge Technical indicators show that Shiba Inu price recently rebounded from a solid support level at $0.0000240tha0, suggesting that a rally could soon happen. Metrics like the RSI (52.49) and a positive divergence in the MACD indicate increasing interest from buyers. Currently, SHIB has a market value of $16.42 billion, with monthly gains of nearly 17.91%, despite dropping in price by 5.12% over the past day, to trade today at $0.00002795. A possible rise above $0.00003100 might initiate a surge towards $0.00003800, as hopeful analysts predict a 1,200% increase in the long run. The persistent interest from investors in SHIB and its recovery trends bolster its optimistic forecast, positioning it as one of the promising meme coins to buy for significant gains. Final Thoughts These four altcoins to watch present compelling cases for significant price rallies in the coming weeks. MANTRA and XRP stand out for their strong technical setups and bullish fundamentals, while Minotaurus offers early entry opportunities with its gaming token presale. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to defy expectations with its vibrant community and recovery potential.

According to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence , a public data application that enables users to analyze blockchain and cryptocurrency activity, Trump’s holdings surged by $6.78 million in just one day as of December 13, 2024. But before you think Trump has fully embraced crypto as his new political weapon, there’s more to the story than meets the eye. Trump crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham Intelligence What’s in Trump’s digital wallet? Trump’s publicly known wallet holds a curious mix of assets, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Wrapped Ethereum ( WETH ), and a slew of meme tokens like TROG and TRUMP. Other smaller holdings include GUA, USDC, TUA, and RIO. On paper, it looks like a bold bet on everything from mainstream crypto to the wild world of internet humor. But don’t let the numbers fool you — not all if any of these tokens were necessarily purchased by Trump himself. In crypto, anyone can send tokens to any known wallet, whether invited or not. This means that while these coins are tied to Trump’s wallet, they haven’t been officially confirmed as his own investments. It’s a classic crypto stunt: creators send tokens to high-profile figures to boost their coin’s credibility. Sometimes, it’s a clever marketing move; other times, it’s just flat-out misleading. Crypto market is bullish on Trump The bulk of Trump’s portfolio is dominated by TROG, which clocks in at $10.49 million. The TRUMP token — yes, named after him — adds another $1.07 million to the mix. But just because these tokens live in his wallet doesn’t mean he’s cashing in on meme coin mania. Interestingly, Trump’s own stance on crypto has taken a turn. On December 12, he made his position clear: “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else, not just China but others, embracing it, and we want to be the head.” Trump seems to be ready to position the U.S. at the forefront of the crypto race, a shift from his previous skepticism.

On-chain data sparks hope,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wazirx-hack-victims-hope/,"The controversial WazirX hack that resulted in the theft of $235 million in crypto sparked discussion about security in the industry. Affected users are demanding robust measures as they are missing out on the selling opportunity amid the bull run. A $200 million fund movement from Binance and WazirX wallets had the crypto world buzzing. Some are suggesting that the world’s biggest crypto exchange might be stepping up to reimburse WazirX users. However, the hacked Indian crypto exchange has temporarily halted withdrawals and seems to be cooperating with authorities. Binance bailout or routine rebalancing? An on-chain Sleuth in an X post flagged $200 million moving to a wallet allegedly controlled by WazirX. This move has sparked theories of what might be a Binance-led bailout. In this pursuit, one user speculated a potential reimbursement deal and suggested “Funding from Binance, likely for equity or token-based compensation.” Others placed 95% odds on a reimbursement announcement. The on-chain investigator mentioned that WazirX consolidated user funds that were untouched during the hack into a wallet two months ago. The funds were shifted from the deposit addresses and hot wallets. It added that the same wallet (labeled 0x305) received $200 million in different tokens from the wallet 0xb03 which was funded by Binance wallets. Squashing all the anticipation and brewing all the conspiracy theories, the hacked exchange posted an asset rebalancing reminder. It highlighted that the exchange is in the process of rebalancing tokens. It added that the users might notice fund movement transactions of various cold wallets. 📢 Update on Asset Rebalancing We are currently in the process of rebalancing tokens.

Zettai Pte seeks creditor approval Zettai Pte Ltd, the parent entity of Zanmai Labs which operates WazirX in India, filed an application with the Singapore High Court on December 6, 2024.

Advisors from the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, are mulling the possibility of abolishing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Will Donald Trump Eliminate FDIC? Advisors from DOGE conducted interviews for roles in the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Besides, they also floated the idea of transferring the responsibilities of deposit insurance to the Treasury Department. However, such an overhaul would need Congressional approval and would be the first time in history that the US government is likely to abolish a legacy agency. On the other hand, bank executives are optimistic that President-elect Trump will roll back stringent regulations on capital requirements and consumer protections. However, some market analysts also believe that FDIC-backed deposit insurance is untouchable and “too big to fail”. While addressing the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, December 12, Donald Trump also said that he has big plans for the crypto market. In a brief interview with Jim Cramer, Trump said: “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else, not just China but others are embracing it, and we want to be the head”. The discussions reflect Donald Trump’s aggressive approach to cutting government size and easing oversight of the heavily regulated financial sector. As a result, his transition team comprising Elon Musk, Scott Bessent, and Vivek Ramaswamy, is reportedly considering merging the FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve nonmonetary functions, and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). On the other hand, crypto leaders like Brain Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, have voiced their opinion on the removal of anti-crypto regulators like Caroline Crenshaw from the Senate Banking Committee . Operation Choke Point, Industry Reactions, and Broader Implications Crypto industry leaders have been calling to eliminate regulators behind Operation Choke Point 2.0. Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini stated: “Eliminating the FDIC would bring us one step closer to ending the weaponization of the US banking system and preventing Operation Choke Point from ever happening again”. On Thursday, pro-crypto Rep. French Hill was chosen to head the House Financial Services Committee, with a focus on stablecoins and cryptocurrency regulations . Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair expressed skepticism about eliminating a bank regulator, noting that banks value maintaining relationships with specific agencies. Speaking to WSJ , she said: “We could use some streamlining on financial regulation. But it is really hard to get done. Banks may complain, but at the end of the day, they like to have their own regulator they have a relationship with. They like the status quo.” In a separate proposal, some transition team members have suggested maintaining only one primary banking regulator, with the others retaining non-regulatory functions. While the proposals signal Donald Trump’s willingness to shake up federal oversight, experts believe these radical changes face significant political and industry resistance.

After the retrace, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has steadily climbed back, recovering the $3,800 support zone on Wednesday afternoon. ETH’s price then rose another 2% in the early hours of Thursday to trade above the $3,900 level again. As Ethereum reclaimed this key zone, Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt noted that the cryptocurrency was trading back above its ascending support trendline, which it had lost during the market correction. Additionally, the King of Altcoins was retesting a six-day downtrend line in the 4-hour chart, which would target a surge toward $4,000 after a successful breakout from the $3,940 mark. Ethereum broke above this resistance in the following hours, surging to a daily high of $3,985 before retracing to $3,945. Per the analyst, holding above this level could propel ETH’s price to $4,100 in the coming days. ETH To $5,000 Soon? According to some analysts, despite reclaiming the $3,900 zone, Ethereum still needs to turn another multi-year resistance into support successfully. Analyst Alex Clay recently pointed out that ETH has been retesting the $9,350 level since 2021, unsuccessfully turning it into support over the past few years. Ethereum has faced rejection at this resistance level on four different occasions. However, when ETH broke and held this level, it rallied toward its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 around three years ago. Crypto analyst Jelle suggested that Ethereum is preparing for massive moves as it recently broke out of a multi-year pennant. ETH-based Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a massive surge since the post-election rally. As Farside Investors data shows, ETH ETFs have seen over $500 million in inflows this week and over $1.3 billion since this month started. This signals increased demand from institutional players, adding to the cryptocurrency’s momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm As Solana (SOL) Retests $210, Rebound Or Retrace Next? Moreover, the Donald Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI) acquired around $10 million in ETH yesterday. Lookonchain said the WLFI wallet bought 2,631 ETH at $3,801 per token. To Jelle, this “looks like ETH season just got the ‘go ahead’ nod from institutions.” If Ethereum reclaims the $3,950 resistance into support, there will be “very little standing in the way of new all-time highs from here,” the analyst added. He forecasted that Ethereum could hit $5,000 after breaking out and that 2025 will be a “comeback year for ETH.” As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,951, a 4.7% surge in the daily timeframe.

For the first time since 2016, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in new developer activity, attracting 7,625 fresh contributors compared to Ethereum’s 6,456. This rise marks an 83% year-over-year growth for the Solana ecosystem, with much of its momentum coming from increased adoption across Asia. Throughout the year, Solana managed to outpace Ethereum in key metrics, including network activity and daily fee generation during certain periods. Notably, on March 18, Solana’s network activity spiked amid a rush for Solana-based memecoins, and on October 28, it briefly outdid Ethereum in 24-hour fee generation. Ethereum Still Dominates in Total Developer Activity Despite losing its top spot for onboarding new developers, Ethereum remains the number one blockchain ecosystem in overall developer activity. The network recorded 6,244 active monthly developers in 2024, representing a 17% drop from the previous year. However, Ethereum continues to lead globally, with the highest number of active developers across all major continents, including Asia, Europe, and North America. Ethereum’s layer-2 networks also saw notable growth, with developer activity rising by 64% since 2021. Additionally, Eigenlayer, Ethereum’s primary restaking protocol, emerged as the fastest-growing ecosystem in 2024, with a staggering 167% increase in active developers. Crypto Broader Adoption Electric Capital’s report highlights that crypto development is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, with activity growing in regions like Africa, South America, and Asia. Asia now hosts one in three crypto developers worldwide, fueled by strong contributions from countries like India, which onboarded the most new developers in 2024. The report also underscores how different regions are driving various use cases. For instance, stablecoin transactions remain consistently active across Asian, European, and African time zones. Meanwhile, NFT trading activity peaks during American work hours, with minting activity predominantly occurring during Asia’s daytime.

The latest pledge forms part of the team’s mission to create a marketplace for “programmable trust” through its decentralized restaking protocol. Eigen Foundation’s 1% Token Pledge The Protocol Guild, which comprises over 180 members from 29 teams, plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum’s decentralized network. Its members focus on key areas such as client development, research, specification design, testing, and coordination. This ensures Ethereum’s continuous evolution and resilience against centralized capture. EigenLayer enables staked ETH to serve as cryptoeconomic security for other protocols, improving Ethereum’s security while supporting innovation. By dedicating a portion of its token supply to the Protocol Guild, the Eigen Foundation aligns its goals with the Guild’s mission of ensuring sustainable incentives for Ethereum’s maintainers. Its official statement read, “This commitment aligns with EigenLayer’s mission: To extend Ethereum’s security through restaking and creating a marketplace for programmable trust. We’re proud to contribute to Ethereum’s growth and long-term sustainability. The latest development comes after the Eigen Foundation announced the EIGEN Season 2 Stakedrop in September. This distribution initiative aimed at recognizing contributors and participants who have supported its development. The entity had then stated that the stakedrop would allocate EIGEN tokens across three categories: stakers and operators who actively participated during the season, ecosystem partners such as rollups and RaaS providers, and community members who have played a pivotal role in advocating for EigenLayer. A month later, EIGEN debuted on several exchanges in one of the most heavily discussed and anticipated token launches of 2024. EigenLayer’s Growth And Two Security Breaches Launched by Sreeram Kannan in early 2021, EigenLayer rose to prominence as a leading DeFi project in 2024, with over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL) as reported by DeFiLlama. However, EigenLayer suffered a $5.7 million hack involving stolen tokens sold via decentralized exchanges. The protocol faced another security breach on October 18 when its official X account was hacked . The attackers used the compromised account to advertise a fake airdrop campaign, directing users to malicious links disguised as part of the concluded Season 2 token distribution. On-chain investigator ZachXBT and Polygon Labs’ Mudit Gupta quickly warned users to avoid these links. Scam Sniffer later confirmed the phishing scheme.

The token recorded a significant 250% surge, signaling heightened investor confidence. Despite market corrections, Ripple continues to demonstrate resilience, maintaining its upward momentum. Analysts suggest this consolidation phase might precede another breakout, potentially driving Ripple toward the $4 level, making the holders rich. XRP Price Holders Could Reap Big Rewards With This Pattern Crypto analyst Ali recently shared a post on X highlighting potential bullish movements for XRP. According to Ali, XRP appears to be forming a bullish flag pattern, suggesting an upward trend in its price. However, he noted that the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart has presented a sell signal, which could point to a brief correction before any significant upward movement. Ali believes that XRP needs to break above the $2.46 resistance level to initiate a potential rally toward the $4 mark. The current chart analysis supports this prediction, showing a clear channel that may guide future price movements. Despite the bullish setup, traders should remain cautious of possible corrections in the short term. The market sentiment could shift depending on how XRP reacts to the $2.46 level. This pattern could make a big reward to XRP holders. Source: X Is XRP Price Ready For The Next Break Out? The XRP price has the potential to hit $4 as market dynamics, Ripple’s RLUSD launch and strategic partnerships fuel optimism. Currently, the value of XRP is trading at $2.29. The token has experienced a slight dip after a massive 251% rally in the past month. Broader crypto prices also support its rise, with Bitcoin surpassing $100K and Ethereum stabilizing near $3,800. Market enthusiasm continues to grow as Ripple’s strategic advancements and the evolving crypto landscape reinforce XRP’s status as a key player. If the bullish momentum continues, the altcoin price could surpass the resistance level at $2.50 and potentially hit $3. With sustained buying pressure, XRP could climb further to reach $4. However, if the bears take control, the price may fall below $2, creating a bearish sentiment in the market. The Relative Strength Index currently sits at 62, showing that XRP is no longer overbought but still leaning toward bullish territory. XRP Price Chart: TradingView XRP’s bullish momentum remains promising despite minor pullbacks. Breaking the $2.46 resistance is crucial for a rally toward $4. Traders should watch key levels closely as market dynamics, strategic developments, and investor confidence continue shaping XRP’s price trajectory.

The platform raised $250M in a private sale, backed by some of the top VC funds. Avalanche (AVAX) extended its relationship with top VC funds, aiming to transform itself from a L2 chain and run an independent new L1. The most recent funding round for $250M was completed as a private placement with some of the leading investors in decentralized projects. The funding was completed after an OTC sale, and was led by DragonFly Capital, Galaxy, and ParaFi Capital. The OTC placement reached up to 40 smaller companies and investors, some seeking to use the services of Avalanche as their native platform. Avalanche achieved its single biggest financing round for $250M. | Source: Cryptorank Since its launch, Avalanche raised more than $577M, including four ICO events, a seed round, and additional undisclosed funding. The recent fundraising effort is the single largest capital injection for Avalanche. Avalanche raised the funds as an addition to its track record of successful funding. The goal is to support the Avalanche9000 upgrade, a new chain that has been tested since the end of November. Avalanche aims to rebrand from Web3 gaming network Avalanche forged its success as one of the leading networks for Web3 and gaming. Avalanche C-Chain was the consumer-oriented L2 network, which carried some of the hottest play-to-earn games. C-Chain was also compatible with DeFi, DEX trading, and general Web3 activities. As a result, Avalanche still retains $1.64B in locked liquidity, though still far from the 2021 levels of over $10B. One of the big obstacles to building on Avalanche was the deposit requirement to build a subnet. Subnets were a technology that proved successful for some of the early Avalanche projects. Games or web projects would launch a subnet when their activity overwhelmed the capacity of C-Chain. Avalanche now aims to build a practically free layer, similar to SUI or Aptos. Previously, subnet builders had to stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX. Instead of a gaming network, Avalanche9000 will aim to position itself as a tokenization hub, with a focus on Web3 and DeFi. The new L1 will aim to retain some of the successful apps from C-Chain, including DEX and GameFi projects. The funding round arrived just days before the intended launch of Avalanche9000. The chain has already onboarded up to 150K potential users and 40K routers in preparation for its December 16 launch. The chain has already partnered with Uplink, a startup for decentralized connectivity, which will build on the new L1. Can AVAX recover to a higher range? AVAX was among the most promising L2 tokens, and the project is one of the best-funded in the Web3 space. However, during the bear market, Avalanche C-Chain lagged behind Arbitrum and Optimism . AVAX is also carrying a backlog of locked tokens, with only 57% of the supply in circulation. Almost all ecosystem participants and early VC backers will continue to unlock their allocation over the next few years. As a result, AVAX spend years trading under $20. The asset was considered a potential competitor to Solana, though it only expanded above $100 for a brief period. In late 2024, AVAX had another rally to a local high of $55.30. AVAX is close to the top 10 of coins and tokens, gaining additional exposure from its recent market rally. AVAX open interest has also recovered above $480M, near the peak of the range for the past three years. The additional exposure from Avalanche9000 and the hype around the main net launch may boost AVAX, as it has shown the ability to outperform. Avalanche C-Chain receives $100M of inflows mainly from Ethereum, with around 7% of that bridged amount in stablecoins. Due to its relatively early launch in 2019, Avalanche is also one of the few chains with 1.6B in native Tether (USDT). As a L1 network, Avalanche may offer additional RWA tokenization to some of its partners. The Avalanche Project is actively curated by the Avalanche Foundation. In the past, the Avalanche team has also worked as an incubator for Web3 projects and games. After the launch of the L1 network, Avalanche may retain some of its top projects.

The report highlights a paradigm shift in the memecoins, which have evolved from short-term speculative assets to a sophisticated market with a total capitalization exceeding $100 billion. The memecoins market has demonstrated significant growth in 2024, with the Benchmark index surging 279.8%, outperforming assets like Bitcoin (118.9%) and gold (27.4%). This growth reflects not merely speculative interest, but a fundamental transformation in how memecoins are perceived and valued in the crypto industry. This notable market expansion has been fueled by two game-changing developments: breakthroughs in infrastructure and an explosion in memecoins cultural diversity. The emergence of specialized platforms like Pump.fun has dramatically simplified memecoins creation and trading, sustaining market momentum throughout this cycle. In this flourishing landscape, Solana and Ethereum have become the go-to destinations for memecoins. Ethereum remains the bedrock for established memecoins, and Solana has become the platform for new launches due to its agility in capturing market momentum. The numbers speak volumes: the market capitalization of Ethereum’s memecoins reached $34 billion, and Solana’s at $20.4 billion. Together, they account for nearly 47% of the total memecoin market. Alongside infrastructure advancement, the diversification of memecoins culture has emerged as another powerful market driver. These memecoins generally fall into four main types: Cult memecoins built on strong community consensus; the Animal memecoins that started it all; Trending event memecoins that capture hype; and the AI-themed memecoins that combine technology. Notably, these categories have begun to overlap as the market matures, creating more sophisticated memecoins narratives. This maturation has sparked a dramatic shift in market sentiment. What began as a retail-driven phenomenon has gained institutional traction, with major players like DWF Ventures, Pantera Capital, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck embracing the value of memecoins and adopting a more open attitude toward the memecoins market. Cryptocurrency exchanges have pivoted in response, racing to capture the memecoins market. In the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency exchanges, LBank cryptocurrency exchange has shown strong performance in the memecoins market through strategic timing and efficient execution. The numbers reflect this approach: with 281 memecoins listings in 2024 accounting for 34% of its total listings, followed by Gate.io (62) and Bitget (46). Notably, all top 10 trending memecoins identified in LBank's previous "" Top 10 Trending Memecoins of 2024 "" report were successfully listed on the platform. The performance of GOAT (29,900%), MOODENG (6,746%), and ACT (7,860%) on LBank reflect its ability to identify and support promising projects at their earliest stages. Analysis of major meme projects reveals LBank's competitive positioning in the market. While established exchanges like Binance and OKX command larger trading volumes, LBank's strategy of early listing and active support has created significant value for traders. This is particularly evident in projects like GOAT and MOODENG, where LBank's early market entry and trading metrics have matched or exceeded those of larger exchanges, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and supporting emerging projects. LBank's strategic focus on the memecoins market has proven effective, contributing to its milestone achievement of reaching 15 million global users. The launch of its slogan ""Discover The Era of Meme Legends"" in early 2024 has resonated strongly with the market evolution. As memecoins continue to mature, LBank cryptocurrency exchange remains committed to its strategic approach, introducing innovative initiatives and fostering market development to drive the next phase of industry growth. About LBank Founded in 2015, LBank is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, serving over 15 million registered users in more than 210 countries and regions. With a daily derivatives trading volume of more than $67 billion and support for over 800 cryptocurrencies, LBank is committed to delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly trading experience.

The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools.

With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Ethereum’s Upward Momentum Tests Key Resistance Levels Ethereum is currently trading between $3643.14 and $4232.62, showing strong momentum with a 16.52% increase over the past month. The cryptocurrency is approaching its nearest resistance level at $4457.83. Technical indicators like the MACD at 57.06 suggest bullish momentum, but the RSI at 70.90 and Stochastic at 91.50 indicate overbought conditions. If the upward trend continues, Ethereum could potentially rise to the second resistance level at $5047.32, representing an increase of about 19%. However, if the price fails to break the resistance, it may retrace to the nearest support level at $3278.88. Conclusion In the midst of the 2024 bull run, established assets like Ethereum may offer less short-term potential compared to emerging platforms.

Its debt-financed bitcoin purchase strategy was tremendously successful. Now, the total value of its BTC holdings stands at $42,450,183,305. Reports indicate that MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael J. Saylor’s BTC purchase strategy has inspired prominent Bitcoin mining companies, including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. Let’s explore. MicroStrategy’s Influence on Bitcoin Mining Companies Reports say that Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are preparing to issue convertible notes to purchase Bitcoin. What this indicates is that these mining companies are planning to shift from traditional mining to accumulating Bitcoin for long-term gains. MARA currently has around 40,435 BTC, worth $4,051,630,265, and RIOT holds at least 10,019 BTC, valued at $1,003,914,520. MicroStrategy has almost turned completely into a bitcoin treasury company. It has successfully executed the debt-financed bitcoin purchase strategy. Since November 5, the MSTR price has surged by over 71.71%. Challenges for MARA and RIOT Firstly, as MARA and RIOT are majorly mining companies, the latest Bitcoin halving event considerably reduced what they could earn from their business activities. Secondly, mining is now a highly competitive business. Reports indicate that MARA and RIOT face tough competition. Finally, both are not as compelling as MicroStrategy in terms of stock performance. This year, MSTR has grown by over 474.13%, while MARA and RIOT have declined by over -1.5% and -19.88%, respectively. Recently, activist investor Starboard Value advised Riot to diversify their business activities, suggesting it to reduce reliance on Bitcoin mining. Debt-Financed Bitcoin Strategy: Concerns of Investors Interestingly, Riot’s convertible notes issuance has a lower premium than MicroStrategy’s. However, not many experts support the debt-financed bitcoin strategy. Some strongly question the long-term viability of the strategy. Reports suggest that many want mining companies to increase Bitcoin holdings originally rather than rely on the debt strategy. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy inspires others but faces scrutiny. With RIOT and MARA adopting similar tactics, the success of these strategies remains uncertain.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 09:57:30

Crypto ETFs offer exposure by investing directly in the assets and/or companies involved in the digital economy. Crypto has been considered a higher-risk investment. Yet, as more regulatory acceptance is achieved, exposure to crypto may offer investors an opportunity to capitalize on the growth of digital assets. Three crypto-focused ETFs, with an average one-year return of +146%, possess incredible momentum and offer investors exposure to a diverse range of crypto and crypto-linked assets. Based on SA’s Quant Ratings, these ETFs possess incredible momentum. Christmas Comes Early for Crypto Fans Every year, investors hope for a 'Santa Claus Rally' – the historical (but never guaranteed) phenomenon in which the stock market jolts in value during the last week of December and the first few trading days of the new year. Cryptocurrency holders need not wait. Christmas has come early for crypto enthusiasts as the presidential victory of Donald Trump, who has pledged to make America “the crypto capital of the planet,” has sent the prices of digital coins soaring. According to crypto data provider CoinGecko, the global cryptocurrency market's value eclipsed $3T for the first time in three years last month, as investors rejoiced at the potential of easing regulatory restrictions on the industry in U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to an all-time high of over $100,000 on December 5, topping only its previous record from the day after election day. The Total Market Value of All Cryptocurrencies Exploded in November Seeking Alpha Premium Meanwhile, the resignation of SEC chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump plans to replace with crypto bull Paul Atkins, is set to shift the balance of power at the securities watchdog to a Republican majority – another reason for Wall Street to celebrate as Trump taps financiers like hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as Treasury pick. Regardless of how many crypto campaign promises Trump manages to keep, many analysts believe that crypto’s bull run will continue well into 2025. One such expert is Geoff Kendrick, head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, who recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of next year. Digital assets could offer an opportunity for investors looking to gain in a unique space achieving more regulatory acceptance “fairly quickly.” Investing in Cryptocurrency As Bitcoin and other digital currencies benefit from the global artificial intelligence push and crypto gains regulatory acceptance, investors wanting some exposure to the space may want a more accessible solution than navigating the complex universe of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. Crypto ETFs, which track the performance of one or more digital currencies and are traded on traditional stock exchanges, which can help with some of the regulatory risks associated with trading on unregulated crypto exchanges, though market risk is still involved. Some key features of crypto ETFs include: Accessibility - Crypto ETFs are traded like stocks on traditional exchanges and can therefore be accessed through brokerage accounts. Regulation - Trading through traditional exchanges offers greater regulation by financial authorities than directly holding crypto, subject to less security and oversight. Diversification - ETFs often include multiple cryptocurrencies and holdings, offering diversification rather than single-asset investments. Seeking Alpha’s Quant ETF Grades are generated by a proprietary system that aims to provide investors with an instant characterization of each ETF. The SA quant system grades organize the market’s Top ETFs by five factors: Momentum, Expenses, Dividends, Risk, and Liquidity. Key ETF metrics are systematically gathered and compared to the median of all ETFs, then assigned a grade from A+ to F. Investors can also use advanced filters to view various ETF asset classes and subclasses, including digital assets. Cryptocurrency-focused ETFs invest directly in digital assets or indirectly in miners and stocks involved in crypto. Although crypto ETFs have strong momentum, investors should realize they are also highly volatile, as demonstrated by their ‘F’ Risk Grades, and subject to expenses, which typically include management fees, custodian charges for holding the fund’s assets, and fees and expenses from fund administrators, auditors, etc. Seeking Alpha Premium The SA Quant Team identified three ETFs that expose investors to a wide range of crypto assets. All of them have ‘Strong Buy’ or ‘Buy’ ratings and excellent momentum, evidenced by a market-crushing average one-year price performance of +146%.

Let’s dive into the first ETF. 1. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF Assets ((AUM)): $1.44B Quant Rating: Strong Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 12/12/24): 2 out of 257 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 12/12/24): 2 out of 38 Ranked number two in both the Alternative asset class and Digital sub class, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF offers a diversified mix of 10 crypto holdings .

Seeking Alpha Premium 3. CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF Assets ((AUM)): $236.73M Quant Rating: Buy Quant Ranking in Asset Class (as of 12/12/24): 17 out of 258 Quant Ranking in Asset Sub Class (as of 12/12/24): 17 out of 38 CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF invests in the B itcoin mining industry. Bitcoin mining is an interesting option for investors looking to back the cryptocurrency industry without direct exposure to Bitcoin itself. The fund invests in nine companies , with more than 50% of its portfolio concentrated within its top four holdings: IREN Ltd, Core Scientific Inc, Cipher Mining Inc, and Cleanspark Inc. WGMI Holdings (as of 12/11/24) Seeking Alpha Premium Up 123.62% over the past 12 months and making SA’s list of Best-Performing Actively Managed ETFs , WGMI has consistently charted strong total return and price performance, contributing to its ‘A+’ Momentum Score . WGMI also demonstrates strong liquidity , with an average daily dollar volume of 12.36M, 778.23% higher than the sector median of 1.4m, and an average daily share volume of 512.52K, a noteworthy 1,316.45% higher than the 36.18K sector median. While all three of these ETFs make for compelling choices according to SA’s Quant system, investing in crypto comes with serious risks that every investor should consider. Risks While 2025 will inevitably be an exciting year for cryptocurrency, it is important to consider the risks involved, as these assets are highly volatile and can often be extremely speculative. The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy “ continues to urge investors to be cautious if considering an investment involving crypto asset securities.” Where mainstream adoption has catapulted many digital assets to new highs, as Seeking Alpha analyst Joseph Calhoun said , “In today's wild west of finance, even conservative investors can get taken,"" so always invest knowing the possibility that your holdings could decline swiftly and without warning. Concluding Summary Cryptocurrencies have seen historic growth in recent months, with more rallying forecasted as a crypto-friendly regulatory regime prepares to take up residency in Washington D.C. Three crypto-focused ETFs, hand-selected using SA’s Quant ratings provide investors with exposure to a diverse range of digital assets through direct investments or investments in companies involved in the broader crypto economy.

Unlike traditional stablecoins like USDT or USDC, USDe is designed as a yield-generating asset rather than just a transaction tool. USDe has quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, with its trading volume jumping by over 24% in a single day to $171.09 million. This shows a strong demand for yield-generating assets, especially in a bullish market. With a $200B market cap, stablecoins are here to change the crypto game. JUST IN: ETHENA LABS HINTS AT LAUNCHING ITS NEW STABLECOIN, USDE, PEGGED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, ON DEC. 16 — BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) December 13, 2024 Let’s see what makes it so appealing. What Makes USDe Different? USDe’s innovative model sets it apart from typical fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead of relying on reserves, it uses a delta-neutral trading strategy, balancing long and short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum to maintain stability. This strategy has helped USDe become the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, surpassing DAI in market cap. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this model, especially in a bear market. On the brighter side, Wintermute now uses it for trading, and it’s become the fastest-growing asset on Aave, a major DeFi platform. Ethena made $200 million in fees this year and is sharing some of that with token holders. Meanwhile, its native token, ENA, has jumped in value by five times since June. However, competitors like MakerDAO, which recently rebranded its stablecoin Dai to USDS, are adding pressure. Analyst Raises Doubts Despite its success, experts have raised concerns about USDe’s resilience, and security concerns. Andre Cronje, CTO of Fantom Foundation, has warned that USDe’s model might only work well in bullish markets. If market conditions turn bearish, the funding rates could drop, reducing yields and potentially destabilizing the coin. This has drawn comparisons to the collapse of Terra-Luna in 2022, which also struggled to maintain its peg during market downturns. Looking Ahead While USDe offers attractive returns and innovative strategies, its long-term stability is yet to be tested in volatile or bearish markets. The crypto community is watching closely to see if Ethena Labs can sustain USDe’s growth and avoid the pitfalls faced by previous high-yield stablecoins.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FTM|MARKET|TRADING|ENA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 10:01:58

By combining a decentralized cloud network with a scarcity-driven tokenomics model, NXQ offers a secure, growth-oriented investment opportunity inspired by the principles that propelled Bitcoin’s success. Understanding the Project NexQloud provides a decentralized cloud infrastructure that outperforms traditional data centers on cost, efficiency, and security. Instead of relying on energy-hungry facilities, NexQloud uses QloudNodes—specialized devices set up by contributors—to create a secure, distributed cloud network. This model significantly reduces costs for businesses while enhancing data security and environmental sustainability. NXQ Tokens: The Backbone of NexQloud NXQ Tokens are rewarded to hardware contributors who power NexQloud’s network. As NexQloud generates revenue from cloud services sold to enterprise clients, that revenue is used to buy NXQ Tokens on the open market. This creates an organic and recurring demand cycle. The more successful NexQloud becomes, the greater the demand for NXQ Tokens, benefiting token holders through potential price appreciation. Tokenomics: Built for Long-Term Value NXQ’s value proposition lies in its scarcity and utility. With a total supply capped at 21 million tokens and a daily distribution of 3600 tokens to contributors, NXQ operates on a deflationary model. Every four years, the token distribution rate is halved, mirroring Bitcoin’s halving mechanism. This structured reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand from enterprise customers, sets the stage for steady, long-term growth. How Demand Drives Value NXQ Tokens are more than a speculative asset. As NexQloud’s client base expands, businesses require more NXQ Tokens to access cloud services. As they consume more computing resources, token demand rises. With new QloudNodes coming online and competing for daily token distribution, the scarcity effect intensifies, further driving value. Investment Potential NXQ’s real-world utility, backed by the growth of NexQloud’s cloud platform, makes it a compelling investment for hardware providers and crypto speculators. Unlike many tokens that rely purely on hype, NXQ is tied to a profitable, enterprise-driven model, providing investors with confidence in the token’s long-term prospects. The balance of supply and demand ensures that NXQ’s value is both sustainable and growth-oriented. Secure Your Investment in the Future NXQ Tokens offer a unique blend of security, scarcity, and real-world utility. As NexQloud’s network continues to grow, the potential for token appreciation remains strong. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this innovative cloud and crypto revolution. Buy NXQ Tokens on P2B today and position yourself for Bitcoin-level growth with maximum security.

However, selling pressure forced BTC below $100,000, with the cryptocurrency down 1.24% and trading at $99,750. The crash earlier in the week liquidated over 100,000 traders, leading to a total of $298.5 million in total liquidations. The crypto market cap, which registered a dramatic increase when markets recovered, is down by 1.33% and currently sits at $3.6 trillion. Most cryptocurrencies have started the day in the red, with Ethereum (ETH) down marginally and trading just below $4,000. Solana (SOL) is down by 1.36% and trading at $227, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 2% and trading at $0.408. Notable declines have also been registered by Cardano (ADA) , Shiba Inu (SHIB), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT). However, Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have defied the broader market, registering gains of 5.97% and 10.90%. Japanese Lawmaker Proposes National Bitcoin Reserve A Japanese lawmaker has asked the government to create a national Bitcoin reserve, following similar calls by lawmakers in Argentina and Russia. Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, made the proposal. Hamada presented a written request to the Japanese government regarding the creation of a reserve for cryptocurrencies. The lawmaker pointed out similar plans have been proposed in Brazil and the United States, where Treasury officials could hold Bitcoin (BTC) as a strategic reserve. The lawmaker asked the government to consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies like BTC. Hamada pointed out that BTC is less susceptible to the influence of countries and institutions, and its neutrality and decentralized nature allow it to support economic activity without relying on a specific currency. The government will present Hamada with a written response, which is also likely to be published on its website. Oddo To Enter Stablecoin Market With Fireblocks Asset manager and private banking services provider Oddo is collaborating with Fireblocks to crack the stablecoin market. The project will launch as early as next year. Stablecoins have become popular among traders thanks to their low volatility. The project comes after Societe Generale SA’s crypto asset unit in France, which uses the euro-dominated stablecoin (EUR). Ethereum (ETH) Could Catapult Beyond $5,000 The crypto markets have bounced back after experiencing a spate of liquidations during the week. However, none have rebounded as strongly as Ethereum (ETH). The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is on the brink of moving past $4,000, a key resistance level, and is up almost 24$ over the past month, with its gains surpassing even BTC. An analyst from Nexo predicted ETH could cross $5,000 as early as 2025 and set a new all-time high. “The cogs and bolts are in place. Ethereum could catapult beyond $5,000 as early as 2025.” Some analysts believe ETH has an edge because it is the only token other than BTC with a US-based ETF. “ETH has a big advantage in that it’s the only token besides BTC to have a US ETF. As traditional investors allocate more to crypto they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Trump Believes US Is Going To Do Something Great With Crypto President-elect Donald Trump has said the US will do great things with crypto during his upcoming term and become the global leader for cryptocurrency in the next four years. Trump made the comments in response to a question about setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve, stating, “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else. But others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” Trump’s views on crypto are a welcome change for the industry and investors from the current administration, which led a crackdown on the industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) went above the $100,000 mark again late on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $102,507. The jump came after the release of November's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came along expected lines. The data reinforced optimism about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut next week. However, BTC couldn't maintain its momentum for long, as it dipped below $100,000 and is currently trading around the $99,900 mark. BTC’s latest price action marks a strong recovery from the market crash earlier in the week when BTC dipped below $95,000. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered a substantial price drop. However, BTC’s recovery following the crash also led to a recovery in the broader market, with prominent altcoins notching up double-digit gains. ETFs registered record-breaking inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares ETFs accounting for a staggering $3.2 billion. Now, let’s take a look at BTC’s price chart. BTC set a new all-time high last week as it surged past $100,000 and peaked at $103,900. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price plummeted, falling to a low of $92,279 before settling at $97,094. However, the price picked up on Friday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $99,695. Buyers retained control over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising by 1.32% to go above $100,000 and settle at $101,043. However, selling pressure increased significantly on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, BTC dropped by 3.57%, going below the 20-day SMA to a low of $94,185. However, buyers propped up the price from this level, and it recovered to settle at $97.434. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC dropped to a low of $94,313 before settling at $96,912, registering a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC recovered, rising over 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,900. Buyers pushed BTC to an intraday high of $102,530 on Thursday before losing momentum. As a result, sellers drove BTC down by 0.97% as it slipped below $100,000 and settled at $99,923. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers take control, BTC could attempt to reclaim $100,000 and push toward its all-time high. Surpassing this level could push BTC to $105,000. If sellers take control, BTC could drop to $97,000 before finding support. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery over the past few sessions as it looks to go above the resistance at $4,000. However, it faces an uphill task to overcome this level, with sellers active. ETH faced considerable volatility last Thursday, which saw the price rise to an intraday high of $3,957 and drop to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787. However, it recovered strongly on Friday as ETH rose almost 6% to move above $4,000 and settled at $4,003. The weekend saw a tussle between buyers and sellers, and ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday to drop below $4,000 and settle at $3,999. However, buyers pushed ETH above $4,000 on Sunday as it settled at $4,007 after a marginal increase. Source: TradingView The current week began with a substantial increase in bearish sentiment as ETH dropped over 7%, reaching an intraday low of $3,504 before reclaiming $3,700 and settling at $3,719. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dipped to a low of $3,519 before ultimately settling at $3,630, registering a decline of 2.32%. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as ETH made a strong recovery, rising almost 6% to go above $3,800 and settling at $3,834. Buyers attempted a move past $4,000 on Thursday. However, ETH lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $3,988 and settled at $3,882, registering an increase of 1.26%. The current session sees ETH up just over 1% as it looks to retest the resistance at $4,000. Some analysts are confident ETH will surpass $4,000 and possibly surge beyond $5,000 as early as 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s struggles to go above the 20-day SMA continue as sellers repelled another attempt to go above it. SOL has witnessed considerable volatility as buyers struggle to push toward $250 and sellers look to lower the price. SOL reached an intraday high of $246 last Friday as it briefly went past the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum, and SOL ultimately settled at $237, registering only a marginal increase. The weekend was mixed as SOL registered a marginal rise on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to end the weekend on a bearish note. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure intensified considerably on Monday as SOL plummeted 8.55%, falling to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $203. However, buyers propped up the price, and SOL ultimately settled at $213 after a drop of 1.47%. Despite considerable bearish sentiment, SOL recovered on Wednesday, rising over 6% and settling at $227. Buyers attempted to go above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as SOL reached an intraday high of $234. However, they lost momentum in the face of selling pressure at this level, and SOL fell back, dropping to $227 and registering a marginal decline. Sellers have retained control during the current session, with SOL down 1.51% and trading at $223. If sellers retain control, SOL could drop to $215. If this level is breached, the price could drop to $200. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) declined considerably during the week, as selling pressure registered a notable increase, and bearish sentiment dominated the market. TAO was bullish towards the end of last week, rising to an intraday high of $725 on Friday before settling at $705, registering an increase of almost 4%. However, momentum waned on Saturday as TAO dropped 0.95%, falling below $700 and settling at $699. In a sign of things to come, the price fell to an intraday low of $675 on Sunday before recovering to register an increase of 2.03% and go above $700 to settle at $713. Source: TradingView Markets collapsed on Monday and TAO plummeted almost 16%, going below the 20-day SMA and 50-day SMA to drop to a low of $504. However, with buyers active at lower levels, the price recovered partially and settled at $600. Sellers continued to dominate the market on Tuesday as TAO dropped over 4% to settle at $575, but not before recovering from a low of $529. Wednesday witnessed a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and TAO registered an increase of 4.34% and settled at $600. Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Thursday as TAO reached an intraday high of $645. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take over. As a result, TAO dropped almost 4% to $577. The current session sees TAO down by 1.32%, as sellers look to lower the price toward the $550 support level. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) was quite bullish towards the end of the previous week as it registered an increase of 7.31% on Friday and settled at $8.84. However, It failed to stay above the resistance at $9 as sellers drove the price lower. As a result, TIA dropped over 4% on Saturday and 1.11% on Sunday to end the weekend at $8.37. Bearish sentiment increased substantially on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, TIA plummeted over 20%, going below the 20-day SMA, and settled at $6.68. Source: TradingView Tuesday saw a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, TIA rose to an intraday high of $7.31 and fell to an intraday low of $6.24 before settling at $6.64 after a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as TIA registered an increase of 8.49% to go above $7 and settle at $7.20. Buyers attempted to drive TIA above $7.50 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $7.65. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $7.20. The current session sees TIA down by almost 1% as sellers look to drive it towards $7. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) has recovered during recent sessions after plummeting below $1 at the beginning of the week. ARB reached an intraday high of $1.24 on Friday before settling at $1.13. However, sentiment changed over the weekend, dropping by 0.89% on Saturday and 0.43% on Sunday to settle at $1.15. Bearish sentiment increased significantly on Monday as ARB plummeted over 17%, going below the 20-day SMA to an intraday low of $0.84. However, it recovered from this level to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.96. Selling pressure persisted on Tuesday as ARB went below the 20-day SMA after a drop of just over 2% and settled at $0.93. Source: TradingView Despite considerable selling pressure, ARB recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 6.51% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.99. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ARB surged to an intraday high of $1.11. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $1.02, registering an increase of almost 3%. The current session sees ARB up by 2.57% and trading at $1.05 as buyers look to consolidate above $1. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis Hedera (HBAR) is attempting to reclaim $0.30 after suffering a dramatic collapse at the beginning of the week. Sentiment around HBAR changed over the weekend as it dropped almost 10% on Saturday after failing to go above $0.40. The price registered a marginal increase on Sunday before falling back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 16% to an intraday low of $0.236 before settling at $0.280. Despite starting the week on a negative note, HBAR recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 3.33% after falling to an intraday low of $0.252 and settling at $0.289. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as HBAR registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $0.298.

In this, BlackRock, a multinational management corporation, has played a major role with the IBIT ETFs and ETHA ETFs inflows that have brought the world’s attention to the Exchange Traded Funds. However, despite the demand and success with these, the firm is holding back on other crypto ETFs, and there is a simple but serious reason behind that. BlackRock Executive Revealed ‘Why No New Crypto ETFs’ BlackRock has a 99.9% ETF approval rate, and because of this, investors and delegates have demanded a few more altcoin ETFs. However, the firm is likely to put a hold on that, as they have focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. The senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchuna, revealed this through a recent X post, sharing a statement of Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs, BlackRock. As per the post, the firm is just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they need to explore and develop more with these ETFs. More importantly, Jay claimed that only a fraction of the clients own IBIT and ETHA. As a result, they are more focused on improving that instead of new crypto ETFs. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 BlackRock’s approach to holding on to further Crypto ETFs has also received appreciation from investors. One commented on the post, saying that a step-by-step approach is better, as launching a new ETF too soon will only exacerbate volatility. A step-by-step approach is much better for crypto in general. Launching new ETF too quickly will only exacerbate volatility more and not bring an educated adoption of crypto. In contrast, Bitwise has recently filed for 10 Crypto Index ETFs with US SEC , bringing the adoption to a new level. Bitcoin and ETFs Days Long Imports Making Waves With the Bitcoin ETFs receiving massive success, the ETF demand has grown impressively. In November alone, global investors contributed $204.6B to global ETFs collectively. The iShares report claims that this is almost three-quarters of the money that has gone to U.S. equity funds. This is a clear representation of the demand for these exchange-traded funds among investors who are looking for secure investment options. At present, the spot Bitcoin ETF is in net inflows for 11 days, gaining $598M on December 12, per Coingalss data. Even in this, IBIT contributed $432M, bringing the total net asset of Bitcoin ETF to $112.546 billion. Interestingly, the spot Ethereum ETF is also on the same track. It is in net inflows for 14 consecutive days, bringing $274M on December 12, 2024. In this, ETHA received $202M, hitting ETH ETF milestones over time. With that, demand for altcoin ETFs like Solana, XRP, and Shiba Inu is also high. The popular ETF launcher white label Tidal’s, Mike Venuto revealed that they often witness people pitching random exchange-traded fund ideas like ‘bitcoin + something else’ ETFs.” Interestingly, he also revealed that every thinkable option strategy will soon be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming” – Mike Venuto of Tidal. BlackRock Set Slow Pace For Crypto ETFs BlackRock has probably decided to implement a cautious approach for the new crypto ETFs as they wish to go for sustainable growth and educated adoption. As per Bloomberg analyst’s revelation, the firm is focusing on currently established Spot ETFs like Bitcoin and Ethereum rather than expanding to more altcoin ETFs. This decision has also received investors’ support as people wish to see broader financial stability rather than volatility. More importantly, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF’s success has led to increased demand for more launches, revealing the impact these two have created on investors and Bitcoin price , currently nearing the $100K mark.

At this point, the Bank of England (BoE) took action to investigate the risks of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England, through its financial sector regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has requested companies to report on the risks of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England's regulatory arm has asked companies to submit detailed reports on their cryptocurrency transactions by March 2025 so it can monitor stability and shape policy. The regulator is also requiring companies to detail their future plans for cryptocurrencies, and specifically their use of permissionless blockchain, by September 2029. The aim of the analyses to be conducted according to the Basel framework is to determine the effects of cryptocurrency markets on financial stability. This framework, which was put into effect by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022, determines the capital adequacy and risk management standards that banks must comply with in crypto asset investments. *This is not investment advice.

This move, outlined in a December 12 statement, aims to monitor financial stability risks while informing the regulator’s approach to crypto-related policies. The PRA’s request extends beyond current holdings, seeking insights into planned crypto activities through September 2029. Firms are also required to detail their adherence to the Basel framework, a global standard for managing risks associated with crypto assets introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2022. “This initiative will help us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures and assess the costs and benefits of various policy options,” the PRA noted. The regulator intends to use this data to evaluate the financial stability implications of cryptocurrencies and their integration into traditional financial systems . Permissionless Blockchains Under Scrutiny A focal point of the PRA’s inquiry revolves around permissionless blockchains. The regulator’s questionnaire highlights concerns such as settlement risks, lack of finality, and potential mismatches between ownership intent and control over authentication mechanisms. While acknowledging potential benefits, the PRA warned that the risks posed by permissionless blockchains remain inadequately mitigated. This classification will stay under review, underscoring the authority’s cautious approach toward integrating decentralized ledger technologies into regulated frameworks. In addition, firms are expected to provide a comprehensive assessment of their crypto strategies, including their use of permissionless blockchains and other decentralized technologies. This marks a significant step in aligning the UK’s regulatory landscape with evolving global standards. Growing Interest in Crypto Treasury Assets As the PRA tightens oversight, global interest in crypto assets continues to surge. Businesses like Hong Kong’s Boyaa Interactive and Japan’s Metaplanet are reallocating treasury assets toward Bitcoin, capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s recent rally past six figures. Boyaa Interactive recently swapped $50 million worth of Ether for Bitcoin, while Metaplanet announced plans to raise $62 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings. These moves reflect a broader trend of companies leveraging crypto assets for diversification and potential growth, even as regulatory scrutiny intensifies worldwide.

Do It Before Is Too Late,https://timestabloid.com/expert-explains-why-he-double-down-his-xrp-position-do-it-before-is-too-late/,"In a recent tweet and accompanying video, Crypto investor Oscar Ramos made a compelling case for XRP, urging his audience to double down on their investments before what he predicts will be a transformative period for the cryptocurrency. As a leading figure in the XRP community, Oscar Ramos articulates several arguments supporting XRP’s potential for generational wealth creation, citing political, regulatory, and market-based factors. BECOME an #XRP Maximalist NOW – here’s why I double down my $XRP position. DO IT Before is Too Late – 2025 will be the greatest year in crypto history, guess where XRP will go?! pic.twitter.com/Hh4jtPmyen — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) December 12, 2024 A Generational Opportunity in Crypto Oscar Ramos characterizes XRP as a “generational wealth opportunity,” pointing to its unique position in the cryptocurrency market. He underscores XRP’s historical significance as a top-tier asset, highlighting its utility as a token developed by Ripple for cross-border payments and financial efficiency. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, Oscar Ramos asserts that XRP’s distinct role in enabling seamless global transactions positions it as a standout asset in the crypto space. According to Oscar, the recent price consolidation of XRP around $2.30 to $2.40 reflects a pivotal moment. He expresses confidence that the token’s value could climb to $5 or higher, fueled by increasing adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Political and Regulatory Landscape A key component of Oscar Ramos’s argument revolves around the changing political and regulatory environment in the United States. Oscar anticipates more crypto-friendly administration and leadership changes at regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC. He suggests these developments will foster an environment conducive to innovation and growth in blockchain technology, particularly for companies like Ripple. Additionally, Osacar highlights Ripple’s proactive approach to navigating regulatory challenges. The company has invested millions in legal defenses against the SEC’s lawsuit and lobbying efforts to advance pro-crypto policies. This, he argues, demonstrates Ripple’s commitment to establishing XRP as a cornerstone of the digital financial ecosystem. Market Catalysts and Projections Oscar Ramos also identifies key market catalysts that could drive XRP’s growth. These include the potential launch of ETFs like XRP, increased institutional adoption, and the resolution of ongoing legal uncertainties. He references the precedent set by Bitcoin’s price surge following the approval of ETFs, suggesting a similar trajectory for XRP once its regulatory hurdles are cleared. Price predictions for XRP, according to Oscar, range from $5 to as high as $300 by 2025. While such forecasts are speculative, they align with the community’s optimistic outlook on XRP’s long-term potential. Oscar points to XRP’s market cap relative to Ethereum’s, arguing that it is feasible for XRP to achieve comparable growth. Oscar’s call to action—encouraging individuals to consider XRP as part of their investment portfolio—is a reminder of the high stakes and potential rewards in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Whether XRP will deliver on its promise of generational wealth remains to be seen, but for its advocates, the future looks decidedly bullish.

Pendle Finance has emerged as the primary beneficiary of this expansion, holding a substantial 1.8 billion sUSDe, accounting for 48% of the total circulating supply.

The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) came in hotter than expected Thursday, prompting investors to tighten their stances and keep a bid for the dollar, as we anticipated . There's also the Truflation index stirring up concern. Seen by some as more reliable than government numbers, it rose above 3% for the first time in over two years. But guess what? Fed fund futures remain confident the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, and traders on decentralized exchanges, who have a knack for catching big trends, remain as bullish as ever. The sentiment is reflected in the impressive $64.8 million open interest for active BTC call options on Derive, the leading on-chain options protocol. That's a staggering six times larger than the open interest in put options. Ether traders are also leaning heavily toward calls, figures from Amberdata show. On top of that, funding rates for BTC, ETH, and SOL on HyperLiquid, a prominent on-chain perpetuals trading protocol, are also positive, albeit with reservations. They're hovering well under an annualized 50%, showing that while the sentiment is bullish, the leverage level is measured and not overly aggressive. In the broader market, AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche network of blockchains, struggled to chew through selling pressure near $55, teasing a ""double top"" pattern on the charts. The lackluster price action comes on the heels of Thursday's $250 million fundraise led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital. Keep an eye out for a pick-up in volatility as the highly anticipated Avalanche9000 upgrade , aimed at making the platform more affordable and flexible for creating layer-1 chains, is set to go live on Dec. 16 . LQTY, the native token of censorship-resistant decentralized stablecoin lender Liquity, took a breather near $2.45, having more than doubled in value in the past four weeks because of the V2 launch and overall bullish market sentiment. The Polygon ecosystem token, POL, wasn't stirred by a proposal suggesting deploying DAI, USDC and USDT reserves locked in the PoS bridge — the equivalent of cash under a mattress — into yield-generating strategies. Lastly, a survey by Vietnam's leading digital assets exchange, Coin68, showed over half of respondents reporting profits from their investments last year and 93.5% anticipating an altcoin season in 2025. Emerging countries, in general, could see more pivot toward alternative investment vehicles as President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs cause fiat volatility, although that could also motivate local governments to implement capital controls.

The scatologically named AI agent token fartcoin (FART) has zoomed to over $670 million in market cap, lifted by gains in the general AI agent sector we discussed on Thursday. The coin allows users to engage with the token by submitting fart-related memes or jokes to claim tokens. It boasts a ""Gas Fee"" system — a parody of gas fees on serious projects such as Ethereum — with certain transactions producing a name-appropriate digital sound, adding a unique layer of what some might call fun. Some community members see the token as more than just a meme; they view it as a cultural phenomenon within the crypto space — one that gets funnier as prices rise. Fartcoin was conceived within the digital conversation space known as ""Infinite Backrooms,” the chatroom that directly led to the creation of the first AI agent, Gospel of Goatse (GOAT). The idea was initially discussed by an AI agent known as ""Terminal of Truths"" (@truth_terminal on X) in conversation with another AI bot. It was explored, among other token launch concepts, as part of a broader discussion on how to raise funds for various projects, including making a film and supporting environmental initiatives.

Related Reading: Tether’s USDT Hits New High—330 Million Wallets And Counting Recent predictions say that the price of XRP could go up a lot, to anywhere from $30 to $200 by 2025, depending on many market factors. Both experienced investors and newbies who want to get in on the cryptocurrency boom are interested in the huge returns that are possible. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE FILTHY RICH BECAUSE OF THIS! (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/esdq9eJ6zz — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Factors Contributing To The Potential Of XRP Rise A number of factors have led to this positive prediction for XRP. Most people are worried about the current legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. As signs of a good outcome appear, investor trust is rising. This legal certainty is very important because it could speed up the use of XRP in global banking. Institutional investors are becoming more interested in Ripple because it changes the way payments are made between countries. By 2025, crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto thinks XRP will have gone up 1,300%, to $30–$35. Since XRP is worth $2.33 right now, this bullish prediction means that buyers will make a lot of money. Instead of waiting for $35, he recommends investors to focus on the daily chart and take profits gradually as XRP rises. Steph warns traders that crypto is uncertain, but he thinks XRP might hit $35 by 2025. Some analysts, such as Ben Beddow, anticipate that XRP could surpass $4.11 by the end of the year, and it could reach $3 within months. Early investors, particularly those who acquired the stock at a lower price, would accrue substantial profits as a result of such price fluctuations. For instance, an investment of $1,000 could potentially increase to $14,000 if XRP achieves those higher objectives. The Potential For A Million The concept of becoming a millionaire through XRP is not merely a pipe dream. Wealth manager Jake Claver suggests that Ripple has the potential to revolutionize international payments in the same way that Amazon did for e-commerce, drawing parallels between XRP and Amazon’s early days. Claver foresees a future in which XRP could execute trillions of transactions per day, potentially causing its price to rise to an astonishing $132. This would be a staggering 23,900% increase from current levels. Related Reading: Eric Trump’s Bold Call: Bitcoin To Soar To $1 Million In ‘Financial Revolution’ Even though such predictions are ambitious, they do not seem impossible, with the growing institutional interest and with the fast pace of development of cryptocurrencies. The growing demand for XRP will force its price to increase as Ripple continues to partner with some of the biggest financial institutions while expanding its use case for global payments. Caution In The Face Of Optimism While the attraction of money is tempting, one must be careful while making such predictions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and although some analysts seem positive about XRP’s future, no guarantee is available. Investors must think about taking profits at prices that rise instead of waiting for maximum valuations.

Notably, the listing or any positive announcements from the top exchanges often fuel market optimism, as it hints towards growing confidence of the exchange towards the asset. Binance Launchpool Adds Vana As 62nd Project Binance announced VANA as its latest addition to Launchpool, lauding the project’s compatibility as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain. According to the announcement, users can farm VANA tokens by locking Binance Coin (BNB) and First Digital USD (FDUSD) in designated pools. Farming will occur over a brief two-day period, starting December 14, 2024, at 00:00 UTC. Notably, the farming rewards are capped at 4,800,000 VANA tokens, accounting for 4% of the token’s total supply. Besides, 85% of the rewards will be allocated to the BNB pool, while the FDUSD pool will receive the remaining 15%. Each user is restricted by hourly caps to ensure equitable distribution, with 8,500 VANA available per hour in the BNB pool and 1,500 VANA in the FDUSD pool. Meanwhile, after the farming, the exchange will list VANA on December 16, 2024, at 10:00 UTC. Trading pairs will include VANA/USDT, VANA/BNB, VANA/FDUSD, and VANA/TRY. This launch adds to the leading crypto exchange’s reputation for introducing promising blockchain projects to its platform. VANA’s Market Appeal Soars VANA’s unique focus on decentralizing user-owned data positions it as a standout project in the blockchain ecosystem. Its initial circulating supply will be 30,084,000 VANA, representing 25.07% of the maximum token supply. This calculated release strategy aims to balance demand and supply, potentially driving price stability during its early trading phase. The market’s enthusiasm for VANA stems from Binance Launchpool’s announcement and its structured approach to launch. Research reports and tools, set to be available prior to farming, aim to educate investors and enhance transparency. Binance’s launch of VANA not only highlights the platform’s commitment to blockchain innovation but also provides investors with new opportunities for diversification. As the trading date approaches, all eyes will be on VANA’s performance and its potential to disrupt the user-data-centric blockchain sector. Meanwhile, the USUAL token also noted a strong rally after the same platform added it as the 61st project on its platform last month. Considering that, the market is anticipating a similar move by VANA following the listing on the top crypto exchange.

Although the Nirvana token bears no connection to the VANA token Binance plans to list on Dec. 16 at 10:00 UTC, it seems crypto traders mistook the VANA token linked to the Nirvana project due to the Vana explorer token not being available on the market yet. In the hours since Binance announced its plans to list VANA, the Nirvana token has formed a candlestick, wildly surging up to 2700% since its launch according to CoinMarketCap . At the time of writing, the token has gone up by more than 1200% after months of mostly stagnant activity on the charts. VANA is currently trading hands at $0.0015. Its trading volume in the past 24 hours saw a surge of 2432% to $616,640. Meanwhile its market cap has gone up by 609% to $90,750.

Binance will also apply the seed tag to the Vana token due to its freshly launched status. Binance sets an hourly hard cap per user of 8,500 VANA in the BNB pool and 1,500 VANA in the FDUSD pool. Binance also supports VANA farming amounting to 2.4 million tokens worth of total daily rewards. With a maximum token supply of 120 million VANA, the Vana network has allocated 44% of its token supply to the Vana community with a 36-month-long unlocking period and 22.9% for the ecosystem with an unlocking period of 48 months. Meanwhile, core contributors and investors get 18.8% and 14.2% respectively, with an unlocking period spanning years.

On December 12, it surged to a new all-time high of $4.91, fueled by a 30% gain over 24 hours, making it one of the top-performing digital assets in the market. Despite a 4.5% pullback in the last 24 hours, SUI’s bullish trend remains intact, drawing comparisons to some of the most explosive rallies in cryptocurrency history, including Solana’s ( SOL ) meteoric rise in 2021. Notably, an analysis by TradingShot , a prominent technical analysis firm, highlights a striking resemblance between Sui’s current price action and Solana’s breakout pattern in 2020-2021. The analysis points out that Sui’s ongoing “Channel Up” formation mirrors the early phases of Solana’s parabolic rise. Technical analysis – Channel up formation driving gains On the one-day chart, SUI has been trading within a well-defined Channel Up pattern since its August 5 low. Each bullish leg within this channel has seen rallies of 138.89%, and the most recent upward move was triggered by a bullish crossover on the one-day moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ). The token is currently supported by its 50-day moving average (1D MA50), a critical level that has consistently acted as a launchpad for its rallies. SUI price analysis chart. Source: TradingShot/TradingView With these technical indicators aligned, the next target for SUI is $7, a level coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement . This level has remained unbroken since August, and a successful breakout could pave the way for further gains. Notably, the 200-day moving average (1D MA200) remains well below the current price action, highlighting the strength of Sui’s bullish trend. AI models further support this momentum, projecting that SUI could surpass $6 in the near term, driven by robust demand and growing network activity, as reported by Finbold. SUI’s ecosystem growth: Fundamental drivers of momentum Sui’s ecosystem growth continues to drive its bullish momentum, with its fundamentals strongly complementing its technical performance. On December 12, the total value locked (TVL) on the network surged to a new high of $1.84 billion, according to data from DefiLlama . Meanwhile, its decentralized exchange (DEX) activity hit a 24-hour record of $466 million, pushing cumulative DEX volume beyond $35 billion. Notably, Sui’s TVL has displayed impressive consistency, remaining above $1 billion since November 6 and currently sitting at $1.66 billion. This sustained capital inflow highlights the network’s robust activity and growing user engagement, underscoring its position as a rising force in the blockchain space. Partnerships fueling growth Recent partnerships have played a crucial role in Sui’s growth trajectory. In November, the network announced a collaboration with $1.7 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton to explore innovative use cases. It also partnered with Babylon Labs, Lombard, and Cubist to integrate Bitcoin liquidity, unlocking programmable Bitcoin capabilities within its ecosystem. Adding to its appeal, Sui has expanded its functionality through key wallet integrations. The announcement of Phantom Wallet’s integration with the Sui network has enhanced its usability, and the recent announcement of Backpack integration has further fueled its rising appeal. While these developments have undoubtedly boosted Sui’s ecosystem, the recent gains suggest that broader market dynamics and increased utility are also driving its growth, pointing to a combination of ecosystem growth and external factors contributing to its bullish trajectory. Sui price analysis At press time, SUI is trading at $4.69, reflecting a 12% gain over the past week and an impressive 46% increase over the past month. Sui seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold A combination of strong technical indicators, fundamental drivers, and broader market dynamics positions Sui to potentially replicate the kind of rally seen with Solana in 2021.

On-chain data shows that Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance is accumulating the token as optimism of a potential partnership with Blackrock. So, how high can the LINK price rise? Linking Trump’s Buying Spree & Chainlink, BlackRock Partnership LINK price has held steady after on-chain data showed that World Liberty Financial has been buying the token. Data shows that the network, which is associated with Donald Trump and his family has bought LINK tokens worth over $2.3 million . The company also owns Ethereum, Tether, and AAVE. WLFI Chainlink Purchases These purchases came after we reported that there was speculation that there will be a partnership between Chainlink and Blackrock . Such a partnership would be notable because Blackrock is the biggest asset manager in the world, with $11.5 trillion in assets. It would, however, not be a big surprise since Blackrock has emerged as a key proponent for the crypto industry. The partnership will come as Chainlink continues inking deals. Just this week, the network inked partnership deals with companies like Coinbase and Emirates NBD, a bank with over $200 billion in assets. Also, whales have continued to accumulate LINK tokens recently. LINK Price Analysis Points To More Gains Technicals suggest that the LINK price has more gains to come. On the weekly chart, we see that the coin has just crossed the upper side of the Andrew’s Pitchfork tool. A strong breakout like this often leads to more gains. Chainlink price has also crossed the crucial resistance level at $22.93, the highest swing in March. It was also the neckline of the slanted double-bottom pattern. It has also moved to the 50% retracement level and is above the 50-week moving average. Therefore, the long-term view for the price of Chainlink is bullish, with the next target being at $53, which is about 85% above the current level. For that rally to happen, Chainlink will need to cross the 61.8% retracement point at $34.90 and the 78.6% point at $42.90. There is also a likelihood that the coin will drop and retest the support at $22.93 and then resume the uptrend. This is known as a break and retest pattern and is one of the most popular continuation signs. Chainlink Price Chart A drop below the psychological support at $20 will invalidate the bullish Chainlink price forecast and point to more downside.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 12:03:56

Crypto feels unstoppable in the wake of the US presidential election. Bitcoin ( BTC ) soars past $100,000 for the first time—a number that felt like a pipe dream just a year ago. The air is thick with FOMO as investors and entrepreneurs scramble to ride the wave. But let’s not get swept away. Moments like these are exciting, sure, but they can also blind us to the fundamentals. If we want blockchain to truly succeed, we need to shift focus from speculative surges to building products that generate sustainable revenue. You might also like: FOMO might be your portfolio’s worst enemy | Opinion I get it. The excitement is contagious. Volatility and moonshots are part of the DNA here. But this time, the excitement isn’t just noise. The signal is clear: crypto is finally ready for real adoption. Game-changing innovations like account abstraction and chain abstraction are making user experiences seamless. SocialFi projects like Farcaster are pushing boundaries, and tokenization is evolving fast (even if memecoins occasionally make us cringe). The growth we actually need Yes, metrics like growing TVL and the popularity of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds show the ecosystem is expanding. And sure, it’s normal for tech startups to lean on venture capital in their early stages. But let’s face it: no industry can thrive indefinitely on venture funding alone. Eventually, every company has to stand on its own two feet—and that means generating real revenue. Think of early-stage crypto projects as babies in the womb. They rely on an external lifeline—VC funding—for survival. But at some point, they’ve got to breathe, walk, and thrive independently. That’s where we are now. Crypto is ready to step into the world and prove it can not only innovate but also sustain itself. For too long, growth has been tied to inflationary token models. While these systems make sense technically, the value they create is often illusory—more about circulating supply than real demand. Thankfully, we’re starting to see new models emerge. These aren’t just about speculation; they’re about solving real problems, unlocking mainstream adoption, and scaling in meaningful ways. Don’t get comfortable Crypto startups must aim higher than just pumping valuations or driving quick returns. Token prices are flashy, but they’re not the endgame. Our focus should be on building sustainable, interoperable economies. Models built on the assumption that a native token will “just keep going up” are inherently unstable, feeding the skepticism that clouds crypto in traditional markets’ eyes. The good news is that the tools are in place to shift gears. As user experiences catch up with technical capabilities, the door is wide open to building robust, user-focused businesses. One significant opportunity is interoperability. Think about why people value the dollar—it works everywhere. Now imagine if every store you visited had its own currency. Shopping would become a logistical nightmare. Crypto shouldn’t fall into that trap. Instead of flooding the market with isolated tokens, we should focus on useful rewards and assets across platforms. This doesn’t mean sacrificing blockchain’s unique advantages. Many L1s and L2s support tokens that are compatible with products across DeFi and beyond. It’s time to lean into tokenomics that reward users with assets they can use, not just hold as speculative bets. The bottom line Blockchain is a revolutionary technology with the potential to overhaul global infrastructure. It’s like replacing steam engines with bullet trains—faster, smarter, better. But no matter how innovative we are, the basic laws of economics still apply. If our products don’t generate real cash flow, they won’t survive. The hype cycles will come and go, but the possibilities are limitless if we focus on creating products that deliver clear value and grow sustainably. This isn’t just wishful thinking—we’re ready to make it happen. The foundation is here, and the potential is enormous. Let’s not waste it.

Celestia price prediction December 2024 Celestia’s price triggered intense bullish pressure following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $7.6 and a maximum of $10.5, with an average of $8.7. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction December 2024 $7.6 $8.7 $10.5 Celestia price prediction 2024 Despite its recent launch, Celestia already boasts a strong ecosystem with wallets, developer tools, and DeFi protocols.

This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025. Celestia price prediction for 2026 Notably, a portion of early investors’ vested tokens will become available before and during this period. Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA (Celestia’s token) as it reaches its peak moment.

The direction of the Bitcoin dominance metric may signal both a market peak and the ability of altcoins to outperform. The real Bitcoin dominance metric is a new metric introduced to measure BTC against a basket of mined coins. The metric excludes ICO tokens and other assets, removing the distortion of the tokenized economy. The index also excludes stablecoins, which do not reflect the true value of other coins. Removing the stablecoin supply and random outperforming tokens serves to give a clearer index of the direction of BTC and the rest of the market. The true BTC dominance index reflects a shift in direction. BTC dominance is measured against mined coins, excluding stablecoins and tokens. | Source: Bitbo The Bitbo index includes some legacy coins, which aim to be hard or deflationary money. BTC usually has a higher dominance against this group of assets. However, it also sends a clear signal when shifting direction. The basket of hard money coins and tokens, most of which use a form of mining, include LTC, BSV, BCH, XMR, DASH, ZEC, BTG, ETC, DCR, XRP, SOL, and TRX. The list also counts Ethereum (ETH), despite it no longer being mined. While inexact, the true BTC dominance index is yet another tool for gauging the BTC price cycle. The metric showed the peak of BTC dominance around November 20, following a month-long expansion. Peak BTC dominance is seen as the signal for an upcoming altcoin market, as funds seek out more active gains. This time around, the real BTC dominance shrank from a peak above 74% down to 69.7%. At the same time, the index drew attention to other mined coins and tokens, which attempted to break out since early November. Are mined coins still viable? Mined coins have a varied profile, including a series of older privacy coins. Mining is still a highly competitive activity, and even smaller networks have gained from a more industrial approach to mining. Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the most successful mined coins, along with Bitcoin. DOGE is in the top 10, but its success lies more in its meme potential, rather than mining. DOGE mining still depends on the Litecoin hashrate, and it is rare for new DOGE buyers to be interested in mining. Recently, Verge (XVG), an early-stage mined coin, broke out from its lows. XVG rallied from $0.004 to $0.017, returning to 2021 levels after three years of stagnation. BCH, while highly liquid and with wide adoption, still lags at $532, with relatively small breakouts in 2024. LTC is performing similarly, for now lagging around $120 despite expectations of an irrational rally to a higher range. At the same time, LTC remains viable for being one of the most widely transacted assets. Is the altcoin season still viable? The shift in BTC dominance is supposed to signal the altcoin season. However, the recent performance of most assets suggests the rally has stalled and is returning to sideways trading and accumulation. The altcoin season index fell from a peak above 89 points down to 67 points, suggesting BTC is still the leading narrative. Based on the buying signal, BTC is near its peak, but altcoins are also a more uncertain bet. While the crypto market is more liquid than ever, sentiment is also shifting and some of the legacy coins and tokens do not rally as hard as expected. There is currently no consensus on the exact parameters of the altcoin season. Some predictions see the rallies continuing into Q1 2025. For others, the meme supercycle and the Solana ecosystem have absorbed the attention and funds previously going into altcoins. However, mining assets have also shown they are uniquely capable of surviving in the long term. With support from large pools, those coins are rarely phased out, and cannot be easily replaced by newly created tokens.

However, the details are yet to be revealed. The team at CYBRO has always had their eyes on major exchanges from the TOP-15 on CoinMarketCap. They even partnered with a reliable and well-established market maker. Notably, the CYBRO team had been in talks with several other Tier-1 and a few Tier-2 exchanges since September of this year. However, to list on the exchanges, the team needed to achieve certain metrics. Also, the market conditions earlier this year were not the most favorable. This is why the team postponed the listing dates to December. Now, with these metrics met and the market in a better position, the team is ready to move forward. What is CYBRO? CYBRO is a multichain AI-powered yield aggregator. The platform offers convenient and secure web3 investment choices, with AI-driven investment portfolio management, intuitive design, and responsive support. Functioning under a user-centric philosophy, CYBRO focuses on seamless processes, particularly in areas such as portfolio management, onboarding, deposits, and withdrawals. The CYBRO token pre-sale was launched on 5 April 2024 on the BlastUP Launchpad. The public pre-sale was launched on 11 April 2024, and the CYBRO dApp has been live since July 2024. CYBRO’s achievements CYBRO has outdone most of its competition in its presale journey. Aside from the fact that the project raised a staggering $7 million, it is also worth noting that it achieved this feat 20 days ahead of schedule. This growth even helped it garner the attention of mainstream crypto media outlets. Having amassed nearly 19k holders, CYBRO performed remarkably well in gaining early adoption and community support. CYBRO maintains an active community presence on platforms like X , Discord , and Telegram . Regular updates, giveaways, and a token allocation of 5% for user rewards help sustain community involvement and loyalty. Another notable achievement is its security. CYBRO has passed 4 technical audits (Pessimistic and QuillAudits) and 2 KYC checks (CertiK and Assure Decentralized Finance). The project’s commitment to strong security and compliance has helped in its public appeal. CYBRO’s future plans The listing of CYBRO on Gate.io and MEXC marks the beginning of the project’s developments planned for the last quarter of the year. The roadmap for Q4 2024 includes features like staking, token generation events, one-click investment and airdrops. Moreover, the platform is working on improving its interface with updates such as redesigned dashboards and detailed vault pages. These enhancements include the ability to view Total Value Locked (TVL) and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) charts, offering greater transparency and ease of tracking investments.

He will succeed North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who is retiring after a 20-year stint in Congress, including multiple terms leading Republicans on the board. Hill’s Vision The Arkansas Republican announced the news on December 13 via X: “I am humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust in me to lead FinancialCmte as their next Chairman.” The party’s steering committee appointed the lawmaker to the role on Thursday while finalizing committee leadership for the 119th Congress, which begins next year. This position means Hill will be key for legislative initiatives for the crypto industry that will take shape in the coming year. In a formal statement , the 68-year-old highlighted his promise to work closely with Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain in the future. He also mentioned that he’s looking forward to collaborating with President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott on what he described as “a new era of American prosperity’ for all citizens. Crypto Legislative Efforts The Financial Services Committee oversees critical areas, including the Federal Reserve, Wall Street regulations, and the increasingly scrutinized cryptocurrency sector. Hill, who currently chairs the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion subcommittee, has been a vocal proponent of crypto-related legislation. His efforts include championing bills to clarify regulatory jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He has also collaborated with California Representative Maxine Waters on stablecoin legislation, though the bill was ultimately not introduced. Additionally, the Arkansan has pledged to investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he described as an initiative targeting the cryptocurrency sector through politicized debanking. Trump has previously vowed to end the Biden administration’s war on crypto. Following his re-election, reports came out that his transition team was considering various crypto-friendly candidates for key regulatory positions. Since then, the President-elect has appointed David Sacks as AI and Crypto Czar and Paul Atkins as the SEC’s new chairman. Hill will officially take on the leadership role when the new congressional session convenes on January 3, 2025.

LINK is up by 250% from its August lows, while AAVE has surged by 600% from the year-to-date low. So, here are some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy and 3X your cash. Best Crypto Coins To 3X Your Money Some of the best crypto coins to buy and triple your money are the likes of DexBoss, Uniswap (UNI), Raydium (RAY), and Aerodrome (AERO). Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap is one of the best cryptocurrency to buy and 3x your money. It has strong fundamentals as the biggest DEX in the industry. It is also about to launch Unichain, a game-changing layer-1 network. UNI whales are also accumulating the coin. Uniswap price has moved above the important resistance level at $17.13, its highest swing on May 4, and the neckline of the slanted triple-bottom pattern. On the weekly chart, the coin has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also jumped above the 50-week moving average. Odds are that the UNI price will jump to its all-time high of $45, which is about 180% above the current level. A drop below $13, the 23.6% retracement level, will invalidate the bullish view. Uniswap price DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss is another top coin that has a lot of potential. It is an upcoming crypto project currently in its presale that has raised over $142,000 from investors. The developers are building a unique DEX platform that will let users buy and sell tokens across all chain. While the DEX industry is highly saturated, DexBoss hopes that its advanced features will help it to attract users from around the world. Current users are buying the DEBO token at $0.01, much lower than the listing price of $0.0505. You can buy the DEBO token here . Raydium (RAY) Raydium is another top crypto coin to buy and hold. It has emerged as the biggest DEX network in the Solana ecosystem, handling billions of dollars in volume. On the weekly chart, the RAY token bottomed at $0.1660 and then bounced back to a high of $6.60. This was a notable price level since it was along the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. RAY price has also formed a morning star pattern, a popular bullish sign. A bullish breakout will be confirmed if it rises above November’s high of $6.60. If that happens, the next price to watch will be at $17. If this happens, it means that the RAY price will rise by 220% . Raydium Price Chart Aerodrome Finance (AERO) Aerodrome Finance is another tiny coin that could 3x your money. It is a major DEX network that is growing its market share. In just a year’s time, it has become the biggest DEX platform on the Base Blockchain. Aerodrome Finance price has been in a strong bull run and has moved near its all-time high. It has also crossed the key resistance level at $2.0. Aerodrome Price AERO is nearing its all-time high of $2.365. If we measure the distance between the top and its low, we can estimate that the coin has a chance to more than double in the near term.

The unchanged value from the previous day confirms that the market remains firmly in Altcoin Season , a period when a significant majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin (BTC) . This metric provides valuable insights into market dynamics, especially for traders and investors seeking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies relative to Bitcoin over the last 90 days . Altcoin Season : Defined as a period when 75% or more of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season : Occurs when 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin. Scoring Range The index uses a scale of 1 to 100 , with higher scores indicating dominance by altcoins. Exclusions Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded to ensure the index reflects the performance of non-pegged cryptocurrencies. Key Factors Influencing the Current Index 1. Bitcoin’s Consolidation Bitcoin’s recent price stability around key levels has allowed altcoins to gain momentum. 2. Strong Altcoin Performance Several altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Polygon (MATIC) , have seen significant gains due to increased adoption, new developments, and partnerships. 3. Market Diversification Investors are exploring altcoins for higher returns, given Bitcoin’s relatively slower price movements during this period. What Does an Index Value of 66 Indicate? An index score of 66 suggests that: The market is in Altcoin Season , with most altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. The current environment favors altcoin investments, particularly for traders seeking short-term opportunities. Altcoin Market Trends 1. Rising Institutional Interest Institutional investors are increasingly diversifying into altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano , driven by their use cases and staking opportunities. 2. Increased Adoption Altcoins are gaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) , non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and gaming sectors , contributing to their strong performance. 3. Ecosystem Developments Major upgrades and partnerships in altcoin projects continue to attract retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Key Considerations Bitcoin Acts as a store of value and a safe haven asset during periods of market volatility. Typically experiences slower price movements compared to altcoins. Altcoins Offer higher potential returns but come with increased volatility . Provide exposure to specific blockchain innovations, such as smart contracts , scalability solutions , and DeFi protocols . How to Navigate Altcoin Season 1. Diversify Investments Consider spreading investments across promising altcoins rather than focusing on a single asset. 2. Monitor Project Fundamentals Research the utility, development activity, and partnerships of altcoin projects before investing. 3. Stay Updated on Market Trends Keep track of metrics like the Altcoin Season Index and individual coin performance to identify opportunities. 4. Manage Risks Be prepared for volatility by setting stop-loss orders and maintaining a balanced portfolio. Challenges and Risks 1. Market Volatility Altcoins are prone to sharp price fluctuations, requiring careful risk management. 2. Liquidity Concerns Some altcoins may have lower liquidity, leading to challenges in executing large trades. 3. Regulatory Uncertainty Ongoing regulatory developments could impact the long-term viability of certain altcoins. Future Outlook As the Altcoin Season Index remains strong, several trends could shape the market: 1. Continued Altcoin Innovation Projects focused on scalability, security, and interoperability are likely to attract significant interest. 2. Increased Retail Participation The growth of user-friendly platforms and wallets will encourage more retail investors to explore altcoins. 3. Potential Market Corrections While altcoins dominate, market corrections are a possibility, especially if Bitcoin regains momentum. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s steady value of 66 highlights the ongoing dominance of altcoins in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins have captured investor attention with strong performance and innovative developments. For traders and investors, this period presents an opportunity to explore altcoins while staying vigilant about market risks.

This marks a seven-point decline from the previous day but still places the index firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone . This sentiment index, developed by the software platform Alternative , uses a range from 0 to 100 —where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed —to gauge investor sentiment. Despite the slight drop, the persistence in the “Extreme Greed” zone underscores the prevailing bullish sentiment in the crypto market. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides an aggregated measure of market sentiment, capturing the emotional dynamics driving cryptocurrency prices. How It’s Calculated The index derives its value from six weighted factors: Volatility (25%) : Measures price fluctuations to gauge risk levels. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading activity and price momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes trends and engagement across platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Surveys (15%) : Collects direct investor sentiment through polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%) : Evaluates search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. Factors Behind the Decline to 76 1. Slight Market Cooling The crypto market experienced mild pullbacks in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices, leading to a dip in market momentum and sentiment. 2. Social Media Sentiment Online chatter around cryptocurrencies saw a decrease in engagement, impacting the social media factor of the index. 3. Reduced Market Activity A slight decline in trading volumes and transaction activity contributed to the lowered index value. Staying in the ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone Despite the drop, the index’s position in the “Extreme Greed” zone reflects robust market optimism. Key indicators include: 1. Strong Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin continues to command a significant share of the market, maintaining bullish confidence among investors. 2. Institutional Inflows Institutional interest remains high, as evidenced by sustained inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. 3. Retail Enthusiasm Retail investors continue to flock to cryptocurrencies, particularly in the NFT and gaming sectors, contributing to market momentum. Historical Significance of the Extreme Greed Zone Bull Market Indicator Historically, a prolonged stay in the “Extreme Greed” zone has often preceded significant market rallies. Warning of Overheating However, excessive greed can signal market overextension, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Risks and Opportunities in the Current Sentiment Risks Overbought Conditions : Persistently high greed levels may indicate an overheated market, vulnerable to sharp corrections. FOMO-Driven Decisions : Fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to irrational investment behaviors. Opportunities Sustained Bullish Momentum : Continued optimism can drive further price appreciation, especially in leading cryptocurrencies. Entry Points for New Investors : The index serves as a tool to understand market psychology and identify strategic investment opportunities. What to Watch Next? Market Momentum A rebound in trading volumes and stronger price action could push the index back toward its recent highs. Volatility Events Any significant market event, such as regulatory developments or large-scale institutional movements, could shift sentiment drastically. Social Media Trends Increased engagement or viral discussions about cryptocurrencies could reignite excitement, boosting the index. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s drop to 76 signals a slight cooling of market sentiment, though it remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone. This reflects a resilient optimism among crypto investors despite minor pullbacks in price momentum and trading activity. As the market continues to evolve, keeping a close watch on the index can offer valuable insights into investor sentiment, helping traders and investors navigate opportunities and risks effectively.

The statement, reported by Jacob King of cryptocurrency newsletter WhaleWire , suggests a broader approach to digital asset reserves, despite the company’s prior decision against investing in Bitcoin. Microsoft’s Approach to Digital Assets 1. Recent Developments Hood stated that the Microsoft board is actively evaluating digital assets as part of its reserve management strategy. This signals a willingness to explore alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets. 2. Stance on Bitcoin Microsoft shareholders recently rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin, citing concerns over volatility and suitability for corporate reserves. The board reiterated that while Bitcoin remains off the table for now, the company is monitoring cryptocurrency trends closely. Implications of Exploring Other Cryptocurrencies Microsoft’s openness to evaluating digital assets suggests it may be exploring opportunities in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: 1. Diversification of Reserves Exploring a range of cryptocurrencies could provide Microsoft with a diversified and innovative approach to managing corporate reserves. 2. Interest in Emerging Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) , which powers decentralized applications, or stablecoins , known for their price stability, might align with Microsoft’s interests in innovation and reduced volatility. 3. Strategic Opportunities Involvement in cryptocurrencies could strengthen Microsoft’s presence in blockchain technology and digital payments, complementing its existing cloud and enterprise solutions. Microsoft’s Broader Blockchain and Crypto Initiatives 1. Existing Blockchain Ventures Microsoft has been a pioneer in blockchain integration through its Azure Blockchain Service , enabling businesses to deploy decentralized applications efficiently. 2. Decentralized Identity Projects The company has invested in blockchain-based identity solutions, such as the ION Decentralized Identifier project built on the Bitcoin blockchain. 3. Potential Synergy with Web3 As Web3 technologies gain traction, Microsoft’s exploration of cryptocurrencies could align with its broader goals of innovation in decentralized platforms and metaverse applications . Challenges and Considerations 1. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations for cryptocurrencies remains a critical challenge for corporations. Microsoft must ensure compliance with evolving standards for digital assets. 2. Volatility and Risk Management Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, requiring robust risk management frameworks to ensure stability in reserves. 3. Shareholder Sentiment Convincing shareholders, who have expressed reservations about Bitcoin, of the value of other cryptocurrencies will be a crucial step. Expert Opinions on Microsoft’s Move Support for Innovation Proponents argue that exploring cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin showcases Microsoft’s forward-thinking approach and its commitment to innovation. Cautious Optimism Some analysts emphasize the importance of thorough evaluation and strategic alignment to ensure any cryptocurrency involvement benefits Microsoft’s core business objectives. Potential Cryptocurrencies Microsoft Could Consider 1. Ethereum (ETH) Use Case : Powers smart contracts and decentralized applications. Potential Appeal : Aligns with Microsoft’s blockchain initiatives, such as enterprise solutions and decentralized identity. 2. Stablecoins Use Case : Reduce volatility by pegging value to fiat currencies or assets. Potential Appeal : Provides a low-risk entry into the cryptocurrency market. 3. Tokenized Assets Use Case : Represent real-world assets like real estate or stocks on blockchain. Potential Appeal : Offers diversification and innovation without the risks of traditional cryptocurrencies. What’s Next for Microsoft and Crypto? As Microsoft continues evaluating digital assets, several scenarios could unfold: 1. Strategic Partnerships Collaborations with blockchain platforms and cryptocurrency projects could enhance Microsoft’s tech ecosystem. 2. Gradual Adoption Incremental steps, such as accepting cryptocurrencies for certain services or investing in blockchain startups, might precede full-scale adoption. 3. Influence on Corporate Adoption Microsoft’s actions could set a precedent, influencing other corporations to explore digital assets. Conclusion Microsoft’s exploration of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin underscores its commitment to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving digital economy. While shareholder opposition has temporarily sidelined Bitcoin investments, the company’s openness to evaluating other digital assets signals a strategic pivot toward embracing blockchain technology and innovation. As Microsoft continues to refine its approach, its decisions could shape the future of corporate cryptocurrency adoption and reinforce its position as a technology leader.

According to Danylo Hetmantsev , head of the Parliamentary Finance Committee , the legislation will regulate the cryptocurrency market, impose taxes on crypto profits akin to securities, and avoid tax exemptions to curb potential tax evasion. This ambitious move positions Ukraine as a progressive force in cryptocurrency regulation, balancing innovation and fiscal responsibility. Key Elements of the Draft Legislation Ukraine’s forthcoming crypto law is being developed in collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . 1. Legalization of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies will gain legal recognition as a legitimate asset class. Businesses and individuals will be allowed to use and trade cryptocurrencies under a regulated framework. 2. Taxation Policies Crypto profits will be taxed similarly to securities. Tax exemptions will be excluded to prevent misuse and ensure fair taxation. A transparent tax structure will be implemented, simplifying compliance for traders and businesses. 3. Regulatory Oversight The National Bank of Ukraine and relevant government agencies will oversee crypto operations. Comprehensive measures will be introduced to prevent money laundering and financial crime. Ukraine’s Journey Toward Cryptocurrency Legalization Ukraine’s decision to legalize cryptocurrency reflects years of growing interest and activity in the crypto space. Crypto Activity in Ukraine Ukraine consistently ranks high in global crypto adoption indices , with a vibrant community of crypto users, developers, and miners. The country has become a hub for blockchain innovation, attracting startups and international investments. Previous Regulatory Efforts Ukraine passed preliminary laws in 2021 defining cryptocurrencies and providing a foundation for regulation. The current draft law builds on these efforts, addressing gaps and establishing a robust legal framework. Implications of Legalizing Cryptocurrency in Ukraine 1. Economic Growth Legalizing crypto could boost Ukraine’s economy by attracting foreign investments and fostering innovation. Blockchain startups and crypto exchanges may establish operations in Ukraine, creating jobs and driving economic activity. 2. Increased Government Revenue Taxing crypto profits ensures the government benefits financially from the growing crypto market. The exclusion of tax exemptions reduces the risk of evasion and increases revenue transparency. 3. Enhanced Investor Confidence A clear regulatory framework provides legal certainty, encouraging more investors to participate in Ukraine’s crypto market. International businesses may view Ukraine as a favorable destination for blockchain projects. Balancing Innovation and Regulation While Ukraine’s move is progressive, it aims to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and maintaining fiscal discipline. Opportunities Technological Advancement : Recognizing crypto legally can accelerate blockchain-based solutions across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Market Expansion : Legalization could integrate Ukraine into the global crypto economy, enhancing its competitiveness. Challenges Tax Compliance : Ensuring that individuals and businesses adhere to the tax rules may require robust enforcement mechanisms. Regulatory Complexity : Balancing innovation with oversight demands meticulous policy design. Market Volatility : The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies poses risks for retail investors. Comparison with Global Crypto Policies Ukraine’s approach mirrors trends in other nations: European Union The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a unified framework for member states, emphasizing investor protection and market stability. United States The U.S. is developing clearer rules, though debates around the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities persist. El Salvador The first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador contrasts with Ukraine by offering tax exemptions for crypto gains. What Lies Ahead for Ukraine’s Crypto Market? Adoption Acceleration Legalization is expected to increase crypto adoption among businesses and individuals, making Ukraine a key player in the digital economy. Partnership Opportunities Collaborations between Ukrainian businesses and global crypto firms could flourish under the new regulatory regime. Educational Initiatives Awareness campaigns and educational programs will be crucial to ensure smooth integration of cryptocurrency into everyday financial activities. Conclusion Ukraine’s plan to legalize cryptocurrency by 2025 represents a landmark moment for the country’s financial and technological landscape. By crafting a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, taxation, and innovation, Ukraine is setting the stage to become a major player in the global crypto market. While challenges remain, the proposed legislation’s comprehensive approach ensures a balanced integration of cryptocurrency into Ukraine’s economy. As the world watches, Ukraine’s efforts may serve as a model for countries navigating the complexities of crypto regulation.

According to data from Glassnode reported by CoinDesk , Bitcoin’s price is closing in on $100,000 , with exchange balances falling to a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC . Institutional Activity Boosts Bitcoin’s Market Value Institutional investors have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s latest surge. Recent data highlights: Key Metrics 12,500 BTC Withdrawn on Dec. 11 : These transactions, worth $1.3 billion , accounted for significant outflows from exchanges, with half of them originating from Coinbase . 200,000 BTC Withdrawn Since the U.S. Election : This activity reflects sustained institutional interest in holding Bitcoin off-exchange. Impact on Exchange Balances Bitcoin exchange balances now sit at a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC , underscoring reduced availability of the asset for trading. The $2 Trillion Milestone: What It Means A $2 trillion market cap represents a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s evolution, signaling: 1. Institutional Validation With companies like BlackRock and Fidelity embracing Bitcoin through ETFs and direct holdings, institutional trust in the asset has grown significantly. Institutional buying is a driving force behind the consistent price surge and exchange outflows. 2. Competitive Hedge Against Gold Bitcoin continues to position itself as “digital gold,” challenging gold’s $17 trillion market cap. The outflows signify a shift in how investors allocate assets for value storage. 3. Broader Market Adoption Increased adoption by institutional players reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a mainstream financial instrument. Exchange Outflows: A Game Changer for Bitcoin Supply Decreasing Supply on Exchanges The sustained withdrawals highlight a growing trend of long-term holding , with investors moving their BTC to: Cold Storage Wallets : Enhancing security and signaling confidence in long-term price appreciation. Custodial Services : Institutions often use specialized services for safe storage of assets. Supply Squeeze Dynamics The reduction in available supply on exchanges could lead to price surges as demand outpaces availability. A smaller tradable supply amplifies market reactions to changes in buying pressure. Challenges to Sustaining the $2 Trillion Market Cap While Bitcoin’s trajectory remains bullish, maintaining its momentum faces potential hurdles: 1. Resistance at $100,000 Psychological resistance at this milestone could trigger profit-taking, leading to short-term corrections. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter crypto regulations in key markets, including the U.S. and Europe, may introduce additional challenges. 3. Volatility Concerns While institutional interest reduces speculative volatility, Bitcoin’s price swings remain a concern for risk-averse investors. What’s Driving Institutional Demand? Several factors contribute to the increasing interest from institutional investors: 1. Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate. 2. Mainstream Financial Products Spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial services have made it easier for institutions to enter the crypto market. 3. Decentralization and Security Bitcoin’s decentralized network offers a unique value proposition in an era of financial uncertainty. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin’s Role in Global Finance Bitcoin’s journey toward a $2 trillion market cap is not just a milestone for the cryptocurrency itself but also a reflection of the broader transformation in global finance. 1. Decentralized Economy Bitcoin is at the forefront of a decentralized financial system, offering alternatives to traditional monetary policies. 2. Institutional Legitimacy The involvement of major players like BlackRock , Tesla , and Fidelity validates Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. 3. Inspiration for Other Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin’s success paves the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based assets, from Ethereum to newer innovations in DeFi and Web3. Conclusion Bitcoin’s march toward a $2 trillion market cap underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial asset. Institutional buying, reflected in significant outflows from exchanges and declining balances, highlights confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As Bitcoin nears the $100,000 milestone , the market remains optimistic about its potential to disrupt traditional finance. However, investors should remain cautious, given potential regulatory and market resistance challenges.

Crypto and blockchain developers account for less than 0.1% of this forecast, but established devs are increasing exponentially. Electric Capital ’s just-published Developer Report shows this data , evidencing how early the crypto and blockchain industry still is. According to the report, 23,613 monthly active developers exist, of which 18,511 were focused on a single blockchain. Notably, the current population of crypto developers has grown by 3% in the last three years. Yet, it has dropped 7% year over year since 2023 and saw a 23% drop since 2022’s bear market start. This status could suggest the crypto and blockchain industry could still be in even earlier stages than some enthusiasts imagined. If this proves to be true, the current state of the industry represents a lifetime opportunity for pioneer developers innovating. Total monthly active developers in crypto and blockchain. Source: Electric Capital United States, India, Ethereum, and Solana dominate among crypto developers in 2024 Overall, 18.8% of all blockchain developers are in the United States, followed by India with 11.7%. The United Kingdom is the third most dominant country, with only 4.3%, evidencing the relevancy of the first two countries. At the same time, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) dominate among the blockchains with more full-time and total crypto developers. Ethereum has 6,244 total devs, of which 2,181 work full-time, committing code at least 10 days per month. Meanwhile, Solana has 3,201 developers, out of which 582 work full-time. Interestingly, however, the higher growth among blockchain developers in 2024 was from what Electric Capital called “established devs.” These are developers who have worked and contributed for more than two years with open-source crypto projects. According to the report, there were 11,243 established devs in the industry by November 2024, a 27% growth year over year and a 65% growth in the past two years. Of these 11,243, 668 are working with Ethereum and 141 with Solana. However, 1,151 (10%) are developing for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stack, which includes other composable blockchains. On the other hand, Solana was the blockchain that attracted the highest number of new developers in 2024. According to the Developer Report, 7,625 new developers explored Solana at one point this year. Solana was the #1 ecosystem for new devs in 2024. Source: Electric Capital Development opportunity in crypto and blockchain As things develop, crypto’s ability to cross the chasm, reaching a broader audience, could bring more developers to the industry. Nevertheless, the significantly small share of the world’s developer population building for blockchain-related projects highlights the growth opportunity for the market in the following years. Some analysts expect 2025 to be “ the mother of all bull markets ” and “ the biggest crypto bull run ever .” Alex Becker and other experts have pointed out “utility altcoins” as the potential “ easiest and surest ” play in crypto. If these predictions become true, we could see a massive inflow of developers into the ecosystem, building utility projects and capitalizing from this lifetime opportunity.

37587759,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109567,1734098131,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Exchange Balances Hit Seven-Year Low at 2.8M, Signaling Institutional Demand",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-exchange-balances-7-year-low/,"Bitcoin Exchange Balances Hit Seven-Year Low at 2.8M, Signaling Institutional Demand Bitcoin exchange balances have plummeted to their lowest levels in seven years, with just 2.8 million BTC remaining on trading platforms, according to data from Glassnode cited by CoinDesk . The sharp decline is attributed to institutional buying , as significant outflows have occurred since the U.S. election. Institutional Buying Behind Exchange Outflows Recent Trends Outflows of Over $10 Million : High-value Bitcoin transactions are leaving exchanges at an unprecedented pace, suggesting accumulation by institutions. 200,000 BTC Withdrawn : Nearly 200,000 BTC have exited exchanges recently, with December 11 alone seeing 12,500 BTC withdrawn. Major Platforms Affected Coinbase Leads Withdrawals : Nearly half of the BTC withdrawn on Dec. 11 came from Coinbase, a favored platform among institutional investors. Why Exchange Balances Are Declining 1. Long-Term Storage The outflows indicate that investors are moving Bitcoin to cold storage or self-custodial wallets, reflecting long-term holding strategies. 2. Institutional Demand The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate adoption has fueled demand among institutions. BlackRock’s Spot ETF : Contributing to increased institutional interest and direct custody over assets. 3. Reduced Selling Pressure Lower exchange balances mean reduced availability of Bitcoin for trading, potentially reducing selling pressure and supporting higher prices. Market Implications of Reduced Exchange Balances 1. Supply Squeeze As Bitcoin exits exchanges, its circulating supply on trading platforms diminishes, potentially driving prices higher as demand outpaces supply. 2. Increased Price Volatility With fewer coins available for trading, price swings may become more pronounced, especially during periods of high demand. 3. Confidence in Long-Term Value The shift to long-term storage signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Challenges Amid Declining Exchange Balances While the reduction in exchange balances signals strong investor sentiment, it also comes with challenges: Sustainability of $2 Trillion Market Cap : Bitcoin has struggled to maintain a $2 trillion market cap despite institutional support. Psychological Resistance at $100,000 : The asset faces significant resistance at the $100,000 price level, with recent pullbacks dampening bullish momentum. Institutional Investors Driving the Shift ETFs and Corporate Adoption The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries adopting BTC are key drivers: BlackRock, Fidelity, and Others : Major firms are buying Bitcoin directly, reducing reliance on exchanges. Tesla’s Holdings : Corporate examples like Tesla underline the trend of holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Macro-Economic Drivers Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation. Decentralization Appeal : Institutions value Bitcoin’s decentralized nature in uncertain economic times. What This Means for Retail Investors For retail investors, declining exchange balances suggest: Limited Opportunities to Buy : Reduced supply may make it harder to acquire Bitcoin at current levels. Potential for Price Surges : Supply constraints could lead to higher prices, benefiting early adopters. Need for Strategic Holding : Investors should consider long-term storage solutions to secure their holdings. Conclusion The decline in Bitcoin exchange balances to a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC underscores the growing influence of institutional demand on the cryptocurrency market. While this trend signals confidence in Bitcoin’s future, it also highlights challenges in sustaining key market milestones like the $2 trillion market cap and $100,000 price level . As Bitcoin continues to evolve as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty, its diminishing supply on exchanges may lead to increased volatility and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors.

In a recent analysis, Datascope affirmed that Bitcoin’s price trajectory remains positive, with no signs of the market reaching its peak. However, critical indicators suggest caution as prices approach potential correction zones. Key Insights from CryptoQuant’s Analysis Datascope’s insights hinge on the interplay between Bitcoin’s 30-day bull-bear market cycle moving average and its 365-day moving average : 1. Bull Market Confirmation Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish momentum as long as the 30-day moving average (short-term) stays above the 365-day moving average (long-term) . The gap between these averages serves as a key signal for the market’s direction. 2. Stronger Bullish Signal Pending A more definitive bullish signal would emerge if the 30-day average crosses above the 365-day average , further solidifying the uptrend. 3. Potential Correction Zones While the long-term outlook remains positive, short-term corrections are possible. Investors are advised to stay cautious as prices test resistance levels. The Current State of Bitcoin’s Bull Market Positive Momentum Bitcoin’s sustained price growth underscores the strength of its current bull run. Market trends, coupled with institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, continue to support the asset’s upward trajectory. Unreached Peak CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates that Bitcoin has not yet reached its peak, suggesting room for further growth before a significant market reversal. Bull-Bear Cycle Dynamics The relationship between short- and long-term moving averages is critical for understanding Bitcoin’s market phases. A consistent gap in favor of the 30-day average reflects sustained bullish momentum. Investor Considerations in the Current Market 1. Short-Term Volatility Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations as Bitcoin approaches resistance levels. Corrections are a natural part of bull markets and can provide buying opportunities. 2. Long-Term Outlook The long-term moving average indicates robust market health, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a store of value and investment asset. 3. Risk Management Set stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Diversify portfolios to balance exposure to Bitcoin and other assets. Factors Supporting Bitcoin’s Bull Market 1. Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recently surpassed its gold counterpart in AUM, signaling growing institutional interest. Major corporations continue to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. 2. Macro-Economic Environment Inflation concerns and a weakening dollar drive demand for Bitcoin as a hedge. Central banks’ exploration of digital currencies boosts the credibility of blockchain-based assets. 3. Technological Advancements Enhancements in Bitcoin infrastructure, such as Lightning Network adoption, improve scalability and usability. Potential Risks to the Bull Market 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter crypto regulations in key markets could impact institutional and retail participation. 2. Market Saturation Over-leveraged positions among traders could exacerbate corrections. 3. External Shocks Macro-economic events, such as geopolitical instability or unexpected monetary policy changes, could trigger short-term volatility. Conclusion CryptoQuant’s analysis confirms that Bitcoin’s bull market remains intact, with its peak still on the horizon. The interplay between short- and long-term moving averages highlights sustained positive momentum, though investors should remain cautious as the market approaches potential correction zones. As the crypto ecosystem evolves and adoption grows, Bitcoin continues to cement its status as a leading asset in the financial landscape. For investors, understanding the nuances of bull-bear cycles and market signals can provide a significant edge in navigating this dynamic environment.

37587793,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109563,1734098253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Australia’s AMP Allocates $27M in Bitcoin for Retirement Fund,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amp-bitcoin-retirement-fund-investment/,"Australia’s AMP Allocates $27M in Bitcoin for Retirement Fund In a groundbreaking move, Australian financial giant AMP has invested $27 million in Bitcoin (BTC) through its retirement fund. The firm, which manages assets worth $56 billion , is among the first in Australia to include Bitcoin in its portfolio for retirement savings. This development, reported by Financial Review , highlights a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies despite skepticism from other major Australian funds. AMP’s Bold Move into Bitcoin AMP’s decision to allocate part of its retirement fund to Bitcoin reflects a strategic shift toward diversifying its investment portfolio. Amount Invested : $27 million Purpose : Diversification and potential long-term growth Context : AMP’s move is part of a broader global trend where financial institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a viable asset class. This investment signifies confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to act as a hedge against inflation and an opportunity for high returns in the evolving financial landscape. Australia’s Cautious Crypto Landscape While AMP’s foray into Bitcoin is noteworthy, it contrasts sharply with the stance of other major Australian funds, many of which remain reluctant to invest in cryptocurrencies. Why Are Other Funds Hesitant? Volatility Concerns : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations make it a risky asset for retirement funds, which typically prioritize stability. Regulatory Uncertainty : Lack of clear cryptocurrency regulations in Australia adds an element of risk for institutional investors. Conservative Investment Strategies : Many funds adhere to traditional investment models, avoiding emerging asset classes like crypto. The Case for Bitcoin in Retirement Funds AMP’s investment aligns with a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset. Key Benefits of Bitcoin Investment Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a hedge against inflation, much like gold. Diversification : Adding Bitcoin to a retirement portfolio can reduce risk by diversifying across asset classes. High Growth Potential : Bitcoin has historically delivered outsized returns compared to traditional assets. AMP’s Long-Term Vision By investing in Bitcoin, AMP demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to retirement fund management. The firm acknowledges Bitcoin’s volatility but emphasizes its long-term growth potential. Bitcoin and the Global Pension Industry AMP’s investment echoes similar moves in the global financial sector: United States : Fidelity Investments offers Bitcoin exposure for retirement accounts through its Digital Assets platform. Europe : Pension funds in Switzerland and the Netherlands have begun exploring crypto investments. These developments highlight a gradual shift in how institutional investors perceive cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified portfolio. Challenges and Risks Despite its potential, investing in Bitcoin through retirement funds carries challenges: Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price swings could lead to significant short-term losses. Regulatory Hurdles : Ongoing changes in crypto regulations may affect institutional adoption. Liquidity Concerns : Converting Bitcoin to cash can be more complex than traditional assets. AMP’s move also raises questions about the fiduciary responsibilities of retirement fund managers, especially in a market as unpredictable as cryptocurrency. How Does AMP’s Investment Compare Globally? AMP’s $27M Bitcoin allocation is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption. Global Context : While AMP is a pioneer in Australia, firms like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have already integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Emerging Trend : Pension funds globally are starting to view Bitcoin as an alternative investment, driven by its resilience and growing acceptance. Conclusion AMP’s decision to invest $27 million in Bitcoin for its retirement fund is a bold step that sets it apart from other major Australian funds. While the move reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s potential, it also underscores the challenges of navigating a volatile and emerging asset class. As institutional interest in cryptocurrency grows globally, AMP’s investment may encourage other Australian funds to reconsider their stance. For now, AMP’s pioneering approach positions it as a forward-thinking leader in Australia’s financial landscape.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) recently unveiled draft rules aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures for high-risk sectors, including cryptocurrency. This initiative comes at a pivotal time, with the crypto market booming and concerns about illicit activities on the rise. The draft rules focus on stricter customer verification, enhanced transaction reporting, and adherence to international compliance standards like the travel rule . Public consultation on these proposals is open until February 14, 2025 , allowing industry stakeholders to weigh in on the future of crypto regulation in Australia. Why Stricter Crypto Regulations Are Necessary Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, offering faster, cheaper, and borderless transactions. However, their decentralized and pseudonymous nature also makes them attractive to bad actors. In recent years, the use of digital currencies for money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing has raised alarms globally. In Australia, AUSTRAC’s proposed regulations aim to: Mitigate Financial Crime : Strengthen safeguards against money laundering and terrorism financing through the crypto sector. Protect Market Integrity : Build trust in Australia’s rapidly expanding digital asset market. Align with Global Standards : Ensure compliance with international frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. Key Provisions of the Proposed Rules The draft rules outline specific measures to enhance oversight and accountability in the cryptocurrency sector. Here are the key highlights: 1. Stricter Customer Verification Requirements Businesses must implement robust know-your-customer (KYC) processes to verify the identities of individuals and entities transacting in digital currencies. Enhanced measures may include cross-referencing government-issued IDs, biometric checks, and proof of address. 2. Comprehensive Reporting Obligations Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers will need to file detailed transaction reports with AUSTRAC. Suspicious transaction reporting will become mandatory, helping authorities identify and act against potential threats. 3. Compliance with the Travel Rule The travel rule requires cryptocurrency businesses to share customer information when transferring funds across platforms. This ensures that key details, such as the sender’s and receiver’s information, are recorded and accessible. The Global Context of Crypto Regulation Australia’s move aligns with a growing international trend toward stricter crypto oversight. United States The U.S. has introduced several legislative measures to monitor crypto transactions, focusing on AML and CTF compliance. European Union The EU has adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) , setting a clear framework for digital assets while prioritizing consumer protection and market stability. FATF Standards The FATF has provided detailed guidelines on crypto compliance, urging nations to implement robust mechanisms to prevent illicit activities. Australia’s proposed regulations are in line with these international efforts, reflecting the country’s proactive stance on digital asset governance. Australia’s Growing Cryptocurrency Market Australia has emerged as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market, with increasing adoption among individuals and institutions. Factors driving this growth include: 1. High Adoption Rates A 2024 survey revealed that nearly 20% of Australians own cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most popular choices. 2. Thriving Crypto Startups Cities like Sydney and Melbourne have become hubs for blockchain innovation, hosting startups focused on DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and tokenized assets. 3. Institutional Interest Major financial institutions in Australia are exploring crypto-related services, such as custody solutions and crypto-backed loans. With such rapid growth, the need for a robust regulatory framework has become more pressing than ever. Benefits of Stricter Oversight The proposed regulations are expected to bring several advantages for the crypto industry and its stakeholders: 1. Enhanced Security Stricter verification processes will help prevent fraud and unauthorized access. 2. Increased Trust Regulatory compliance can enhance consumer and investor confidence in the crypto sector. 3. Alignment with Global Norms By adhering to international standards, Australian crypto businesses can gain a competitive edge in the global market. 4. Better Consumer Protection Improved oversight ensures that users are safeguarded against scams and financial malpractice. Challenges Facing the Crypto Sector While the benefits are clear, implementing these regulations may pose challenges: 1. Higher Compliance Costs Crypto businesses, especially startups, may face financial strain in meeting stringent regulatory requirements. 2. Operational Complexity Enhanced reporting and verification measures could increase administrative burdens. 3. Privacy Concerns Critics argue that stricter regulations might compromise user anonymity, a core feature of cryptocurrencies. 4. Risk of Over-Regulation Overly rigid policies could stifle innovation and deter businesses from entering the market. Public Consultation: A Collaborative Approach AUSTRAC has invited feedback from industry stakeholders, ensuring that the final regulations are practical and balanced. Deadline : February 14, 2025 Key Participants : Crypto exchanges, blockchain startups, financial institutions, and consumer advocacy groups. This inclusive approach demonstrates AUSTRAC’s commitment to fostering a thriving yet secure cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Future of Cryptocurrency in Australia Australia’s proactive stance on crypto regulation could set a benchmark for other nations. By addressing financial crime risks while supporting innovation, the country can position itself as a global leader in the digital asset space. Opportunities for Growth Regulated Innovation : Clear rules encourage the development of innovative blockchain solutions. Attracting Global Talent : A secure and transparent crypto market could draw talent and investment from around the world. Conclusion Australia’s proposed regulations mark a significant step toward creating a secure and trustworthy cryptocurrency ecosystem. By targeting anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, AUSTRAC aims to strike a balance between innovation and security. As the consultation period progresses, it will be crucial for industry stakeholders to collaborate and provide input, ensuring that the final regulations are both effective and equitable. With these measures, Australia is poised to become a leader in the global effort to integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly.

This milestone signals a significant shift in investor sentiment, with digital assets like Bitcoin gaining momentum over traditional safe-haven assets such as gold. A Changing Landscape for Asset Allocation Ju shared the insights on X , highlighting the growing appeal of Bitcoin among savvy investors. Despite gold’s massive $17 trillion market capitalization compared to Bitcoin’s $2 trillion , the rising AUM for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF underscores a changing perspective on wealth preservation and growth. Bitcoin vs. Gold: A New Frontier Gold’s Legacy : Long considered a reliable store of value, gold has maintained its dominance for centuries. Bitcoin’s Appeal : As a digital alternative, Bitcoin offers decentralization, scarcity, and the potential for exponential returns. Ju emphasized that investing in Bitcoin over gold represents a forward-looking decision , aligning with technological advancements and evolving market dynamics. Key Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Momentum Several elements contribute to Bitcoin’s increasing popularity as an investment asset: 1. Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF reflects growing acceptance of digital assets among institutional investors. A regulated ETF provides traditional investors with a secure and familiar way to gain Bitcoin exposure. 2. Superior Performance Bitcoin’s price performance has outpaced gold over the past decade, offering significantly higher returns. With Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing demand, its long-term growth potential remains strong. 3. Digital Transformation The global shift toward digital finance has boosted Bitcoin’s relevance. Investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation in an increasingly digital economy. Implications of the Shift The overtaking of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin counterpart carries profound implications: 1. Investor Preferences The shift indicates a growing willingness among investors to diversify into digital assets. Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a complement, if not a replacement, for traditional safe-haven assets. 2. Competitive Market Dynamics Gold remains a significant asset, but Bitcoin’s rise introduces competition for capital allocation. The debate between gold and Bitcoin reflects broader shifts in market behavior and generational preferences. 3. Market Confidence in Bitcoin ETFs The success of Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s could encourage further product innovation and adoption. It highlights the maturity of the cryptocurrency market as a viable investment space. Looking Ahead: The Case for Bitcoin Ju’s remarks underline the growing momentum behind Bitcoin and its potential to redefine traditional asset classes: Market Expansion : As institutional interest grows, Bitcoin’s market cap could narrow the gap with gold. Technological Relevance : Bitcoin’s role as the foundation of the digital asset ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for future growth. Strategic Asset Allocation : For investors, incorporating Bitcoin represents a hedge against economic uncertainty and a bet on innovation. Conclusion The surpassing of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin ETF is a pivotal moment in the financial markets. It signifies not just Bitcoin’s rising prominence but also a broader shift in investor sentiment toward digital assets. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, its potential to challenge traditional safe-haven assets like gold becomes increasingly evident. For forward-looking investors, Bitcoin offers a compelling case as the asset of the future.

Meanwhile, in China, Alipay, the country’s leading payment platform, has drawn attention by featuring advertisements promoting Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a subtle yet intriguing shift in a market known for its strict anti-crypto stance. AMP’s $27 Million Bitcoin Investment Marks a Turning Point for Australian Superannuation Funds AMP, one of Australia's leading superannuation funds, has become the first major fund in the country to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). With a $27 million allocation to the digital asset in May 2024, AMP has joined the global trend of institutional investors exploring Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier. The $27 million investment represents a modest 0.05% of AMP’s total $57 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Financial Review , the fund acquired Bitcoin during its price range of $60,000 to $70,000, positioning itself to benefit from the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. AMP's move comes amid Bitcoin’s historic price rally, fueled by a surge in market sentiment following Donald Trump’s electoral victory in November 2024. Bitcoin recently breached the $100,000 milestone, signaling unprecedented confidence among market participants. Despite this bold move, other Australian superannuation funds remain hesitant to follow suit, citing the nascent asset class's volatility and regulatory uncertainty as primary concerns. AMP’s investment aligns with a broader global trend of pension funds integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios to capitalize on its growth potential and hedging properties. Institutional interest in Bitcoin has surged in recent years, with pension funds worldwide seeking to diversify holdings and enhance returns amid persistently low yields in traditional assets. In July 2024, Michigan’s state pension fund disclosed a $6.6-million exposure to Bitcoin through ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marked one of the first instances of a US state pension fund actively participating in the Bitcoin market. South Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS), the world’s third-largest public pension fund, followed in August with the acquisition of 24,500 MicroStrategy shares. Market participants view investments in MicroStrategy as a leveraged Bitcoin play due to the company’s significant Bitcoin holdings, financed through convertible notes and equity offerings. The trend has continued to gain momentum across regions. In October, Florida’s Chief Financial Officer, Jimmy Patronis, advocated for the state’s public pension funds to explore Bitcoin investments. More recently, United Kingdom-based pension manager Cartwright announced a 3% allocation to Bitcoin in November. Sam Roberts, Cartwright’s director of investment consulting, lauded Bitcoin’s “unique asymmetric risk-return profile” as a compelling reason for the allocation. Roberts expressed optimism that the move would inspire other institutional investors in the UK to diversify into Bitcoin, setting a precedent for broader adoption. AMP’s decision to invest in Bitcoin suggests a willingness to embrace innovative asset classes while maintaining a conservative allocation. By integrating Bitcoin into its portfolio, the fund aims to benefit from the cryptocurrency's status as a hedge against inflation and its potential for outsized returns. The timing of the investment also demonstrates AMP’s strategic foresight. Bitcoin’s continued appreciation and the global recognition of its role in a diversified portfolio have positioned AMP as a trailblazer among Australian superannuation funds. Skepticism Persists in Australia Despite AMP’s bold move, the Australian superannuation industry remains largely cautious toward Bitcoin. Many funds view the asset as too volatile and speculative to fit within their long-term investment strategies. This skepticism is a stark contrast to the growing interest seen in regions like the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, where pension funds are beginning to embrace Bitcoin as a legitimate investment option. AMP’s groundbreaking $27 million investment in Bitcoin marks a significant milestone for institutional adoption in Australia. While other superannuation funds may be hesitant to follow, AMP’s move could set the stage for a broader shift in the investment strategies of Australian pension funds. As Bitcoin continues to break records and solidify its role as a key asset in institutional portfolios, AMP’s foray into the cryptocurrency market could prove to be a transformative moment for the superannuation industry. Whether this sparks a trend among other funds remains to be seen, but the potential for Bitcoin to reshape institutional investing is undeniable. Alipay’s Bitcoin ETF Ads Stir Crypto Buzz in Mainland China Amid Strict Regulations Alipay, China’s largest payment platform with over 1 billion users, has caused a stir in the crypto community after reportedly featuring advertisements related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on its platform. According to reports from Sina Finance, mainland Chinese users recently saw promotional ads for spot Bitcoin ETFs on their Alipay homepages, marking a notable development in the country’s otherwise stringent approach to digital assets. The advertisements reportedly promoted cryptocurrency investments with messages such as: “Global investment, cryptocurrency soaring, 10 yuan minimum investment, get on board now.” The ads directed users to Huabao Overseas Technology C (QDII-FOF-LOF), a fund that reportedly offers indirect exposure to Coinbase stock and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. While these ads signal an unexpected softening toward crypto-related services, they come with notable restrictions. Mainland China users are currently limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000 Chinese yuan ($137) worth of the fund’s shares daily, with a minimum investment threshold of 10 yuan ($1.40). Prominent market observer Colin Wu noted on X that Huabao Technology and other similar funds advertising cryptocurrency are leveraging the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) structure. This regulatory framework allows Chinese investors to access overseas investments indirectly. Crypto Ads Raise Eyebrows The first reports of crypto-related ads on Alipay emerged on Dec. 11, sparking widespread discussion in the Chinese blockchain community. Some users speculated that this could be a precursor to enabling direct Bitcoin purchases through Alipay, a move that would represent a seismic shift in China’s crypto policy. However, the appearance of these ads may not signal an official endorsement from Alipay’s parent company, Ant Financial Services Group. Yifan He, CEO of Chinese blockchain firm Red Date Technology, suggested that the ads might have been published by third parties exploiting regulatory loopholes. “It doesn’t mean anything. They will disappear soon,” He stated, downplaying the significance of the ads. China has long maintained a strict anti-crypto stance, with Alipay itself banning all Bitcoin-related transactions in 2019. This ban aligned with the Chinese government’s broader crackdown on cryptocurrencies, which began with the prohibition of crypto exchanges in 2017 and escalated with an interdepartmental clampdown in 2021. Despite these measures, Chinese authorities have repeatedly emphasized that crypto assets are considered legal property protected under law. The crypto ads on Alipay have reignited speculation about a potential policy shift in China. Earlier this year, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz fueled rumors that China might lift its crypto ban amid the ongoing 2024 bull market. However, skepticism remains high, as the Chinese government has shown no official signs of reversing its restrictive crypto policies. Bloomberg analyst Jack Wang noted in April that Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs remain unavailable to mainland Chinese investors, reinforcing the divide between the two jurisdictions. Nevertheless, smaller developments, such as Nano Labs—a Hangzhou-based crypto mining-chip designer—accepting Bitcoin as payment via Coinbase, suggest a nuanced shift in attitudes toward digital assets. The appearance of Bitcoin ETF ads on Alipay is a significant moment for the global crypto industry, highlighting both the growing demand for digital assets and the creative strategies used to navigate restrictive regulatory environments. While these ads may not reflect an official policy change, they demonstrate the potential for cryptocurrency-related services to gain traction in markets traditionally hostile to digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-13 13:59:26

In a lighthearted remark, Alipay stated: “Just because you saw a banana ad on X, it doesn’t mean you can buy bananas on X!” Alipay’s Stance on Cryptocurrencies Alipay has consistently maintained a cautious approach toward cryptocurrencies, in line with China’s stringent regulatory framework. Key Policies Prohibition on Crypto Transactions : Alipay prohibits the use of its platform for cryptocurrency-related activities, including trading and purchases. Regulatory Compliance : The payment giant operates under the oversight of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) , which has banned cryptocurrency transactions to prevent financial risks. Anti-Fraud Measures : Alipay actively monitors and flags suspicious activities to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) laws. The Role of Social Media in Spreading Rumors The rapid spread of false information highlights the challenges companies face in the digital age. Justin Sun’s Banana Ad The viral ad featuring Tron’s Justin Sun humorously eating a banana inadvertently fueled speculation. Social media users drew baseless connections between the ad and Alipay’s alleged involvement in cryptocurrency transactions. Alipay’s Proactive Response By swiftly addressing the rumors, Alipay reinforced its commitment to transparency and regulatory adherence while dispelling misinformation. Cryptocurrency Regulations in China Alipay’s strict stance reflects China’s broader regulatory environment, which has taken a hard line on cryptocurrency activities: 1. Ban on Crypto Trading and Mining The Chinese government has outlawed cryptocurrency trading and mining to prevent financial instability. 2. Promotion of the Digital Yuan China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan , has been heavily promoted as an alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies. 3. Impact on Businesses Companies operating in China must comply with these regulations, avoiding any association with banned crypto activities. Industry Reactions The denial by Alipay underscores a broader industry trend of navigating misinformation and aligning with regulations: Reaffirming Compliance : Companies like Alipay are doubling down on transparency to maintain user trust. Managing Perceptions : False rumors can impact brand reputation, prompting swift responses from businesses. Balancing Innovation and Compliance : Firms in fintech and payments are exploring blockchain technologies while staying within regulatory boundaries. Conclusion Alipay’s firm denial of cryptocurrency purchase rumors highlights its commitment to compliance and its proactive approach to managing misinformation. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, companies like Alipay must balance innovation with strict adherence to regulatory frameworks. For users and businesses alike, the incident serves as a reminder to verify information and avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions from viral content.

Over the past week, the native token of the decentralized oracle network posted a 21% gain. As a result, LINK has emerged as one of the best-performing altcoins in recent weeks. Whale and Shark Gobble Up LINK The surge is largely fueled by a significant increase in whale and shark accumulation, according to the latest analysis by Santiment. Over the past two months, wallets holding 100K or more LINK have added 5.69 million tokens, while wallets with less than 100K LINK have reduced their positions by 5.67 million tokens. Historically, such patterns – where large wallets accumulate coins from impatient or panicked retail traders – often signal future growth. However, the success of Chainlink and other large-cap altcoins still hinges on Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its momentum, the on-chain crypto analytic platform said in its findings . If Bitcoin continues to hold steady, there are strong indications that patient holders of LINK will see long-term rewards. The recent surge in the price can also be attributed, in part, to World Liberty Financial’s $1 million purchase of LINK, increasing its holdings to $2 million. Backed by the Trump family, the platform also holds significant amounts of Aave’s AAVE , with LINK now being its fourth-largest holding after Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT). World Liberty Financial uses Chainlink’s services for essential pricing data and cross-chain interoperability. LINK Futures OI Reaches All-Time High This surge in value also coincided with a notable increase in Futures Open Interest (OI). According to Glassnode, this figure has hit an all-time high of $770.27 million, signaling a massive uptick in trading activity. There’s also been a significant profit-taking in the spot market, with $35.57 million in realized profits, making it the second-largest profit-taking event of the year, behind only February 11’s $40.39 million. This activity was predominantly driven by speculative market participants, with 15.3% of profits taken by ultra-short-term holders (1d-1w) and 22.5% by short-term holders (3-6m). Despite the profit-taking, LINK’s fundamentals are showing positive signs, with active addresses trending higher, signaling continued interest and potential for future growth, though still below the 2021 peak.

Table of Contents Whales go on buying spree, DOGE ready for next leg up Intel Markets AI trading bot sets it apart from the competition Cardano forecasted to reach $6 based on previous cycle In Conclusion Whales are on the move again as positive sentiment gradually returns to the market. They have accumulated 210 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens as they eye a potential rally to $0.5. These whales have also shown interest in an AI coin called Intel Markets (INTL) . Intel Markets has dominated this bull market, increasing by more than 600% while raising over $4.1 million in funding. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) could soar to $6. An analyst believes the altcoin is following its 2021 price movement. Whales go on buying spree, DOGE ready for next leg up Despite the ongoing consolidation, Dogecoin whales are not backing out. They have bought over 210 million DOGE during this period, per Ali Charts. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin crypto is trading between $0.3696 and $0.4758 on the weekly level. DOGE has dipped by 4.8% in the past week. Nevertheless, analysts believe a rally could occur soon. Crypto Genos forecasts the value of the Dogecoin token could rally to $0.5 in the coming weeks. Another analyst called Cantonese Cat told their followers the memecoin is ready for the next move up. The analyst posted a chart comparing the Dogecoin price movement this year to that of 2021. If this pattern plays out, the value of DOGE could pump to $3.5 soon and $22.5 in the long run. However, the Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) are showing sell signs which is a bearish signal. You might also like: Dogecoin attracts investors as experts think Intel Markets could give 10x returns Intel Markets AI trading bot sets it apart from the competition Intel Markets is a project that seeks to change the trading market through the use of AI trading bots. These bots are different from the kind anyone has come across. Unlike regular ones, they are based on Rodeum AI technology and can conduct a large number of trades with high precision. Intel Markets utilizes the potential of the most effective AI algorithms to analyze live market data, predict the market, and perform trading operations. This advanced technology has a lot of advantages for the traders. First of all, it increases accuracy to the maximum level, which is crucial for the execution of correct trades. Secondly, it helps to minimize the trading process by automating the work, thus saving time for traders and excluding the possibility of making a mistake. Thirdly, advanced tools allow traders to make large profits using a 1000x leverage. In the meantime, Intel Markets is still in the presale stage and has raised over $4.1 million. The INTL coin is priced at $0.064091, an increase of 600% in the past few months. Those who missed out on this return still have a chance to join the presale and boom up to 15x profit before it ends. Cardano forecasted to reach $6 based on previous cycle Cantonese Cat predicts the value of the Cardano token could rise to $6-$8 in the next few weeks. The analyst believes the DeFi coin is following the same pattern from 2021. At the time, Cardano was trading around $0.4 before it rallied to the $3 region. Another analyst called Sssebi posted a similar prediction. According to him, there are some similarities between the Cardano price movement in 2021 and 2024. The analyst noted the bull season is on the way. At the moment, the altcoin is showing mixed sentiment on the price chart. CoinMarketCap data shows its value has dropped by 2.6% in the weekly timeframe. However, the Cardano crypto is bullish on the biweekly and monthly charts with price increases of 15.7% and 96.7%, respectively. Its 14-day RSI is above the midline, hinting at a potential rally. In Conclusion Investors who want big gains in the coming months should consider Dogecoin, Intel Markets, and Cardano. Analysts forecast their prices could skyrocket to new levels in the coming months. Intel Markets is already up 600%, outshining most altcoins in the market.

Initially dismissed as speculative and frivolous, these playful digital assets, often inspired by internet memes, have proven their ability to drive significant market activity and attract a new wave of participants to the crypto ecosystem. According to CoinGecko data , the memecoin market capitalization currently sits at $140 billion, up from its $17-21 billion range in 2023. As these coins gain traction, they serve as a gateway for newcomers to explore the broader cryptocurrency landscape, bridging the gap between casual interest and deeper engagement. This phenomenon raises a critical question: how are market makers, the backbone of liquidity and price stability in crypto markets, influencing the adoption and sustainability of memecoins? Understanding the dynamics between memecoins and market makers like CLS Global offers valuable insights into how this unconventional segment could drive mainstream crypto adoption. This article explores the impact of memecoins on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the strategic role market makers play in this evolving narrative. Memecoin Impact on Crypto Adoption Memecoins primarily drive crypto adoption through their accessibility and cultural appeal. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can seem intimidating due to their technical complexity and high prices, memecoins are often cheap and easy to understand. This low barrier to entry encourages first-time investors to dip their toes into the crypto market. Moreover, the viral nature of memecoins has expanded cryptocurrency’s reach beyond traditional financial circles. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit, play a significant role in spreading awareness and creating buzz around memecoins. These platforms amplify community engagement, making cryptocurrency discussions more mainstream and inviting new demographics into the fold. However, the volatile and speculative nature of memecoins can deter institutional investors and long-term adoption. This is where market makers like CLS Global come into play, mitigating risks and ensuring smoother market operations. The Role of Market Makers Like CSL Global Market makers are essential for maintaining liquidity in financial markets, and their importance is magnified in the volatile world of memecoins. CLS Global , a leading player in the market-making space, has been instrumental in stabilizing trading environments for memecoins and the general crypto market. By providing liquidity, they reduce price slippage and create more efficient markets, making it easier for both retail and institutional investors to participate. In the case of memecoins, market makers like CLS Global offer several key benefits: • Liquidity Provision Many memecoins suffer from thin order books, which can lead to significant price fluctuations. Market makers step in to ensure consistent trading activity, reducing volatility and improving the user experience. • Increased Credibility Memecoin projects can demonstrate their commitment to creating sustainable ecosystems by partnering with market makers. This, in turn, attracts more serious investors and helps these tokens gain legitimacy. • Accessibility and Onboarding CLS Global and leading market makers often work with exchanges to optimize trading conditions. This collaboration makes it easier for new investors to buy and sell memecoins without excessive fees or delays. • Support for Innovation Beyond liquidity, market makers contribute to the growth of memecoins by supporting tokenomics design, advising on market strategies, and ensuring regulatory compliance. These services are critical for turning a viral sensation into a long-term success story. Overview of CLS Global CLS Global is a leading crypto market-maker, especially on centralized exchanges (CEXs). In today’s crypto world, projects need more than just a market marker that provides trading liquidity. These projects need industry-oriented partners who clearly understand traditional finance and the unique crypto dynamics. CLS Global has positioned itself to serve as both a liquidity provider and a support system for various crypto and blockchain projects at different stages of development. CLS Global services include but are not limited to market making, helping projects navigate the complexities of exchange listing, and comprehensive liquidity strategies to ensure token visibility and reduce slippage for clients. Aside from the market-making services, CLS Global also offers consulting services ranging from financial modeling to marketing strategies, connecting projects with potential investors. Some of CLS Global’s growth initiatives include: • Building relationships with over 60 VC funds/advisors• Developing comprehensive technical and business roadmaps• Building stronger connections with top exchanges like Binance, MEXC, Kucoin, and Huobi.• Enhancing marketing capabilities and partnerships Since its inception in 2017, CLS Global has integrated over 80 centralized exchanges, currently services more than 500 clients, and has attracted over 1 million holders. Conclusion The initial exposure to memecoins often leads investors to explore more established cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications, contributing to overall market growth. Market makers like CLS Global play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between speculative hype and sustainable adoption. By providing the infrastructure needed for stable and efficient trading, they help transform memecoins from fleeting trends into enduring assets within the crypto economy. The interplay between memecoins, market makers, and the broader blockchain ecosystem will likely shape the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. With the right balance of innovation, community engagement, and institutional support, memecoins could continue to drive interest in crypto, proving that even the most unusual aspects of the blockchain world can profoundly impact its future.

While the blockchain space is full of innovation, one platform has been steadily capturing the attention of Bitcoin whales and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enthusiasts alike. Enter Lightchain Protocol AI , a groundbreaking blockchain ecosystem blending artificial intelligence with decentralized innovation. 🌐 This isn’t just another blockchain; Lightchain is rewriting the playbook for scalability, efficiency, and meaningful AI-powered applications. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus algorithm and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , it promises to be the next big thing in blockchain. Here’s why investors and tech pioneers are jumping at the chance to get in early. 🚀 Why Bitcoin Whales and DeFi Enthusiasts Are Paying Attention Blockchain developments are measured by their ability to solve real-world problems. Lightchain addresses some of the most pressing challenges in the crypto and tech worlds today: Scalability Issues Bitcoin may be king, but its scalability concerns have long been a pain point. Likewise, Ethereum’s growing user base often encounters congestion, leading to high gas fees. Lightchain’s PoI consensus model not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, turning scalability from a problem into an opportunity. DeFi Innovations DeFi investors are always on the lookout for platforms that provide versatile tools to build applications that stretch beyond finance. Lightchain combines the benefits of secure decentralized governance with the flexibility of AI-driven tools, bridging the gap between DeFi and advanced AI capabilities. Transparency and Trust Lightchain’s Transparent AI Framework fosters trust by providing open, auditable, and accountable AI workflows. For serious investors looking for stable but innovative projects, transparency is a must. Key Features Making Lightchain Shine The Lightchain Protocol AI stands out with features that make it far more than just a blockchain: 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Consensus PoI is a giant leap forward from conventional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of wasting computational power on solving meaningless equations (as PoW does), PoI rewards nodes for carrying out real-world AI computations like model training and optimization. That’s efficiency and purpose combined! 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM isn’t just about executing smart contracts; it’s about revolutionizing them. By embedding AI-powered functionality directly into the blockchain, developers can build applications capable of tasks like predictive modeling, personalized strategies, and deeper data analysis. Example use cases? Picture a dApp that predicts market trends before they happen or a supply chain management tool capable of real-time adjustments. 📊💡 3. Advanced Community Governance With its decentralized governance model, Lightchain puts decision-making power back into the hands of its users. Token holders can propose and vote on ecosystem updates, ensuring the platform evolves in alignment with community priorities while leveraging AI for smarter, data-backed decisions. 4. Smarter Security with AI Blockchain security remains a critical focus across the industry. Lightchain’s integration of AI gives it an edge by detecting vulnerabilities and potential threats before they can compromise the system. 5. Supporting the Meme Economy And yes, for those into creativity (and fun financial opportunities), Lightchain AI even supports meme projects with its Memecoin Launchpad. 😉 The Growing Buzz Around Lightchain From seasoned Bitcoin whales to fledgling DeFi enthusiasts, people are recognizing that Lightchain brings something powerful and different to the table. Its ability to marry AI with blockchain isn’t just a technological feat—it’s a competitive advantage. And the best part? You can get in early. Why the buzz? Lightchain’s native token ($LCAI) is in its presale stage, currently priced at $0.001125 . This offers early adopters a chance to secure tokens at heavily discounted rates before prices rise in the next stage. 🔥 Participants also gain access to exclusive perks, such as governance voting rights and priority access to ecosystem features. How Lightchain Serves Visionaries Like You Whether you’re an established crypto investor or curious about venturing into blockchain, here’s why Lightchain may be your ideal platform: For DeFi Enthusiasts: Advanced tools for building decentralized applications.

French Hill, a staunch supporter of the crypto sector, secured the House Financial Services Committee chairmanship on Thursday. Hill (R-Arkansas) will take the reins from fellow GOP lawmaker Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), who didn’t seek reelection this year. McHenry is also a vocal digital asset advocate . Hill has an “A” rating from Stand With Crypto, a digital asset advocacy group backed by top US crypto exchange Coinbase. He co-sponsored the pro-crypto House Resolution 109 , which would have reversed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. SAB 121 is a guidance bulletin that states certain companies should label digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, even if they are simply holding them for customers. The House Resolution passed the House and Senate earlier this year but was vetoed by President Joe Biden in May. A House effort to overturn the veto failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in July. The Arkansas lawmaker has also blasted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for allegedly having “pressured banks to sever ties with entire industries like crypto.” Hill promised in November that the House Financial Services Committee would work with President-elect Donald Trump to halt that pressure and conduct an investigation.

As we look toward 2025, experts predict that Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and the new viral altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) will be at the forefront. Each of these coins stands out for different reasons, but Yeti Ouro’s focus on the Play-to-Earn (P2E) market gives it a distinct edge. Dogecoin continues to attract mainstream attention, Pepe Coin rides the wave of meme coin popularity, and Yeti Ouro carves a unique niche in gaming and utility. Let’s explore what sets these altcoins apart and why they’re expected to dominate in 2025. Dogecoin News: The Original Meme Coin Still Reigns Dogecoin remains a favorite among crypto enthusiasts. Despite being created as a joke, it has proven its staying power. Its community support and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk make it a significant contender. 1-month Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Here’s why Dogecoin could dominate by 2025: Mainstream adoption. Retailers and merchants are increasingly accepting DOGE as a form of payment. Strong community. The DOGE army remains one of the most loyal in the crypto space. Low transaction fees. Dogecoin’s utility as a payment method is unmatched among other meme coins. While Dogecoin lacks a robust ecosystem like Ethereum or Solana, its simplicity and popularity keep it relevant. However, newer players like Yeti Ouro are catching up by offering more utility. Pepe Coin: Meme Culture Drives Growth Pepe Coin capitalizes on internet meme culture, much like Dogecoin did. Its rapid rise shows that the demand for meme-based coins is far from over. 1-week Pepe Coin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Pepe Coin price trends suggest bullish potential for 2025: Community engagement. The coin has gained a massive following thanks to its playful and relatable branding. Massive trading volumes. Pepe Coin often trends as a top performer in daily crypto volumes. Low entry point. Its affordable price attracts a broad range of investors. Despite its meme coin status, Pepe Coin has started incorporating token burns and staking rewards, signalling a shift toward sustainability. However, while Pepe Coin rides the meme wave, Yeti Ouro builds on tangible use cases in gaming. Yeti Ouro: The Rising Star Of The P2E Market While DOGE focuses on payments and community, Yeti Ouro has carved a niche in the P2E gaming ecosystem. Yeti Ouro powers Yeti Go, a P2E Unreal Engine-based racing game that combines chaotic gameplay with financial rewards. The game's development has been catapulted thanks to a partnership with a world-class asset creation company. Yeti Go receives premium quality looks and feel from an AAA development team best known for titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, and The Witcher. Furthermore, Immersive Audio Design is one of Yeti Go's many impressive features. The game reacts in real-time to gameplay using dynamic, cutting-edge techniques like Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos. The realm of Yeti Go springs to life as every sound is handcrafted to improve the player experience. Final Thoughts Dogecoin, Pepe Coin and Yeti Ouro are set for major milestones according to ChatGPT’s analysis. Dogecoin gains steam from its established reputation; Pepe coin takes off due to cultural correctness for people looking, Yeti Ouro is entirely breaking the old concept of an alt-coin by crossing games and finance. If you diversify between them, you can get considerably more money. Dogecoin promises stability, Pepe is the latest trend and Ouro Yeti brings practicality along with some fresh air As 2025 approaches, these altcoins stand out as a few of the best bets for those who would like to ride on the next wave of cryptocurrencies.

Frank Richard Ahlgren, a Texas investor who bought Bitcoin during Satoshi’s time, was sentenced to two years in prison for underreporting $3.7 million in earnings from selling Bitcoin from 2017 to 2019. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement that during rigorous checks, Frank Richard Ahlgren filed false tax returns between 2017 and 2019, underreporting or failing to report $4 million worth of Bitcoin sales from which he made significant profits. In October 2017, Ahlgren sold approximately 640 Bitcoins for approximately $5,807.53 for a total of $3.7 million and used the proceeds to purchase a home in Park City, Utah. When it came time to file his 2017 federal income tax return, Ahlgren reported that he had purchased the BTC he sold at much higher prices than they actually were in order to hide the full size of his Bitcoin gains. Ahlgren also sold BTC in 2018 and 2019 but never reported these sales on his 2018 and 2019 tax returns. The DOJ also stated that Ahlgren used mixers and wallet transfers to conceal funds, resulting in more than $1 million in tax losses. At this point, the DOJ added that Ahlgren must pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government. Acting Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division said: “Frank Ahlgren made millions of dollars buying and selling Bitcoin. “But instead of paying the taxes he knew he was owed, he lied to his accountant about the size of a large portion of his earnings and attempted to conceal some more of his profits by using sophisticated techniques designed to disguise his transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. This behavior earned him a two-year prison sentence today.” *This is not investment advice.

According to sources that spoke to the WSJ, Trump’s advisers have questioned candidates for regulatory positions on the feasibility of merging the FDIC with other agencies or absorbing its functions into the Treasury Department. These discussions are part of broader efforts under Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency to shrink federal oversight and streamline financial regulation. According to the WSJ, the talks also extend to merging or restructuring the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and parts of the Federal Reserve. These moves would require congressional approval and face political and industry resistance. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair told the WSJ that banks often rely on their relationships with specific regulators and would likely oppose the disruption of current frameworks. Trump’s campaign and vision align with Republican calls to reduce oversight . The proposed changes primarily aim to streamline regulatory functions and reduce restrictions on financial institutions.

Trowbridge argues that decentralized computing is a critical missing piece for Web3 to reach its full potential. The vision of Web3 remains incomplete if it continues to depend on centralized cloud servers like Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud, etc., undermining the principles of privacy, security, trust, and autonomy that decentralization promises. We recently interviewed Tom Trowbridge , Co-Founder at Fluence Labs, in person during Devconnect in Bangkok to understand what they're building in the decentralized infrastructure space. In this interview, we dive deeper into how decentralized computing is a fundamental component for the Web3 ecosystem to flourish. Generating Real Revenue is Important for DePIN Companies While crypto had traditionally been used for consensus algorithms or DeFi protocols, integrating it with physical infrastructure was an innovative concept that demanded its own terminology. DePIN's emergence emerged by the maturity of software and crypto-economics, honed and proven across various protocols. With respect to how users can get involved in the DePIN ecosystem , there are different angles to consider depending on whether you're a provider or an end customer. For example, as a provider, you can offer services like computing power, but you can also be a consumer, buying data and using the resources. This dual role fascinates many users, offering flexibility and a unique way to engage with the ecosystem. Trowbridge believes the most exciting aspect for users is generating revenue through decentralized platforms, with clear links between their contributions and economic rewards. It creates a sustainable model driven by the network's economics and does not rely on subsidies or temporary pricing. For example, it's a real deal when the ability to offer cloud infrastructure at a price almost 80% cheaper than centralized providers is offered. It is about creating an alternative to the centralized cloud that is economically viable and censorship-resistant. Fluence's core mission is to provide a decentralized cloud infrastructure 80% cheaper than traditional centralized cloud services while maintaining a sustainable economic model. Unlike other providers, Fluence's pricing structure is not temporary or subsidized—it is driven by the economics of the network. This leaves room for more affordable and reliable infrastructure for organizations without the risk of price manipulation or vendor lock-in. Fluence aims at the empowerment of enterprises as well as individual users by allowing them to build, scale, and monetize decentralized applications with increased security and efficiency. Therefore, Fluence stands for three key aspects: affordability, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. Challenges of Centralized v/s Decentralized Infrastructure While discussing the challenges associated with using DePIN infrastructure, Trowbridge shared a more evolved approach. He explained that in disputes or issues related to DePIN infrastructure, users interact directly with the compute providers via smart contracts and network protocols instead of relying on a centralized support team. Such processes ensure that users are billed only for resources used, and any issues over performance or allocation can be resolved by working directly with the provider. This is precisely where there is a need for decentralized infrastructure to evolve and provide a user experience that competes with AWS, Google, and Microsoft. While the experience with centralized cloud platforms is generally seamless, decentralized computing platforms like Fluence are still working on user interfaces and tooling to ensure ease of use. The user experience may be more complex initially, but it will improve as the developer community grows. Fluence seeks to make the shift from centralized to decentralized computing as smooth as possible as more enterprises and developers embrace decentralized computing. Over time, as the decentralized model evolves, it will offer businesses and enterprises a compelling alternative that can match the capabilities of traditional cloud providers. Fluence’s Upcoming Developments in the DePIN Landscape As for the broader trends in Web3 and the growing interest in technologies like DePIN, there is always the risk that specific trends may lose momentum, as we've seen with the rise and fall of NFTs, gaming, and other sectors. However, Fluence is focused on creating a sustainable infrastructure that can thrive regardless of market trends. As a strong use case for Web3, decentralized computing has an inherent long-term value beyond the hype cycles. Even as specific sectors may wax and wane in popularity, the need for decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure will only grow, driven by the increasing demand for privacy, security, and autonomy. Looking ahead, Trowbridge expressed his excitement that the Fluence infrastructure is gearing up for several key milestones, including the launch of Virtual Machines (VMs), scheduled for December. This significant development will enhance the platform's capabilities and attract a broader user base. The company also plans to announce its first customer use cases, demonstrating the real-world applications of its decentralized compute solutions. The third feature that adds excitement will be support for GPU-powered workloads, opening up new possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. Beyond DePIN, Trowbridge is also tapping broader market trends, such as the potential for Bitcoin reserves to gain traction among national governments. He said that if countries like the U.S. start holding Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves, it could create a domino effect, encouraging other nations and large pension funds to adopt Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value.

In an effort to maintain transparency and regulatory compliance, Bybit has announced that it is actively pursuing a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) license in Austria. With this license, Bybit will be eligible to offer secure and compliant services in the EEA that align with strict European standards. Compliance-based approach and the difficulty of the decision Ben Zhou, the co-founder and CEO of Bybit, commented on the decision: “Obtaining the MiCAR license will be a strategic milestone for Bybit. Our proactive stance ensures that we meet and exceed the expectations of both regulators and our users, as we work toward a future where innovation and compliance coexist seamlessly.” In order to avoid potential breaches of reverse solicitation rules, Bybit has made the difficult decision to cease communication with the EEA region for now. That said, existing users can still access their crypto assets without interruption. Bybit intends to resume the previous engagement in full once its compliance-first approach is reinstated and the MiCAR license is secured. Ben Zhou upheld the exchange’s stance on regulation: “As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow globally, it is Bybit’s mission to deliver secure and reliable trading experiences underpinned by robust regulatory framework to all crypto communities.” He proceeded to explain the decision behind the adjustment: “To ensure we meet the highest standards and pave the way for a safer and more sustainable future for the industry, we’ve made the proactive decision to temporarily adjust our operations in the EEA. This allows us to focus on obtaining the necessary licenses and ensuring a fully compliant platform focused on serving EEA clients.” Commitment to the European market Finally, Bybit stated that they remain committed to their EEA clients and that the exchange actively engages with the regulatory authorities to streamline the licensing process and resume regional operations.

His decisions seem to thrive on unpredictability, leaving financial markets and global policymakers scrambling to make sense of them. Hedge funds, economists, and even his own advisers are left guessing as Trump’s policies oscillate between wild promises and actions that undercut them. Bridgewater recently warned its clients that Trump plans to “go big” in reshaping U.S. institutions, global trade, and foreign policy. Yet, they openly admitted their predictions are little more than educated guesses due to the lack of clarity around his plans. Investors are left to hedge their bets, bracing for whatever may come. Inflation and tariffs: A self-made dilemma One of the clearest contradictions in Trump’s policies is his stance on inflation and tariffs. During his campaign, he slammed the Biden administration for soaring inflation, promising to bring it under control. But his proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada could have the opposite effect. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the tariffs will “derail” the fight against inflation. Stephen Moore, one of Trump’s economic advisers, dismissed this concern, claiming there was no inflation spike during Trump’s first term despite higher tariffs. However, inflation is now at 2.7%, already above the Federal Reserve’s target. Goldman Sachs estimates Trump’s tariff plans could add another percentage point to inflation—before factoring in labor cost increases from mass deportations. The Federal Reserve and interest rate chaos Trump’s relationship with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been anything but smooth. While Trump recently pledged to keep Powell in his role, history suggests otherwise. He has repeatedly criticized Powell, even calling him an “idiot,” and pressured the Fed to lower interest rates during his first term. The stakes are higher now. Debt-servicing costs have surged, giving Trump more incentive to push for rate cuts. But Powell has consistently defended the Fed’s independence, leaving a potential standoff on the horizon. Trump’s team has flagged the U.S. dollar as overvalued, with Scott Bessent, his Treasury Secretary nominee, suggesting the need for a “grand global economic reordering” akin to the Bretton Woods agreement. Bessent even hinted at convening a G20 meeting to replicate the 1985 Plaza Accord. Bessent has admitted that two-thirds of tariff impacts typically manifest as currency gains, which would strengthen the dollar rather than weaken it. Most economists agree this scenario is likely, creating a paradox where Trump’s policies could work against his own goals. Trump’s approach to the trade deficit defies conventional economic wisdom. He plans to slash the deficit through political and commercial dominance. But the numbers tell a different story. During Trump’s first presidency, the U.S. trade deficit hit its highest level since 2008, rising from $481 billion to $679 billion. Source: Vlad Bastion Tariffs and a stronger dollar could exacerbate this issue, increasing imports instead of reducing them, especially if economic growth picks up. In just four years, U.S. debt has shot up by $11 trillion—that’s 40% of the country’s entire GDP. To put it in perspective, it took the U.S. 220 years to rack up its first $11 trillion in debt. The BRICS challenge Trump’s threats against the BRICS nations are another example of his shoot-from-the-hip diplomacy. Last month, he warned of sanctions if these countries pursued a shared currency to challenge the dollar. While the BRICS have no concrete plans for such a currency, Trump’s aggressive stance could backfire. While the dollar’s dominance is unlikely to wane anytime soon, Trump’s unpredictable use of U.S. power could accelerate the search for alternatives. Ironically, the very actions meant to protect the dollar could end up undermining it. How does Trump not see that? The president’s fiscal plans are another quagmire of contradictions. He has vowed to cut the federal deficit from 6.5% to 3% of GDP while simultaneously promising massive tax cuts. His team claims this gap will be filled by economic growth, government spending cuts, and tariff revenues. But analysts are skeptical. Even if some fiscal improvements occur, the scale of Trump’s promises seems unrealistic.",OP-ED,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-13 15:41:19

While the digital asset spent most of 2024 either trading flatly or in a slight downtrend after a short move to the upside in March, the wider cryptocurrency bull market that ignited in November has seen DOGE prices skyrocket. To be fair, that is true of most of the leading cryptocurrencies — but DOGE has an additional advantage — Elon Musk’s long-term support for the coin, as well as his recent naming to the Department of Government Efficiency. By late November, Dogecoin was trading in the vicinity of 0.4188$ — at press time, the price of DOGE had receded to $0.4078, bringing year-to-date (YTD) returns to 195.71%. DOGE price YTD chart. Source: Finbold Some, like pseudonymous technical analyst Trader Tardigrade , claim that the bull run has just started . The asset has also shown quite impressive performance when compared with Bitcoin ( BTC ), as pointed out by crypto expert Ali Martinez. On the whole, analysts are quite bullish — and a recently published bit of analysis focusing on the volume of high-value traders further supports such a case. DOGE whales invest $160 million in 24 hours Over the last 24 hours, Dogecoin whales have bought $160 million worth of the meme coin, per a chart shared by Ali Martinez in a December 13 X post . In tandem with this, data from crypto behavior analysis platform Santiment has shown a notable decline in the mean dollar invested age when looking at DOGE. In simple terms, this indicates that older, stagnant wallets — particularly those with large holdings, are putting their coins back in circulation at an accelerated pace. DOGE whale purchase chart. Source: Ali Martinez on X Although the price of DOGE has actually declined by 4.37% over the last thirty days, this period of consolidation bears a striking resemblance to the cryptocurrency’s price action back in 2021. If these similarities continue to play out, based on Fibonacci retracement, Dogecoin could experience an 85% surge from current prices to reach prices as high as $0.75443 by January of 2025 per Martinez. DOGE Fibonacci retracement chart. Source: Bitcoinwallah on TradingView As the premier meme coin and the 7th largest cryptocurrency in the world, DOGE has inherent advantages compared to rivals and peers — and Musk’s long-term advocacy for the asset is only going to become a bigger bullish catalyst as Donald Trump’s presidency kicks off. Finally, this analysis isn’t even the most optimistic one — Trader Tardigrade also spotted a bull flag pattern on December 13. The consolidation period currently at play also fits the description of a bull flag — and in this case, if legitimate, DOGE prices could skyrocket to $2.15. #Dogecoin Bull Flag 🔥 Tight consolidation within Flag 👉 INTACT ✅ ✍️ A long Flagpole projects the target at $2.15 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rR6xyNZ94p — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 13, 2024 In any case, the asset seems primed for a renewed rally — the only question that remains is exactly how high it will go.

The original meme coin, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), both is and isn’t an exception to this rule. The dog-themed cryptocurrency’s yearly surge would have generated exceptional returns to any investor, albeit less than an early 2021 purchase, followed by a cashing out in May of the same year. Under the circumstances, even a relatively late DOGE investment made on January 1, 2021, would have generated a massive windfall by press time on December 13, so let’s break down the exact figures. The investment: $1,000 in DOGE on January 1, 2021 To begin with, Dogecoin was changing hands at the relatively low $0.005685 on January 1, 2021, while, by press time on December 13, 2024, DOGE price rocketed to $0.40381. Considering the price dynamic, $1,000 invested into the meme coin at the start of 2021 would have ensured ownership of 175,901 DOGE. Said Dogecoin would be worth $70,978 this Friday, December 13, signaling an overall rise of 7,003.08% and a total profit of nearly $70,000. As impressive as this performance is, traders who were savvy enough to spot the 2021 DOGE market top and sold in May could have – within mere months – turned $1,000 into an incredible $120,453. If the time frame is shortened to the current bull market , Dogecoin entered 2024 trading at the modest price of $0.09206, and the year-to-date (YTD) chart reveals an annual rally of 352.14%. This means a $1,000 investment made on New Year’s Day would have purchased just over 10,862 of the meme coin. At press time, the same number of Dogecoin would be worth an impressive $4,386. DOGE YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Finally, despite DOGE’s stellar performance – whether purchased at the start of 2021 or only in 2024 – data shows it would not have been the best meme coin to hold long-term. As Finbold calculated on December 12, 2024, a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) made on January 1, 2021 would have grown to $172,888. What is next for Dogecoin investors? For investors who have already held on to Dogecoin for a long time, the prime question in late 2024 is likely whether it is worth keeping the meme coin in their portfolio. While there is no clear answer to such a question – though all investors who purchased after May 2021 and before November 2024 would probably be wise to take at least some of the profit – there is a strong sentiment in the cryptocurrency market that the bull cycle is still only at its beginning. Indeed, Dogecoin itself appears stable for the time being – though there is always some doubt if technical analysis ( TA ) even makes sense for such assets – as the relative strength index ( RSI ) at 55.23 shows it is neither ‘overbought’ nor ‘oversold.’ On the flip side, DOGE’s 17 green days out of the last 30 and overall optimistic investor sentiment serve as a testament to the strength of the recent rally and the confidence it will continue trading higher. Furthermore, it is important to say that broader market factors also hint at persistent strength. For example, Bitcoin – usually the trendsetter for digital assets – is, by press time, widely expected to rally at least another 150% in 2025 to $250,000 , indicating a broad uptrend.

Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.4 on Dec. 13, up by 28% above the lowest level this week, and a few points below the year-to-date high of $2.90. XRP price is forming a bullish flag The daily chart shows that Ripple is slowly forming a highly bullish pattern that may lead to a strong comeback in the next few days. It is forming a bullish flag pattern, which is characterized by a long vertical line and a rectangle-like formation. In this case, the flag started forming in late October and concluded in November. It has been forming the flag section since Dec. 2. In most periods, an asset tends to have a strong rebound when the flag pattern concludes. In XRP’s case, the breakout will be concluded when it rises above the descending channel. XRP also formed a hammer pattern on Dec. 10, whose lower side was at $1.9690, which was along the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement point. A hammer is made up of a long lower shadow and a small body, and is a popular bullish reversal pattern. There are also signs that Ripple is in the Elliot corrective wave, which follows the impulse wave. It has also remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the XRP price has more room to run. A move above the upper side of the flag at $2.90 will confirm the bullish view. The first point to watch after that will be the psychological point at $3, followed by $5. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Ripple Ripple faces numerous catalysts ahead. First, there are signs that XRP whales are accumulating the token. According to CryptoQuant, whale activity jumped to an all-time high, signaling that big investors have embraced it. XRP whales are buying | Source: CryptoQuant Second, Ripple Labs has received approval from New York’s regulators to launch the RLUSD stablecoin . The developers have hinted that the stablecoin will be launched soon. While it is too early to determine whether it will be successful, the launch will likely attract hype from investors. Third, there is a chance that the XRP Ledger will start seeing traction among developers. Data shows that the network has over $63.5 million in assets , a figure that will keep growing. Further, and most importantly, Ripple will likely have an ETF now that Donald Trump has pledged to be a crypto-friendly president.

This development comes as the UK evaluates the impact of virtual digital assets on its economy and financial systems. In a statement dated December 12, the PRA noted that this move aims to improve financial stability and shape the central bank’s approach to regulating the rapidly growing sector. Notably, the regulator has asked firms to report their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and to outline their application of the Basel framework, which is a regulatory standard introduced in December 2022 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to set capital and risk management requirements for crypto exposure. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on cryptoassets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” the statement emphsized. Notably, the directive goes beyond current exposure, which requires firms to consider any future plans to engage with crypto assets until September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire spotlights several crucial areas of interest, like how firms are implementing the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. The regulator voiced specific concerns about permissionless blockchains, mentioning risks like settlement failures, lack of settlement finality, and the absence of a guaranteed link between asset ownership and control of authentication mechanisms. While the PRA noted that, as of now, the risks associated with permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated,” it acknowledged that this classification remains under review. This directive comes as more global firms increase their exposure to crypto assets, notably Bitcoin. For instance, on November 29, Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International moved nearly $50 million worth of Ether into Bitcoin. A day before, Metaplanet announced plans to raise over $62 million to purchase additional Bitcoin for its treasury, which already holds 1,142 Bitcoin valued at over $114 million.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 15:58:01

Commenting on the firm’s performance and its projections, CEO Hock Tan underscored the company’s strategic AI focus. “The reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business.” – Tan Tan also emphasized the company’s strong customer relationships. “We are very well positioned, well on the way to creating a multiyear roadmap for our customers,” said Tan. During its earnings call, analysts also asked about the AI market opportunity with particular reference to Broadcom’s engagement with hyperscale customers. The company indicated that networking content within AI is expected to increase significantly, while it also highlighted an open approach to mergers and acquisitions. Despite the strong AI projections, it might not be all rosy for the semiconductor firm. There are some potential risks to watch out for such as potential volatility in the semiconductor market, given its cyclical nature. The company also faces competitive pressure in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. According to Investing.com , Broadcom faces macro-economic uncertainties that could have an impact on demand, and integration challenges post VMware acquisition. AI supported Broadcom’s Q4 performance The company recorded a 4.1% revenue growth to $9.3 billion year-over-year beating Wall Street projections. According to the company, the robust earnings performance is reflective of growing demand for its semiconductor solutions, especially in networking and AI accelerators. Network revenues jumped 23% year-over-year to close the quarter at $3.1 billion, which represented 42% of the company’s semiconductor revenue. Tan remained upbeat about the role of AI in the firm’s performance and projects revenue opportunities of between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal year 2027, further cementing the company’s commitment to expand its AI offerings . His projections of an AI-driven growth trajectory are also in line with the growing adoption of AI technology across the globe as industries embrace it for its transformative abilities. During the period under review, Broadcom recorded $1.5 billion in revenue from generative AI, which accounted for 20% of semiconductor sales. Advanced networking products, including custom AI accelerators and connectivity solutions, have positioned it as a key supplier to hyperscale data centers and cloud providers. According to Reuters , demand for the firm’s chips that help move large amounts of data that is used by applications such as ChatGPT has also surged, as businesses double down on investments in GenAI infrastructure. “Broadcom’s strong performance doesn’t come as a surprise. It’s one of several companies benefiting from AI invigorating the global semiconductor industry, with its AI revenue growing 220% this year.” – eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne Some analysts are, however, downbeat and expressed doubts about the amount of future business from Apple, which is one of Broadcom’s most significant wireless customers. This comes as Apple is working on designing more of its chips in-house and planning to switch to a homegrown chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections starting next year. This will replace some parts that Broadcom currently supplies. Although Broadcom faces intense competition from Nvidia’s ethernet-like Infiniband products, Broadcom still benefits from the expansion of AI data centers as it is one of the largest providers of advanced networking equipment. “Broadcom will continue to be a relevant player in the custom AI ASIC market together with companies like Marvell as tier-1 hyperscalers will continue to introduce their in-house chips,” Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said.

Republican pro-crypto U.S. Representative French Hill will steer the House Committee toward relaxing banking regulation, standardizing crypto market structure, and improving capital formation to incentivize more companies to go public. Rep. Hill shared these ideas during a CNBC interview just hours after beating fellow Republicans in a race to become the next House Finance Services Committee chair. The Committee has been vocal about digital asset regulation, emphasizing the need to axe policy ambiguity and introduce clear rules. Under outgoing chair, Representative Patrick McHenry, the Committee pushed through proposals like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. You might also like: Rep.

Drumbeats in favor of a BTC stockpile grew louder in the Senate and across State Houses. Texas introduced legislation on Dex. 12 to this effect, while jurisdictions like Alabama and Pennsylvania could soon produce Bitcoin reserve proposals. Despite the nationwide fever pitch around the idea, Rep. Hill reportedly said he’s unsure if the U.S. should create a Bitcoin reserve.

According to the DOJ, Ahlgren was an early Bitcoin investor who began purchasing bitcoin in 2011. In 2015, he acquired 1,366 bitcoins through his Coinbase account, a year in which the price of bitcoin peaked at approximately $495 per coin. By October 2017, Bitcoin’s value had surged, and Ahlgren sold 640 bitcoins for $5,807 each, totaling a gain of $3.7 million. He then used the proceeds to purchase a home in Park City, Utah. However, when filing his 2017 tax return, Ahlgren misrepresented the gains by inflating the cost basis of his bitcoin purchases, claiming he had acquired the coins at prices higher than market rates. This misreporting significantly reduced the reported capital gains. Between 2018 and 2019, Ahlgren sold additional bitcoins worth over $650,000 but failed to report these transactions on his tax returns entirely. In an attempt to conceal his gains, he transferred funds through multiple wallets, exchanged bitcoin for cash in person, and using mixers to anonymize his bitcoin transactions. In total, the DOJ stated that Ahlgren’s actions resulted in a tax loss exceeding $1 million. “Frank Ahlgren III earned millions buying and selling bitcoins,” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division “But instead of paying the taxes he knew were due, he lied to his accountant about the extent of a large portion of his gains, and sought to conceal another chunk of his profits through sophisticated techniques designed to obscure his transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. That conduct today earned him a two-year sentence.” The U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman sentenced Ahlgren to two years in prison, followed by one year of supervised release. Additionally, Ahlgren was ordered to pay $1,095,031 in restitution to the U.S. government. “Ahlgren will serve time because he believed his cryptocurrency transactions were untraceable. This case demonstrates that no one is above the law. My team at IRS Criminal Investigation has the expertise and tools to track financial activity, whether it involves dollars, pesos, or cryptocurrency,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Lucy Tan of IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)’s Houston Field Office. “This case marks the first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency. As the prices for cryptocurrency are high, so is the temptation to not pay taxes on its sale. Avoid the temptation and avoid federal prison.”",News|Legal|Bitcoin|Department of Justice|DOJ,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2024-12-13 16:08:29

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 16:10:00

As the crypto market dips, major players like BlackRock and analysts remain bullish, accumulating Cardano, Avalanche, and newcomer Cutoshi for their breakout potential. Table of Contents Is Cardano preparing for a breakout year? Why AVAX is central to BlackRock’s tokenization strategy Cutoshi’s presale raises over $1.3m As the crypto market experiences a flash crash, big players and analysts such as BlackRock and Ali Martinez are loading up on coins like Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX) and Cutoshi (CUTO). Is Cardano preparing for a breakout year? After years of slow development in comparison to the many blockchains, Cardano has been on a tear, until the recent flash crash. But popular trader Ali Martinez is still bullish on ADA due to technical analysis, and says “#Cardano is doing the same as it did in 2020, which is why I’m buying! Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” The two major changes for ADA this year are the upcoming change in US administration, since ADA will not be classified as a security. Another boost came from Cardano’s integration with BitcoinOS. A smart contract system expanding Bitcoin’s capabilities by connecting it to platforms like Cardano. This allows for secure and private interactions using ZK technology. Which brings much-needed cross-chain functionality and gets rid of the need for traditional bridges, improving scalability and efficiency. Why AVAX is central to BlackRock’s tokenization strategy Avalanche failed to hold the $50 resistance level and is now trading at $44, which some traders, like Martinez, see as a potential buying opportunity. But the real whales in Avalanche right now are interested in BlackRock’s launch of the Digital Liquidity Fund BUIDL, using Securitize. This move is due to asset managers like BlackRock being very bullish around the tokenization of real world assets, something which the BUIDL fund makes possible on Avalanche. BlackRock is creating its own stablecoin on Avalanche. Each BUIDL token represents one share of $500M+, a fund designed to maintain a stable value of $1 per token. Investors receive daily dividends directly in their wallets, with the Fund allocating 100% of its assets to cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. This setup lets investors earn yield on fiat or stablecoins that might otherwise sit idle. On Avalanche, the fund offers much lower fees compared to other blockchains where it’s available, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. Professor Mike from Binance says that AVAX could be headed for a $300 price point in 2025, based on various analysis points.

However, that hasn’t stopped the whales from piling in, as the project has raised $1.35 million in less than two months, a clear sign that traders are bullish on its potential. Cutoshi recently completed its $2,000 meme competition, which showcased the creativity of its growing community and its focus on user engagement. The project has trended three times so far on X, proving that the Chinese Lucky Cat branding with a DeFi twist resonates with the crypto crowd. The whitepaper outlines ambitious plans, starting with a cross-chain DEX designed to simplify on-chain trading. It also includes features like P2P transactions for users who value privacy and a learning academy aimed at onboarding newcomers into DeFi. Cutoshi is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, tokens are priced at $0.031, marking a 100% gain from the initial price. Over 20% of the stage is already sold out. With a low market cap of $13m, Cutoshi has significant room for growth. If it achieves even a fraction of the success seen by other MemeFi projects, early backers could see substantial returns when the token lists on exchanges.

Bybit’s main motivation for this move is to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Focus on MiCA Licensing in Austria Bybit is actively pursuing a MiCA license in Austria, which is a key step in its compliance-first approach. The license will allow Bybit to operate under the strict European regulatory requirements. Ben Zhou , co-founder and CEO of Bybit, believes that obtaining the MiCA license will be a major strategic milestone for Bybit, and will also allow the exchange to exceed the expectations of both regulators and its users before compliance becomes a problem. Temporary Adjustments to EEA Operations To ensure full compliance with the MiCA regulations, particularly the reverse solicitation principle, Bybit temporarily stopped all general communications with EEA users. While this adjustment limits certain activities, existing customers still have uninterrupted access to their crypto assets. The company also assured its users that this measure is only temporary and to avoid any regulatory breaches. Bybit stated that it will re-engage with the EEA market once it secures the MiCA license. Additionally, the company is actively collaborating with regulatory authorities to make the licensing process as quick and painless as possible. For now, Bybit plans on becoming one of the first fully compliant platforms serving the EEA crypto community. Other European Exchanges Adjust to MiCA Rules Bybit is not the only exchange making big changes to comply with MiCA. Coinbase Europe, Coinbase Germany, and Coinbase Custody International announced plans to delist several stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT, PAX, PYUSD, GUSD, GYEN, and DAI, starting Dec. 13 to ensure compliance with MiCA’s regulations and requirements. Despite these changes, Coinbase will still support USD Coin (USDC) and the euro-pegged EURC, which already meet MiCA’s regulatory standards. The European Union's very strict stablecoin regulations were introduced in June of 2024.

Buyers are becoming impatient, seeking a quick rise above this steady range. This has triggered significant buying interest from large investors, potentially leading to an increase in long positions for Dogecoin. Whales Begin Accumulation Process Dogecoin’s value has surged 500% since its lows in August, with a 220% increase following Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November. Currently, the cryptocurrency is experiencing a phase of consolidation around $0.4. Data from Coinglass reveals that Dogecoin witnessed a total liquidation of nearly $7.5 million in the last 24 hours, out of which buyers liquidated around $6 million worth of long positions. Messari data reveals that addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE now possess a total of 130 billion DOGE, reaching a record high. This increase in holdings by large investors suggests a robust confidence in Dogecoin’s potential for growth. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a gradual increase in the DOGE’s large transaction volume. It shows that the metric surged from the low of $6.1 billion to $23.3 billion over the last 72 hours. This shows a rising demand from whales as Dogecoin takes a halt around the $0.4 mark. Despite the bullish sentiment among large investors, their demand has not succeeded in lifting Dogecoin from its consolidation pattern, as the memecoin continues to struggle. Experts suggest that broader market trends will play a role in whether DOGE can hold a breakout above the $0.5 mark. Also read: Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised For 20% Price Drop if This Happens Elon Musk’s significant influence continues to be a crucial factor in Dogecoin’s market trends and appeal to major investors. His frequent endorsements via Twitter during the 2020-2021 rally significantly contributed to its sharp price increases. Recently, a similar momentum boost has come with the introduction of the Department of Government Efficiency, humorously abbreviated as DOGE. This nod to Dogecoin’s ticker symbol has triggered significant interest in the leading memecoin. What’s Next for DOGE Price? Dogecoin price is attempting to surge above the consolidation of $0.4. Bulls are actively working to drive the price back into the resistance zone around $0.5. However, bears are strongly defending a surge above EMA trend lines. As of writing, DOGE price trades at $0.405, surging over 0.2% in the last 24 hours. A successful break above the EMA50 trend line on the 4-hour chart would indicate that the initial rejection might have been a bear trap, potentially pushing the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.48. At this level, sellers are expected to strongly defend. Conversely, this bullish scenario will be invalidated if the price falls and breaks below $0.36, increasing the risk of a decline to the 50-day simple moving average at $0.31. This level is crucial for bulls to hold to prevent further losses. As the RSI level is holding below the buying level, we might see a minor downward pressure before a robust rebound.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 17:15:47

Now, investors are looking at tokens that can replicate Bitcoin’s past growth. Solana, WIF and a new MemeFi token, Cutoshi are among those with the biggest potential. Solana Set For $600 In 2025? Currently trading at $208.94, Solana (SOL) has seen a significant correction from its all-time high of $260 in November. This correction erased its monthly gains, with Solana losing 1% of its value over the last 30 days. Despite its latest correction, Solana is still up 188.02% over the last year. What is more, SOL proved it could reach new ATHs, surpassing its November 2021 level. What is more, its expansive ecosystem and scalable infrastructure suggest that more growth is on the way. This is why some analysts put Solana’s price at $600 in 2025. CoinCX puts its price range between $380 and $450 for the beginning of 2025. Before reaching $500, however, the token will likely experience a correction. Still, despite a bullish long-term outlook, Solana is not looking so good in the near term. Daily technicals are pointing to a bearish outlook , especially the short-moving averages. Weekly moving averages, however, are still bullish, with all the key moving averages below Solana’s current price. WIF Set For Major Returns Like most meme coins, the Solana-based DogWifHat (WIF) was hit by the recent price correction. On December 10, WIF crashed 17.28% to $2.79 in just one day, reflecting similar declines by other memecoins. However, the token still has a strong medium-term outlook. The recent bull market has largely seen meme coin underperform utility tokens. For one, this is because memecoins had their bull run in March. The explosion of Solana-based tokens on Pump.fun helped further boost the sentiment. This was when WIF achieved its all-time high of $4.85. Still, memecoins may yet experience a bull run once traders roll over their profits from utility tokens. This is when tokens like WIF are likely to shine again. In three months, CoinCodex puts WIF’s price target at $ 9.81. Looking at a more recent outlook, overall technical indicators for WIF are still strong. While short-term moving averages for WIF are turning bearish, others are still below WIF’s current price. Can Viral MemeFi Token Cutoshi Increase 100x? The bull market is bringing new traders into the market and one token is taking full advantage of this. Unlike Solana and WIF, memeFi Cutoshi (CUTO) was shielded from the recent retracement. This is because the token is still in its presale phase, which is showing wildly successful. By December 10, Cutoshi raised over $1.36 million in presale investment. This is significant, as this is just weeks after its launch, indicating strong investor interest. What is driving interest in Cutoshi is its unique blend of memes and DeFi. Cutoshi is a memecoin, but it’s also building a decentralized ecosystem that wants to bring as many people as possible to DeFi. With a dedicated multichain DEX and a learning platform to onboard new users, this utility is attracting traders. With regular memecoins losing out this cycle, Cutoshi is in a unique position to use its DeFi utility to attract both users and investors.

WazirX (WRX) price jumped to a high of $0.3500, its highest level since March 14, and 255% above the lowest point this year. This rally happened as the developers made an update about the ongoing legal issues following its hack in July. In a statement, the developer said that they had applied with the Singapore High Court to convene a scheme meeting. This will be a crucial step towards final distributions since it offers the fastest recovery solution, is fair and equitable for all creditors, and is legally binding. The distributions will be made within ten working days after the scheme is approved by creditors and the court in Singapore. The WazirX price also jumped after the developers sent an update about asset rebalancing. They noted that they were in the process of rebalancing tokens in its exchange. This will be an important step towards the final allocations to cold wallets. All these events happened a few months after WazirX, which was then a big crypto exchange, was hacked. Hackers drained over $235 million in what has been viewed as an inside job by some crypto analysts. Police in Delhi arrested a person suspected of carrying out the hack. Cryptocurrency tokens of troubled companies like Celsius, Safemoon, and FTX Token often jump when there is a major legal progress. You might also like: Inside job or cover-up? New accusations add fuel to the WazirX controversy WazirX price analysis WazirX price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the WRX token has staged a strong comeback, rising by over 260% from its lowest point this year. It then pared some of these gains, moving to a low of $0.30. It has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages flipped each other. WazirX token also moved to the extreme overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. It is also slowly forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $0.3947, which is about 34% above the current level. Therefore, the WRX price will likely continue rising if bulls flip the extreme overshoot point at $0.35. A drop below the strong pivot reverse point at $0.20 will invalidate the bullish view.

This comes after a modest recovery from a recent dip to $1.90 earlier this week, following a multi-year high of $2.90 on December 3. Notably, XRP , now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a remarkable 250% rise over the past month, making it one of the standout performers in the recent crypto market rally. XRP’s recent bullish momentum was fueled by several key factors beyond riding the broader market uptrend sparked by Bitcoin’s rally following Donald Trump’s election victory last month. Optimism surrounding Ripple’s ongoing SEC lawsuit has played a significant role, with speculation about a potential leadership change and the dismissal of the case boosting investor confidence. Additionally, growing institutional interest has emerged through applications for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with filings from firms like 21Shares and WisdomTree further solidifying market enthusiasm. Adding to this excitement are rumors that Ripple may soon launch the RLUSD stablecoin , which has heightened anticipation and contributed to XRP’s recent gains. However, the price now hovers near the critical $2.50 support level, sparking concerns of a potential decline. Adding to the risk, substantial whale activity has intensified selling pressure, with CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartunn reporting a sharp increase in whale transactions involving Binance in the past month. “Over the past 30 days, more than 2.66 billion XRP tokens have been deposited into Binance.” Maartuun wrote. According to the analyst, this represents the highest level of whale activity since April 2024, signaling potential strategic shifts by these influential market participants, who often have the power to move prices substantially. Adding to the uncertainty, broader market dynamics also weigh heavily on XRP. On Wednesday, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal warned that Bitcoin’s dominance, currently at 54.8%, could continue to rise, potentially diverting capital from altcoins like XRP. “In November, funds flowed out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Now, the trend has reversed—money is flowing back out of altcoins. XRP, SOL, and ETH market cap growth has stalled.” He tweeted. Furthermore, the rapid increase in leveraged trading has added another layer of risk. Open interest in XRP futures has surged to nearly $3.99 billion, almost doubling within a month. Historical trends suggest that such heightened leverage often precedes market corrections, raising further concerns about XRP’s near-term trajectory. Nevertheless, despite the challenging fundamentals, analyst Ali Martinez identified a potentially bullish setup for XRP, noting the formation of a bull flag pattern that could signal a breakout, potentially driving the price toward the $4 mark. However, the pundit also cautioned that the TD Sequential indicator recently issued a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, indicating a likely short-term correction before any breakout above $2.46.

A recent proposal to deploy a new instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum’s mainnet has been successfully approved. The proposal, which passed through the AaveDAO governance process, outlines the creation of a custom-built platform designed to cater to the needs of World Liberty Financial. More so, this new platform will provide liquidity for digital assets like Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and stablecoins including USDC and USDT. The approval marks a step for Donald Trump’s project as it moves closer to operationalizing the platform. As part of the proposal, the platform will be governed by a risk management model built on the Aave v3 infrastructure. Donald Trump WLFI Proposal Approved by AaveDAO for Ethereum Mainnet Launch According to a recent report , AaveDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization responsible for governing the Aave protocol, has approved the proposal made by World Liberty Financial to launch an instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum’s mainnet. The proposal, passed on Thursday, outlines that the WLFI platform will initially support Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and stablecoins such as USDC and USDT for lending and borrowing activities. The platform will leverage Aave’s existing infrastructure while introducing a customized risk management strategy for managing asset liquidity. AaveDAO will receive 20% of the fees generated from the World Liberty Financial instance, as well as a 7% share of the total supply of WLFI tokens. This partnership will boost liquidity and governance integration between Aave and WLFI, benefiting both platforms as they expand their ecosystems. Aave’s risk managers will also adjust the supply caps of Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin to ensure stable liquidity and enable sustainable borrowing of stablecoins. The governance model for WLFI will allow it to attract new participants to top DeFi projects. World Liberty Financial Project Invests Millions in Niche DeFi Tokens In addition to the proposal for launching the Aave v3 instance, World Liberty Financial has made investments in key DeFi tokens . Recent blockchain data shows that the project has acquired millions of dollars worth of tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE). These investments align with Trump’s commitment to building a DeFi ecosystem, helping ensure liquidity for the planned lending and borrowing platform. Donald Trump’s project has purchased $35 million worth of Ethereum and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), along with $1 million each in Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). The total investment of $50 million reflects WLFI’s strategy to boost its DeFi presence and integrate various blockchain solutions. Notably, the purchases have already contributed to price surges in the affected assets, demonstrating market interest. Furthermore, the investment will enhance World Liberty Financial’s capabilities in the DeFi space. As Donald Trump’s crypto initiative gains traction, the president-elect outlined plans to establish the United States as a leader in the crypto sector. During an interview, Donald Trump emphasized the importance of staying ahead of nations like China in the race for blockchain and crypto innovation. His administration’s focus will include advancing crypto mining, adopting blockchain technologies, and implementing regulatory frameworks that boost growth.

The foundation which supports the restaking platform, Eigen Layer, announced this on X, noting that it is committed to Ethereum security. According to the Foundation, pledging 1% of its supply to the fund will enable the Protocol Guild to continue its work on Ethereum infrastructure development and ensure it stays decentralized. Given that the EIGEN token has a total supply of 1.68 billion, with 210.81 million currently in circulation, the pledge would see Protocol Guild get around 16.8 million EIGEN tokens over time. Based on the current value of the token, that would be worth $82.6 million. Eigen Foundation said: “By pledging 1% of EIGEN supply, we aim to ensure that the Protocol Guild can continue its mission to provide consistent funding for Ethereum maintainers, supporting their stewardship of the network.” Protocol Guild is an on-chain fund for the core maintainers of Ethereum L1 infrastructure. Its focus is on research and development to sustain the network and the group members work on several core developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Beam Chain, zk-proofs, decentralized storage, and zk-proofs. Protocol Guild donations are to surpass $100 million Meanwhile, the pledge from Eigen Layer now means over a dozen projects have taken the Protocol Guild pledge to donate at least 1% of their token supply to the fund. According to data from Dune analytics regarding the restaking protocol, EtherFi was the first to commit 1% of its supply. Since then, several others have made similar moves, but the data has not yet been updated to include the Eigen Foundation commitment. Other major pledges include Taiko Labs, PWN DAO, Puffer, and EthStorage. More recently, Otto DAO, the community behind the on-chain lottery protocol LottoPGF, also committed 1% of its treasury to the Guild, while Alinged Foundation allocated 1.5% of the Aligned Layer token supply. However, other Ethereum-based projects and individuals have opted for direct donations, including popular L2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Zksync. Overall, Protocol Guild has received over 8,282 donations from almost 832 donors, who donated $92.9 million as of December 9, with Ether.Fi being the biggest donor, followed by TAIKO. The donated funds are being spent supporting various developers working on core Ethereum projects. Developers receive distributions based on their contributions to the Ethereum network. So far, the Guild has 187 members. Over the last two years, the project has distributed $38 million to developers, with each recipient receiving a median amount of $51,617 in the last 12 months. The Guild also plans to distribute a median amount of $79,342 to the developers in the next 12 months. The project currently has about $54 million, subject to a four-year vesting period. Ethereum developer activity in decline Meanwhile, the increase in financial commitment to Protocol Guild could not have come at a better time for the Ethereum network. Solana recently overtook Ethereum as the top ecosystem for developers for the first time since 2016. According to a report from Electric Capital, Solana attracted 7,625 new developers in 2024, compared to Ethereum’s 6,456. The increase in Solana developers is mostly due to growth in Asia, but it highlights how the network is attracting new builders. Nevertheless, Ethereum remains a major draw for most developers as it continues to have the highest developer activity of all blockchain networks, with 6,244 in 2024. However, monthly Ethereum developers fell by 17% compared to last year. Amidst all these, Eigen Layer emerged as the fastest-growing developer ecosystem. The protocol reported a 167% increase in monthly overall developers.

The exchange noted that it will continue supporting MiCA-compliant assets like USD Coin (USDC) and EURC. In a Wednesday announcement set to its users, Coinbase wrote that “due to the new European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, Coinbase will implement restrictions for stablecoin services that do not meet MiCA requirements.” Which Are The Stablecoins Affected? Other than USDT, retail customers on Coinbase Europe and Coinbase Germany will see the delisting of Paxos Standard Price (PAX), PayPal USD (PYUSD), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD). It’ll also impact GYEN and Maker Protocol’s DAI. Coinbase pointed out that USD Coin (USDC) and EUR Coin (EURC) are MiCA-compliant and will continue to be supported. For now, the platform suggests that its users sell or convert assets not compliant with the new regulatory requirements before the restriction date or transfer those tokens out of the exchange. MiCA’s first phase, which was implemented in June 2024, mandates stricter guidelines for stablecoins, with full compliance required by December 30. Coinbase encouraged users to convert restricted coins into approved ones and stated it will reassess delisted assets once they comply. Although MiCA regulators haven’t officially called USDT noncompliant, Coinbase’s actions reflect its effort to align with European regulatory standards. Tether Expresses Criticism Tether criticized the rushed implementation and confirmed its commitment to creating MiCA-compliant solutions for the region. This regulatory change is a key moment for European crypto markets as exchanges adapt to stricter rules. Notably, USDC issuer Circle secured a MiCA-valid license this summer, which drew attention from exchanges looking for a major stablecoin suitable for EU markets. Earlier this week, Binance partnered with US-based stablecoin issuer Circle to accelerate the adoption of the USDC stablecoin. On the other hand, a September report by Consumers’ Research criticized Tether’s USDT for lacking transparency about its dollar reserves, warning it could be risky for consumers. However, Tether defended itself with attestations and security measures but did not provide a full audit from a reputable firm.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|USDC|PYUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 17:41:58

Get in early or get left behind This could be the chance to ride the wave of a change in meme coins. With major listings on the horizon and a rapidly growing community, XYZ is the star player you can’t afford to bench. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin but has carved out its own path in the crypto world. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum sets it apart from other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for an NFT platform and a community-driven governance system. These developments hint at SHIB’s potential beyond being just a meme. In a market where utility and technology are gaining focus, SHIB’s ambitions could make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. As trends shift towards projects with real-world applications, SHIB’s evolution within the Ethereum ecosystem might attract those looking for more than just hype in the crypto space. Pepe PEPE is a new cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme. Created as a tribute to Matt Furie’s character that gained fame in the early 2000s, PEPE embraces its meme origins wholeheartedly. Launched on the Ethereum network, this deflationary token aims to join the ranks of other successful meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a transparent approach, PEPE keeps things simple, attracting a community that appreciates its straightforward meme coin nature. In the current market cycle, PEPE has made a significant impact. Between late April and May 2023, its market cap soared to a peak of $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This explosive growth has sparked a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens experiencing rapid rises and falls. While PEPE lacks traditional utility, its appeal lies in community engagement and the viral nature of memes. As the crypto world anticipates events like the upcoming Bitcoin halving, some see potential for PEPE to reach new heights. Its success highlights a trend where community and culture can drive value, even in the absence of conventional fundamentals. Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have seen strong gains, XYZVerse aims to surpass them, uniting sports fans in a community-driven meme coin poised for 20,000% growth during the bull run.

Backed by Metalpha, Waterdrip Capital, BIT Mining, Animoca Brands, and more, Prosper has procured the new ASIC miners from BITMAIN to bring institutional-grade execution quality to its protocol Prosper aims to expand its underlying Bitcoin hashrate capacity to accelerate the flywheel of DAO-owned hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations & democratize access to institutional-grade mining Following the announcement of Prosper’s long-term partnership and hosting service agreement with BITMAIN, the world’s leading manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, this landmark purchase marks an instrumental step in Prosper’s mission to provide institutional-grade reliability to its mining ecosystem. By leveraging BITMAIN’s cutting-edge products, Prosper enhances the value delivered to its PROS token holders, further distinguishing itself as the premier Web3 Bitcoin mining protocol backed by leading industry players. “Bitcoin brought about a fundamental shift in finance by democratizing an economic system in its entirety with blockchain technology. Prosper follows the footsteps of Bitcoin’s core ethos by democratizing access to Bitcoin hashrate, the underlying layer powering Bitcoin-through blockchain technology. This layer of community governance and ownership afforded by blockchain allows Prosper to scale its flywheel of both Bitcoin hashrate and treasury operations while simultaneously helping to ensure that Bitcoin mining layer is sufficiently decentralized to maintain Bitcoin’s status as the most recognized digital reserve currency. ” said Milton Lam, Prosper Advisory Council Member. Prosper’s Latest Development 1 EH/s of hashrate procured and ready to fully go live (with 250 PH/s live on Prosper’s dApp already) Access to pipeline capacity of 170MW with the mid-term goal of adding another 5 EH/s More than 2 BTC rewards given out to PROS holders since November Access to more than 200 BTC to be delegated by launch partners to the DAO to unlock TVL opportunities for PROS holders Strategic Round Closure: Strengthening the Bitcoin Ecosystem In addition to its BITMAIN partnership, Prosper announced the closure of its strategic funding round, which saw participation from prominent industry players and financial investors, including Metalpha, Waterdrip Capital, BIT Mining, and Satoshi Protocol. Earlier in October, Animoca Brands also disclosed its intention to purchase PROS tokens from the open market. These investments demonstrate the strong confidence in Prosper’s vision of bridging institutional-grade Bitcoin mining power on-chain and its innovative approach to Bitcoin liquidity farming. The involvement of these strategic partners brings crucial industry expertise and networks to support Prosper’s operations as it scales. Positioning Prosper for Growth Prosper’s tokenomics adopts a unique design to ensure hashrate-per-token will only increase and be accretive to PROS holders. Prosper’s DAO leverages a unique flywheel model with both hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations – all governed by and for the benefits of PROS holders. Institutional-grade hashrate generates Bitcoin on an ongoing basis, part of which is rewarded to holders for their active participation, and remaining goes to the DAO treasury. DAO’s treasury Bitcoin can be directed towards TVL opportunities with ecosystem partners such as Bitcoin L2 to generate benefits for PROS holders and the DAO. Growth in DAO treasury value and PROS adoption allows the protocol to further expand underlying hashrate and enhance protocol resilience. By combining institutional-grade Bitcoin mining hashrate, a decentralized protocol design backed by strong fundamentals, and an extensive network of strategic partners, Prosper is well-positioned to solidify its status as the flagship decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol. About Prosper Prosper is a decentralized protocol for a community that truly believes in Bitcoin, providing full exposure across Bitcoin hashrate and Bitcoin through tokenizing institutional-grade Bitcoin hashrate as omnichain RWA, and aims to fully unlock the potential of Bitcoin.

As hodlers double down on their Solana ( SOL ), Glassnode has pointed to recent selling pressure as having come from last bull market’s holders. This is a cohort in the one-to-two-year group of buyers that likely elected to take profits as Solana rode the crypto uptick post-U.S. election to its current bull cycle peak. “The 1-2 year cohort has steadily diminished, dropping from 48% in June to just below 5% now. These were investors from the previous bull run who largely took profits during this year’s rally. For now, those who wanted to sell SOL have likely sold,” the platform wrote on X.

HBAR crypto explained,https://crypto.news/what-is-hedera-hashgraph/,"The Internet is a big world; every country represents a digital ledger. Most of these ledgers are blockchains but most have ‘slow economies’. Here is where the global leader Hedera Hashgraph comes into the picture. It is a distributed ledger technology that replaces the old blockchain system, making the ‘economy’ fast, fair, and secure. Table of Contents What is HBAR? How does Hedera Hashgraph work? How to use Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR? Key features and benefits of Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR How to buy, store, and use HBAR Challenges and criticisms Future of HBAR and Hedera Hashgraph In this article, we will discuss what is hedera hashgraph, how it works, its key features, the challenges it faces, and the future of Hedera ( HBAR ). Read more: HBAR hits seven-month high after 47% rally as whales accumulate What is HBAR? The Hedera (HBAR) token is the native token of the Hedera ecosystem. The entire network’s transactions are fueled by HBAR, which guarantees their speed and security. In simpler words, you can consider Hedera’s HBAR as the rocket fuel, allowing users to pay for network services like file storage, smart contracts, and token production. Through staking , HBAR contributes significantly to preserving the integrity of the network in addition to serving as a transactional tool for users to take advantage of the key features offered by Hedera’s infrastructure. At the time of writing, the HBAR token is trading at around $0.313 and has experienced around 800% price surge in the past 2 months. Hedera Hashgraph weekly chart | Tradingview How does Hedera Hashgraph work? A decentralized network of nodes makes up the Hedera Hashgraph ecosystem, which verifies transactions and adds them to the common ledger. The Public Hedera Network’s Hashgraph consensus method is built for fast transaction speeds and low latency, guaranteeing quick and effective transaction processing. Fundamentally, Hedera Hashgraph relies on a novel consensus process known as “gossip about gossip.” Until everyone agrees, nodes exchange information about who they spoke with and what transactions they are aware of. Byzantine Fault Tolerance and fairness are maintained while the inefficiencies of blockchain’s proof-of-work are eliminated. The network is very quick and impenetrable since transactions are timestamped and arranged according to when the majority of the network gets them. The Hedera platform allows developers to create smart contracts that facilitate the execution of transactions and the operation of decentralized apps. The platform’s native cryptocurrency , HBAR, is utilized for handling and safeguarding network transactions. A technical board and a council oversee the platform, and HBAR holders have the power to shape significant choices about the project’s future. Now let’s discuss what is Hedera Hashgraph used for. How to use Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR? Using Hedera is a straightforward process. It offers APIs that let developers manage smart contracts, create tokens, and build decentralized apps. The Hedera ecosystem is made up of several components that cooperate to form the network as a whole. It consists of nodes that record transactions, developers who use the Hedera SDK to create dApps and smart contracts, businesses, and organizations like IBM and LG that play around with the technology. For more efficient operations, businesses can use Hedera’s token services and file storage. HBAR can also be used by regular users to make payments, stake, or communicate with dApps. To enter this quick and safe ecosystem, all you need is some HBAR and a wallet that works with Hedera. Hedera’s cryptocurrency holders use the cryptocurrency for platform oversight and operations, and dApp users take advantage of the quick and safe transactions made possible by Hashgraph technology. You might also like: What is tokenization and how does it work Key features and benefits of Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR Speed is one of the key features of Hedera Hashgraph as it is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second with very low latency. It is environmentally beneficial thanks to its energy-efficient consensus method. It also offers key benefits including its Hedera services which include Consensus-as-a-service (CaaS), file storage, identity management, and cryptocurrency payments. These services use hashgraph technology, which offers lightning-fast speeds, safety, and flexibility. The Hedera platform’s native cryptocurrency is called HBAR Token. In addition to voting on important platform decisions, it is utilized to process and secure network transactions. Furthermore, the Hedera SDK gives developers the resources and tools they need to create smart contracts and dApps on the Hedera platform. It provides a large selection of languages of programming as well as the ability to integrate with other platforms and programming tools. The usefulness of HBAR extends to network transaction fuelling, governance, and staking. It is a solid option for both developers and businesses because of its fairness, decentralization, and regulatory compliance features. How to buy, store, and use HBAR Buying, selling, and storing Hedera’s cryptocurrency i.e. the HBAR token is a straightforward process. The easy way is to create an account on any major centralized exchange like Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Then you can deposit fiat currency and buy a stable coin in which HBAR is traded on that exchange. In this case, it can be USDT or USDC. Then you can buy the HBAR token at its current price or set a buy limit on which you want to buy the HBAR token. After buying the tokens will show in your exchange wallet after which you can sell them by using market or limit order. The other option is to use decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Pancakeswap to buy HBAR tokens which can be done after creating a digital crypto wallet like Metamask. After buying the token you can secure it in your digital crypto wallet and sell it by going to any decentralized exchange. If you don’t want to store HBAR tokens in your digital wallet or any centralized exchange you can also stake HBAR by following the official guide here . Challenges and criticisms Hedera Hashgraph offers impressive technology that solves a lot of problems that normal blockchains don’t, however, despite its excellent technology, its governance mechanism comes under criticism now and then. This is because, despite the diversity of its governance council, the authorities on the governance panel are centralized which points questions to the core concept of decentralization on which every cryptocurrency stands on. Additionally, the coding behind Hedera Hashgraph isn’t open-source which can be a security issue as public audit of code is often a better alternative than keeping it private. While Hedera does claim to be highly scalable this claim hasn’t been tested in the real world, however, as crypto gets wider acceptance, a large number of users can be onboarded to Hedera’s platform and it may pose a challenge to it in the future. Future of HBAR and Hedera Hashgraph The roadmap outlined by Hedera’s team is impressive. The network’s potential for use in the gaming, supply chain, and financial industries increases as it shifts to a more decentralized governance and consensus architecture. The usefulness of HBAR will increase with further improvements, such as mirror nodes for increased transparency and sharding for scalability. Collaborations with significant corporations such as Google and IBM show faith in Hedera’s goal. A promising future is indicated by the growing usage of Hedera for identity management, tokenization, and safe micropayments. Hedera has the potential to be a key component of Web3 infrastructure if it can successfully negotiate regulatory environments and keep coming up with new ideas. You might also like: What is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance and its uses How many Hedera coins are there? The total and max supply of the HBAR token is set at 50 billion tokens and its circulating supply is 38 billion (at the time of writing).

Despite recent gains, a new $1 billion mixed shelf offering could lead to significant dilution and potential underperformance. Previous capital raises include $150 million in August and $400 million in late-November private placement notes show the company's willingness to raise. Even without the shelf, BTDR is trading at a massive book value premium to most mining stocks and the broader revenue trend is not a good one. Bitdeer Technologies ( BTDR ) has been one of the best performing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks this year. After only TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Core Scientific ( CORZ ), no other mining stock has generated a better year to date return than BTDR. But the 102% year to date return for BTDR really doesn't even do the stock's recent rally justice. Since I last covered the name for Seeking Alpha in August, BTDR shareholders who ignored my 'hold' call and bought the stock under $7 have been handsomely rewarded with a face-ripping 220% four month rally. Data by YCharts Well done, bulls. This is why I try to avoid outright 'sell' calls on stocks even if I feel there are valid fundamental issues. Attachment to Bitcoin can make any stock volatile and mining stocks are possibly the best example of Bitcoin-adjacent volatility. I'm making an exception today. For Bitdeer specifically, there is now a very large overhang on the stock that, I believe, will shift BTDR from a position of brief sector out-performance to one of under-performance for the foreseeable future. That overhang in a word, dilution. The Shelf Offering Just four months ago the company issued $150 million in senior notes . More recently, Bitdeer announced $360 million in convertible notes that pay 5.25% in a late-November private placement. The company disclosed the closing of that offering at $400 million during its November production update. Now we have the prospect of yet another capital raise, and this one is bigger than the other two combined. On December 11th, Bitdeer filed a prospectus to raise $1 billion through a mixed shelf offering that could include common stock, debt securities, and/or warrants. Data by YCharts While we don't yet know when this offering will begin or the pricing of any equity issuance, the prospect of a $1 billion capital raise could mean significant dilution for current shareholders at a $3.6 billion current market capitalization. Consider, the closing price of Bitdeer common shares was $18.90 when the prospectus was filed. At $21.37 on December 12th, BTDR shares are trading at nearly 7x book value. Compare this with large mining peers: Data by YCharts Bitdeer's price to book value is running 3 to 4 times other miners in the sector. The only conclusion I can draw from this is that BTDR is wildly overvalued compared to the rest of the large public miners. Frankly, it would be shortsighted for the company to not tap the spigots at these share price levels and capture some of the implied value in the equity by issuing common stock shares. Thus, I suspect they will do so and likely rather soon. Retail Hype and SEALMINER Expectations BTDR Daily Chart (TrendSpider) There is admittedly quite a bit of excitement in the market about BTDR at this point in time. Based on both the spike in percentage of trading activity and some of the postings I'm seeing on places like X and YouTube, Bitdeer has been generating quite a bit of buzz with retail traders over the last few weeks. Much of the hype is likely a result of Bitdeer's SEALMINER A2 machine which apparently has just under 1.4 million reservations already booked. SEALMINER Reservation Page (Wayback Machine) Though I think it's important to point out that 99 cent reservations without KYC do not necessarily mean there will be 1.4 million SEALMINER orders when it's all said and done. I think it's also interesting that the Wayback Machine is indicating that there have only been about 40k new reservations since late July even though the price of Bitcoin has essentially doubled over the same time frame. Ultimately what matters is whether or not Bitdeer turns these reservations into revenue growth. Because Q3's numbers show a continuation of a concern I've laid out in prior pieces covering the company. Revenue Story For the quarter ended September, Bitmain reported $62 million in top-line revenue. This was a 37% sequential drop from $99.2 million in Q2 and a 29% year over year decline from $87.3 million in Q3-23. Data by YCharts More importantly, for the third consecutive quarter Cloud Hash Rate revenue has declined. At the reported $7.1 million, Cloud Hash Rate generated just 11.5% of Bitdeer's top line revenue in Q3. For context, Cloud Hash was Bitdeer's primary revenue driver for much of 2022 before falling drastically last year. Analyst's Chart, Bitdeer Filings Self-mining now accounts for just over 50% of the company's total revenue. This is potentially a concerning long term trend because self-mining happens to be bad for gross profit as the segment lost $3.2 million in Q3. Q3 Revenue Breakout (Bitdeer) Cloud Hash Rate continues to be the best moneymaker for the company on a gross margin basis and yet revenue from that segment declined by 55% year over year. The only segment that generated year-over-year growth for Bitdeer was self-mining. Which, again, is a problem because the segment hasn't been profitable for the company following the block reward halving. Bitcoin Production Of course, markets are supposed to be forward looking and higher Q4 Bitcoin prices should drive revenues for Bitdeer. The company had 17.1 total hash under management in Q3. Bitdeer's November production update showed 20.7 EH/s under management with 8.2 of that hash allocated to self-mining. Analyst's Chart, Bitdeer filings For the month, Bitdeer produced 150 BTC from that hash and 174 BTC during the month of October. November Production BTC Mined EH/s BTC per EH/s Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 907 46.1 19.67 TeraWulf ( WULF ) 115 5.9 19.49 HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) 103 5.3 19.43 IREN Limited ( IREN ) 379 19.7 19.24 Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 495 25.8 19.19 Bitfarms ( BITF ) 204 10.7 19.07 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 622 33.7 18.46 Bitdeer 150 8.2 18.29 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 45 2.5 18.00 Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 202 12.0 16.83 Source: Company filings From a BTC per EH/s standpoint, there are several public companies that are running more efficient fleets than Bitdeer. That could certainly change given some of the advertised specs we're seeing from the new SEALMINER machine. But until we see actual performance metrics, self-mining is still potentially a headwind for Bitdeer rather than a tailwind due to it being a net income loser following the halving. To be sure, Bitcoin prices are higher than they were in Q3. But so is the global hash rate, and we're already seeing signs that Q4 BTC production may be lower than Q3. Even if we assume Bitdeer can continue to produce at the three-month average of 163 BTC per month, the company's stock is trading at more than 15x forward BTC sales at $100k Bitcoin price. Since half the company's revenue comes from other segments, we can cut it down to just under 8x forward sales. Bottom line, BTDR is not cheap up here and management seems poised to take advantage of that mispricing through the shelf offering. Closing Thoughts It's certainly true that I've missed a fantastic run in BTDR shares. I think traders and investors who bought under $10 have obviously made the right call by getting in before the rally. However, I think the gains have been had here for the time being. The company is going through a revenue generation transition that is a fairly large gamble. In addition to entering the HPC/AI space with the rest of the Bitcoin miners, Bitdeer's broad revenue trend has been one of increasing reliance on the less profitable segment. Bitcoin's price increase can theoretically help BTDR grow top line, but history shows us each halving cycle has a blow off top and then a large decline. I see a lot of hype about BTDR right now at the same time the company is hoping to raise $1 billion. It's difficult for me to see how BTDR shares stay above $20 for much longer. I think the stock is a sell. I would not advise shorting it. But if I were long, I'd take the win.",BTDR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-13 17:54:33

Citing a statement from Danylo Hetmantsev, chairman of the unicameral parliament Verkhovna Rada’s Financial, Tax and Customs Policy Committee, the Ukrainian online newspaper Epravda reports there is a high probability that Ukraine will legalize cryptocurrency in the first quarter of 2025. Says Hetmantsev, “If we talk about cryptocurrency, the working group is completing the preparation of the relevant bill for the first reading. I think that the text together with the National Bank and the IMF will be after the New Year and in the first quarter we will pass this bill, legalize cryptocurrency.” But Hetmantsev says cryptocurrency transactions will not enjoy tax benefits. The government will tax profits from asset conversions according to the securities model. “In consultation with European experts and the IMF, we are very cautious about the use of cryptocurrencies with tax benefits, as an opportunity to avoid taxation in traditional markets.” The development comes amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Russian lawmakers passed a bill to enable the use of cryptocurrency in international trade as the nation faces Western sanctions, causing payment delays that affect supply chains and costs.

37595645,https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-the-based-rollups-debate,1734112800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Understanding the debate around based rollups,https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-the-based-rollups-debate,"Ethereum loves rollups. As of late, “based” rollups are in vogue. What makes based rollups special? Its sequencer. Layer-2s today use a trusted centralized sequencer to order users’ transactions before they are posted down to the layer-1 for settlement, but based rollups defer those execution duties to Ethereum layer-1 validators. This is otherwise known as “based sequencing.” There are two primary reasons this is preferable: censorship resistance and interoperability. Using the layer-1 as a sequencer ensures the same liveness guarantees as Ethereum layer-1 blocks, and avoids the major complaints of potential censorship surrounding trusted centralized sequencers. Read more: MagicBlock open sources a16z-backed ‘ephemeral rollup’ tech The second advantage of based rollups is better interoperability. Based rollup proponents such as Justin Drake have in recent months touted this benefit as “ synchronous composability ,” where transactions in Ethereum are sequenced (or bridged) across different layer-2s at the same time. Simply put, smart contracts on based rollups will be able to call any other contract on the layer-1 in near-instant finality within the same block — as if they were all on the same chain. This composability and “money legos” is not exactly new; it was always one of the core properties sold with the original vision of Ethereum. Read more: Rethinking Ethereum consensus with Beam Chain But the fragmented state of rollups today means an Arbitrum transaction is asynchronous with an Optimism transaction, which creates problems of fee uncertainty. Fee uncertainty arises because gas fees are calculated in different slot times, as opposed to within the same 12-second slot time of one Ethereum block. In addition to making Ethereum seamlessly interoperable again, there are also different kinds of significant cost savings, Ahmad Mazen Bitar, technical product lead at Nethermind and Ethereum ACD developer, explains. “A user may want to swap his token on the [layer-1] but wants to take advantage of a deep liquidity pool on a [layer-2]. With synchronous composability, they would be able to push a singular transaction from the [layer-1] to the [layer-2], execute it, then bring it back to the [layer-1].” The first and largest existing based rollup in live production today is Taiko, which recently saw a burst in TVL and daily transactions this month. Source: DefiLlama Other early based rollups are also in early production, such as Surge by the Nethermind team, and UniFi by the Puffer Finance team. Both are forks of Taiko. Based rollups don’t come without its own drawbacks, however. Since execution (i.e. sequencing duties) is now being relegated back to layer-1 block validators, that means based rollups are constrained by the layer-1’s 12-second block time. Hence, the purported benefits of based rollups, like synchronous composability, may be easier said than done. Based rollups would require real-time proving within the latency of one 12-second slot, without which based rollups cannot execute composable transactions speedily. To have that kind of fast proof generation in turn brings another technological dependency into the mix, but Brecht Devos, co-founder and chief technology officer of Taiko, remains confident the tech is catching up. It’s why Taiko recently enabled two zk proofs on its rollup by Risc Zero and Succinct Labs, on top of Intel’s SGX trusted execution environment (TEE). This made it the first multi-proof based rollup in production without reliance on one trusted party. “Provers are improving quickly with more TEEs, faster and cheaper zkVMs and AVSs that can be used. We think the zk development is going very well and the sub-slot latency for proving is not far off,” Devos told Blockworks. One other believed disadvantage of based rollups is a loss of MEV as a key “revenue” stream, due to the lack of a centralized sequencer. Yet there are nifty workarounds available, Devos said. On Taiko, “MEV can also be captured by auctioning “execution tickets” to layer-1 block proposers,” Devos told Blockworks. As such, while based rollups by default give up sequencing rights to layer-1 validators, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. Matthew Edelen, co-founder of Spire Labs, a based rollup infrastructure provider, shares a similar view. As he explained on a recent Bell Curve podcast: “Auctions don’t have to be the only way to distribute sequencing rights. You could distribute 99% of sequencing rights through an auction and give the last 1% to friends or solo stakers to look good on L2Beat.” Finally, MEV may not even be such a big deal in the long run. This idea centres on a simple cost benefit analysis: Today, the bulk of blockchain revenues are coming from congestion fees, dwarfing a far smaller share of MEV revenues that is diminishing over time due to better MEV solutions. As such, the smarter rollup revenue model for rollups is one that banks on the greater network effects of congestion fees coming from synchronous composability, rather than MEV fees. As Justin Drake explained on the The Rollup podcast: “Congestion fees against contention fees is roughly at an 80:20 ratio today. 80% of the income on the [layer-1] comes from congestion fees — about 3200 eth per day since EIP-1559. MEV is about 800 ETH daily since the Merge. My thesis is that this ratio is becoming more extreme, going from 80:20 to something like 99:1.” In conclusion, the benefits of based rollups bring the user experience of Ethereum back full circle. There’s a sense of irony here, considering that these benefits were what blockchains already had from day one. Synchronous composability and layer-1 sequencing transactions have been the norm for all blockchains since the Bitcoin network’s genesis. This deviation of execution layer duties only happened due to the rollup-centric roadmap (or the multichain path in Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche) as of the last few years. Based rollups are ready to run it back. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

In his analysis, Master Kenobi also revealed what this sudden volatility means for the market. Where The Bitcoin Price Dominance Is Headed In an X post, Master Kenobi stated that the Bitcoin price dominance was meant to have begun its decline yesterday. However, the drop started 20 days earlier than anticipated. The crypto analyst added that. Having recorded three consecutive red weeks, Bitcoin’s dominance has entered a phase of volatility that could last for some time. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Falling Wedge Pattern, Why $2.8 Is A Possible Target From Here The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price dominance experienced this volatility phase for 136 days. If history were to repeat itself, this volatility won’t end until April 6 next year. Master Kenobi opined that the market is currently in the first and likely the most critical stage of capital rotation from Bitcoin profits. Once the market moves past this period of capital rotation, Master Kenobi predicts that a massive drop in dominance will follow, which, on the other hand, can be interpreted as the start of the altcoin season. Master Kenobi stated that even if the bull market extends beyond April 6, this period will likely be the most prolific for most altcoins. Master Kenobi noted that the bottom in the Bitcoin price dominance on May 14, 2021, coincided with the first peak of the crypto market during the 2021 bull run. The analyst expects a similar pattern to unfold this time around. Meanwhile, the analyst indicated that the bottom in the dominance could happen at the beginning of March instead of April 6. From The Bitcoin Halving Perspective Master Kenobi also used the Bitcoin halving date as a reference point to prove that the Bitcoin price dominance could move along with these timelines. He noted that in the previous cycle, there was a short interval (four days) between the one-year anniversary of the Bitcoin halving on May 11 and the first major bottom in dominance on May 15. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything In line with this, the analyst remarked that the timeline for the bottom in the Bitcoin price dominance (which would also mark the peak for the crypto market) can extend beyond April 20 to April 23, 2025. Master Kenobi cautioned that the exact date for the market peak cannot be pinpointed at this moment. However, as time passes, he believes that there is a likelihood that he will be able to pinpoint with greater accuracy the date when the first phase of the bull market will end.

The market regulator pushed the deadline to December 16 in the hope that Musk would file a response. US SEC Compromises on its Deadline to Elon Musk For a background into the matter, the securities regulator sent Elon Musk a settlement offer on Tuesday. The SEC requested a response in 48 hours, which should have been on December 12. Instead of his response, Musk shared a copy of a letter sent by his lawyer to Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, saying staff of the Commission gave him 48 hours to agree to pay a penalty or face charges. US SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS EXTENDED TIMELINE FOR ELON MUSK TO RESPOND TO SETTLEMENT OFFER IN TWITTER PROBE UNTIL MONDAY, SOURCE SAYS IF MUSK DOES NOT RESPOND SEC WOULD PROCEED TO A ‘WELLS SUBMISSION’ AND POTENTIAL NEW SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION, SOURCE SAYS — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 13, 2024 The decision to move the deadline to Monday, is in concession to a request for more time. It is not yet certain that the Tesla CEO will comply with the request of the court. His lawyer Alex Spiro referred to the recent SEC actions as nothing but an “endless investigation campaign” targeted at the Tesla boss. Per the extension granted, the case might proceed to the US SEC issuing Elon Musk a “Wells Submission” if he fails to comply. Notably, the tech billionaire has been webbed in legal chaos with the SEC for sometime. However, this time around, the agency is investigating his $44 billion takeover of Twitter, which Musk later rebranded to X. Precisely, SEC is checking to know whether Elon Musk broke securities laws when he bought X stock two years ago. Consequently, they are looking into statements and filings he made in relation to the deal. SEC has asked for court enforcement of a subpoena to compel Elon Musk to testify on the matter. The probe on Neuralink There is also a fresh investigation into Musk’s brain-computer interface (BCI) company, Neuralink. The call to probe the neurotechnology firm first surfaced in 2023. At the time, lawmakers questioned the safety of the company’s brain implant technology. Although Musk’s claimed it was safe, there were still some concerns. Till now, the securities regulator is yet to disclose the exact nature of these charges though it refers to it as a multi-year investigation. In the face of this situation, Elon Musk wrote: “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” Meanwhile, the court denied the Commission’s request to sanction Musk regarding the X acquisition deal for $44 billion last month.

Bonk (BONK) is now the leading Solana meme by market capitalization, after flipping Dogwifhat (WIF). Solana meme tokens are rearranging their influence. Bonk (BONK) flipped DogWifHat (WIF), reaching a total market cap of $2.99B. BONK is a relatively early mass-appeal meme, while WIF tapped its community for long-term holding. Both memes have gone through drawdowns of up to 70%, with both retail and whale activity. Meme tokens as a whole retained a total market capitalization of over $120B after a recent correction. Solana’s top assets make up about 10% of that market, with some fluctuation in the top 20 tokens. While Solana makes up to 80% of new token launches, only a handful of top tokens compete with the earlier batch of Ethereum-based memes. Solana meme traders have also shifted their profile in the past few weeks. There are fewer new traders and smaller weekly cohorts, with lowered DEX activity. The bulk of transactions come from repeat traders, experienced in the Solana ecosystem. Overall, Solana memes are trying to grab the spotlight from the earlier Ethereum-based dog-themed tokens. The Solana network carries five tokens with a market capitalization above $1B, a threshold of increased visibility. Most of the up-and-coming Solana tokens are hovering around $500M while waiting for a breakout. Solana DEX activity slowed down in the past few days, as seen by lowered fees for Raydium and JitoSOL. The Solana meme craze is now being replaced by a rollover to DeFi and Ethereum-based projects. Despite this, meme tokens are still highly active, offering short-term opportunities for outsized rallies. SOL also took a step back, trading at $221.69, after attention moved to BTC and other narratives. AI agent tokens boost Solana’s trades The recent attention on Solana assets comes from meme tokens linked to AI agents. Those assets are the most active ones. The top Solana assets in the past week include WIF, POPCAT, Luigi, BONK, Chillguy, FARTCOIN, and GOAT. AI agents extended their top position among the most mentioned topics in crypto, starting from the end of November. The trend may continue into 2025, as predicted by experts from the real a16Z. In total, the AI agent market expanded above a valuation of $10B, of which AI16Z made gains at around $1B in market capitalization. The AI16Z token rallied after MEXC prepared to list it in its Assessment zone, starting to trade this Friday. 🚨 #MEXC New Listing Alert! 📈 #AI16Z /USDT will be listed in the Assessment Zone on 2024-12-13 03:40 (UTC). @ai16zdao is the first venture capital firm led by Al agents. — MEXC (@MEXC_Official) December 13, 2024 AI agent meme tokens are one of the recent trends on Solana, which partially overlaps with general AI on-chain startups. The trend was started by Truth Terminal and the Numogram (GNON) bot, later spawning multiple social media profiles. Not all AI agent tokens are made equal, and some are abused by minor token projects for extra visibility. One of the AI-driven tokens to rally was FARTCOIN, a ticker selected almost as a joke. The token rallied to an all-time high of $0.76, driven by social media hype. The asset is not connected to any specific AI agent on social media but is considered a part of the AI agent narrative. AI agent tokens are the more recent meme creation, tapping the Solana ecosystem for a faster launch through Pump.fun. The ranking of AI agents on social media also coincides with their token performance. In the past few days, FARTCOIN lined up as the most influential mention by AI agents , driven by social media messages on X. AI agents still take up a significant part of the mindshare, evolving into agent-to-agent communication. New projects are also building infrastructure to allow the agents the ability to transact on-chain without additional human input or permission.

Before I even arrived at this year’s Africa Bitcoin Conference , I saw attendees posting about Tando , a new Kenya-based payments app that allows users to spend their sats with merchants who don’t accept bitcoin. Just arrived in Nairobi 🇰🇪🛬 & the 1st thing I see as I exit is the @tando_me sign LET’S GO @AfroBitcoinOrg 🙌🏾 pic.twitter.com/zhPSP2dTH8 — OKIN | Nikolai Tjongarero (@OKIN_17) December 8, 2024 “How is this possible?”, you might ask. Well, let me explain. To use Tando, you simply download the app and prepare to pay any merchant who accepts payments via M-PESA , Kenya’s mobile money service. (Notice I didn’t say you had to go through a set up or KYC process, as neither are necessary — Tando doesn’t collect any identifying information from its users.) When the merchant presents you with your bill, you simply click on the “Send Money” square on the app’s home screen. From there, you enter the mobile number tied to the M-PESA account to which you’re sending money and then input the amount of Kenyan shillings you want to send. The app automatically calculates the amount of sats it will take to cover the shilling amount you’ve input. You then click on the green “Create Invoice” button to obtain a Lightning invoice. After that, you copy the invoice and pay it via your preferred Lightning wallet. Tando receives the sats and then settles the bill in shillings with the merchant within seconds. I can barely count how many times I’ve watched Bitcoiners use Tando to pay restaurant bills or taxi fares since I’ve been here. (I’ve been to a lot of restaurants and have ridden in a lot of taxis since I’ve arrived.) Now, I know what some of you are thinking: Tando interfaces with a fiat payment system, which means it should be excommunicated from the Church of Bitcoin. But before you allow yourself to entertain that kind of thinking, please consider the following notions: You’re a loser. Here in Kenya, much like in other parts of Africa, people actually use bitcoin for payments. When you show someone how to use Tando, it provides you with an opportunity to show the merchant what Bitcoin is as you show them how the app works. (I watched Gorilla Sats ’ Brindon Mwiine masterfully do this for a waitress at a conference after party.) M-PESA requires that its users KYC and some Kenyan citizens don’t have the proper documentation to do so, which means they’re excluded from the system. Using Tando, they can be included in Kenya’s broader monetary system. The excitement around Tando at the conference was part of the broader enthusiasm around apps that make bitcoin easier to use across the African continent — apps like Bitsacco , Machankura , Fedi and Bitnob . Massive shout out to the devs making #Bitcoin wallets easier to use. @bitsacco @Machankura8333 @fedibtc @tando_me @Loicbtc pic.twitter.com/UhVw5bnBxO — Frank Corva (@frankcorva) December 11, 2024 African Bitcoiners are far ahead of their counterparts in the United States when it comes to using bitcoin as it is intended to be used — as peer-to-peer electronic cash. And while many Africans are working tirelessly to onboard as many merchants as they can to Bitcoin, Tando is an excellent intermediary step that allows Bitcoiners to spend their sats even if the merchants with whom they’re spending don’t yet accept bitcoin payments.",Tando|Opinion|Takes|Lightning|Payments|M-pesa,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2024-12-13 18:05:58

Despite the cryptocurrency’s recent rise and increasing institutional interest, Payne argued that Bitcoin’s volatile history and speculative nature could lead to an inevitable collapse, likening the scenario to the 2008 housing bubble. Bitcoin has experienced significant price swings over the years, with Payne pointing to historical declines of over 60% to 70% on multiple occasions. “If you’re running a business and holding cash in Bitcoin, that’s crazy,” Payne said, criticizing BTC as an unreliable store of value. Payne’s comments extended to MicroStrategy, a company heavily invested in Bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy have risen nearly 500% this year, largely driven by its $4 billion Bitcoin holdings. But Payne called the strategy risky and unsustainable, stressing that the company’s current valuation of around $90 billion is a far cry from its modest $500 million revenue generation. Related News: BREAKING: Developers of This Altcoin Sue Coinbase Over Delist Decision In comparison, Payne said a company like Enbridge Inc., with $50 billion in annual revenue and a 6% dividend yield, offers a much more stable and profitable investment. In contrast, MicroStrategy’s business model seems entirely dependent on Bitcoin’s price continuing to rise, which Payne describes as a “house of cards.” Asked if he would consider investing in Bitcoin during the current rally, Payne was adamant: “I don’t own Bitcoin and I’m not going to own it here. At some point, it’s going to crash.” He compared the situation to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when excessive leverage in the real estate market led to a dramatic decline as prices stopped climbing. He suggested that MicroStrategy could face a tough year if Bitcoin’s value declines. “This wouldn’t be their first crash,” Payne said, referring to the company’s troubles during the dot-com bubble. *This is not investment advice.

The company, in collaboration with Fireblocks, one of the well-known crypto infrastructure providers, intends to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin next year. This move is part of the group’s larger initiative to extend the use cases of digital euros, in line with the European Union’s new regulatory framework for digital assets. Stablecoins, characterized by their low volatility, have become increasingly popular among crypto traders and institutional investors, making this a strategic entry point for Oddo. Growing Competition in Europe’s Stablecoin Market Oddo’s move is reflective of broader momentum in Europe’s financial landscape as demand for stablecoins soars. This follows the launching by Societe Generale SA of its euro-pegged stablecoin, EUR, issued under EU regulatory guidelines. Strong competition already characterizes the European market, with big players such as Tether’s USDT, Centre’s USDC, and PayPal’s PYUSD already leading the charge in the global market. Other companies that have also shown interest in offering stablecoin solutions include Robinhood Markets and Revolut. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank has teamed up with Galaxy Digital to create AllUnity, a platform that will issue euro-denominated stablecoins among its suite of digital finance services. Oddo’s move just underscores how much more central stablecoins are becoming to Europe’s new financial landscape. Fireblocks: Powering Digital Asset Operations Fireblocks, Oddo’s technology partner of choice, is integral to this effort. With its reputation for secure wallet infrastructure and deep operational tools, Fireblocks supports more than 60 blockchain networks, making it a natural fit for integrating and managing stablecoin transactions. The platform’s capabilities go beyond security; it streamlines digital asset settlements , enabling institutions like Oddo to efficiently manage transactions while ensuring compliance with EU regulations. This positions Oddo for effective competition in a market characterized by rapid technological changes and strict regulatory oversight. The market for stablecoins continues to grow, meaning Oddo BHF’s move with Fireblocks may pave the way for greater mainstream use of digital euros in Europe, another step into blockchain for traditional finance.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-13 18:09:58

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 19:15:00

Near Protocol (NEAR) is showing a strong recovery after a recent correction, with analysts predicting more gains ahead. Meanwhile, XRP (Ripple) is causing quite the stir, with experts boldly claiming that XRP holders could become “filthy rich” thanks to its unique market position and ongoing adoption in global remittances. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , an emerging powerhouse that’s turning heads with its presale success. With over $5.9M raised and 318 million tokens sold, Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s redefining how crypto payments work. From eliminating volatility to integrating with Apple Pay, Qubetics is tackling real-life problems that its predecessors left unsolved. Let’s break down why these three are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Crypto Payment Revolution Qubetics isn’t playing around when it comes to innovation. Picture this: you’re running a small online store, and a customer in Europe wants to pay in XRP, while another in Asia prefers Bitcoin. Normally, this would be a nightmare of conversions, fees, and timing. But with Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet , these payments are auto-converted into your local currency—fast, secure, and hassle-free. That’s not all. The Qubetics wallet integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto payments as simple as grabbing coffee with your phone . It’s designed for everyone, whether you’re using iOS, Android, or a desktop. For freelancers, gig workers, and global businesses, this is a game-changer. Let’s talk numbers. At $0.0311 per token, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 12. Prices increase 10% every week, with a final phase jump of 20%. With over 9,000 holders and an expected post-presale price of $0.25, early investors could see a 900% ROI. That’s insane growth potential, and it’s happening now. Qubetics doesn’t just simplify crypto—it makes it practical. Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or managing a team, $TICS is setting the standard for what a modern financial tool should be. Near Protocol (NEAR): The Smart Contract Powerhouse Near Protocol is all about making blockchain accessible. Known for its user-friendly design and focus on scalability, NEAR is rapidly becoming a favorite among developers. It uses sharding technology to ensure the network can handle massive traffic without breaking a sweat—think of it as the blockchain version of a six-lane highway. After a recent pullback, NEAR is back on an uptrend, and investors are paying attention. Why? Because its ecosystem is expanding fast. From DeFi platforms to gaming and NFTs, NEAR is powering a wide range of applications. Plus, its low fees and lightning-fast transactions make it a solid choice for everyday use. What sets NEAR apart is its emphasis on user experience. Unlike many blockchains that require a steep learning curve, NEAR simplifies everything, even for first-time users. And with big-name partnerships and a growing community of developers, it’s clear that NEAR is here to stay. For anyone looking for one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, NEAR offers a mix of innovation, practicality, and growth potential. It might not have the hype of XRP or the crypto presale buzz of Qubetics, but it’s a project that’s quietly building a strong foundation for the future. XRP (Ripple): The Global Payments Leader XRP isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a movement. Designed for cross-border payments, Ripple is tackling one of the biggest issues in global finance: slow, expensive international transfers. By replacing traditional banking systems with blockchain technology, XRP makes sending money across borders as easy as sending an email. Here’s why people are bullish on XRP: global adoption is growing. Banks, payment providers, and financial institutions are increasingly using RippleNet to streamline remittances. This isn’t just speculation; it’s real-world use. And with recent regulatory clarity, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on its unique niche. Experts are making bold claims, saying XRP holders could become “filthy rich” as adoption increases. While that might sound like hyperbole, the fundamentals are strong. XRP’s speed, low cost, and scalability make it a top choice for institutions and individuals alike. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, XRP offers a mix of practicality and high growth potential. It’s not just a bet on crypto—it’s a bet on the future of money. Why Qubetics, Near Protocol, and XRP Are Must-Haves So, which crypto should you bet on? Honestly, why not all three? Qubetics ($TICS) is perfect for those looking to get in early on a project with massive ROI potential and real-world impact. Near Protocol (NEAR) offers innovation and scalability, making it a solid choice for long-term growth. And XRP is revolutionizing global payments, offering both practicality and huge upside. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Near Protocol (NEAR), and XRP (Ripple) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t miss out—2025 could be the year these projects take off!

In a tweet , Horsley stated that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is accelerating as traditional financial institutions integrate more crypto-savvy investors. He noted that the investment, made through one of the bank’s funds, marks a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. The name of the bank has not been disclosed yet. Bitwise Asset Management launched the first-ever Aptos staking exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange in November of this year. This investment vehicle is designed to deliver an expected return of 4.7% by staking Aptos’ APT tokens, providing investors with a regulated method to earn passive income through participation in blockchain activities. The launch of this product comes at a crucial period in the world of crypto investments, as Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETPs had been already introduced in the United States. Meanwhile, network activity on Aptos has been on an uptrend. Data compiled by Nansen, for instance, revealed that active addresses on the network hit 1.2 million this month. The newly released Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 also ranked Aptos as the second-fastest growing ecosystem in terms of overall developer activity. Comparing data from Q3 2023 to Q4 2024, Aptos experienced a whopping 96% growth in its developer community. Despite the recent developments, APT’s spot price has not experienced a significant uptick. In the past week, it saw a slight rise of 1.4%, trading at $14.19.While many other crypto assets have experienced significant rallies this month, APT only gained a little over 16% during the same period.

Matrixport Thinks So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-bitcoin-hit-160000-in-2025-matrixport-thinks-so/,"Singapore-based crypto service provider Matrixport predicts that Bitcoin may reach as high as $160,000 by 2025. In a newly released report, titled Matrix on Target (Issue #2024-112), the firm outlines a scenario in which increased institutional adoption, macroeconomic evolution, and broadening global liquidity could push the leading cryptocurrency to unprecedented levels. Why Bitcoin Will Reach $160,000 In 2025 Matrixport’s research team notes that Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 exceeded multiple key price projections and validated their previous analytical frameworks. According to the report, this strength has been propelled by institutional investors who embraced the Bitcoin ETF market. These investors have “realized substantial gains, incentivizing further allocation as we move into 2025,” states Matrixport. The report highlights Bitcoin’s emergence as a portfolio component, underscoring that “our analysis recommends a 1.55% allocation to achieve optimal diversification while maintaining portfolio stability.” This approach reflects Bitcoin’s gradual integration into traditional investment strategies, as well as its evolving status as a macro-relevant asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $250,000, Ethereum To $12,000: Here’s When, Says VC CIO Looking ahead, Matrixport’s analysis emphasizes the approaching “8% adoption threshold” that could signal a turning point for Bitcoin. Drawing parallels to other technologies that experienced exponential growth once this threshold was crossed. “Historically, technologies that cross this mark, such as smartphones and social media, experience exponential growth driven by network effects and broader accessibility. As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, it is poised to transition from a niche asset to a core component of global financial markets,” the firm forecasts. Matrixport also details a shift in market dynamics. Historically, Bitcoin’s cycles were defined by steep 80% retracements, but this pattern may be diminishing. The firm reports “a growing base of dip buyers and institutional support,” which it says reduces the probability of severe corrective phases. While temporary consolidations remain a part of market structure, Matrixport anticipates these to be “less pronounced, reflecting Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class.” Regarding specific price forecasts, Matrixport outlines a “+60% upside” as the market progresses into 2025, culminating in a $160,000 price target for Bitcoin. The report attributes this target to “sustained demand for Bitcoin ETFs,” supportive macroeconomic conditions, and an expansion in global liquidity. Related Reading: Australia’s Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First Matrixport’s proprietary Greed & Fear Index—a barometer for market sentiment—indicates stable conditions. The report claims that “the current consolidation phase may be shorter than previous ones,” with stabilized funding rates and normalized market conditions. In turn, the analysts see “the stage … set for renewed upward momentum.” Matrixport also calls attention to Bitcoin’s recent resilience, noting that “the swift recovery from recent overheated conditions” supports the notion that BTC price is well-positioned for another growth cycle. The overarching view remains optimistic. Matrixport concludes that “the outlook for 2025 remains bullish,” with Bitcoin’s track record as “an inflation hedge, and its integration into institutional portfolios suggest a transformative year ahead.” The firm concludes: “As adoption accelerates and the market matures, Bitcoin is positioned to achieve new all-time highs, further solidifying its role as a cornerstone of the global financial landscape.” At press time, BTC traded at $100,371.

By 2030, HBAR could trade between $1.89 and $2.10, with an average price of $2.02. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) cryptocurrency is one of the altcoins that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force to reckon with within the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market and the infamous LUNA incident, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

Image Source: Trading view On December 13, the 1-day HBAR/USDT chart showed a strong bullish trend, as evidenced by a consistent upward trajectory. The price is currently at $0.3077, above the 20-day SMA of $0.2487, indicating robust momentum. The RSI (14) sits at 65.17, showing strength indicating overbought territory. Bollinger Bands reflect high volatility, with the price approaching the upper band at $0.4038, suggesting potential resistance. Support is observed at $0.2487 and $0.0935. The chart indicates that while upward momentum persists, traders should monitor overbought levels and resistance zones for potential corrections. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Trading view The 4-hour HBAR/USDT chart shows consolidation, with the price currently at $0.3067. The Balance of Power indicator remains neutral, suggesting an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The MACD line at 0.0020 has crossed above the signal line at 0.0008, indicating a bullish divergence and potential upward momentum. Immediate support lies at $0.3002, with resistance at $0.3126. A break above $0.3126 could validate further upside, while failure to hold $0.3002 might result in a retest of lower levels. The chart reflects cautious optimism as traders wait for decisive movements to establish clearer trends. What to expect from HBAR price analysis next? Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts, HBAR exhibits bullish potential, with the price currently at $0.3077. The MACD on the 4-hour chart shows a bullish crossover, supporting near-term upward momentum. However, the Balance of Power indicator is neutral, suggesting cautious optimism. On the 1-day chart, the RSI of 65.17 indicates strong momentum, indicating overbought conditions, implying a potential slowdown or consolidation. Resistance at $0.4038 remains a critical level to breach for continued upside, while $0.2487 serves as key support. Overall, a short-term rally is likely, but traders should monitor resistance levels and overbought conditions for pullbacks.

Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $1.89 and $2.10, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.73 by 2025 and $2.10 by 2030.

This incident underscores the ongoing risks of phishing scams, which can affect multiple assets and remain undetected for extended periods. The user had purchased the device directly from Ledger, and the seed phrase was securely stored, highlighting that even with proper security measures, users can still fall victim to sophisticated phishing attacks.

These assets encompass tokenized assets and stablecoins. Firms have until March 24, 2025, to submit their responses. The PRA emphasized that the information will inform its policymaking, including calibrating prudential frameworks for managing ‘cryptoasset’ exposures. This initiative aligns with the global Basel framework , which guides the prudential treatment of cryptoassets.

Back in July, the Bank for International Settlements partnered with the Bank of England on a pilot project called “Project Pyxtrial” to track stablecoins’ reserves. The project hoped to help regulators with near real-time data on stablecoins’ liabilities and backing assets, utilizing data collection, storage, and analysis technologies. Similarly, the current data collection request aims to analyze the costs and benefits of potential regulatory approaches and establish a baseline for monitoring developments in the sector, according to the statement. Not all firms are required to submit a response. The PRA clarified that only entities with relevant cryptoasset exposures or activities need to provide information. However, firms are asked to complete sections of the data template that apply to their operations. A “nil return” is not required from those without exposure.

Whales Acquire 590 Million Tokens appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, appears to be consolidating within a tight range for over a week. Amid this consolidation and the market uncertainty, crypto whales and long-term holders have shown strong interest in the altcoin, following the formation of a bullish price action pattern, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment . Crypto Whales Add Over $1 Billion Worth of XRP Despite the price remaining in a tight range, data reveals that whales and long-term holders have seized this opportunity to significantly accumulate the tokens. Investors holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP tokens have reportedly accumulated an additional 590 million XRP, worth $1.29 billion. Furthermore, the data indicates that these whales collectively hold 8.91 billion XRP tokens. Source: Santiment These substantial accumulations of XRP tokens indicate the interest and confidence of long-term investors and crypto whales. This notable acquisition reduces selling pressure, hints at a potential upside rally, and suggests an ideal buying opportunity. However, despite these accumulations, the XRP price has remained neutral, with no major price changes observed, although it has formed a bullish pattern on its daily chart. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP appears to be forming a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily time frame and is currently struggling to breach this pattern. Based on the analysis, if XRP breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 80% to reach the $4.50 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View On a positive note, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 62, which is below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset still has enough room to rally further. XRP price momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41 and has experienced a price decline of 0.52% in the past 24 hours.

In a new announcement, The Bank of England says that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – the UK’s financial regulator – is looking to gather data on firms’ current and future exposure to crypto assets. “This [data] will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on crypto assets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures, analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options and providing an updated view of firms’ current and intended crypto asset-related business activities as a base from which to monitor the financial stability implications of these assets.” Some of the disclosure requirements include any business related to digital assets and how the bank profits from it, risk management policies of the bank toward crypto, a rundown of how the bank reports its crypto assets, and the most significant crypto-related risks the firms are exposed to and how they plan to manage them, according to the PRA’s questionnaire. “The decision to hold crypto assets (either under trading or banking book) and provide services to crypto asset operators must be fully consistent with the bank’s risk appetite and strategic objectives as set down and approved by the board, as well as with senior management’s assessment of the bank’s risk management capabilities.” According to the PRA’s second framework for crypto assets, which was released in 2022, firms still cannot completely mitigate the risks of using permissionless blockchains.

CN: Vlad, can you elaborate on the future of the meme coin sector? Do you think meme coins can transform from hype-driven assets to solid, long-term performers, especially in light of recent headlines about the meme coin hype cooling down? VG: Meme coins are a quintessential reflection of the new investment culture. At first glance, they might seem like frivolous creations with no intrinsic value, purchased purely for entertainment or speculative purposes. However, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin was once in a similar position. In its early days, Bitcoin had no tangible value — its worth was built on a collective belief in its potential. This phenomenon mirrors broader financial markets, whether in stocks or other investment spaces, where community confidence helps companies achieve valuations 100 or 200 times their annual revenues or profits. Similarly, meme coin communities, often million-strong, hold onto their tokens not because of inherent utility but because of a shared belief in the token’s future. For some, the appeal lies in the humor or ideology behind the memes; for others, it’s the perceived “uselessness” that makes these coins intriguing. Memes themselves have become intertwined with events and various ideas, embedding them firmly in modern cultural expressions. So, meme coins have solidified their place as a phenomenon that isn’t likely to fade anytime soon. Their market capitalization continues to set records, with year-to-date price changes exceeding 10,000%. As one of the fastest-growing niches in the bull market, meme coins now rank fourth behind currencies, chains, and stablecoins. The world’s most influential people, like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, align themselves with the meme coin culture, demonstrating their understanding of the movement that resonates with large audiences. Market researchers project the meme coin sector has the potential to surpass $1 trillion, signaling that we’re at the beginning of a new cycle that could drive mass adoption. Yet, can meme coins transform into sustainable, long-term investment vehicles? The answer is likely no. They are more apt to remain speculative instruments, prone to delivering astronomical returns. Take $POPCAT, which alone has surged over 6,400% in 2024. However, this dynamic isn’t entirely different from that of other cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the driving force behind meme coins is the same as that for any digital asset: community sentiment. One thing that can improve meme coins’ position is utility. And this is where Meme Bank enters the picture. You might also like: Vote for the best crypto project! CN: But how can Meme Bank ensure its utility-driven approach will resonate in a market that prioritizes excitement over real value? VG: The goal of Meme Bank isn’t to diminish the emotional value, excitement, or hype surrounding meme coins; in fact, it amplifies them by transforming this energy into a foundation for creating tailored products that empower specific meme coins with practical use cases. These products enhance the functionality of meme coins, offering features that integrate them into everyday activities. In doing so, Meme Bank not only strengthens and expands the utility of meme coins but also boosts its visibility and investment appeal. CN: Can you elaborate on the utilities Meme Bank will provide to meme token holders and what the potential use cases for it are? VG: Utility refers to the ability of a coin to perform specific functions that provide tangible benefits or support a broader economy. Take Binance Coin, which creates consistent demand through clear functionality, including reduced transaction fees of 25–30% on Binance. Additionally, holders who stake BNB contribute to its ecosystem, as portions of the token are utilized, burned, or repurchased, ensuring its active integration within Binance’s operations. In the meme coin world, communities like BONK occasionally distribute NFTs or rewards to top holders, but such initiatives fall short of offering true utility. Acting as a crypto bank for meme coins, Meme Bank will enable these tokens to serve as functional currencies for transactions, exchanges, and withdrawals. Users can even issue Visa and Mastercard cards featuring unique meme designs, deposit their meme coins onto these cards, and use them globally for shopping, bill payments, and more. These practical applications will also generate revenue through transaction fees paid by users when they send meme coins to a card or make any other transactions. This revenue can be further reinvested into the ecosystem. For example, if a million transactions generate $10 million in fees, $5 million could be allocated to reducing meme token supply via buybacks and burns, increasing scarcity and value. Alternatively, users could stake their meme coins within the Meme Bank ecosystem and earn a share of the revenue as a reward. Through these mechanisms, Meme Bank will foster stronger, more engaged meme coin communities. Initially, Meme Bank will focus on working with meme coin communities, developing tailored solutions to meet their specific needs. Over time, the platform will open up to broader participation, allowing any community to vote for a given meme coin to gain a dedicated meme bank platform. Governance will be community-driven through DAO mechanisms, enabling members to influence key decisions such as card designs, transaction fees, and other banking features. CN: The CHO token will be integrated into every Meme Bank transaction — what advantages and benefits will this bring to the Choise.ai ecosystem? VG: The resources for developing Meme Bank are provided by Choise.ai and Vault, a leading provider of white-label crypto banking solutions. They equip Meme Bank with the necessary infrastructure to launch meme banks swiftly and efficiently. Vault already supports over 50 enterprises worldwide, typically generating revenue by charging clients for its services. However, with the Meme Bank platform, meme coin communities will be able to launch their own dedicated meme banks without the need for licenses or significant upfront investments. Instead, Vault will leverage the Meme Bank project to showcase its own solutions to vibrant, large-scale meme coin communities, driving millions of transactions. Choise.ai and its extensive community of CHO token holders stand to benefit from each of these transactions. A portion of the revenue will be allocated to burning CHO tokens, increasing their scarcity and value. This process will take place seamlessly in the background, without affecting the meme coins themselves. To ensure transparency and foster engagement, real-time dashboards will display burning volumes. Choise.ai and Vault strongly believe in the vast potential of meme coin communities. The top three meme coin ecosystems — DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE — already boast over 7 million token holders, many of whom are actively profiting from these assets or aspiring to do so. Meme Bank represents a groundbreaking initiative to unlock this potential further, propelling meme coin trading far beyond its current 11-digit volume. CN: If you could sum up Meme Bank’s mission in a single word or phrase, what would it be? VG: Meme Bank’s mission is to become the premier utility provider for meme coins, elevating their functionality while maintaining their hype and emotional allure.",Interviews|Interview|Meme Coin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-13 19:43:40

Digital assets are tipped to revolutionize the sector, enhance cross-border payments and increase adoption. Trump and pro-crypto executives believe sectors’ use cases, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi), could give consumers control and help cushion the effects of negative macro trends. United States To Become A Leader A major campaign promise of Trump’s team is to make the country a leader in crypto and other emerging technologies like blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Trump pledged support for the crypto industry to boost innovation in the country. The former President also tipped a strategic Bitcoin Reserve as his administration seeks to end asset sales. This led to an upswing in momentum because the US adopting Bitcoin could open up wider channels into major jurisdictions. Senator Cynthia Lummis pushed for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill to allow the government to acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold over the next 20 years. Notably, Trump wants the country to be ahead of China and Russia, amongst others, in crypto. “… yeah I think so, we’re gonna do something great with crypto cause we don’t want China not just China, others are embracing it and we want to be ahead. We want to be ahead AI and we are going to produce tremendous amounts of electricity… we need more than twice what we already have.” A Shift From The Biden Administration President Biden has been criticized for his administration’s stance on crypto assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed several lawsuits against industry leaders and firms, lowering overall sentiments. This hostile regulation by enforcement approach on the sector led to an exodus to friendly jurisdictions. Crypto enthusiasts expect comprehensive regulations on several aspects of the market to usher in a new wave of adoption and innovation.",Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-13 19:43:56

Now, a new AI-driven token priced at a mere $0.06 is attracting attention. With projections aiming for a staggering 10,000% return by 2025, it presents a potential chance to enter at the ground level. This development could be the next significant player in the digital currency arena. $CYBRO Targets 1000% Growth Post-Listing With $7 Million Raised CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace, is about to hit a major milestone with its Token Generation Event (TGE). After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on Gate.io and other major exchanges — and it’s happening on December 14th. During the presale, $CYBRO’s price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project. Join CYBRO Before the Listing Frenzy Drives Prices to the Moon What’s behind the hype? CYBRO combines cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly platform, offering tools like staking, farming, and lending that make DeFi investing accessible to everyone — from cautious newcomers to bold risk-takers. During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation. And there’s more to come. CYBRO’s roadmap through 2025 promises features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and even smarter AI tools, cementing its place as a game-changer in decentralized finance. With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it’s built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Solana and SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and supports apps, competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It aims for faster transactions through its design and offers flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana’s own cryptocurrency and plays a central role in its network. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards supporters. SOL holds value by underpinning Solana’s operations, rewarding participants, and giving users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on splitting its network or adding extra layers to improve scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network suitable for hosting demanding products and services. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, established coins like SOL may offer limited short-term gains. CYBRO, however, emerges as a powerful opportunity for significant returns. This advanced DeFi platform uses AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize investor earnings. With attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO enhances the user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Its commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality has drawn strong interest from major investors and influencers. CYBRO stands out as a promising project poised for substantial growth in the dynamic crypto market.

The new trusts add to the crypto firm’s more than 25 existing digital asset products. Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research, praises the two altcoin projects for the benefits they bring to the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem. “Lido is helping to democratize staking on Ethereum, and Optimism is critical in allowing Ethereum to scale to compete with newer, faster layer-1 blockchains. Grayscale Lido DAO Trust and Grayscale Optimism Trust provide investors with exposure to protocols helping to increase Ethereum’s efficiency, security, scalability, and adoption within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem – playing a critical role in the Ethereum story.” OP is trading for $2.52 at time of writing, up 7.6% in the last 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto analyst Astekz sees a bright future for Shiba Inu (SHIB) as DTX Exchange (DTX) and Ripple (XRP) show bullish indicators. Table of Contents Astekz: Shiba Inu has parabolic potential DTX Exchange: A presale star with 500% growth XRP price rises, indicators point to more growth SHIB, DTX, XRP: The first altcoin to surge The crypto market is seeing big price movements, with tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) soaring. Well-known crypto analyst Astekz has forecasted a bullish scenario for SHIB as XRP shows technical indicators in the buy zone. Amid this movement, DTX Exchange (DTX) has shocked investors with its ICO event, with its price rising by 500%. Many experts hint that this crypto coin could be the next 4x token in 2025. Astekz: Shiba Inu has parabolic potential Shiba Inu is one of the meme coin titans known for their strong communities. Analyst Astekz excited this community with his Shiba Inu price forecast. In a new X post, Astekz said that the Shiba Inu price may see a parabolic rise from its current price. Data shows that SHIB has soared from around $0.000025 to over $0.000027 on the one-month chart. The technicals for SHIB also show good signs. The meme coin is valued above its 30-day EMA ($0.000026) and its 50-day EMA ($0.000024). Furthermore, its bull-bear power sits at −0.0000036 in the buy zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. DTX Exchange: A presale star with 500% growth DTX Exchange is making waves in the crypto market with its great presale performance. Notably, this rookie has already given early buyers a 500% return. Since its presale is currently in phase six, more price increases are expected as there are plenty of stages left. The recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin could also open the door to millions of new traders to set their eyes on it. The DTX Exchange will give access to over 120k asset classes like stocks, gold, and crypto coins at 1000x leverage and transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. Traders are also interested in the DTX token because of all the perks they will get by holding it. For example: Governance voting rights: The ability to vote on important issues concerning the future of DTX Exchange. Revenue-sharing model: DTX holders will get a portion of the trading fee revenue generated by the platform. Staking: DTX stakers will earn up to 15% APY in staking rewards. Currently, one DTX costs $0.12. This price is 500% higher than when this crypto ICO event started at $0.02. Once phase seven starts, DTX will cost $0.14. Not only that, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20, providing a 66% return for those who buy the altcoin at current prices. XRP price rises, indicators point to more growth XRP is an altcoin showing signs of a breakout. The coin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.31). Furthermore, its bull-bear power has an indicator of 0.16 in the buy zone, suggesting bulls could push its value up. The Ripple price has grown over 300% on the one-month chart. In that period, its value moved between $0.58 and $2. Crypto analyst Amonyx took note of this XRP performance. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the next move will be massive for the coin, suggesting a potential surge to $64. SHIB, DTX, XRP: The first altcoin to surge Although SHIB and XRP could see gains down the line, many experts are focusing on DTX. The 500% growth in its ongoing presale shows the potential that it has to surge in a fast period. Since DTX will have a smaller market cap than its peers, it will need less money for its price to rise. Thus, experts foresee a potential 4x surge for DTX in 2025.

The last dip, which saw the asset’s price below the level, triggered diverse reactions as traders repositioned holdings. Flows into Bitcoin and other crypto assets have flipped green in the last 48 hours. On-chain data shows a crypto whale purchased 2000 BTC in two transactions at different price points. The first transaction of 1000 BTC, approximately $96.8 million, occurred on Dec 10. This came as whales sought to buy the dip, setting sights on a higher price. Bitcoin traded at $96,749 at the time of this transaction and has taken an upward turn. On Dec 12, the whale purchased another 1000 BTC for $101 million. Both transactions have attracted a positive spark from the community. As Bitcoin prices increase, traders have projected similar swings in the coming months. Wider Market Accumulation Spikes This whale’s transfer is one of several leading to heightened sentiments in the crypto market. According to data from Lookonchain , after the asset’s price reclaimed $100K, a whale swooped 201 BTC worth approximately $20.3 million. The holder has amassed 1,502 BTC worth $152 million since Nov 24. This year ushered several events that led to increased Bitcoin adoption. Institutional inflows picked up after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. These inflows led to a rising price and multiple all-time highs. As firms continue to raise projections across the next five years, whale accumulations will be seen across the ecosystem. Meanwhile, the number of assets in centralized exchanges has declined in the last 30 days. This upward signal shows traders preparing for a long-term holding period. “ When we examine the data, we see that a large amount of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from spot exchanges, especially in recent days. This data, observed while the price is rising, indicates that investors are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin. It seems that investors are anticipating new all-time high (ATH) levels for Bitcoin,” a CryptoQuant analyst wrote. Aside from Bitcoin, altcoins have recorded massive inflows since the US elections. A spike in BTC price impacts the wider market, with traders moving funds to altcoins and meme tokens in anticipation of more gains. This leads to an altcoin season , which is seen after a major jump in Bitcoin prices.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-13 19:53:35

If SHIB surpasses the nearest resistance level at $0.00003759, it could target the next resistance at $0.00004443, which is a significant increase from current levels. The MACD level suggests bullish momentum may be building. With the altcoin season approaching, SHIB has potential to rise further, attracting attention from investors looking for promising opportunities.

With over 30 million users spanning 170 countries and daily trading volumes topping $7 billion, MEXC offers a global stage for $CYBRO to expand its reach and liquidity. Earlier, CYBRO announced its debut on Gate.io , another top-tier CEX. Boasting 19 million active users and an average daily trading volume of $8 billion, this platform opens the door to a wider audience , so it could further cement CYBRO’s presence in the crypto market. On both exchanges, users will be able to trade the CYBRO/USDT pair starting December 14, 2024. Notably, CYBRO is approaching the listings phase on a strong footing. On December 3rd, it successfully concluded a presale of $CYBRO tokens 20 days ahead of its initially planned completion at the end of December. The presale enabled CYBRO to raise $7 million in initial funding and attract nearly 20,000 holders. Furthermore, CYBRO burned 500 million tokens in November to ensure greater price stability. These developments reflect CYBRO's ongoing efforts to expand its footprint in the decentralized finance sector. CYBRO’s Impact on the Evolution of Decentralized Finance CYBRO has entered the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with a mission to streamline investing for both seasoned players and newcomers. It strives to address critical pain points that have long hindered user adoption and satisfaction. One of the biggest challenges in DeFi is navigating the revenue intransparency. Promises of high yields often come with shifting parameters or poorly communicated risks, leaving investors in the dark. CYBRO counters this by offering clear and consistent projections, paired with transparent strategies that give users a firm grasp on potential earnings. Portfolio management, another weak link in the DeFi chain, sees a marked upgrade with CYBRO. Missing timely alerts about inactive pools or declining returns could leave users vulnerable to missed opportunities. CYBRO’s real-time updates and tracking tools aim to keep investors ahead of the curve. The user experience in DeFi also remains a significant barrier, especially for newcomers. Complex interfaces can lead to confusion and errors. CYBRO counters this with a streamlined onboarding process, AI-driven investment tools , and straightforward return tracking capabilities. These achievements will soon be complemented by upcoming features designed to further enhance the user experience. CYBRO’s Next Steps CYBRO is rolling out a series of innovations designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more user-friendly and efficient. Two standout features are Zap-in and AI-Broker, each addressing specific needs within the DeFi space. Zap-in streamlines the process of depositing and withdrawing funds by allowing users to transact in tokens that differ from the pool's native currency. This eliminates the often cumbersome process of converting tokens. Meanwhile, AI-Broker , slated for release in Q1 2025, is an advanced assistant powered by artificial intelligence. This tool will enable users to design and manage custom on-chain investment strategies. In addition, CYBRO plans to integrate fiat functionality into its ecosystem, a milestone that could significantly broaden its appeal to traditional investors. The upcoming wallet with a payment card feature will allow users to seamlessly convert their crypto earnings into fiat and spend them as they would with conventional currency. This development is expected to enhance liquidity input and output, making the platform more accessible to users unfamiliar with DeFi mechanics. These improvements highlight CYBRO’s commitment to empowering users of all experience levels to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance with ease and confidence.

Bitcoin Suisse shared the forecast in its outlook for the next year, with key points including the U.S. adopting a Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve as other countries follow and BTC trading to an all-time high above $180’000. The Swiss-regulated crypto startup also foresees financial giants stepping up to unveil institutional rollups on Ethereum ( ETH ). However, one of its biggest projections for 2025 is that Ethereum-staking ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs. “While Bitcoin ETFs shattered records with $32B in net flows and IBIT now approaching $50B in AUM in just 225 trading days, we project a structural shift of flows into ETH ETFs in the post-election environment.” Bitcoin Suisse Outlook 2025. Read more: Bitwise CIO: Ethereum ETFs came too early Bitcoin Suisse points to key fundamentals for its Ethereum ETFs 2025 prediction. One of these is the risk-reward proposition Ether ETFs offer as institutional demand surges. An example is the flip in capital flows in November, which had Ethereum ETFs outpacing Bitcoin ETFs in daily flows – $332.9 million for ETH compared to $320 million for BTC. ETH’s underperformance was more due to Bitcoin having a head start as an established narrative. The regulatory headwinds that surrounded staking yields also contributed. Removing these bottlenecks could cause ETH ETFs to take off massively. “Under the new Trump administration, we expect a swift approval for ETH staking in ETFs, eventually unlocking a 3-4% yield, which strongly caters to institutional allocators and is particularly compelling in a declining rate environment. We project that staking yields will disproportionately benefit Ethereum and emerge as the primary catalyst for sustained constructive flows into ETH ETFs.” Other projections for 2025 include the approval of new crypto ETFs, the startup predicts. Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) lead this race, having seen multiple issuers file applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You might also like: Rep.

As per the report , the publicly traded crypto holding previously identified as Cypherpunk gave the update on Thursday. The announcement came after its stock, with the ticker HODL on the Canadian Securities Exchange, registered a 2,336% spike. This figure represents its growth between July and now. Sol Strategies Makes Play for Nasdaq Listing According to Leah Wald, Chief Executive of Sol Strategies, the move to list positions the company to increase liquidity. It also guarantees accessibility to investors in multiple markets. A strategic angle to the listing is that Sol Strategies can capitalize on investment opportunities within the Solana ecosystem. This ensures that the firm’s operational costs are covered without liquidating its long-term holdings. Beyond these, listing on the Nasdaq will increase liquidity, brand visibility, and a broader investor base. Sol Strategies’ commitment to the Solana ecosystem has grown as it currently holds over 142,000 SOL tokens, estimated at $32 million (or 46 million Canadian dollars). The company has acquired four additional Solana validators, with staking now a critical part of the Sol Strategies approach. What is Driving the Transition from Bitcoin to Solana? As “Cypherpunk Holdings” bet huge on Bitcoin, the company offered a path for investors interested in getting crypto exposure. However, market dynamics have shifted, and Bitcoin exposure is readily available through exchange-traded products, crypto exchanges, and other options. Since Wald assumed her role as CEO, the company has greatly reduced its Bitcoin holdings from hundreds to just about 3 BTC. This shift occurred before Bitcoin surged to the $100,000 price level. Wald explained that the shift from Bitcoin aligned with the company’s decision to embrace Solana. Its move on Solana mirrors the earlier Bitcoin bet. Sol Strategies might be betting on increased demand for exposure to the Solana ecosystem . Already, Solana is making waves in attracting new developers to the ecosystem and recently surpassed Ethereum on this front. Commitment to Solana Ecosystem Development Sol Strategies has consistently focused on expanding its portfolio investment in Solana-based startups. According to Wald, efforts were made to collaborate with the developer communities to promote innovation. It aims to do this via grants, educational programs, and partnerships.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global alleges that Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC was to promote its own competing product, cbBTC, that has caused massive financial losses and deteriorated consumer confidence in wBTC. We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC (wBTC) on December 19, 2024, on or around 12pm ET. — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) November 19, 2024 The lawsuit covers allegations of attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, claims of predatory practices to undermine wBTC’s market position and accusations of false statements implying wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Lawsuit Claims Coinbase Delisted WBTC to Gain Monopoly The lawsuit further alleged that Coinbase’s listings of meme coins and tokens such as Dogwifhat (WIF), Pepe (PEPE) and Mog Coin (MOG) that have “no inherent value” proves that the exchange delisted WBTC in a bid to have a monopoly over the industry. It also restated that delisting WBTC in place of these memecoins proves that the exchange did not follow any defined listing standards. “Like all the centralized tech giants before it, Coinbase gives lip service to the innovation of a decentralized world,” the firm’s lawsuit noted. “But in the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab.” Notably, Coinbase launched its own wrapped Bitcoin token in September, called Coinbase Wrapped BTC, or cbBTC. Last month, it delisted WBTC citing that it did not meet the exchange’s listing standards. Coinbase Capturing Market Share However, BiT Global alleged Friday that this was an unfair business practice. “Having decided to copycat WBTC with its own product, Coinbase resorted to unfair and deceptive tactics that long been used by tech giants to crush their competition,” BiT Global’s lawsuit noted. The crypto custodian stated in the lawsuit that WBTC’s circulation fell by 5% within two weeks of its delisting. They argued this was evidence that Coinbase aimed to capture WBTC’s market share for itself. The BitGlobal complaint noted that Coinbase’s decision to list Mog just two weeks after delisting wBTC shows that the decision had “nothing to do with standards and everything to do with unfairly and fraudulently pushing wBTC out of the market.” Lawsuit Seeks $1 Billion! The suit was filed by law firm Kneupper & Covey in the Northern District of California. “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space,” stated attorney Kevin Kneupper. “If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” Notably, the lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and includes demands for injunctive relief to prevent further harm​.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|MOG,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-13 20:02:50

Following his election as the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Hill emphasized the need for clear regulatory frameworks to support the growing digital asset sector. As part of his plans, Hill will focus on developing a market structure for digital assets during the first 100 days of his leadership. Rep. French Hill’s Crypto Agenda: Market Structure and Stablecoin Regulation During an interview on CNBC , French Hill discussed his top priorities for the coming year. He expressed the need for a structured regulatory framework for digital assets, emphasizing the absence of clear guidelines under the current system. Hill pointed out that, under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the industry has been subject to “regulation by enforcement,” which he believes hinders innovation. Hill has called for a more structured approach to crypto regulations to support technological progress in blockchain and Web3 applications. French Hill also indicated that stablecoins will be a key focus. He noted that House Majority Leader Steve Scalise plans to introduce a bill during the first 100 days of the new Congress. This will establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins. Moreover, the U.S. Representative, recently appointed as the next Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has pledged to tackle politically motivated debanking practices. Hill plans to investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . His goal is to ensure fairness, transparency, and regulatory integrity Plans for Regulatory Clarity in Digital Asset Space As the newly appointed chair of the House Financial Services Committee , French Hill intends to address the lack of regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. He has been an advocate for defining a clear market structure that would provide stability and encourage innovation. Many in the crypto industry have supported Hill’s call for comprehensive crypto regulations. These regulations, he believes, will create an environment where businesses can thrive while ensuring consumer protection. The push for a regulatory framework aligns with Hill’s ongoing work with the committee’s digital asset subcommittee. As a former chair of the subcommittee, he has already led efforts to shape cryptocurrency policies. He aims to continue that momentum in his new role by working closely with industry stakeholders and other lawmakers. French Hill has garnered support from various industry groups for his proactive stance on digital asset legislation. The DeFi Education Fund and the Blockchain Association have expressed their backing, noting his experience in digital asset policy. In addition to his focus on crypto regulations , Hill has also addressed broader financial issues, including improving capital formation and banking regulations. However, during the interview, when asked about a bitcoin reserve, Hill responded, “I understand why some people are attracted to that, I’d have to think long and hard about what the value of that is to the United States or the Treasury.” The post US Rep French Hill Discusses Crypto Plans Under New Role appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|cryptocurrency regulation|Stablecoins Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-13 20:03:02
