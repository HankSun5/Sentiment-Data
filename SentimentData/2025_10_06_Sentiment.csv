52716556,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85450,1759690959,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Reveals Next Target as XRP Prepares for Bullish Flag Breakout,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-next-target-as-xrp-prepares-for-bullish-flag-breakout/,"XRP’s recent price movement has gained attention as a well-known crypto analyst, Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), shared a video showing what he described as a breakout in progress. The chart he displayed shows XRP trading within a bullish flag , a pattern that traders often watch closely for signs of renewed upward momentum. The bullish flag began forming in January after XRP’s remarkable 500% surge, and the asset has stayed within it for most of 2025. However, the candles now appear to be breaking out of this flag, and this could signal the start of a rapid upward move. $5 #XRP .. (This is Actually Insane) pic.twitter.com/XWjrwCIsyr — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 4, 2025 XRP’s Next Targets The chart highlights several Fibonacci extension levels that align with resistance zones. These levels, from previous price swings, indicate where traders might expect XRP to meet short-term resistance if its upward move continues. XRP’s rise to an all-time high of $3.65 in July helped it test the upper boundary of the bullish flag, and $3.6 is the next target Steph highlighted on the chart. This level aligns with the Fibonacci 1.618 extension, and could open the door to further gains once breached. He added that the following levels to monitor are $4 and $4.65, with the potential for the price to extend even higher if momentum strengthens. These figures correspond to the Fibonacci 2 and 2.618 extensions displayed on his chart, which are often used by traders to estimate possible continuation targets after a breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The final target is $5.7, which sits at the Fibonacci 3.618 extension level, just below the $5.85 target recently set by another prominent analyst. Steph referred to a $5 XRP price as “insane,” and this level would cement XRP as one of the best performers in the crypto space. A sustained rally toward this point would also signal a significant change in sentiment and could attract more traders back to the market. Is a Breakout Coming? The bullish flag’s upper boundary has served as dynamic resistance for several months, and XRP’s attempt to move above it indicates that buyers may be regaining control. The volume accompanying this move will be crucial in confirming whether the breakout can sustain itself beyond the short term. Analysts often stress the importance of waiting for confirmation before assuming a breakout has completed. For XRP, maintaining price action above the upper boundary of the bullish flag would validate this shift. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Expect profit-taking in altcoins while BTC-driven ETF inflows continue to set market direction. Zcash (ZEC) surged ~140% and led weekly gains. MYX Finance (MYX) plunged ~67%, driven by negative funding rates and deleveraging. Bitcoin dominance rose to a six-week high, signaling a BTC-led risk-on rally with heavy ETF inflows. Meta description: Crypto weekly winners and losers: ZEC led gains while MYX plunged — read the concise market summary, key levels, and trading implications. Stay informed. What were the crypto weekly winners and losers? Crypto weekly winners and losers were led by Zcash (ZEC) as the biggest gainer and MYX Finance (MYX) as the largest decliner. Bitcoin dominance climbed to a six-week high, fueling a BTC-led rally while select mid-cap altcoins posted outsized moves amid record ETF inflows. How did Bitcoin dominance shape this week’s performance? Higher Bitcoin dominance concentrated gains in BTC and pressured many altcoins under key resistance. ETF inflows and rotation into BTC created a risk-on environment, but individual altcoin strength remained idiosyncratic — driven by catalysts, liquidity, and social momentum. Weekly winners Zcash [ZEC] — Privacy token posted a triple-digit jump Zcash topped the leaderboard with a ~140% rally, reclaiming attention after prolonged sideways trade since December’s $60 peak. The push began with a clean breakout early in Q4 and accelerated mid-week with a near-vertical move. About 62% of weekly gains arrived on October 1st, producing a rapid run that tests momentum and conviction. Short-term risk includes overextension; a corrective dip to $120–$130 would be healthy if bulls fail to hold near-term support. Source: TradingView (ZEC/USDT) SPX6900 [SPX] — Memecoin breakout off support SPX rallied ~57% to $1.50, recovering September losses and regaining August levels. Weekly momentum on the weekly chart suggests room to run, though daily RSI hints at possible short-term topping. SPX’s breakout off $1 support sets a $2 retest as a near-term target if market risk appetite persists. DeXE [DEXE] — DeFi bulls regain control DeXE climbed ~28% after two choppy days, posting back-to-back strong sessions that pushed price to $13 — the highest since June. A formed base at $9 and a higher low at $10 suggest a constructive setup for a move toward $15 on sustained momentum. Other notable winners Smaller-cap altcoins posted spectacular percent gains: GeorgePlaysClashRoyale (CLASH) +752%, DeAgentAI (AIA) +733%, MetaDAO (META) +338% — classic volatility from low-liquidity names. Weekly losers MYX Finance [MYX] — DeFi platform lost 67% on deleveraging MYX led weekly losses with a ~67% drop from the $16 open, driven by funding rates turning negative (-0.0033%), heavy short positioning, and forced liquidations. The move sliced through $8 support and erased September gains. Derivatives metrics remain essential to monitor for signs of stabilization or further deleveraging; normalized funding rates could precede a tactical dip-buy opportunity. Source: TradingView (MYX/USDT) DoubleZero [2Z] — Volatility and social-driven sell-off 2Z lost ~27%, reacting to insider-trading allegations circulated on social platforms. Despite founder clarifications, shorting pressure and sentiment-driven flows amplified downside risk. MemeCore [M] — First weekly red after four months MemeCore fell ~17% after a 27% intraday drop earlier in the week. The retracement erased September gains and tested the $2 support zone — a level to watch for potential consolidation or further downside. Other notable losers Broader altcoin weakness saw Mira (MIRA) -58%, MonBase Coin (MBC) -56%, and Plasma (XPL) -45% as liquidity rotated into BTC and select momentum plays. Frequently Asked Questions Which tokens were the highest gainers this week? Zcash (ZEC), SPX6900 (SPX), and DeXE (DEXE) led weekly gains, with ZEC surging ~140% and memecoins posting high single-to-triple-digit moves. Which tokens lost the most this week? MYX Finance (MYX), DoubleZero (2Z), and MemeCore (M) were top decliners, driven by deleveraging, negative funding rates, and social sentiment shifts. Key Takeaways BTC-led rally : Bitcoin dominance and ETF inflows drove broad market direction. Concentrated altcoin moves : Few mid-caps and memecoins produced outsized returns amid liquidity rotation. Risk management : Watch derivatives metrics, funding rates, and key support levels for trade signals. Conclusion This week’s crypto action highlighted how Bitcoin dominance and ETF flows can steer market narrative while select altcoins deliver outsized volatility. Monitor derivatives indicators, liquidity, and key price levels before trading.

A decisive daily close above the descending channel near $4,500 would likely accelerate a run toward the $4,200–$6,400 target zone and the $6,666 projection. Immediate trigger : daily close above the descending channel near $4,500 signals breakout momentum. Key drivers include institutional adoption, staking approvals, and correlation with the Russell 2000 index. Historical move: a 90% recovery from the mid‑June low to August highs supports strong upside potential. Ethereum $6,666 target: Uptober breakout seen as catalyst — read analyst-backed analysis and trade triggers on COINOTAG. Published: October 5, 2025 • Updated: October 5, 2025 What is the outlook for Ethereum’s $6,666 target this Uptober? Ethereum is positioned for a potential Upswing toward the $6,666 target if it achieves a confirmed breakout above the descending channel. Analysts cite rising on‑chain activity, institutional flows, and macro alignment as the primary catalysts that could propel ETH from the current ~$4,487 price toward the $4,200–$6,400 green zone and beyond. How did Ethereum price action evolve before the current setup? From April to June 2025, ETH traded sideways between $2,400 and $2,800 before a mid‑June reset to $2,100. A strong recovery followed, lifting ETH above $4,000 by August — roughly a 90% gain from the June low. That swing established the structure now confined in a descending channel from late July through early October. Source: Captain Faibik How does the descending channel influence near-term price action? The descending channel defines clear support and resistance bands tested multiple times between late July and early October. A confirmed breakout with elevated volume would invalidate the bearish pattern and shift momentum to the upside. Conversely, a failure to break higher could retest the channel base and target previous consolidation levels near $2,800–$3,200. What macro and market signals support a bullish view? Analysts highlight several supportive signals: rising institutional interest, expected staking approvals, and positive correlation with risk‑on equity benchmarks such as the Russell 2000. The latter recently reached new highs, which historically aligns with stronger risk appetite and altcoin performance. Frequently Asked Questions Can Ethereum realistically reach $6,666 in Q4 2025? Yes, analysts say a realistic path exists if ETH closes decisively above the descending channel and macro liquidity remains supportive. Institutional buys and staking developments would speed the move; technical confirmation is essential to validate the target. What are the key technical levels traders should watch? Watch $4,500 for breakout confirmation, $6,400 as a primary resistance zone, and $6,666 as a psychological and analyst target. On the downside, $2,800–$3,200 represents prior consolidation support. How should traders manage risk on an Uptober setup? Use defined stop levels below the channel base, scale positions on confirmed breakouts, and monitor volume and macro indicators. Maintain position sizing discipline given the market’s elevated volatility. Key Takeaways Breakout trigger : A daily close above the descending channel near $4,500 is the primary buy signal. Fundamental drivers : Institutional adoption, staking approvals, and equity correlation support upside. Risk management : Use structured stops and scale on confirmation; watch $2,800–$3,200 as key support. Conclusion Ethereum’s technical setup and improving fundamentals create a credible path to the $6,666 target if the descending channel is broken on strong volume. Traders should prioritize confirmation, manage position sizing, and monitor institutional flow indicators. COINOTAG will continue tracking price action and catalyst developments.

This marks a fresh all-time high and returns the market firmly into bull territory. The new all-time high level of total crypto market cap topped its previous summit of about $4 trillion set late in September 2025. The latest rally surge came as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their ETFs saw record-level inflows as the US government remains shut down , as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan. Overall crypto market cap reached a new all-time high of $4.35 trillion. Source: CoinMarketCap Overall market cap sets new $4.35 trillion record Various factors have contributed to the recent surge in the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $125,506 yesterday, October 4, while Ethereum finally regained momentum after price stalled at the $4000 level to now trade close to $4,500 as of October 5. BTC and ETH together account for over 65% of the total market capitalization, accounting for about $3 trillion between the top two cryptos. The growing institutional demand has also boosted the capitalization surge to $4.35 billion. According to reports, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have attracted over $70 billion in inflows since the beginning of 2025, significantly lowering barriers for traditional investors and validating cryptocurrencies as mainstream investment options. They slowed to a crawl in September, a month historically thought to be a bad one for BTC. However, they picked up again as we entered October, closing out their best seven-day period during the last week, coinciding with the first week of the US government shutdown. Investors have increasingly been viewing cryptocurrencies as hedges against inflation and economic uncertainty, with Bitcoin being likened to digital gold amid rising sovereign debt and weakening fiat currencies. The outlook for the rest of 2025 As crypto continues to grow, it will continue to integrate with traditional finance. With institutional adoption on the rise, new regulatory frameworks being crafted globally, and developer ecosystems maturing, the digital asset industry is expected to develop into a pillar of global finance. Already, real-world asset tokenization, DeFi, and stablecoin usage have been expanding crypto’s reach, with major financial institutions exploring tokenized products, but markets will be watching closely to see whether the momentum is sustained through Q4. Cryptopolitan analysts expect Bitcoin to reach $160,000 by the end of 2025, with bullish sentiments projected to persist until the end of the year. Over the long term, BTC could ride institutional demand to $350,548 by 2031.

Sold for a mere $0.035 in presale, MUTM is already among the top DeFi altcoins of 2025, with over 55% of its Stage 6 presale sold already. The project has attracted over 16,750 holders with $16.85 million+ raised. Speculative meme coins do nothing, but Mutuum Finance offers actual utility and long-term growth potential. Investors looking for huge upside in the short term and long term, spot Mutuum Finance as a must-buy token under $1. Vitalik Buterin Discards Meme Coins as Utility Tokens Take Center Stage Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has been a dumping magnet for meme coins that he’s held over the years, a trend whose origins trace back in 2021 when he infamously burned 450 trillion SHIB tokens which were gifted to him by Shiba Inu creator Ryoshi. Earlier during the week, on-chain data indicates he dumped 150 billion PUPPIES tokens for 28.58 ETH and 1 billion ERC20 tokens for $13,889 USDC, furthering the trend of dumping hype tokens. These are all part of a broader market trend: as utility-based tokens solidify themselves, investors and devs are rushing to projects that have actual value and actual utility-based use cases and away from pure speculative meme coins. Buterin’s move is crypto’s breaking point, where utility-driven projects are the new trend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with real-world utility, embodying the type of long-term growth the sector offers. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy as Investor Mania Reaches All-Time High Mutuum Finance has offered early birds the special benefit of purchasing MUTM tokens at a reduced price prior to the project’s launch. Phase 6 tokens costing $0.035 have been highly sought after, raising more than $16.85 million from more than 16,750 buyers. Numbers speak volumes about market interest and increasing faith in the potential of the long-term project’s future. Apart from securing the platform and engaging with the community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with a formal $50,000 USDT bug bounty fund. The program welcomes white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to submit information about vulnerabilities in the codebase and have rewards disbursed based on severity. This ensures that even the smallest of problems are resolved promptly and the overall safety of the platform is maintained at an optimal level. Mutuum Finance Announces New DeFi Borrowing & Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance announced recently the launch of its native lending and borrowing protocol , a breakthrough in decentralized finance. V1 of the protocol is set to release on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include the fundamental building blocks like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Supported day one for lending, borrowing, and collateralization already with ETH and USDT, the platform is ready to offer a scalable and robust foundation for users of DeFi. Utility Leads, MUTM Is 2025’s Number One Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves as investors shift away from hyped meme coins and toward projects delivering real value. With its Stage 6 presale more than 55% sold, more than 16,750 investors on board, and more than $16.85 million raised, MUTM’s traction is increasing fast. Its imminent release of lending and borrowing protocol, robust security features like the $50,000 bug bounty program, and actual DeFi usability set it apart from hype tokens. As the global market trend moves towards utility rather than speculation, MUTM offers investors the unique chance to invest early in a project with solid growth prospects.

No one will inherit them.” The statement garnered a wide range of responses, as many in the digital asset space found this decision unusual and selfish. When asked if he planned to have children who might inherit his assets, BD responded that “life is better without kids.” He later defended his stance, saying he had every right to do what he wanted with his money. When I die, the 24 recovery phrases of my XRP wallet will die with me. No one will inherit them — BD (@DiepSanh) October 4, 2025 Autonomy and Responsibility in Digital Ownership BD’s comment raised questions about what happens to crypto holdings. In traditional finance, inheritance is structured and regulated, but self-custody wallets operate differently. Without shared recovery phrases, assets can become permanently inaccessible. While BD saw this as a matter of personal freedom, others term lost coins as wasted value that could have contributed to causes or family inheritance. Investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the years by losing their access codes , but BD plans to purposely destroy them and ensure no one can access his XRP. BD’s defiance also drew support from some who agreed that financial independence includes the right to decide what happens to one’s holdings, even if that means they are never recovered. XRP Community Reacts Responses ranged from practical suggestions to moral criticism. Some users questioned whether the assets should be preserved for charitable or community purposes instead of being lost forever. Several users criticized BD’s refusal to consider others, calling it a selfish choice.

Some replies were interested in the potential permanent loss of these tokens, as they see it as a token burn and a reduction of supply . Some replies found humor in the post, seeing it as a reflection of how strongly individuals guard their crypto assets . The post also drew input from recognizable figures in the XRP community, with Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), agreeing with BD’s stance and revealing plans to do the same thing.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Jeffries said the White House is worried about the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act health-insurance subsidies at the end of the year, calling them a real point of concern, but added that the administration’s rhetoric about healthcare for unauthorized migrants is “not a serious barrier for talks, beyond its political juice.” He also said threats of mass firings and cuts to projects in Democratic-leaning states “will backfire” and “won’t dent Democrats’ unity.” Jeffries drew a clear line between what he called serious discussions at the White House on Monday and what came afterward. “Unfortunately, the president’s behavior subsequent to the White House meeting deteriorated into unhinged and unserious action,” he said, pointing to the “mariachi-themed” memes Trump sent his way online. Jeffries said his caucus will continue pushing for a deal, even as the shutdown stretches on. Jeffries holds Democrats together while Senate fights GOP bill Last month, Hakeem Jeffries persuaded all but one of the more than 200 House Democrats to vote against the GOP’s stopgap bill to keep the government funded, embracing a position that Democrats had rejected in the past. Jeffries has also kept Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer firmly by his side this time, unlike in March when the party split. Then, Schumer and several Senate Democrats voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open rather than face a shutdown. This time around, only a handful of Senate Democrats defected, leaving Republicans short of the 60 votes needed to pass their seven-week spending bill, including their most recent attempt on Friday. Democrats are demanding a permanent extension of enhanced premium tax credits to help Americans purchase private health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and want assurances that the White House will not try to unilaterally cancel spending agreed to in any deal. Chuck Schumer told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, “They’ve refused to talk with us,” saying the impasse could only be solved by further talks between Trump and the four congressional leaders. White House signals layoffs as shutdown continues without talks As the shutdown entered its fifth day on Sunday, a senior White House official said the administration will start mass layoffs of federal workers if President Donald Trump decides negotiations with congressional Democrats are “absolutely going nowhere.” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN’s State of the Union that there is still hope Democrats will “back down,” avoiding a costly shutdown and the federal employee layoffs threatened by White House budget director Russell Vought. “President Trump and Russ Vought are lining things up and getting ready to act if they have to, but hoping that they don’t,” Hassett said. “If the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere, then there will start to be layoffs. But I think that everybody is still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it’s just common sense to avoid layoffs like that.” Trump described the potential job cuts on Sunday as “Democrat layoffs,” telling reporters, “Anybody laid off that’s because of the Democrats.” The shutdown began October 1, the start of the federal fiscal year 2026, after Senate Democrats rejected a short-term funding measure that would have kept federal agencies open through November 21.

That level of capital has led to a more bullish ripple price prediction, with some experts believing XRP could climb well past $25. At the same time, retail traders are turning their attention to Layer Brett (LBRETT), the meme-powered Layer 2 project riding Ethereum’s momentum. With regulatory clarity improving and new investment products on the horizon, Ripple looks set to gain institutional strength — while Layer Brett’s viral growth proves how quickly retail excitement can fuel a breakout. Ripple price prediction: Why XRP is back in focus Ripple has long been one of the most recognized names in the crypto industry thanks to its focus on cross-border payments and banking partnerships. With ETF discussions now accelerating, XRP is being placed back into the spotlight as a coin that could benefit massively from institutional-grade liquidity. Analysts highlight that ETFs provide a gateway for traditional investors to access assets like XRP without needing to directly hold tokens. If even a fraction of institutional capital flows into these vehicles, Ripple could see a demand surge similar to what Bitcoin experienced when spot ETFs were launched. Some also argue that Ripple’s strong brand recognition and early regulatory wins give it an advantage over other altcoins vying for institutional flows. ETF inflows as a catalyst The potential of $20B in ETF-driven volume cannot be understated. Institutional money is often stickier and less speculative, providing a more stable foundation for long-term growth. Experts argue that if these flows materialize, XRP could not only revisit its all-time highs but smash through them with conviction, setting the stage for a run into the $25+ range. This bullish scenario also rests on Ripple’s unique advantage: real-world use cases. With dozens of partnerships across financial institutions, Ripple is already solving real payment bottlenecks. Unlike many meme-driven tokens, XRP has both enterprise adoption and regulatory momentum working in its favor. The rise of Layer Brett alongside XRP While Ripple is attracting institutional interest, retail traders are also looking at high-upside projects like Layer Brett (LBRETT). Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT combines near-instant, ultra-low-cost transactions with viral meme culture, creating a unique blend of utility and hype. Many early XRP holders are hedging their bets by adding LBRETT to their portfolios, seeing it as the kind of early-stage project that can deliver 50x–100x gains by 2026. Key highlights of Layer Brett’s momentum: Ethereum Layer 2 scalability – cheap, fast and secure transactions Over $4.2M raised in presale revenue already 614% staking rewards available for early adopters More than 10,000 holders and climbing Viral community presence across X, Telegram, and Discord This combination of meme virality and Layer 2 fundamentals is why analysts are calling LBRETT one of the strongest contenders for outsized gains. Community sentiment is also showing rapid acceleration, with presale stages selling out faster as word spreads across social platforms. Final shot: Position before institutional waves The latest ripple price prediction suggests that if ETF inflows channel $20B into XRP, the token could rocket to over $25, rewriting the rules of its long-term valuation. But while Ripple’s growth is powered by institutional demand, traders seeking faster multiples are eyeing projects like Layer Brett. Together, these two tokens represent both sides of the market — stability with enterprise adoption and explosive growth potential from meme-driven Layer 2 innovation. The Layer Brett presale is live — secure your tokens before the next stage sells out and staking rewards shrink.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.12. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.82 with an average trading price of $1.75. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.256 (+2.97%) Market Cap $38.84B Trading Volume (24-hour) $3.13B Circulating Supply 151.22B DOGE All-time High $0.7316 May 08, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.2647 24-hour Low $0.2475 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.05% 50-Day SMA 0.236642 14-Day RSI 51.07 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA 0.209474 Dogecoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed an uptrend as its price increased to $0.256. The cryptocurrency gained 2.97% of its value. The DOGE coin may find resistance around $0.267. On October 5, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a bullish trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price increased to $0.256 today, representing a 2.97 percent gain in value since it closed at $0.250 yesterday. Today’s bullish trend indicates a positive sentiment in the market, as gains are significant for the day; however, the coin may face resistance around the $0.267 resistance zone, as the coin keeps spiking towards the said level, which will reignite the selling pressure. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin indicated an upward trend in the market, as buyers are in the leading position. The cryptocurrency’s value increased to $0.256 today. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify renewed buying interest.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.284, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.217. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 54.76 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a buy indication as it moves upwards, as the overall market sentiment is positive today. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin shows a bearish trend in the market, as selling pressure has formed above the SMA, which is evident from the last two red candlesticks. The DOGE/USD price has been facing decreasing volatility toward the $0.256 level on an hourly basis. The decreased volatility signals a lesser chance of a trend reversal and less volatile price movements in the coming hours. Seller dominance is currently pushing the DOGE price towards the support of $0.247. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart.

The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral region. Its value has decreased to 55.15 in the past four hours.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $0.256 in the past 24 hours. If buyers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further gains and may retest the $0.267 resistance. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.513038–$0.652958 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.256 over the last 24 hours as buyers tried to maintain support around $0.250 and succeeded. Moreover, buyers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.349799 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,175.58 DOGE in October; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.82 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked issuers to withdraw DOGE ETF filings under new listing rules, along with some other crypto-related ETF filings. The regulator is introducing generic standards to replace 19b-4 reviews to speed up ETF approval.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. In October, Doge is trading near $0.21.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-05 20:13:39

According to reports, the token rose about 2.7% to roughly $125,245 on the day, topping its prior August peak near $124,480.

Investors and traders also pointed to a weaker US dollar and broader equity strength as helping push prices higher. Some coverage tied the shift in sentiment to policy signals under US President Donald Trump, and to worries about a possible US government shutdown that nudged buyers toward alternative stores of value. Traders See ‘Uptober’ Playing Out “Uptober” — a nickname for October’s often bullish stretch — has returned this year, and traders say technical breakouts after Bitcoin flipped $120,000 into support added momentum. Reports show BTC briefly climbed as high as $125,750 during early Asian trade before pulling back, a sign of fast buying followed by profit-taking in some venues. Bitcoin Prices: This cryptocurrency surges to all-time high past USD 125K; Here’s whyhttps://t.co/A1RxGUwdGb — ET NOW (@ETNOWlive) October 5, 2025 Liquidity Tightening On Exchanges Based on reports, the amount of Bitcoin kept on centralized exchanges has fallen, which reduces immediate sellable supply when buyers step in. That thinning supply, combined with fresh ETF demand, is a recipe for sharper moves in price when flows spike. Market watchers caution that such patterns can amplify both ups and downs. What Analysts And Traders Are Watching Options desks and chart watchers are flagging near-term resistance levels above current highs, while some technical scenarios point to larger targets in the months ahead — figures like $135,000 and even higher have been floated by certain market players, though those are projections rather than certainties. Volume and fund flows will likely determine whether the rally holds or cools. Related Reading: All-Time High Alert: BNB Smashes $1,111 Barrier – Details What Comes Next According to observers, this run matters because it has pushed Bitcoin back into the conversation alongside major asset classes, and, for a moment, the token’s market value ranked among the world’s largest, even overtaking Amazon on some measures. Still, volatility is high. Sharp reversals, policy shifts, or a sudden change in ETF flows could quickly alter the picture. Meanwhile, a mix of institutional buying, seasonal momentum, and macro factors helped lift Bitcoin to new highs. The rally has drawn fresh attention from investors, but it also comes with the familiar risks of big price swings. Markets will be watching flows, dollar moves, and any policy signals from Washington for clues on what comes next.

The rumor caught fire on social media, leading many to believe that the absence of regulatory staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had somehow triggered automatic approval for pending ETF applications. But the story didn’t hold up. Within hours, analysts and legal experts began debunking the theory, explaining that the claim was based on a misunderstanding of how ETF rules work. The truth, it turns out, is far less dramatic: the XRP ETF remains unapproved, and all spot crypto ETF applications are still frozen until the SEC resumes full operations. Amid the confusion, investors searching for stability and clarity have turned their attention to safer, community-driven opportunities — with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as one of the few projects maintaining clear communication and progress during a chaotic regulatory environment. What Actually Happened Behind the Scenes The misunderstanding began when several posts claimed that Teucrium’s XRP ETF had quietly gone live. The argument was that, since the SEC is partially closed due to the shutdown, the mandatory review period for ETF filings had expired without action — meaning the proposal became effective by default. However, that assumption turned out to be incorrect. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Teucrium product does not fall under the same category as spot crypto ETFs. Instead, it operates under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs funds backed by traditional instruments like Treasury securities and derivatives. Under that law, a filing can automatically become effective after a given period — but that process has nothing to do with cryptocurrency spot ETFs. By contrast, spot ETFs such as those linked to Bitcoin, Solana, or XRP itself are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as commodity trusts. These products require explicit approval from the SEC before they can be listed or traded. A shutdown does not grant automatic authorization. In other words, the claim that the XRP ETF was approved simply because the SEC wasn’t functioning normally is false. Spot ETFs Still Frozen All pending spot ETF reviews remain on hold until the government reopens. Only enforcement, legal emergencies, and essential market stability operations are being managed by a minimal SEC staff. For now, this means that every ongoing crypto ETF review — including those for XRP, Solana, and Cardano — is paused. The false rumor nonetheless caused a stir in trading circles, briefly pushing XRP’s price higher before markets corrected. Analysts say the episode highlights how quickly misinformation spreads in crypto, especially when regulation becomes uncertain. Similar confusion occurred earlier this year during debates over Ethereum’s ETF applications, when speculation temporarily distorted sentiment and liquidity. Despite the noise, the reality is simple: the SEC’s silence does not mean approval. Until the agency is fully operational again, no spot ETF — not even Bitcoin’s — will move forward. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Amid Uncertainty While established projects wait for regulatory clarity, investors are shifting focus toward opportunities that operate independently of government processes. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of those rare projects thriving in the middle of uncertainty. Its community-driven model, transparent roadmap, and ongoing presale success have kept momentum strong even as the rest of the market slows down. The project has already raised more than $15.5 million and continues to attract new investors each week. But what sets MAGACOIN apart in this environment is its consistency. While major players are stalled by policy delays, MAGACOIN has maintained weekly progress reports, community engagement campaigns, and open audits. That level of visibility has earned it a reputation for reliability at a time when regulatory paralysis is shaking confidence across the market. Analysts describe MAGACOIN as a “bottom-up success story” — a project proving that growth doesn’t always have to depend on institutional validation or regulatory milestones. Its appeal lies in its ability to build trust directly with investors, something that has become increasingly rare in a market dominated by complex financial products like ETFs. The Broader Message for the Market The XRP ETF incident is a reminder that crypto markets still move on information — and sometimes misinformation. Traders react quickly to rumors, which can fuel rallies or panic within hours. Analysts are urging investors to verify sources before reacting to claims about regulatory events, especially during periods when official communication from agencies like the SEC is limited. The episode also reinforces a larger theme: that decentralized projects with transparent operations can thrive even when the traditional financial system stalls. As institutional products like ETFs face indefinite delays, investors are once again reminded of the importance of innovation and community-led growth — qualities that projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE embody. Conclusion The rumors surrounding the XRP ETF’s supposed approval may have stirred the market, but the facts are clear: the SEC has not approved any new crypto ETFs during the government shutdown, and all pending applications remain frozen. Once the agency resumes normal operations, reviews will pick up where they left off – not before. In the meantime, investor attention continues to shift toward independent, transparent opportunities that aren’t at the mercy of regulators. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its steady progress and strong grassroots community, is becoming a clear example of that shift. For traders tired of waiting on government timelines, it represents the kind of project that moves forward — even when the rest of the market stands still.

Traders say the unusual move comes from how quiet actual market swings have been. The difference between what markets are expected to do and what they’ve actually delivered, the risk premium, has grown, and that is now reflected in the cost of options. The narrow ranges behind this premium are tied to different drivers in each market. In gold, bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts have been the key force. In oil, the squeeze comes from supply and demand outlooks. For stocks, it’s been uncertainty over Fed policy, corporate earnings, and unpredictable retail flows. All of it has added up to higher costs for traders looking for protection. Options grow costly as equities hit record volumes In equities, options trading hit a record in September, as investors looked to hedge risks around the end of the year. But the willingness to pay for contracts is being capped by the lack of realized volatility. The S&P 500 Index has been steady, with individual stocks moving in different directions and canceling each other out. That has kept overall index swings restrained. The result is that the VIX, Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, has stayed low. But under the surface, single-stock volatility has been climbing as companies prepare to report earnings. Last week, the gap between the VIX Constituent Volatility Index and the Cboe Volatility Index hit its widest since January, ranking near the highest levels of the last two years. That divergence shows how individual company moves are building up while the broader market remains calm. Bond investors have played a different game this year. They scored gains by betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts and the slide in short-term US yields. That strategy has paid off, but traders are now shifting to longer maturities on the Treasury curve. A cluster of bullish trades over the last two weeks has been wagering that the 10-year Treasury yield will drop below 4% for the first time since April. Pacific Investment Management Co. told clients to lock in yields while they remain attractive. JPMorgan Asset Management and TD Securities both reported clients moving out of short-term paper and into longer-term bonds offering higher yields. The momentum, which also reflected nerves around the US government shutdown, pushed 10-year yields down 0.05 percentage point in the past week to 4.1%, near the low end of their trading band. The 30-year yield also slid, landing around 4.7%. Investors push into long bonds as auctions loom This renewed focus on longer maturities is a reversal from most of the year, when investors made money betting that the spread between short- and long-term yields would widen. That curve steepener trade performed well, since expectations for Fed cuts drove short-term yields way lower while long-term yields held up, weighed by fiscal and political concerns. Those dynamics helped the bond market deliver its best nine-month stretch in five years through September, Bloomberg data show. But the trade has since lost steam. Longer-dated bonds have stopped underperforming, and the gap between five-year and 30-year Treasury yields has narrowed to about 1 percentage point. That’s down from 1.26 percentage points in early September, which had been the widest in four years. The next test of demand will come with the Treasury auctions. The government is preparing to sell $39 billion in 10-year notes and $22 billion in 30-year bonds next week. Analysts say those sales will show whether the appetite for long-dated paper is strong enough to keep driving yields lower, or whether investors will hesitate after a year of heavy bets on both ends of the curve.

Bitcoin is pushing against historic resistance levels into new all-time highs above $125,000. Conversely, altcoins are switching between fresh strength signals, disbelief, and euphoria. The bulls have momentum, the bears have conviction, and in between lies the most electrified battleground the market has seen in over a year. The latest data confirms what it took a while for institutional liquidity and retail energy to get in tune. Bitcoin’s price action has defied skeptics, surging higher to new levels barely days after the U.S. spot ETFs received $985 million in inflows, the fifth-highest single day that Bitcoin ETFs have ever attracted since their inception. That wall of capital means interest roaring back across the board. Trading volumes on major exchanges have reached multi-month highs, while open interest on various derivatives platforms continues to climb as a reflection of the renewed appetite for speculation. Analysts pointed out that this is a combination of institutional inflows, combined with acceleration on-chain, that could pave the way for one of the most volatile, yet rewarding, months of the year. And right in the midst of the frenzy, a retail counterweight to Bitcoin’s institutional dominance is making headlines: MAGACOIN FINANCE, the presale phenomenon that is rewriting the script for early stage conviction in 2025. Bulls Take the Lead For now, the bulls decidedly have the better of it. Bitcoin is still trading right near its previous all-time high, and it’s tempting to get very bullish on a breakout that would take it to fresh highs before November. Demand from exchange-traded funds is reinforcing the shift, with BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone attracting an astounding $790 million in one session, while Fidelity and ARK 21Shares added hundreds of millions more. Combined daily ETF activity reached $7.5 billion, about 7% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, which is a stunning display of liquidity and conviction. Market strategists view this as a sign that Bitcoin has become more of an institutional base than a speculative asset. “Institutions aren’t after volatility anymore, they’re after dominance,” stated one fund manager. “The ETFs provided the structure they were looking for to get behind, and now they’re deploying with confidence.” The Bearish Counterargument But the bears haven’t conceded. Short positions on perpetual futures have been on an uptrend on Binance, OKX, and Bybit, which would take into account that contrarian traders are betting on a huge short-circuit after such a quick climb. Some analysts cite profit-taking near all-time price highs, thin liquidity during weekends, and over-leveraged retail positions as triggers for near-term pullbacks. Still, most agree that any dip will probably be only short-term. The combination of macro liquidity, ETF momentum, and Q4 seasonality has historically had the bulls beat. In the last 5 years, bitcoin has managed to close “Uptober” in the green four times, with average monthly gains of more than 16%. The bears can slow down momentum, but not necessarily stop it. Ethereum, Solana, and the Rotation Trade Ethereum recently broke above $4,600 while inflows to ETFs have been cooling to $233 million. Yet its technical indicators continue to be bullish, with developers brief for several Layer-2 scale upgrades in this quarter. Meanwhile, Solana keeps climbing through the high-performance lane, with steady growth rates in the size of NFT activity as well as in the total value locked in DeFi. However, the real story is the rotation happening below the surface, with capital being drained from massive caps into high-upside plays. Traders are again looking for asymmetric trades on presale platforms and DEX listings. It’s the classic late-cycle beat of a maturing rally: Big money built the base, and retail built the story. That’s precisely where MAGACOIN FINANCE has had the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Retail’s Flagship in the New Cycle In the midst of Bitcoin’s institutional breakout, the voice of the retail revival has centered around MAGACOIN FINANCE. The presale project is now past $15 million, completing a HashEx and CertiK audit and setting a new standard for meme-aligned, scarcity-based tokenomics. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE from the many presales is execution. Each stage sells faster than the previous, and community involvement keeps growing. Its channels in Telegram and X (Twitter) a re currently among the most active in crypto, attracting investors from both the Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP ecosystems. Analysts point out the unique balance the project’s meme culture has, through such structural credibility. With its limited supply of tokens, open and transparent audit, and the spread of viral positivity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as on of the coolest and most authentic speculative gem of 2025. Bitcoin’s bullish “Uptober” rally has seen new bull momentum, and presale participants are looking for even larger multipliers. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now one of the most talked about names by retail traders, positioning for post-Bitcoin breakouts. Analysts project a 63x multiplier potential if listings on exchanges reflect presale momentum. Its pricing stages are created to reward early participants, while inducing natural FOMO via a limited supply. As Bitcoin reclaims dominance, capital flows back out to emerging tokens, of which MAGACOIN FINANCE stands in the perfect position to attract such a wave. In this bull vs. bear showdown is the case for presales is the area where the smaller caps get outsized gains. Market Psychology in Motion The sustained tug of war between bulls and bears has less to do with price and more to do with the psychology of a maturing market. The bulls, fueled by legitimacy: ETFs, macro liquidity, and institutional respect. Meanwhile, the bears feed off history, the notion that all parabolic advances eventually reverse. Both are in their right mind in their own way, but only one can define the short-term narrative. So far, the numbers are in favor of the bulls. Derivatives data indicate increasingly long exposure, as well as stablecoin inflows on major exchanges, reflecting new power to buy. The Fear & Greed Index has turned “Greedy” once again, for the first time since mid-summer, often a predictor of marked rallies. What Comes Next for the Market Looking ahead, the traders are bracing for an aggressive Q4 in terms of volatility. With Bitcoin ETF inflows at all-time levels and macro sentiment improving, it is a recipe for expansion at all levels of the market. Analysts believe altcoins are in for a follow-up should Bitcoin break decisively above resistance in a move that typically leads to the rotation effect that helps fuel multi-asset rallies. Retail participation is rising rapidly, and presales similar to MAGACOIN FINANCE seem like they will see the first benefits. Every big run of bulls starts with conviction, and conviction is on the rise again. Conclusion: The Year of Controlled Chaos “Uptober” 2025 will be the month that returns the bulls in control. Bitcoin’s ETF-powered outburst has reignited belief within institutions, as AlkaladiThapar has proved that retail power, symbolized by Magacoin Finance, has rekindled the flames that make crypto what it is. The bears will keep fighting, but the market is momentum-driven and momentum is back in spitting force. With a raised $15 million, verified audits, and unstoppable viral traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the heartbeat of this cycle, an impeccable mirror to how far it has come since the early turmoil, and how far indeed it will go. In the great bull-and-bear contest, there is one truth. And conviction, at this moment in time, lies with those building, from ETF desks to MAGACOIN FINANCE, an expanding global community.

The exchange centered around the nature of XRP and its role in global payments, revealing a clear difference in how traditional financial leaders and blockchain experts perceive digital assets. Zschach had stated that “calling a private token a ‘bridge currency’ is like using a fax machine and calling it the internet,” arguing that some digital assets imitate innovation without delivering genuine transformation. His remark was seen by many as a critique of blockchain-based solutions that claim to rival SWIFT’s global payments network . However, Vet’s reply presented a factual counterpoint to that position. In his response, he corrected Zschach’s characterization of XRP by noting that it is “not a private token.” He clarified that XRP is traded openly across a wide range of centralized and decentralized exchanges and operates on the XRP Ledger, a “public and permissionless network.” XRP is not a private token. It's publicly traded on many centralized and decentralized exchanges, including the XRP Ledger, a public and permissionless network. No wonder SWIFT is being replaced with this lvl of research in 2025. — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 4, 2025 Revisiting the Definition of Openness Vet’s remarks draw attention to a crucial distinction between public blockchains and the closed systems that have long dominated international payments. The XRP Ledger operates transparently, allowing anyone to access , verify, and transact without restriction. This open model stands in contrast to SWIFT’s centralized structure, where message-based financial transactions depend on multiple intermediaries and slower settlement processes. By emphasizing the public nature of XRP, Vet argued that its bridge function is real and operational. The XRP Ledger enables cross-border transactions to settle in seconds, removing the need for traditional correspondent banking chains. That capability demonstrates how blockchain can address inefficiencies that institutions like SWIFT have struggled to overcome for decades.

For years, SWIFT has been at the center of global money transfers, processing vast volumes daily. However, it faces persistent criticism for its slow and costly procedures. Ripple’s technology, which leverages XRP for liquidity and instant settlement, offers a practical alternative that aligns with modern digital infrastructure.

Specifically, this class of investors has accumulated about 800,000 ETH in the past week. Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have steadily increased their positions over the period, according to data shared by Santiment on October 5. ETH whale transaction. Source: Santiment Historically, such aggressive accumulation phases often coincide with the early stages of broader rallies, as institutional and high-net-worth investors tend to position ahead of retail market participation. Notably, while the whale accumulation climbed through late September into early October, Ethereum’s price followed suit, breaking out of its consolidation range. This suggests whales are buying dips, establishing a strong demand floor that could limit short-term downside risk. To gauge how the asset might react to these whale accumulation trends, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for insights on Ethereum’s short-term outlook. According to the AI model, if the trend continues, Ethereum could be setting up for a decisive breakout above the $4,600 and $4,700 range, potentially targeting $5,200 in the coming weeks. Conversely, failure to hold above $4,300 could trigger a brief correction toward $4,000 before another leg higher. Ethereum price analysis At press time, Ethereum was trading at $4,507, up about 0.55% over the past 24 hours, while posting a weekly gain of more than 10%. ETH seven-day price chart.

Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.78, firmly in neutral territory, indicating balanced momentum with room for further gains if buying pressure intensifies.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-05 21:23:19

The Tokyo-listed company now ranks as the world’s fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, but investor confidence in its shares continues to falter. Fundamentals Strengthen as Stock Price Weakens The situation forced CEO Simon Gerovich to take to X on October 2 to reassure shareholders. He drew a parallel with Amazon’s dot-com era slump when Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos reminded investors that “the stock is not the company, and the company is not the stock.” Gerovich highlighted that Metaplanet’s Q3 Bitcoin income revenue had gone up 115.7% to ¥2.44 billion, which is about $16 million, quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, operating profit came in 88% higher than forecasts. The company also reported a near debt-free balance sheet, with leverage under 1%. Its aggressive buying strategy has drawn attention all year. On September 22, Metaplanet bought 5,419 BTC for $632.5 million, lifting its holdings to 25,555 BTC at the time. Since then, further acquisitions have taken the stash past 30,000 BTC, cementing its position ahead of rivals like Bullish. However, stock performance remains volatile. On Friday’s session in Tokyo, shares closed at 622 yen, up 7.43% on the day but far below their yearly peak of 1,930 yen. Furthermore, the stock is down nearly 20% in September alone, even as it maintains a 70% gain year-to-date. Gerovich noted that the disconnect between balance sheet strength and equity performance was frustrating shareholders. “It’s painful for our team, shareholders, and for me personally,” the CEO stated. “But as with Amazon, fundamentals and share price often diverge — sometimes for months, sometimes longer.” He also stressed that the firm’s long-term mandate is clear: accumulate Bitcoin and build revenue streams around it. Bitcoin Volatility and Market Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which saw its price drop sharply toward $112,000 at the end of September, has since stabilized, with the asset trading around $120,000 at the time of this writing. Market watchers are keeping an eye on this level to see if it can hold as a base for a new push toward all-time highs. Some technical analysts say that if the current trend continues, BTC could make a big move up before the end of the year.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , at only $0.035, has already seen more than 55% of its Stage 6 presale sold out, reflecting early buyers’ high confidence. Unlike Cardano (ADA) wagering on long-term network development and ecosystem adoption, Mutuum Finance offers immediate utility through its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contracts, offering long-lasting returns and full user control. While ADA has solid growth potential, MUTM’s affordability, DeFi innovations, and presale dynamics make it the best coin for enormous gains, potentially outperforming more recognized altcoins by year end. Cardano (ADA) Eyes ATH Retest Cardano (ADA) is showing new bullish power following a breakout from a dropping triangle within its longer-term climbing channel, which suggests that its trend will continue. Following the breakout and retest, ADA is currently aiming for the upper band of the rising channel, which is in line with its 2021 all-time high level. Technical analysts consider this setup a top indicator for implied price momentum because the coin can be of new investor interest if it is able to sustain itself above the retest area. While ADA’s chart shows strong structural momentum, some investors and traders are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the newer utility-oriented altcoin worth a paltry $0.035, as a fresh play with runaway potential for early adopters. MUTM Presale Momentum Gaining Steam MUTM tokens are currently at $0.035 during Presale Round 6, an increment of 16.17% compared to the previous round. Investor interest is rather high with well over 16,750 investors having already invested in excess of $16.85 million to date. Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program recently, and white-hat developers and hackers are invited to report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, have been utilized so that bugs could be detected and resolved early on. The protocol has strong collateral management that secures the network and participants. There is unlimited collateral ratio, lending capacity, and deposit capacity that are some of the security features that secure it. Real-time undercollateral remedy and fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is the underlying principle of the Mutuum Finance model. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels and taking overcollateralized positions, the protocol participates in all available capital with fearless guardians. Reserve requirements provide to serve as a buffer for uncertainty in the market with overlying reserves to borrow against riskier assets to hedge against uncertainty. Mutuum Finance Announces Lending & Borrowing Protocol Launch Mutuum Finance has revealed its lending and borrowing protocol development, further emphasizing its mission to bring more decentralized finance solutions. V1 will be available in the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will feature essential aspects such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will initially be the assets used for borrowing, lending, and collateral and the foundation of an active and solid DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized finance on three fundamental pillars: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is taking DeFi to the retail investor and institutions. MUTM Poised to Top ADA in 2025 Gains Race Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself as a leading player within the DeFi space, with early-stage growth opportunity combined with genuine utility and sound fundamentals. Its Stage 6 presale is already more than 55% soldout, supported by more than 16,750 investors and more than $16.85 million raised, an unmistakable signal of accelerating market confidence. While ADA is targeting a likely sprint to $3, MUTM’s affordability, rapid adoption, and early momentum may pay outsized returns before the year ends.

Nonetheless, crypto analysts are bullish on the meme coin, and a few of them have highlighted important support, resistance, and breakout levels. As it stands, Dogecoin path to $0.3 still holds merit, and its reaction here will determine how its price action plays out. Analysts Map Out Bullish Setups And Near-Term Targets The $0.30 level, in particular, stands out as the next critical threshold for Dogecoin: both as a psychological and technical marker that could open the door for a stronger rally if conquered. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $123,000 As Rising Open Interest Signals More Action Ahead For instance, crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed that Dogecoin is currently trading within an ascending channel. This pattern holds merit as a bullish continuation, and according to the analyst, Dogecoin is still in the accumulation phase. The projection on the chart shows all that’s needed now is for a clean break above $0.3 for Dogecoin to enter into an expansion phase. Dogecoin 1W Price Chart: @ali_charts on X EtherNasyonaL, another crypto analyst, is more aggressive with Dogecoin. According to his projection, Dogecoin has now completed a successful retest after breaking above a descending trendline of lower highs. The most recent 3-day candlestick now shows Dogecoin forming a bullish candle above $0.25, and now the next step is a bullish leg to new all-time highs. Dogecoin 3D Price Chart: @EtherNasyonaL on X Dogecoin has been consolidating in a clear nine-month ascending triangle and is now approaching a key breakout point, according to a TradingView analysis. The pattern has been forming since early 2025 with rising support around $0.22 and a horizontal resistance zone between $0.28 and $0.30. Therefore, a confirmed breakout above $0.30 could send the Dogecoin price to between $0.38 and $0.40, matching the height of the formation and aligning with a prior resistance zone from earlier in the year. The breakout must come with a strong daily candle close above $0.30 and a clear volume surge, ideally two to three times higher than normal. Failure to hold above $0.30 or a drop below $0.22 would invalidate the bullish setup, but for now, Dogecoin’s structure suggests that a decisive move is close. Dogecoin 4H Price Chart: The Pythia On TradingView Early Signs Of Strength Dogecoin needs enough trading volume in order to complete this predicted move. The move needs to be backed by a noticeable surge in trading volume, ideally two to three times higher than the recent average. Dogecoin’s trading volume has spiked notably in the past 24 hours, coming to $2.5 billion across all exchanges. Furthermore, active addresses and transaction frequency have both increased over the last few trading hours.

The crypto is experiencing resistance at $124,000, yet institutional buying through spot ETFs and whale accumulation is driving the bullish price. As Q4 has historically been in favor of digital assets, analysts are also shifting their interest to DOT and Ethereum, with both showing recovered strength. In the meantime, new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investor interest even before they are listed on exchanges, with a possible Q4 rally. Can Bitcoin Price Hold $120K? Bitcoin is trading between $120,000 and $124,000 as traders wait for a breakout. The formation points to accumulation as opposed to distribution, indicating that the market is about to enter another leg. The greatest driver is ETF inflows, which had almost 1 billion net inflows last week. This institutional action provides confirmation that Bitcoin can hold the position of $120K as support. A close above $124K would be a positive sign of bullish continuation, which would open the way to reach $126K. Analysts observe that Q4 is usually biased towards an upward trend, as it has been historically, and as a result of inflows of more capital. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, positive ETF flows will make Bitcoin revisit its August high at $124.2K and attain new highs of around $125K. A fall below $120K will, however, result in retesting of the $117k support zone. Nevertheless, stock analysts highlight that the whale accumulation trends and rising sentiment in the market will reduce the chances of further correction. In the meantime, the future of Bitcoin remains optimistic, as long as it keeps trading in the above key support range. DOT and Ethereum Lead Q4 Gains Additionally, Polkadot (DOT) is among the early movers in Q4, currently trading around $4.20 and maintaining a bullish setup above key moving averages. The token’s technical structure suggests a short-term target of $4.30 within two weeks, with momentum supported by a rising MACD and RSI levels below the overbought zone. Analysts note that a breakout above $4.38 could attract momentum buyers and push prices toward $4.50. DOT’s sustained strength above the 200-day moving average at $4.03 indicates a broader uptrend, positioning it as one of the altcoins to watch this quarter. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has extended its Q4 gains after surging nearly 20% in late September. The ETH price recently broke the $4,500 mark and continues to trend higher as spot Ethereum ETFs record $1.3 billion in inflows. Data from SoSoValue shows cumulative inflows reaching $14.42 billion, with expectations of surpassing $15 billion next week. The daily chart displays a bullish flag pattern, and analysts project targets between $5,000 and $5,625 if momentum persists. ETH ETF cumulative inflows | Source: sosovalue With altcoins like DOT and Ethereum building technical strength, traders are seeking diversified exposure to capture potential upside across the board. Among the newer entries, one token emerging as a top Q4 pick among investors is MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Investor Picks in Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE is an Ethereum-based altcoin that is getting a lot of traction thanks to its strength and growth potential. The token has continued to climb steadily even when the market was generally volatile, and it has gained a reputation as a safe haven among investors. Analysts consider it to be an appealing offer to traders who are diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, investor interest is gathering momentum, anticipating the next exchange listing of MAGACOIN FINANCE, with the number of holders of the project already exceeding 18,000. Whales are early positioning, a typical indicator of confidence in the run-up to big listings. The past trend reveals that early entries in presales usually beat after-listing entrants by several folds. The 50% PATRIOT50X bonus of the team is another demand booster, which provides extra incentives to investors until the closing of the limited window. The only distinction between MAGACOIN FINANCE and other companies is its security-first approach. Audits have been completed using HashEx, with the project in the process of undergoing a CertiK audit, indicating transparency and legitimacy. All these factors, along with a robust expansion of its community, point to the possibility of MAGACOIN FINANCE dominating mid-cap altcoins in Q4 . Final Take: The fact that Bitcoin has been consolidating above $120K highlights that the market is somewhat bullish entering Q4. As Ethereum and DOT look to break out to $5,000 and $4.30 respectively, the overall crypto market space seems to be on the way to further growth. In the meantime, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the best choice , with a combination of stability, credibility, and increased potential as it approaches its exchange launch.

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp rise to the $340 resistance but failed to cross the level and fell back to $320. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,XMR|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|MARKET|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-05 22:23:00

In its ""Crypto Monthly Recap for September 2025"" research report published Oct. 3, global asset manager VanEck says Solana’s upcoming Alpenglow upgrade marks the biggest change to the network’s core software since launch. The firm calls it “the largest upgrade to Solana’s consensus in its history,” pointing to six key changes that together promise faster performance, lower costs, and greater reliability. For readers less familiar with Solana’s design, Alpenglow essentially changes how the network’s thousands of validators agree on which transactions are valid. That process, known as consensus, is being streamlined so data moves through the system more efficiently and validators can operate with less friction. What VanEck highlighted Faster finality. Today, Solana takes around 12 seconds to finalize a transaction, meaning to confirm it permanently. Alpenglow cuts that to about 150 milliseconds — roughly the time it takes to blink. Faster finality makes trades, payments and app interactions feel instantaneous, bringing Solana closer to web-level responsiveness. Off-chain voting. Validators currently vote on every new block by submitting thousands of small transactions on-chain. That keeps the network secure but clogs bandwidth. Alpenglow moves voting off-chain, letting validators exchange votes privately and later post a single proof. This clears space for regular user transactions and helps keep network fees low. Simpler validator costs. Instead of paying transaction fees for every vote, validators will submit a single Validator Admission Ticket each cycle. This reduces costs and makes it easier for smaller operators to run validators, which strengthens decentralization and network security. Streamlined communication. Solana’s nodes constantly share messages to stay in sync, a process known as “gossip.” Alpenglow reduces this background traffic so validators spend less time and bandwidth coordinating with each other. That makes the system more stable, even when some validators go offline. Bigger blocks. Developers plan to increase block capacity by 25% by the end of the year. A block is a batch of transactions added to the ledger. More capacity means Solana can fit more transactions into each block, reducing waiting times and congestion. The Firedancer client. Built by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is a second, independent version of Solana’s validator software expected to go live in late 2025. Having two clients means the network can keep running smoothly if one experiences problems. It also includes a proposal called SIMD-0370 , which removes Solana’s fixed limit on block size. That would let the network automatically scale with faster hardware, improving long-term throughput. P-tokens for efficiency. Solana’s current SPL tokens , used for most on-chain assets, require a lot of computing power to move. VanEck says the new P-token format will reduce that demand by about 95 percent, freeing up space in each block and boosting total transaction capacity by roughly 10 percent. This makes token transfers cheaper and the network more efficient under heavy use. Together, these changes show how Solana is redesigning its infrastructure to support the next generation of decentralized finance, gaming and tokenized asset applications. What Solana’s Engineers Are Building Beyond That VanEck’s analysis captures the key elements of Alpenglow, but Solana Labs’ Alpenglow white paper shows that the upgrade goes even deeper than the firm described. Engineers have built several behind-the-scenes changes aimed at making Solana faster, sturdier, and easier to maintain over time. One of the most significant additions is Rotor , a new broadcast layer that replaces Solana’s existing Turbine system for spreading data among validators. Rotor transmits information more efficiently, cutting down on duplicated packets and shortening the time it takes for new blocks to reach the entire network. The change helps transactions confirm more smoothly and makes the network more responsive under heavy load. Another improvement involves local signature aggregation , which allows validators to combine multiple transaction signatures before broadcasting them to the rest of the network. Every transaction on Solana carries a digital signature proving its origin; processing each one separately consumes computing power and bandwidth. By grouping signatures together, Alpenglow lightens that workload, reducing the computational cost of maintaining security. The upgrade also strengthens fault tolerance , ensuring that Solana continues to function even if as many as 40 percent of validators lose connectivity or temporarily go offline. This improvement makes the network more resilient during regional outages or traffic spikes, limiting the risk of downtime. In addition, Alpenglow cuts unnecessary “gossip” traffic — the background messages validators exchange to stay in sync. Reducing this chatter not only frees up bandwidth but also helps validators in regions with slower internet connections participate effectively, broadening Solana’s global base of operators. Finally, Solana has reworked validator participation through a ticket-based system that replaces thousands of tiny voting transactions with a single predictable admission step. This change simplifies the cost structure and lowers barriers for smaller operators, promoting fairer participation and stronger decentralization. Taken together, these refinements transform Alpenglow from a simple speed upgrade into a full redesign of how Solana communicates internally. They show Solana Labs’ push to make the network not just fast in theory but also dependable at scale — an essential step as more financial and consumer applications move on-chain.",Tech|Solana|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-05 22:42:13

The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported that the bank wants to launch a comprehensive review of crypto investments and lending volumes for companies operating in the space. Russian Central Bank: Crypto Audit Incoming The Central Bank said it also plans to review “individual investments” in digital financial products “whose returns are tied to the price of cryptoassets.” This likely refers to crypto derivatives and other similar financial products. Many of these have launched on the Moscow Exchange and elsewhere in Russia this year. The newspaper wrote that the bank’s decision “reflects its growing attention to the risks and opportunities” of the crypto space. These, the bank thinks, are having an impact “not only on global markets, but also on the Russian economy.” The Bank of Russia said it will “conduct a survey of cryptoasset investments and lending to crypto companies” over the first two months of 2026. Officials said the survey’s goal was “to assess the volume of investments in cryptocurrencies by regulated entities, including for risk hedging purposes.” Crypto Derivatives Order The bank has also ordered the Moscow Exchange and commercial banks that offer crypto derivatives to send it monthly reports on transactions and volumes. The bank has frequently found itself at loggerheads with the Ministry of Finance on crypto policy . Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Source: Ministry of Finance/Screenshot) The ministry wants to regulate and tax the crypto industry, and wants to take it “out of the grey zone.” But the bank would rather pursue solutions that restrict crypto to the fringes of the Russian economic system. However, Kirill Karpov, a senior lecturer in the Department of Financial Law at Moscow State Law University, told the newspaper: “[The bank and the government] will use the information from the survey to help form regulatory policy. They will look to legalize the market to generate tax revenue.” The legal expert Olga Zakharova noted: “At present, Russian legislation does not provide scope for any legal players other than officially registered crypto miners and participants in [the bank’s sandbox project].” The sandbox in question allows Russian firms to use crypto as a payment tool in cross-border trade deals. The bank begrudgingly approved the sandbox in response to to Washington-, Brussels-, and London-led sanctions packages.

Another Russian expert said that the bank is aware that it will need more data on the crypto industry in the years ahead. He told Izvestia that the global crypto market “currently accounts for approximately 2% of all financial assets,” adding: “Given this level of risk, there are no serious threats to the Russian economy yet. But this is a situation that requires constant monitoring.” Despite the bank’s caution, the crypto sector has many powerful advocates in the Moscow hierarchy. Senior politicians have made repeated calls on the Kremlin to fast-track crypto exchange regulation and consider the launch of a Russian strategic Bitcoin reserve .

In the meantime, analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale 2025. As the presale investors seek plausible projects before another bull run, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained momentum due to increased analyst support. In contrast to speculative launches, this presale has demonstrated signs of premature legitimacy – authenticated access portals, audited tokenomics, and transparent roadmaps. With analysts tracking Solana and Polygon bullish and rebound potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rated as one of the top emerging opportunities in altcoin cycle of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Crypto Presales in 2025 There is general consensus among analysts that legitimacy is the one differentiating factor between a successful presales and a short-lived hype token. MAGACOIN FINANCE gained popularity thanks to its proven presale system and developed investor-protective system. The stages of sale are based on an incremental pricing model, where early entrants have the advantage of a low entry point. In addition, it is stated that tokenomics and smart contract audits of MAGACOIN FINANCE match the highest security standards in the industry. This disclosure has made it one of the few presales tagged analyst-verified , an unusual feat on a market dominated by pure speculation. As the number of influencers and analysts supporting the project increases on a daily basis, confidence is growing. The increasing Telegram and X communities also contribute to its validity, indicating a real retail interest, and not artificial hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE Exchange Listing and Whale Moves As presales progress, early buyers of MAGACOIN FINANCE are already positioning for the upcoming exchange listings scheduled post-Q4 2025. Each presale phase brings gradual price increases, creating a built-in incentive for investors to move early. On-chain data also shows accumulation from large holders, indicating whale confidence in the project’s fundamentals. This early whale entry suggests expectations of significant upside once trading goes live. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention similar to early-stage tokens that delivered 10x–20x returns in previous cycles. With liquidity plans and marketing campaigns set for rollout around its listing phase, the presale is expected to reach full capacity ahead of schedule. Will Solana Price Hit New ATH? Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to dominate institutional headlines. With CME open interest surpassing $2.16 billion and ETP assets crossing $500 million, analysts believe a new all-time high could arrive before year-end. Technical patterns show strong accumulation above the $214–$216 support range, reinforcing bullish momentum. Bitwise CIO Hunter Horsley recently commented that a “Solana season” could be weeks away, driven by growing demand for regulated Solana products. A sustained move above $237 may trigger a breakout toward $253 and possibly beyond the previous record. SOLUSD 4-Hr Chart | Source: TradingView As Solana draws professional traders and funds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is securing early-stage investors who want the same returns. Both assets are now the representations of institutional belief and retail positioning before the next expansion phase in 2025. Polygon (MATIC) Among Altcoin Picks in 2025 Q4 Polygon (MATIC) has also re-entered analysts’ radar following a prolonged consolidation. Trading near $0.38, the token is testing critical support with signs of momentum recovery. Technical projections indicate potential targets between $0.58 and $0.80 by November 2025, supported by a bullish RSI reversal and narrowing MACD spread. Despite temporary bearish pressure, MATIC remains structurally bullish. Its upcoming zkEVM developments and partnership integrations could spark renewed investor attention. Within this market, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefiting from renewed retail participation, as investors rotate toward emerging, verified opportunities. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE proved itself to be among the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 , combining proven access, transparent audits, and organized stages of prices. Its rising analyst following, coupled with investor buzz about Solana and Polygon, indicates a wider resurgence of market trust in the altcoin market. MAGACOIN FINANCE will continue to be a top choice among investors looking to get in on the next crypto boom, having integrated all the elements of credibility, security, and growth potential as the market gears towards a Q4 rally.

While the asset has consistently climbed to new highs after each halving, the gains have diminished. In fact, new research revealed that “the degree of post-halving price gains has compressed over time since the second halving.” Returns Are Shrinking Fast Halvings, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, have slashed block rewards by 87.5% since 2012 – from 25 BTC to the current 3.125 BTC. This has fueled scarcity narratives that have long supported upward price momentum. Over this period, Bitcoin’s value has surged more than 9,110-fold, hitting $109,000 on September 1, 2025. A month later, the crypto asset has risen above $120,000. Despite this, CoinGecko stated that the magnitude of returns post-halving has waned. The second halving cycle in 2017 delivered peak gains of 29x, the 2021 cycle dropped to 6.7x, and the latest run in 2025 has seen a comparatively modest 93.1% increase. Interestingly, the cycle’s rhythm changed when Bitcoin posted a record $73,400 in March 2024 – months before the fourth halving -challenging historical expectations. Meanwhile, market activity has exploded, as evidenced by daily trading volumes surging from approximately $20 million in 2013 to nearly $30 billion in 2025. This has not deterred publicly listed companies from increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. As of October 3rd, 1,040,061 BTC was held by almost 200 listed firms, which is almost 5% of the total BTC supply. Strategy leads with 640,031 BTC. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, this represents 63.2% of all corporate-held Bitcoin, and added another 4,048 BTC on September 2. Several new companies are making significant moves into Bitcoin. Twenty One, backed by Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank, has purchased 43,514 BTC since May. It has now become the third-largest corporate holder. Meanwhile, US-based healthcare firm KindlyMD expanded its holdings through a merger with Nakamoto BTC Holdings, and added 5,765 BTC. It had also announced plans to raise $5 billion for treasury growth. Internationally, organizations like MetaPlanet in Japan and Treasury BV in Europe are building sizable Bitcoin treasuries, with Treasury BV raising $147 million to acquire more than 1,000 BTC. Bitcoin’s Backbone Strengthens While institutional holdings climb, the network itself has seen remarkable expansion in computational power. The Bitcoin network’s mining hash rate has been on a steady upward trajectory, as participation from both individual miners and institutional players has kept growing. Over the past year alone, the hash rate surged 88%, from 670 million TH/s to 1.266 ZH/s. Under the Trump administration, the US mining ecosystem has expanded, aided in part by the relocation of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to the US, spurred by tariffs and regulatory pressures. Meanwhile, domestic firms including HIVE, Hut 8, Marathon, and CleanSpark are increasingly prioritizing alternative energy sources for new facilities. Adding to the momentum, Eric Trump recently co-founded American Bitcoin Corp, which debuted on the Nasdaq.

After one year of consolidation, false starts and macro hesitation, crypto has found its groove again. Bitcoin ETFs are seeing nearly record inflows while Ethereum’s ecosystem remains strong and serious capital is flowing back into altcoins. But not all projects are equal. Every cycle produces their share of leaders, develops assets that combine technical strength, on-the-ground development, and cultural momentum. This quarter, the buzz is all about Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and MAGACOIN FINANCE. When you combine those elements, you have all the elements of crypto’s next expansion speed, sustainability, speculative firepower. The assets you need to know about that could drive the next bull market, from institutional positioning to community-driven surges. Solana: The Return of a Powerhouse After recovering in 2023 and 2024, looks like Solana will be on the rise this 2025. The network’s fundamentals have been strengthening across the board; daily active users, developer count, and DeFi TVL are all steadily growing. Solana processes more than 65,000 transactions per second. Thus, it is the fastest Layer 1 network in the top 10. More importantly, stability issues creating problems in the past have largely been solved with better validator and consensus upgrades. According to on-chain data, its ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Solana’s popularity is on the rise once again. NFT activity is on the rise, decentralized exchanges like Jupiter and Phyrnix are recording users, and Solana gaming projects are bringing in funds from the VC and retail. As liquidity shifts from Bitcoin ETFs, analysts think Layer 1s will perform better. The scalability, low fees, and growing pool of developers are set to position Solana to capture that flow. Cardano: Quiet Consistency Meets Long-Term Strength While Solana thrives on speed, Cardano wins on endurance. One of the few networks in crypto to operate with high decentralization and consistent protocol renewal without falling into the trap of a hype cycle. Currently, Cardano can be bought for $0.87 making it a great purchase as its all-time highs were much higher. Yet its fundamentals are stronger than ever. The hydra scaling is live. Transaction throughput is rising. Staking participation is continuously among the highest in the market. More and more developers are utilizing the Midnight sidechain of Cardano, which is privacy-enabled and made for enterprises and developers of compliant dApps. Meanwhile, links throughout Africa and Asia are extending the undertaking’s technological relevance, from identity management to agricultural tracking. The big picture of Cardano suggests a long accumulation base taking shape above multi-year support. This structure is bullish for investors who plan to stay long-term as it indicates an extended quiet phase before price acceleration on the upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Retail Power Redefined Q4 is shaping up as one of the strongest quarters for altcoins, and alongside giants like Solana and Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction. ROI forecasts hover between 1,000% and 1,400% , boosted by presale momentum and community expansion. The PATRIOT50X bonus code continues to attract early entries, driving near-continuous stage sellouts. Analysts argue that while SOL and ADA may double or triple, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s asymmetric structure gives it the chance to deliver multiple times that return. It’s this mix of accessibility, branding, and timing that makes it one of Q4’s most-watched projects. The Macro View: Rotation, Liquidity, and Momentum The Q4 setup is clear. Bitcoin ETF dominance has rekindled liquidity across exchanges. Ethereum remains the institutional hedge. At present, money is being pumped into altcoins that have a strong technical and cultural pull. Because of its scalability and ecosystem, capital rotation will first benefit Solana. Investors Are Looking For Credible Long-Term Foundations, So Cardano Follows MAGACOIN FINANCE boom as a result of psychological phenomena of early entry and community faith returned from speculation. This dynamic mirrors previous bull cycles. The institutional flows create structure; retail enthusiasm creates velocity. Together, they build sustainability. The upcoming 2025 cycle ultimately contain something new, transparency. With clear data available, investors can ascertain their confidence levels in projects in real-time. Why These Three Define Q4 2025 Each of the three leaders embodies a different kind of strength: Solana: The institutional favorite – fast, efficient, and liquid. Cardano: The developer’s choice – secure, academic, and future-focused. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The people’s coin – transparent, viral, and scarce. Institutional adoption, foundational innovation and retail momentum combine to form the perfect trinity for the next leg of the market. Solana’s breakout could ignite the entire Layer 1 sector. Cardano’s steady growth ensures depth and sustainability. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows the thrill of new capital. Combining these elements achieves stability and generating explosive potential—the key characteristics that instil confidence in investors during a bull phase. Conclusion: The Quarter That Changes Everything At the end of 2025, the mood is once again optimistic for cryptocurrencies. ETFs have brought in some structure, liquidity is coming back and the retail crowd is waking up. All signs are pointing to acceleration in Q4, as conviction meets timing and innovation meets community. Solana leads the charge with institutional confidence. Cardano grounds the rally with technical integrity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the emotional fire that converts belief into breakout momentum. Looked through every previous cycle, the narrative was formed by a few assets, this time it’s these three. Together they herald a bigger message: balance is returning between structure, speculation and spirit. The market has grown up, but the chance remain. Those who position early, hold clearly, and understand that true conviction always comes before the move, shall own Q4 2025.

Addressing tens of thousands of people at Mexico City’s central Zócalo on Sunday to celebrate one year in office, Sheinbaum’s speech struck a confident note about her government’s future. Sheinbaum stated that she was confident Mexico would establish good relations with the United States and other countries, including those in the trade sector. Her comments came as Mexico prepared for difficult discussions over the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set for a pivotal review next year. Sheinbaum pushes tech agenda And aside from trade, Sheinbaum is placing a big bet on technology. In the weeks ahead, in addition to other progress reports, her government will release information on homegrown projects related to electric vehicles, semiconductors, satellites, drones, and an artificial intelligence laboratory. These policies are at the heart of her vision for a “made-in-Mexico” future that would reduce reliance on imports and put the country at an advantage in emerging industries, the President said. Such proposals are consistent with Sheinbaum’s constant linkage of economic development to innovation and environmental sustainability, journeying into a post-oil economy. By supporting EVs and semiconductor plants, the latter of which critics deride as “dig attachment,” she wants Mexico to enter both the manufacturing game and compete in the global tech race . Sheinbaum told the crowd that her government was not only defending sovereignty but was doing so through knowledge, science, and technology. Sheinbaum’s assertion comes at a fragile moment in Mexico’s commodity trade. Her government secured a 90-day truce on new U.S. tariffs earlier this year, giving negotiators time to seek a longer-term deal. Washington has hinted that it might conduct negotiations with Mexico and Canada one-on-one, a development that could significantly alter the context surrounding the USMCA. Meanwhile, Mexico is imposing tariffs on nations that don’t have trade agreements with it – China, in particular. Economists view the move as a tactical shift toward American interests, as Washington is simultaneously engaged in a trade war with Beijing. Sheinbaum has cast these maneuvers as a responsibility of her government to protect Mexico’s sovereignty while remaining part of the world. She even took a jibe at the U.S. Donald Trump’s recent attempt to rename the oil-rich Gulf that they both share. Smiling, she let audience members “vote” on whether a proposed train line from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo should be called the “Gulf of Mexico Train.” The audience roared its approval. Sheinbaum builds political momentum and faces new challenges Sheinbaum starts her second year in office with approval ratings over 70% — some of the highest in Latin America. She has been popular for projecting an image of a pragmatic leader who combines progressive ideals with careful economic stewardship. Still, challenges loom. The review of the USMCA will also test Mexico’s hand as it navigates political uncertainty in Washington. At home, Sheinbaum will also need to persuade businesses that her tech drive can shift from grand announcements to concrete action, particularly in industries where Mexico has faced stiff international competition. Observers said Sheinbaum’s success as president would depend on her ability to balance diplomacy abroad with innovation at home. One Mexico City economist noted that she was trying to straddle the fence, seeking to please the U.S., protect Mexico’s sovereignty, and at the same time build a new industrial base — a strategy he described as a high-stakes gamble. With her supporters celebrating in the capital, Sheinbaum’s message was clear: Mexico can refuse to allow itself to be shaped by global powers. Instead, she hopes to help shape the country’s future connections with the world through trade deals and a bold push into technology.

The San Francisco startup led by Sam Altman acquired Ive’s company LoveFrom (io) last May for $6.5 billion, but it shared little about the two companies’ joint project. Now, sources familiar with the effort say the two are working on a palm-sized, screenless device that listens, watches, and responds to its environmen t, but key hurdles have yet to be resolved. OpenAI and Ive battle software glitches and compute shortages Ive and his team, famous for iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, have built early hardware prototypes . However, progress is being slowed by software hurdles and the infrastructure required to support OpenAI’s powerful models. Issues under debate include shaping the assistant’s “personality,” addressing privacy concerns, and covering the steep computing costs of scaling the device to mass markets. “Compute is another huge factor for the delay,” said one person close to Ive. “Amazon has the compute for an Alexa, so does Google [for its Home device], but OpenAI is struggling to get enough compute for ChatGPT, let alone an AI device — they need to fix that first.” A person close to OpenAI described the current glitches as typical growing pains in product development. According to multiple people familiar with the project, OpenAI and Jony Ive are working on a device about the size of a smartphone, equipped with a camera, microphone, and speaker. One source said the gadget could even feature multiple cameras. The device is designed to sit on a desk or table, but can also be carried around. Unlike voice assistants that activate with a trigger word, it would be “always on,” with sensors continuously collecting data to build a virtual assistant’s “memory.” The Wall Street Journal previously reported som e of its early specifications. OpenAI, now the world’s most valuable private company at $500 billion after surpassing Elon Musk’s SpaceX , sees hardware as a way to justify its soaring valuation. The goal is to go beyond the limited use cases of smart speakers like Amazon’s Echo, instead offering a far more capable AI companion. Still, challenges remain. Two people familiar with the effort said the team has yet to settle on the device’s “voice” and personality. Another hurdle is striking the right balance in conversations: ensuring the assistant chimes in when helpful without dominating interactions — a weakness still evident in ChatGPT today. “The concept is that you should have a friend who’s a computer who isn’t your weird AI girlfriend . . . like [Apple’s digital voice assistant] Siri but better,” said one person who was briefed on the plans.

Genius Act and SEC accounting guidance have significantly boosted confidence in stablecoins. This, in turn, drove institutional and retail adoption in 2025. $300B Milestone According to DeFiLlama, Tether (USDT) remains the dominant stablecoin as it accounts for 58.52% of the market with a valuation of $176.241 billion. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) follows with a market capitalization of more than $74 billion, while USDe, the third-largest yield-bearing stablecoin, holds $14.83 billion. The milestone indicates the growing prominence of stablecoins in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, and comes amidst market-wide recovery after a volatile week. Historically, Q3 is quieter for crypto, but 2025 reversed that trend and ended up becoming a record-breaking period for stablecoins. Activity surged thanks to both regulatory clarity and growing user engagement. A report by Cex.io revealed that Google searches for “stablecoin” spiked following landmark announcements. For instance, the US enacted the Genius Act, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued new accounting guidance, which classified USD-pegged stablecoins as cash equivalents. These regulatory developments boosted trust among both institutional and retail participants. Impact On USD’s Global Role The rapid growth of the stablecoin market is significantly influencing the global role of the US dollar, according to John Murillo, Chief Business Officer of B2BROKER. In a statement to CryptoPotato, Murillo said that this surge is partly due to last month’s slow momentum in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, which prompted investors and users to turn to dollar-pegged stablecoins. He explained, “With it, the global footprint of the US dollar has certainly deepened, because around 98% of all stablecoins are directly or indirectly dollar-pegged. This has been, for better or worse, embedding USD into decentralized finance, cross-border payments while helping stabilize many inflation-hit economies. In regions like Nigeria and Venezuela, digital dollars now circulate more freely than local currencies, extending the dollar’s dominance into the digital realm.” However, Murillo warns that this growth carries systemic risks. The exec added that stablecoins typically operate outside conventional banking regulations, which raises questions about reserve transparency, liquidity vulnerabilities, and regulatory gaps. A sudden loss of confidence, whether from unclear backing or platform failures, could, in fact, destabilize both crypto markets and traditional fiat systems. Additionally, as stablecoins increasingly operate within decentralized networks, they begin to function independently of US institutions, which potentially limits Washington’s direct control over monetary influence. “The dollar remains dominant in form, but increasingly contested in function.” The post USDT Leads $300B Stablecoin Surge Amid Record-Breaking Q3 Crypto Activity appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Stablecoins|Tether (USDT)|USDC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|MARKET|USDC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-06 00:47:55

The utility-driven DeFi altcoin is priced at just $0.035 in Stage 6 of its already over 55% sold-out presale. With $16.85 million+ raised and 16,750+ holders, the presale suggests confidence from early investors. As opposed to XRP, which only benefits from cross-border payment adoption and speculative positioning, MUTM offers dual lending infrastructure, delivering actual utility and sustainable growth. Whales are cycling into Mutuum Finance for asymmetric upside potential, and it’s a unique sub-$1 crypto that can offer gigantic returns as adoption grows in the DeFi sector. XRP Maintains Key Support During Mid-Cycle Pause Ripple (XRP) remains in a robust macro uptrend regardless of the recent drawdown, which analysts consider to be a mid-cycle pause rather than a reversal. The $2.85 support has remained firm, and price action is coiling within a falling wedge, a bullish setup that resolves higher. Traders are also watching $3.40 as a strong resistance level, and a move above this level may open up gains above $5 in this cycle. While XRP is still on the radar of technical traders, the majority of investors are also considering alternative DeFi opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is picking up momentum in the market. MUTM Presale Momentum Gains Speed MUTM tokens are priced at $0.035 in Round 6 Presale, which is a 16.17% rise compared to the previous round. Solid investor demand persists with over 16,750 investors raising a total of $16.85 million to date. Mutuum Finance is preparing to deploy its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to further solidify its grasp in the DeFi market. V1 of the protocol will be deployed on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with required features such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. With ETH and USDT support for lending, borrowing, and collateral from day one, the protocol is looking to offer a robust and user-friendly decentralized finance experience. Another step taken to construct the platform’s security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers are welcome to report bugs. There are four levels of bug severities, i.e., low, minor, major, and critical, available so that bugs might be detected on time and resolved. As a gesture of appreciation to its early investors, the team also unveiled a $100,000 giveaway , to compensate 10 lucky winners with 10,000 MUTM tokens each. MUTM is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and users. Unconditional deposit limits, borrowing limits, and collateral ratios are some of the features that render it safe. Real-time closure and remediation fees and penalties on undercollateral position stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Whales See What’s Coming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as the investment of choice for individuals seeking explosive upside outside the typical altcoins like Ripple (XRP). With Stage 6 of its presale already over 55% sold out and with more than 16,750 investors and in excess of $16.85 million invested, whale activity is signaling growing confidence in its long-term potential. The upcoming launch of its lending and borrowing protocol, along with real-yield tokenomics and extensive security measures like the $50,000 bug bounty program, showcases the project’s commitment to building a strong DeFi ecosystem. As institutional players invest capital into projects with tangible use cases and growing potential, MUTM’s early traction positions it as a standout opportunity in 2025. Secure your presale allocation today and join the investors who are getting ahead of the curve on the next giant leap for decentralized finance.

Although XRP bulls have managed to hold above $3, the cryptocurrency hasn’t really followed rallies witnessed by Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 24 hours. Nonethless, XRP’s price action in the past few days has caused its price chart to print a new technical setup that has previously marked the beginning of significant rallies, and history might repeat itself again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $123,000 As Rising Open Interest Signals More Action Ahead Bullish XRP Technical Signal Reappears Technical analysis of XRP’s 3-day candlestick chart shows that the cryptocurrency is currently repeating a technical signal which has preceded rallies multiple times this cycle. This signal, which was first revealed on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Cryptoinsightsuk, holds importance, as it has preceeded three different price rallies already this cycle. Crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk shared a post on X highlighting this development, noting that XRP just achieved a great 3-day candle close and a simultaneous bullish cross on the 3-day RSI, which is a setup that historically preceded explosive price movements. The RSI, which tracks momentum shifts in market sentiment, has just crossed above its signal line to form a bullish structure identical to those seen in November 2024, April 2025, and June 2025. Each of these past simultaneous 3-day candle closes and RSI crosses occurred shortly before major XRP rallies. The RSI crossover in November 2024 occurred right before the most remarkable XRP rally since 2017. Notably, this RSI breakout was followed by a sharp 500% price surge, and XRP’s price increased from around $0.5 to over $3 within the weeks that followed. The April 2025 signal similarly preceded another leg up. Although the resulting rally was smaller than the November 2024 rally, XRP went from around $1.9 to $2.7. Then came June 2025, when the same RSI and candle setup appeared for a third time after XRP closed its 3-day candlestick above $2.2. This one proved even more significant than April’s signal, and this eventually culminated in a new all-time high of $3.65. XRP 3D Price Chart. Source: Cryptoinsightuk on X Market Context And What Comes Next The patterns noted above are very important for XRP, and there’s no reason for it not to repeat the same rally. According to Cryptoinsightuk, the reappearance of this exact signal suggests that XRP might once again be gearing up for pop to the upside. Interestingly, the signal also sets a good precedent for the possible approval of Spot XRP ETF applications by the US SEC. Related Reading: XRP To $100? Analyst Says It Could Be The Next Amazon At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.03. If history repeats itself even on a smaller scale, such as the rally witnessed in April 2025, XRP could climb toward $3.80 in the coming weeks. The most bullish repeat scenario could see the XRP price climb as high as $15.

Now, in his second term, some Washington officials who advocate a hard line on China are concerned that Trump may be softening. As Trump seeks to establish a significant trade deal with the country’s largest economic rival, those pushing for a tougher stance worry that they are being pushed aside. This occurs when the tech industry becomes more influential, and Trump demonstrates a heightened interest in what he calls “a big deal.” Economic experts raise concerns about Trump’s efforts to strike a trade deal with China Concerns about Trump easing up on China have intensified following an announcement of an upcoming meeting between the U.S. president and Xi Jinping, the President of the People’s Republic of China. Ahead of the talks, China outlined several demands expected to alter the US’s long-standing policies. This includes easing investment regulations to boost investments and reducing U.S. support for Taiwan. Additionally, Trump demonstrated his willingness to disregard concerns raised by China hawks, such as maintaining deals to keep TikTok’s video-sharing app operational and permitting Nvidia Corp. to sell some of its AI chips to the country. The U.S. president also fired several advisers from the National Security Council who backed a tougher approach toward China. Consequently, this has weakened the council’s role. The situation has worried security and tech experts because it seems like no one is left to challenge those advocating for stronger business ties with Beijing. According to some economic experts, the situation surrounding China-U.S. business ties is serious due to the strong economic connections between the two countries and China’s potential in sectors such as AI, chips, and cybersecurity. Huang’s remark against China hawks faces criticism from individuals Trump cited national security as the basis for imposing tariffs on a range of products, including aluminum and steel, as well as kitchen cabinets. However, during his first term, he also demonstrated a pattern of halting efforts to curb sales to China. He criticized his advisers for employing a fake concept of national security. The tensions were revealed last week when Jensen Huang, the chairman of Nvidia, criticized hard-liners against China during a podcast interview. A powerful informal adviser to Trump on issues of technology and China policy, Huang blasted them as hard-liners who wear a “badge of shame” and are not patriotic. Seeing how individuals raised concerns about his remarks, Huang’s defenders argued that his remarks were misinterpreted. This prompted strong criticism from people like former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who called for Huang to be arrested, saying he is an agent of influence for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Moreover, tech investor Joe Lonsdale, a Trump supporter, proudly pointed out that he is a China hawk, describing the CCP as an evil and violent authoritarian regime. Still, Huang and David Sacks, a tech investor and podcaster who serves as Trump’s advisor on AI and crypto, believe that the hawks are wrong. They say it is good for America if China becomes dependent on American technology. According to them, this strategy will hinder Chinese companies from gaining sufficient power and market share to overpower American businesses elsewhere.

In the last 24 hours, several tokens have retraced sharply while a select few have held strong. The constant shifts in price have made the spotlight fall on projects that not only bring hype but also real mechanisms of growth. Data shows that Hedera ($HBAR) has gained more than 5% in the past day, while Polkadot ($DOT) rose about 4% according to CoinMarketCap. In contrast, several speculative meme coins shed gains, showing again that liquidity often flows into projects with deeper fundamentals when markets shake. Within this backdrop, BullZilla ($BZIL) is marching to a very different beat. Its presale has already crossed $770,000, reaching Stage 5, titled “Roar Drop Incoming.” Over 2,500 holders now own a slice of the beast, with more than 30 billion tokens sold. Its unique progressive presale design is not just pushing demand upward but also creating one of the most talked-about investment stories in 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale Engine Driving Relentless Growth Unlike conventional presales with fixed stages, the BullZilla ($BZIL) system is a living mechanism. Every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, the price increases automatically. This maintains constant upward pressure on prices and ensures that, regardless of when a buyer enters, the cost will always increase the longer they wait. At a current price of $0.00012574, compared to the launch price of $0.00527141, early buyers are already sitting on paper ROI potential of over 2,000%. Stage 5C holders are tracking more than 4,000% gains if the launch price holds. A $1,000 investment today secures around 7.95 million tokens. When multiplied against the launch price, that investment could be valued at $41,900. BullZilla’s economic engine doesn’t stop at presale mechanics. The Roar Burn mechanism ensures that tokens are permanently removed at the end of every chapter in its 24-part Lore Bible. Meanwhile, its HODL Furnace staking pool offers a blazing 70% APY, rewarding conviction. Add in the Roarblood Vault referral system, where buyers earn 10% on both sides of the referral link, and the project’s design begins to look like a self-reinforcing ecosystem. Presale Figures at a Glance Metric Details Current Stage 5 (Roar Drop Incoming) Phase 3rd Current Price $0.00012574 Presale Raised Over $770,000 Token Holders 2,500+ Tokens Sold 30B+ Launch Price $0.00527141 ROI (Stage 5C to Launch) 4,092.30% ROI for Earliest Joiners 2,086.78% Upcoming Price Surge 5.29% (next stage) The presale advantage is clear. Each milestone ensures that hesitation comes at a cost. According to the project’s official whitepaper, the system is engineered not by timelines but by belief and liquidity flow. This makes BullZilla not just a token but a living mechanism, where scarcity, rewards, and growth converge. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Purchasing BullZilla is simple, but the key is speed. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Second, acquire Ethereum (ETH) from an exchange like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it into your wallet. Third, connect the wallet to the official BullZilla presale site. Finally, swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Once the transaction is confirmed, allocations are secured and claimable after the presale ends. With each $100,000 milestone raising the token’s price, every delay means paying more for the same tokens. Hedera ($HBAR): The Network Powering Enterprise-Grade Adoption Hedera continues to prove itself as one of the most robust distributed networks in the space. Its Hashgraph consensus mechanism provides thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of a cent, making it a favorite for enterprise adoption. According to the Hedera documentation, fees are consistently around $0.0001, far lower than Ethereum’s current costs. The network is governed by a council of global giants, including Google, IBM, and LG. This governance model is unique, offering both decentralization and credibility. Hedera has also maintained a carbon-negative footprint, which appeals to corporations that must meet stringent sustainability standards. In the last 24 hours, Hedera has surged more than 5%, reflecting increasing investor confidence. Use cases range from tokenized assets to supply chain verification. As blockchain adoption spreads, Hedera’s enterprise-first approach positions it as one of the most practical networks for global firms. Polkadot ($DOT): Bridging the Future of Blockchains Polkadot was created with a mission: to connect blockchains. Its parachain architecture enables multiple chains to run independently while still communicating through the Relay Chain. This shared security model enables projects to innovate while remaining protected. The recent 4% increase in DOT’s price coincided with discussions around its proposed stablecoin, pUSD, which will be minted via the Honzon protocol and fully backed by DOT. If launched, pUSD could stabilize DeFi activity across the Polkadot ecosystem, reducing reliance on external stablecoins. Polkadot has already enabled dozens of parachain projects, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to decentralized identity systems. By addressing interoperability, it solves one of blockchain’s biggest bottlenecks: isolated ecosystems that cannot communicate. Analysts from Messari have noted that Polkadot’s design could play a key role in Web3’s scalability if adoption accelerates. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BullZilla’s presale structure provides an edge that neither Hedera nor Polkadot can match in the near term. While Hedera continues to win enterprise adoption and Polkadot pushes interoperability forward, BullZilla’s progressive presale design, high staking rewards, and referral ecosystem create an explosive investment case. With more than $770,000 raised, 2,500 holders onboard, and ROI potential already calculated at over 4,000% for Stage 5 buyers, the project is shaping up as one of the best presales with 100x potential in 2025. Investors who wait risk buying at higher prices, while those who act now secure a position in what could be the next breakout. The call is clear: join the presale, secure allocations, and use referral codes for extra bonuses before the next price surge triggers.

LLM Summary This article examines BullZilla’s presale alongside recent gains in Hedera and Polkadot. BullZilla is currently in Stage 5 of its presale, with over $770,000 raised and more than 2,500 holders. Its progressive presale engine raises prices every $100,000 or 48 hours, while burns, staking at 70% APY, and referral rewards enhance scarcity and returns. At current pricing, a $1,000 investment could turn into over $41,000 at launch. Hedera’s enterprise partnerships and Polkadot’s interoperability advances add weight to their ecosystems, but BullZilla’s deflationary design positions it as one of the best presales with 100x potential in 2025.

52728746,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=828368,1759713344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52728746.jpeg,China’s green tech exports outshine U.S. fossil fuel push,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinas-green-tech-exports-outshine-us-fossil/,"China is pulling ahead in the global energy race, outpacing the United States as it ramps up exports of clean technology. While the U.S. continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, China is rapidly expanding its footprint in electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, and other carbon-cutting products. The country has been increasing its clean energy exports for years, and 2025 has been another significant year. In August alone, the country sent $20 billion worth of clean energy products to international markets, according to Ember, a London-based energy think tank. Growth is strong in both value and volume: solar exports have increased even as prices have declined, with a record 46,000 megawatts of solar power capacity exported in a single month. Electric vehicles and batteries are now the fastest-growing sectors, surpassing solar as China’s top clean energy exports. New factories are running at full capacity, and more than half of this year’s electric car exports have gone to emerging markets outside the OECD. Africa, for example, imported 60% more Chinese solar panels over the past year, reaching an installed capacity of over 15 GW. The edge for China is scale, efficiency, and cost. It creates clean technologies that developing nations could afford for energy. While China already consumes most of what it produces — the country remains one of the world’s largest energy consumers — its export strength is shaping global markets, according to experts. The U.S. is doubling its fossil fuel exports As China zips forward with clean energy, the United States is doubling down on fossil fuels. In 2024, it exported roughly 30% of its primary energy output — mostly oil and gas — according to the Energy Information Administration . The U.S. is now a major power in world oil exports. Crude exports had reached roughly 4.2 million barrels per day in September 2025, the highest level in 18 months, fueled by robust demand in Asia. Exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also growing, and new LNG export terminals are being built along the Gulf Coast. Federal subsidies are supporting this push. A recent study found that U.S. fossil fuel companies benefit from approximately $31 billion in government support each year. Critics argue that this undermines global climate commitments, particularly as international funding for fossil fuel projects declines. At the policy level, Washington has promoted increased oil and gas production, a drive that received renewed momentum during Donald Trump’s first term and continued under Joe Biden. In Trump’s second term, continued rollbacks of regulations are likely to propel the fossil fuel industries further and limit incentives for clean energy technology. Importers face a sharp divide For nations that buy American or Chinese energy products, the choice is between two very different futures. Hardware for clean energy — whether solar panels, wind turbines, or EV batteries — is infrastructural in that it can make power for decades. Fossil fuels are used, bought, and used, then must be replaced. This cleavage is remaking energy politics. China’s clean exports may not always generate more revenue in the short term than American oil and gas sales. Still, the rise of green technology leaves a more lasting legacy of influence — and partnerships with developing economies. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, stated that clean energy exports offer hardware capable of producing power for a decade or two after purchase. In contrast, gas is consumed immediately and is gone forever once used. It’s not over till it’s over in the fight for energy supremacy. But as more and more solar panels, battery packs, and electric vehicles are shipped to other countries, China’s lead in determining the world’s energy future seems insurmountable.

Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as sellers failed to push the price below Fib levels. The recent lows triggered minor buying pressure. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , the Bitcoin mining industry had a powerful September as the total value of major publicly traded miners surged to $58.1 billion. Bitcoin price prediction October 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $118,000, making a minor recovery in September. However, it declined later and saw heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around October 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction October 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-06 01:20:00

The project has so far raised over $15 million and enlisted over 18, 000 investors, which is an indication of increasing confidence in the retail and institutional circles. According to analysts, all the presale phases are selling out at unprecedented rates, generating one of the best momentum in this market cycle. As the crypto presale gets attention from major trading communities, MAGACOIN FINANCE adoption curve continues to accelerate, positioning it for 75x ROI in 2025. Here’s Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Adoption Is on The Rise Analysts cite the mix of legitimacy, transparency, and confirmed audit credentials as the reason behind the rapid MAGACOIN FINANCE adoption. The project passed a Hashex audit, which proved the smart contracts to be secure with no critical vulnerabilities. In the meantime, secondary verification is being carried out through a Certik audit. These steps boosted investor confidence at a time when the market demands accountability from new presales. In contrast to speculative token launches based on social momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a systematic and transparent presale structure. Every phase comes at an increasing price, rewarding those who join early and promoting long-term expansion. This model has generated strong backing among traders seeking reliability in a volatile market. Moreover, throughout the adoption surge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a 50% additional bonus to the early buyers by using the code PATRIOTS50X . Therefore, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting itself as the most suitable crypto presale to purchase early in this cycle, with returns of 75x. XRP Price Prediction XRP price is holding steady near the $3 mark as analysts monitor a critical resistance zone around $10.30, historically known as “The Chasm.” Market analysts suggest that breaking this zone could trigger a major breakout toward $11 or higher. The structure suggests a multi-year accumulation period, during which the holders will experience a huge upside after the resistance is broken. Although the long-term perspective of XRP is positive, traders are shifting to new opportunities with greater short-term gains. Many of the XRP investors have already started to transfer over to the 75x ROI presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE , hoping to ride its rapid adoption and early-stage pricing advantage. AVAX Price Defends $27 Support Avalanche (AVAX) is currently holding its $27 support zone, which analysts believe is important in maintaining its overall uptrend. According to technical analysts, this level acts as a catapult to major targets at $45 and $55. On-chain data also verify an increase in DEX trading, with high levels of network demand and institutional involvement. AVAXUSD 2-Day Chart | Source: X Nevertheless, despite AVAX stabilization, some of its traders are seeking high growth opportunities elsewhere. A large number of AVAX investors are shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which promises 75x ROI . The transition highlights the changing investor sentiment from established Layer-1 assets to presales at the early stages. This migration trend is indicated by the rapidly growing adoption rate of MAGACOIN FINANCE, signifying that it is one of the preferred alternatives in the current market cycle Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANC E is on top of the 2025 crypto presales with verified legitimacy and explosive demand. Having already raised more than $15 million and a potential 75x ROI , it is attracting XRP and AVAX traders looking to get in early. Besides, the bonus code of 50% PATRIOTS50X boosts MAGACOIN FINANCE adoption. Consequently, the crypto presale is topping investor picks in the 2025 bull cycle.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. A ruble-backed stablecoin tied to a sanctioned Russian defense bank somehow ended up sponsoring Singapore’s biggest crypto event, creating a compliance headache that exposed how easily financial sanctions blur across jurisdictions. On Friday morning, former White House Crypto Policy Director Bo Hines took to the stage at Token2049 to extol the virtues of Tether – his new employer – and its Genius-act compliant stablecoin USAT. A guarantor of U.S. dollar hegemony, which the world seems to want, is how he described it. A few hours later, Oleg Ogienko, A7A5's director for regulatory and overseas affairs, a ruble-backed stablecoin issuer targeted by authorities worldwide took to the stage with a very different message. While the presence of Ogienko and the speech he gave made for a more interesting conference, a big question on everyone's mind is how his sanctioned company was able to pay for sponsorship. A7A5, a ruble-backed stablecoin issued by Old Vector and used on the A7 LLC payments platform – which is designed to assist businesses in-country to bypass sanctions – is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), a financial institution sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K and many other jurisdictions around the world for its role in financing Russia’s defense sector. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Singapore broke from its decades‑old policy of neutrality and joined the West in sanctioning key Russian banks and defense‑linked entities , including state‑owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), a move that also set it apart from its ASEAN neighbours, who avoided such measures. On March 14, 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued notice SNR-N01 which prohibits financial entities in Singapore from interacting with major banks in Russia including Promsvyazbank (PSB) – where A7A5's reserves are kept. Effectively, this would bar any MAS-regulated institutions and crypto service providers from facilitating or processing any transactions, sponsorships, or partnerships involving A7A5 or other PSB-backed digital assets. But, Token2049 is organized by Hong Kong-registered BOB Group. Hong Kong, as part of China, follows Beijing's lead on sanctions, which currently maintains trade and financial ties with Russia despite Western restrictions. Token2049 organizers did not respond to repeated requests for comment. MAS did not provide a response by press time. While the BOB Group would be in compliance with local law in Hong Kong, other sponsors became nervous about having their brands associated with A7A5. A number of companies that spoke to CoinDesk called the presence of the stablecoin issuer a ""compliance nightmare"" while another said they had a ""heart attack"" seeing them on the site. BOB seemed to have gotten the message, and scrubbed references to A7A5 from the sponsor list, though the Internet Archive still has it . A7A5, for its part, still proudly lists itself as a conference sponsor on social media, including of the official Token2049 massage zone , which has, as it says, a lounge ""where deals are closed while you unwind."" Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin surged to a record high above $125,000, up 11% for the week, as massive inflows into U.S. spot ETFs and heightened safe-haven demand amid the U.S. government shutdown and global liquidity expectations fueled buying. ETH: Ethereum is trading around $4,500 and is gaining attention ahead of December’s Fusaka upgrade, which VanEck says will cut rollup costs through PeerDAS, enhance scaling efficiency, and strengthen ETH’s role as the monetary backbone of the network rather than just a fee-generating asset. Gold: Gold continues to surge, trading above $ 3,880, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a prolonged U.S. government shutdown. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged over 4% to a record high after the ruling LDP chose Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, with investors betting her pro-growth “high-pressure” economic stance will keep the BOJ’s policies accommodative.

The committee issued its guidance in a special report published last week, suggesting that exposure to digital assets should remain modest and conservative. Its recommendations apply across portfolio categories, from wealth conservation at 0% to opportunistic growth at a maximum of 4%. “While the GIC allocation models will not include explicit allocations to cryptocurrency, we aim to support our financial advisors and clients, who may flexibly allocate to cryptocurrency as part of their multiasset portfolios,” the report said. Advisors Urged To Rebalance Portfolios Regularly To Limit Crypto Risk The committee, which guides 16,000 Morgan Stanley advisors overseeing $2 trillion in client wealth, framed cryptocurrency as a speculative but increasingly popular asset class. It compared Bitcoin to “digital gold” and placed the asset within the broader category of real assets. This is huge. New Special Report from Morgan Stanley GIC: ""we aim to support our Financial Advisors and clients, who may flexibly allocate to cryptocurrency as part of their multiasset portfolios."" GIC guides 16,000 advisors managing $2 trillion in savings and wealth for… pic.twitter.com/RBWFxlRNkS — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) October 5, 2025 It stressed the need for investors and advisors to rebalance regularly, preferably quarterly or at least annually, to avoid swelling allocations that could add unnecessary portfolio risk. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley described the report as “huge,” noting that crypto is moving into its mainstream phase. Bitcoin Hits Record $125,000 As Supply On Exchanges Tightens The recommendations come as Bitcoin pushes further into mainstream portfolios. On Sunday morning, the token surged to a record $125,000 , breaking its previous peak of $124,500 set in August. Centralized exchanges are now reporting the lowest Bitcoin reserves in six years, signaling a tightening supply backdrop as demand grows. Morgan Stanley’s analysis reflects the growing recognition of crypto among major financial institutions, even as they approach the sector cautiously. By limiting allocations to a narrow range, the bank acknowledges both the appeal of digital assets and the risks of volatility and liquidity stress. The report also pointed to the role of exchange-traded products in providing access to the emerging asset class, giving investors regulated pathways rather than direct token purchases. Advisors Gain Clarity As Wall Street Giant Prepares For Next Crypto Push Although the GIC stopped short of adding crypto allocations into its official model portfolios, it sought to provide clarity for advisors already fielding interest from clients. Younger investors in particular have been pushing for more exposure, while institutional adoption continues to rise. Separately, Morgan Stanley is also planning to roll out crypto trading for E-Trade clients in early 2026, potentially unlocking access to $1.3 trillion in trading volume. The bank is working with crypto infrastructure firm Zerohash to provide liquidity, custody and settlement, representing one of the biggest moves by a major US bank into digital assets.

This presale is being closely watched alongside established altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) , which are seeing growing institutional interest and ecosystem activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in to give speculators some much-needed clarity, as presale markets are increasingly crowded with speculation. It provides an exclusive ecosystem for investors to easily engage in the presale, use promo codes, and follow token stages. MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning out to one of the top presales in October 2025. Analysts are predicting that an early investor in MAGACOIN FINANCE could easily walk away with 50x, 75x, or even more with its current growth trajectory. The organized presale and community growth of MAGACOIN FINANCE entices both institutional and retail investors in the early stage with high upside exposure. Growing popularity within the market shows more people want to buy the presale which offers alternative to coins like XRP and Solana. Ripple (XRP): Bullish Catalysts XRP is trading near $3.03 due to positive ecosystem developments. The digital treasury will be restructured with Ripple at the helm; a new injection of $19 million will be used for the purchase of XRP and to repay debt. Analysts predict that the SEC will approve spot ETFs around October 18, potentially leading to institutional inflows. According to technical analysis, the price of XRP could reach $4.20. Some traders are cautious that XRP’s momentum may not last and that it could be supplanted by newer altcoins. Engineers at Ripple are working on enhancing the XRP Ledger for privacy, compliance and for institutional adoption. Solana (SOL): Steady Ecosystem Growth Solana is stable, trading at $232–$234, as it continues to develop its high-speed blockchain. Scalability is continued to be supported by network improvements and developer activity. Meanwhile, the bubbling ecosystem is giving Solana a status of a top smart contract platform. While it doesn’t have as many big headlines, Solana remains a significant rotation pick for investors seeking high-cap stable altcoins with ongoing ecosystem expansion. Conclusion The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has the potential to offer investors an early entrant opportunity worth anywhere from 50x to 75x in October. The bull run of XRP, along with the anticipation of an institutional ETF and the steady ecosystem expansion of Solana, makes these three projects great rotation picks for altcoin investors in Q4 2025. For investors seeking a mix of established altcoins and high-upside, new tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Solana offer a compelling combination.

Remarkably, Strategy alone accounts for more than half of this total. Last week, its Bitcoin treasury value reached an all-time high, even though BTC has yet to make a new all-time high. Michael Saylor’s firm currently holds 640,031 BTC worth a whopping $79 billion at current market prices. This values the stash higher than the market capitalizations of Motorola, Airbnb, BNY Mellon, and US Bancorp. The DAT Model is Working for Now DATs leverage their stock volatility to raise capital by selling securities at prices below their implied volatility. This attracts sophisticated traders who buy these “cheap” instruments and hedge with “expensive” options, profiting as volatility converges. VanEck noted that many new DATs lack deep and liquid markets for trading options, for example, forcing them to offer steep discounts. Bitmine Immersion Technologies is one such company that recently sold a package at a deep discount despite having twice the trading volume of other DATs. Always good nuggets in our crypto monthly https://t.co/8ZamYYoRVX — VanEck (@vaneck_us) October 3, 2025 However, the DAT model does have two major risk factors. Bitcoin volatility has been trending downward for nearly a decade due to adoption. Since DATs need ongoing volatility to fund purchases, this threatens their business model. Additionally, some DATs now trade below their net asset values. When this happens, they may start selling options for income instead of issuing shares, which could further compress volatility across the sector and create a self-limiting cycle. “This dynamic could reduce implied volatility across the sector and eventually leave the ‘volatility well’ depleted, limiting the ability of DATs to purchase assets.” Explosive Growth Not Without Risk The DAT sector has exploded from around 70 companies in September 2024 to over 200 companies by September 2025, including over 190 focused on Bitcoin and 10 to 20 on Ether or altcoins, reported the Digital Assets Council on Friday. “This accelerating growth rate highlights DATs’ mainstreaming but underscores leverage and market risks,” it cautioned. Public and private corporate Bitcoin treasuries have collectively accumulated 1.32 million BTC, or around 6.6% of the circulating supply, worth around $164 billion. Meanwhile, an explosion in new Ether treasuries has amassed 5.5 million ETH, or around 4.5% of the total supply worth $24.8 billion in just a few months.

IBIT stands out with a low 0.25% expense ratio, strong fund flows, and over $95.0B in assets, making it the largest Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin's break-out and positive regulatory developments, like the GENIUS Act, support continued adoption and upside potential for IBIT investors. IBIT is recommended as a core Bitcoin holding, but investors should be aware of regulatory risks and the ETF's undiversified, directional exposure. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is a solid, highly liquid investment product for investors that want to gain exposure to the world’s largest digital currency, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD )… and benefit from its current upside momentum. Bitcoin just reached a new all-time high above $125,000, and the price of the cryptocurrency has almost doubled in the last year. A few months ago, the GENIUS Act was passed into law, which provided a clear regulatory framework for so-called stablecoins such as Tether USD ( USDT-USD ), which are an important pillar of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With cryptocurrency adoption likely to continue to rise going forward for both retail and institutional investors, I believe Bitcoin has a decent chance of seeing a series of successive highs. As a result, I continue to see the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF as a promising investment vehicle for investors that want directional price exposure to Bitcoin. Data by YCharts Previous Rating I previously rated iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF a strong buy— A Simple Way To Play Bitcoin —due to growing digital asset adoption rising in the U.S. and the world. Since Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million BTC, I believe the world’s largest cryptocurrency offers investors potential for serious upside. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is a highly liquid ETF play focused on Bitcoin and offers investors both the opportunity to participate in Bitcoin’s price growth and provides them with robust liquidity. Bitcoin Reaches New All-time High, Drastic Shift in Investor Sentiment, Positive Fund Flows Bitcoin has spent months in a consolidation zone after Congress passed the GENIUS Act earlier this year, but investor sentiment has shifted nicely in favor of the world's largest digital asset. The GENIUS Act was meant to create a stable pro-crypto regulatory environment and has helped turn the IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) into a major success . With investor sentiment shifting in favor of higher-risk assets lately and the stock market trading up to new record highs, Bitcoin also made a new all-time high at ~$125,700 over the weekend. With this current breakout to the upside, highly liquid, large-scale ETF plays such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are also becoming attractive ways for investors to play this sentiment boost and build a core position in this digital currency asset. Bitcoin still very much dominates the cryptocurrency market and represents approximately 58.5% of the entire industry’s capitalization. Bitcoin therefore offers investors straightforward exposure to the entire cryptoeconomy and will likely continue to dominate the market in the years ahead. CoinMarketCap ETFs like IBIT and others are seeing positive asset inflows as well, showing a willingness of investors to deploy more capital into high-volatility assets like Bitcoin. As inflows increase to the Bitcoin ETF sector, they can be used as a sentiment gauge about how investors think about Bitcoin and its price appreciation potential. The fund flow picture, as represented by aggregated data from ETF Database, shows that investors have turned decidedly pro-Bitcoin this year. According to this website's data, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has seen a massive $24.1B in asset inflows since the beginning of the year, highlighting a profound shift compared to the previous years. ETF Database With money steadily flowing into Bitcoin ETFs this year, it makes sense to use them as a vehicle to gain asset exposure, and here the IBIT especially stands out because of its large size and liquidity. Because of its size, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is one of the most heavily traded Bitcoin ETFs, which has value for investors, especially during times of heightened volatility. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest Bitcoin-oriented ETF product available to investors and currently has net assets of more than $95.0B under management... which is the equivalent of approximately 777,320 Bitcoins. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) is the second-largest ETF in the market but manages a significantly lower amount of Bitcoin assets worth about $25.3B. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is the third-largest Bitcoin dedicated ETF and manages even less investor capital: $21.7B. Data by YCharts One of the reasons why the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is so popular and has grown into such a juggernaut is that the ETF charges investors a very competitive expense ratio in order to invest in Bitcoin: investors pay only 0.25% annual fees, the same as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust charges its customers. The expense ratio for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF is 1.5%. Strong Investment Returns for Investors With a High-Risk Tolerance The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was only incepted in January 2024 but has achieved a strong net asset value record so far: since then, the IBIT has delivered a total return of 72.6% (as of August 31, 2025). The IBIT, as well as other Bitcoin ETFs, has been launched in order to track the price of the world’s largest digital currency, so investors can expect ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, and GBTC to closely track the price of the underlying digital asset. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT’s Valuation As is typical for ETF investment products, the underlying assets are marked-to-market; therefore, net asset value discounts or premiums tend to be very small. The net asset value premium for the IBIT is currently 0.19%, which is slightly higher than the 0.11% premium for FBTC and the 0.09% premium for the GBTC. Data by YCharts The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has had the strongest net asset value performance since its inception, based off of net asset value. However, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust is a close second and has a competitive expense ratio as well. If I had to make a choice about a Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF would be my first one due to its size, liquidity, and low expenses associated with the management of the fund. Data by YCharts Risks With IBIT IBIT is not a diversified investment product and offers investors directional exposure to the price of Bitcoin… which means that if Bitcoin outperforms, investors can expect a strong ETF investment performance as well. However, if the cryptocurrency regulatory environment were to change in the future, or investor sentiment turned sour, Bitcoin may see a serious valuation drawdown. In this case, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF could seriously underperform investor expectations. Closing Thoughts The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is a highly liquid, cost-effective ETF investment choice for investors that want to get directional price exposure to Bitcoin. Bitcoin benefits from an improving pro-crypto regulatory framework, rising retail and institutional adoption, as well as a positive fund flow picture. Bitcoin just broke out above its previous all-time high and now trades around $125,400. In my opinion, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF offers investors a great way to invest in Bitcoin now that sentiment has swung decidedly in favor of owning riskier assets.",IBIT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-06 03:22:13

MARA posted $238.5M in Q2 revenue (up 64% YoY), a $1.2B gain on digital assets, and surpassed 50,000 BTC holdings. The Street projects 93% top-line growth in Q3. Tailwinds for BTC include lower interest rate expectations, with CME projecting two more cuts before year-end, and strong institutional Bitcoin demand as noted by ETP ownership. Returns are tied to BTC. Therefore, a stronger USD or slower-than-expected Fed cuts due to tariff-driven inflation could pressure Bitcoin and make me reassess my rating. I resume my coverage on MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ), upgrading this stock to a strong buy after record Q2 results and a clearer setup for Bitcoin following the decline during the tariff selloff earlier this year. Let me first clarify my strong sell rating from March. Back then, we were in the midst of the tariff selloff, and I didn't see any compelling reasons to own this stock, considering the headwinds at that time that I noted in that article (mainly the fear of tariff-driven inflation, leading to persistently high interest rates). Considering that the stock sold off by 35% from the moment of writing that article to the lows in April, I believe I was correct with my rating. The main reason I didn't revisit this stock after the April 9 tariff pause (when the market realized that the dreaded tariffs presented on April 2 were a mere negotiation tool) was due to my focus on the semiconductor sector. To be direct, I would have reconsidered my strong sell rating on Mara after April 9. That said, I have revisited the stock and the crypto industries, and I was in for a pleasant surprise. I discuss the details of my bull case below. Record Q2 Results The Q2 quarter was one of the best quarters in the company's history. The company reported $238.5 million in revenue, up 64% yoy. To put that figure into perspective, this was the highest quarterly revenue in the history of the company. Seeking Alpha Looking at the bottom line, net income was $808.2 million, compared to a loss of $199.7 million in Q2 2024. This turnaround was driven by a $1.2 billion gain on digital assets as Bitcoin prices increased by approximately 60% in that period. From a production perspective, the company mined an average of 25.9 BTC/day compared to 22.9 BTC/day in the previous quarter. This is equivalent to an increase of 300 BTC on a QoQ basis, which makes sense in my view, considering the recovery in Bitcoin prices after the tariff-driven selloff in Q1. TradingView Furthermore, the number of blocks that the company won increased by 52%, with May being the best month in the company's history. Interestingly enough, that's exactly when the turnaround in BTC prices began (see the chart above). From a Bitcoin holdings perspective, the company surpassed 50,000 BTC post-quarter , remaining the second largest public holder in the world. Mara Furthermore, the market value of their Bitcoin holdings increased by $4.2 billion yoy, or 362%. Moving on now to the balance sheet, the company issued $950 million 0% convertible senior notes due in 2032. Mara 10-Q Q2 2025 By the way, that convertible debt offering was upsized , likely due to strong demand. Additionally, the company has over $5 billion in liquid assets, which I believe will be used to purchase more BTC. Why? Take a look at the BTC/USD chart below. TradingView I see price consolidation between the $100k and $125k range. This pattern is ultra bullish, especially when one takes into account the tailwinds in the crypto space. The main one is the consensus towards lower interest rates, as noted in the chart below by the CME Group. CME Group Traditionally, lower interest rates were a tailwind for Bitcoin as more liquidity hit the market and some of it spilled over to risky assets. This is especially the case now, considering the institutional ownership of Bitcoin through U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETPs like IBIT holding 747k BTC and FBTC holding about 200k BTC. Valuation Moving on to valuation , I see an attractive forward P/CF multiple, sitting at 14.8 at the time of writing this article. In comparison, Riot is trading at 16.6x next year's operating cash flow. Furthermore, the P/E multiple is quite attractive, particularly on a TTM basis, with the stock trading at 10.8x last year's earnings (65% below the sector median). Again, if we were to compare this multiple with Riot's, Mara wins again, as Riot is not profitable (yet), so there are no earnings in the denominator of P/E. Furthermore, if we look beyond valuation and consider the Street's estimates for the top line of the company, one can find a (very) pleasant surprise. Seeking Alpha As seen above, the Street is projecting a spectacular Q3, with a 93% YoY increase in revenue at the midpoint. Overall, I see a nicely valued company with decent growth prospects ahead. That said, there are some risks to consider. Risks In the last earnings call, CEO Fred Thiel noted the following regarding the price of Bitcoin: Regarding the current price of bitcoin, our view is that things feel a little frothy at the moment. I believe he may be referring to the consolidation phase between $100k and $125k that I mentioned earlier. He further added: Supply is currently being absorbed relatively well. But if the buying demand were to subside, we could see downward pressure as sellers attempt to lock in gains at these high price points Considering that the company was holding approximately 50,000 BTC at the time of the Q2 conference call, the returns of the stock are correlated to the price of BTC. So far, I see tailwinds for a deterioration in the price of the dollar, as noted by the deterioration of the DXY since the start of the year. TradingView However, if there is a turnaround in the US dollar, accompanied by a slowdown in interest rate cuts by the Fed, I may have to reconsider my strong buy rating on this stock. Conclusion To wrap up, when considering all the factors above, I believe Mara deserves a strong buy rating. We're talking about the second-largest holder of BTC in the world, with strong tailwinds that could lead to a breakout in Bitcoin's price beyond the $125k resistance. Specifically, I am bullish on further interest rate cuts, as I believe unemployment in the US will only tick up from here due to the broader adoption of AI among enterprises (a topic I vividly discussed in my macro articles ). On a company-wide basis, I see solid double-digit growth in the topline, and unlike competitors like Riot, Mara has a positive EPS. The Street is projecting 93% YoY growth in Q3, with double-digit growth moving into 2026. On a valuation basis, the company looks quite attractive. Overall, I believe Mara is a strong buy at this price level.",MARA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-06 03:54:34

The price is now consolidating gains and facing hurdles near the $3.050 level. XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $2.920 support zone. The price is now trading below $3.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $3.050 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $3.050. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price started a recovery wave after it found support above $2.80 and $2.820, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.920 and $2.950 resistance levels. The price even climbed above $3.00 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.098 and the price corrected some gains to test $2.950.

The first major resistance is near the $3.050 level. There is also a key declining channel forming with resistance at $3.050 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A clear move above the $3.050 resistance might send the price toward the $3.080 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.150. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.950 level. The next major support is near the $2.920 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.920 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.850.

Such is the case of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already surpassed $15.5 million in presale funding . The Ethereum-based altcoin has become one of the hottest projects entering the year 2025. Analysts refer to it as the best presale in 2025, with good traction and increased market momentum in Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) . Having regular stage sellouts and confirmed audits, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly becoming a valid player in the next altcoin cycle. Solana Named the New Wall Street Solana has gained global interest following a commentary by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who referred to Solana as the “new Wall Street”. He highlighted Solana as having the fastest speed, throughput, and instant finality, making it one of the most appealing blockchains for financial implementation. Hougan observed that tokenization and stablecoins are being acknowledged by global institutions as disruptive. Solana can process transactions in under 150 microseconds, making it competitive in terms of institutional adoption. This trend is in line with growing capital inflow into tokenized assets, and the infrastructure of Solana facilitates a large inflow of activity with minimal latency. To investors, this is an indication that the real world of finance is coming in line with blockchain technology. Recent trading information also indicates that SOL is in a steady period of consolidation, where it is supported above the $225 level. Analysts assume that a long-term breakout above resistance will take Solana to a new ATH. SOLUSD 7-Day Chart | Source: CMC AVAX Tokenomics, Utility, and Upside Potential Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) remains another powerhouse in 2025, supported by solid tokenomics. Notably, Avalanche blockchain currently supports over $18.3 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), proving its utility. Source: AVAX real-world assets (RWAs) Interestingly, in a move that highlights institutional trust, Bergen County in New Jersey committed to migrating deed recordings of $240 billion of all its real estate onto Avalanche blockchain. Also, Avalanche ecosystem burns AVAX with each transaction, in an attempt to establish a deflationary supply mechanism. This architecture enhances security and decentralization without compromising unmatched performance in transaction throughput. As supply is approximately 422 million AVAX , it is estimated by analysts that virtual currencies have long-term upward potential due to the scarcity of supply and practical demand. Thus, Avalanche remains pegged as one of the most promising Layer-1 networks – a position that similarly reflects the initial path that Ethereum took. Under the greater crypto market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is ascending together with these top networks. Its presale success and structured roadmap place it in the same conversation with high-potential ecosystems like AVAX and SOL. Analysts Call MAGACOIN FINANCE the Best Presale MAGACOIN FINANCE has been applauded by analysts due to its excellent fundamentals and transparent organization. The project has already collected more than $15.5 million, exceeding most 2025 presales, which have not surpassed the $5-million mark. Its smart contracts are Ethereum-based , which means that they are c ompatible with ERC-20 and can get deep liquidity pools across decentralized exchanges. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been audited by HashEx , and a CertiK audit is already being pursued, which leads to investors confidence. This authentication sets it apart as compared to non-verified projects and eliminates most investor worry regarding safety and legitimacy. The consistent increase in the presale through the stages indicates that investors are involved as opposed to speculative hype. More so, audit disclosure, scalable technology, and community engagemen t bring the best performance. With talk of exchange listing going around, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a top contender for Q4 growth. Final Thoughts: The surpassing of the $15.5 million presale point highlights increased presence of MAGACOIN FINANCE in altcoin market. Having verified audits, a good community presence, and an Ethereum-based background, the project is rated as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Solana and Avalanche keep on solidifying the market narrative of high-utility blockchains. Nevertheless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining the attention of investors pursuing early-stage opportunities.

According to Morgan Stanley’s October Global Investment Committee report, which guides more than 16,000 advisors who manage approximately $2 trillion in client wealth, the bank advises keeping only a small amount of crypto in diversified portfolios. The report indicates that Morgan Stanley is taking a deliberate yet crucial step toward incorporating digital assets into traditional wealth management. Morgan Stanley says that crypto prices can change rapidly The new report by Morgan Stanley informs investors that digital assets, such as Bitcoin, can offer substantial profits but are also risky, even for experienced investors, due to their fluctuating prices and volatility. The analysts stated that individuals who can tolerate higher risk and seek higher returns through “Opportunistic Growth” portfolios can allocate up to 4% of their funds to crypto. However, investors with “Balanced Growth” portfolios that grow steadily should not invest more than 2% of their money. At the same time, those who wish to protect their wealth or focus on income should disregard crypto entirely. Analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote that cryptocurrencies have a “double nature,” offering very high returns under favorable market conditions, but losing value quickly when confidence wanes, the economy slows, or regulators intervene. The report also advised investors interested in crypto to monitor and adjust their holdings periodically, ideally every few months or at least once annually (regular rebalancing)—people who neglect to rebalance risk exposing themselves to risks and losses when the market shifts. According to the bank, cryptocurrencies can have a place in modern investment plans, but only as a small, carefully controlled part that helps investors gain exposure to new technology and global innovation. Advisors urge investors to diversify and use crypto in small amounts Hunter Horsley, CEO of the crypto investment firm Bitwise , stated that people’s views on cryptocurrencies shift when a large and respected bank like Morgan Stanley offers structured guidance on how to incorporate them into client portfolios. Morgan Stanley’s analysts also compared Bitcoin to “digital gold,” because it has a limited supply and cannot be printed or changed easily. They said that more investors are turning to Bitcoin to protect their purchasing power as inflation rises and the global economy faces more uncertainty. These analysts added that Bitcoin’s price has reached a new all-time high of over $125,000. Data from blockchain research firm Glassnode also shows that the number of Bitcoins held on exchanges is now at its lowest level in six years. These statistics suggest that an increasing number of investors are holding their coins in personal wallets for the long term, rather than selling them. The report also mentioned that other companies are also expanding their crypto assets, with companies like E*Trade adding support for Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana on their trading platforms. Clients will be able to buy and sell some of the most popular cryptocurrencies directly through a platform they already trust. In the final part of the report, Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote that cryptocurrencies can give portfolios a small diversification benefit when investors handle them carefully. However, they still warned that the benefit only comes when the same investors use crypto in moderation because too much exposure can do more harm than good when the market crashes. They said investors need clear rules on how much to invest, when to rebalance, and how to protect themselves during downturns. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Deputy Finance Minister Nguyen Duc Chi shared the update at a Sunday press briefing when asked about the number of applications submitted and the expected timeline for the first licenses, local news outlet Theinvestor reported Monday. The ministry has not yet received any formal applications, though Chi noted that several companies are already making preparations, including registering new business lines to enter the digital asset market. He added that while interest is growing, the government has capped the number of participants at a maximum of five during the pilot phase. “The Ministry of Finance is expediting the process so that the first eligible enterprises can be licensed and begin operations in the Vietnamese market as soon as possible,” he added. Vietnam Targets Pilot Launch Before 2026 Pending Enterprise Readiness The deputy minister said the government hopes to launch the pilot before 2026, but the pace will depend on how quickly companies meet the requirements. With close coordination between businesses and regulatory bodies, he suggested the timeline could be brought forward. The government issued Resolution No. 05 in September to launch a five-year pilot of the digital asset market. Following the resolution, the finance ministry began drafting detailed regulations covering taxation, fees, and accounting standards for market participants. It also set up coordination channels with the State Bank of Vietnam and the Ministry of Public Security to finalize licensing procedures. The move came after the National Assembly legalized digital assets earlier this year under the Law on Digital Technology Industry, which takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026. The legislation marked a turning point after years of regulatory uncertainty that had left Vietnam dependent on offshore exchanges. Vietnam has officially legalized crypto assets, introducing its first legal framework to regulate digital currencies and virtual assets. Here's what the new law covers. #Vietnam #CryptoLaw https://t.co/p3SC5jp9UL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 Pilot Seeks To Shift Vietnam’s $100B Crypto Trade Onshore The pilot aims to move the country’s massive informal crypto activity into formal, taxable onshore channels. Estimates suggest that as many as 17m Vietnamese already trade digital assets, with annual transaction volumes exceeding $100b, nearly all of it routed through overseas platforms such as Binance and Bybit. Major firms in finance, securities and banking have signaled interest in joining the pilot, although none have formally submitted applications. Industry watchers say the coming months will be crucial as potential participants finalize their preparations. Formal Recognition Seen As Key To Boosting Investor Confidence Vietnam’s legalization of crypto follows mounting international scrutiny. Since 2023, the country has been on the Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” due to gaps in its anti-money laundering safeguards around virtual assets. Regulators accelerated efforts to address these concerns, leading to the passage of the digital technology law and the pilot framework. Analysts say the legal recognition of digital assets places Vietnam among the first Southeast Asian economies to formalize the sector. If implemented smoothly, the pilot could boost investor confidence and integrate digital assets more firmly into the domestic financial system. For now, the ministry is waiting on enterprises to step forward.

Meanwhile, Sanae Takaichi’s win in Japan’s ruling party race positions her as the next prime minister, boosting growth expectations and lifting local and Asian markets. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallied to nearly $126,000 in early October, setting a new all-time high, as global economic uncertainty and the ongoing US government shutdown fueled safe-haven demand for the leading crypto asset. Gold prices rose past $3,900 per ounce to a record high on Monday, driven by investors seeking the safe-haven asset amid growing worries over a prolonged US government shutdown. Consumer prices in Thailand fell 0.72% Y/Y in September 2025, a sharper decline than market expectations of a 0.60% drop and following a 0.79% decrease in August. Vietnam’s GDP expanded 8.23% Y/Y in Q3 2025, quickening from an upwardly revised 8.19% rise in the previous period and marking the fastest pace since Q3 2022. Vietnam’s trade surplus increased to USD 2.85 billion in September 2025, up from USD 2.29 billion in September 2024. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 4.51% to around 47,600 on Monday, hitting fresh record highs after a ruling party vote paved the way for fiscal dove and pro-stimulus lawmaker Sanae Takaichi to become Japan’s next prime minister. The Japanese yen depreciated nearly 2% toward 150 per dollar on Monday, touching a two-month low. Among five contenders in the Liberal Democratic Party race to replace hawkish Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Takaichi was seen as the most expansionary, closely aligned with the late Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” policies. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.71% to 26,976 in Monday morning deals, marking the second session of losses as most sectors, led by tech and consumer stocks, retreated.

The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.66 on Monday, extending gains from the previous week, as investors digested the latest inflation report. Investors digested the latest Monthly Inflation Gauge from the Melbourne Institute, which showed a 0.4% month-over-month increase in September 2025, rebounding from a 0.3% fall in the prior month. Investors are now turning their attention to speeches from RBA officials this week, which are expected to provide further insight into the central bank’s policy outlook. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes ended mostly flat, the Dow Jones extended its record run, rising 240 points finishing at 46,758 after briefly surpassing 47,000 during the session, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.3% as the US government shutdown entered its third day. US gasoline futures rose more than 1% to $1.88 per gallon on Monday after OPEC+ agreed to a smaller-than-expected production increase. Traders now await fresh signals from central bank officials this week, including remarks from Fed Governor Stephen Miran on Wednesday and Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday.

Institutional prints confirmed $3.07 as resistance, while repeated defenses near $2.98 kept losses contained. News Background XRP slipped 1% from Oct. 5, 03:00 to Oct. 6, 02:00, retreating from $3.01 to $2.98 despite opening strength. The token spiked to $3.07 in early hours, only to face concentrated selling pressure. Analysts said institutional desks were active at resistance, with turnover 17% above daily averages. Despite bearish control through much of the session, XRP ended with a rebound off $2.98, signaling continued accumulation interest. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.09 corridor, or 3% intraday range, between $2.98 and $3.07. Price peaked at $3.07 before sharp rejection on 64.3M tokens, vs. 54.7M average. Selling pressure dragged XRP to $2.98, where support was repeatedly defended. A late-session dip triggered a 1.95M-volume flush to $2.979, immediately absorbed by buyers. Rebound flows stabilized price near $2.98, with recovery volumes averaging 750K per bar. Technical Analysis Resistance is firmly established at $3.07, validated by above-average selling pressure and repeated failures to break higher. Support holds at $2.98, where buyers consistently stepped in, including a high-volume flush absorbed late in the session. Price action reflects a rejection-driven pullback inside a $3.07–$2.98 band. While sellers dominated two-thirds of the session, the defense of $2.98 shows institutions continue to accumulate on dips, keeping the structure intact for another attempt higher. What Traders Are Watching? Whether $2.98 holds as support in coming sessions. If $3.07 remains a hard ceiling or weakens under renewed pressure.

SOL price is now consolidating gains above $220 and might soon aim for more gains above $232. SOL price started a fresh increase above $215 and $220 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $225 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $227 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Solana is now trading above $225 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $227 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair.

The next major resistance is near the $238 level. The main resistance could be $242. A successful close above the $242 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $250. Any more gains might send the price toward the $255 level. Another Drop In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $237 resistance, it could continue to move down.

Whales and mid-tier wallets boosted holdings, signaling accumulation as technical patterns compress into an ascending triangle. Traders are now watching if $0.25 can harden into a launch base toward $0.27–$0.30. News Background DOGE traded a 5.3% range in the 24 hours to Oct. 6, 03:00, moving between $0.265 and $0.251. The token opened at $0.258, rallied briefly to $0.264, then faded into afternoon selling pressure.

On-chain data showed mid-tier wallets added 30M DOGE, lifting their combined holdings to 10.77B tokens, while top 1% addresses now control over 96% of supply. Price Action Summary DOGE swung through a $0.014 corridor, peaking at $0.265 and bottoming at $0.251. Afternoon selloff dragged price lower, but $0.251–$0.252 support held on sustained buying.

The post included a chart indicating steady upward momentum, reinforcing the same expectations highlighted in earlier forecasts. CryptoBull had previously made a strong claim about XRP’s price path. In the post, the analyst said XRP would reach $4.75 on or before October 21 . He promised to give 100 XRP to one random community member if the asset fails this target. The update emphasized that the projection remains intact, with just over two weeks until the deadline. The new message repeated the specific price and date set in prior forecasts, suggesting confidence that XRP has not deviated from the expected trajectory. So far so good. #XRP is still on track to $4.75 by October 21. https://t.co/v3A2BPXv45 pic.twitter.com/FCmVmRIMJz — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 4, 2025 Can XRP Reach $4.75? The timing of these forecasts coincides with a shift in U.S. monetary policy that has created a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. In September, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points , lowering the federal funds target range to 4% and 4.25%. Similar rate cuts in September 2024 contributed to XRP’s massive explosion later in the year. This decision marked the first rate cut since December 2024 and signals the start of a new cycle aimed at stimulating growth. ETF Progress as a Catalyst Another factor bolstering sentiment is the progress on crypto exchange-traded funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted new listing standards for crypto ETFs, and several filings for spot XRP funds are approaching decision deadlines this month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If approved, these ETFs could attract massive institutional flows, providing a structural boost to demand. Even in the absence of full approval, the market has shown excitement, and these deadlines could bring significant growth for XRP. Outlook for October 21 With just over two weeks remaining until the stated deadline, the combination of monetary easing and potential ETF approvals gives context to why the forecast has remained unchanged. Rate cuts provide the liquidity conditions that benefit speculative assets, and ETF progress offers a pathway for greater institutional involvement. CryptoBull has consistently predicted XRP to hit $4.75 by October 21. Whether the target is met will depend on market momentum in the days ahead, but the surrounding environment has shifted in ways that lend additional support to the outlook.

The move was praised by Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley as “huge,” and comes as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $125,000. Morgan Stanley Embraces Crypto Exposure Morgan Stanley took a major step toward legitimizing cryptocurrency as an investable asset class after issuing formal guidelines for crypto allocations in multi-asset portfolios. In its October Global Investment Committee (GIC) report, the financial services giant advised a “conservative” approach but nonetheless included crypto exposure in select portfolio types, which is a huge shift in institutional sentiment. According to the report, Morgan Stanley analysts recommended up to a 4% crypto allocation for “Opportunistic Growth” portfolios, which are designed for investors looking for higher returns and willing to accept more risk. For “Balanced Growth” portfolios, the report suggested a smaller 2% allocation for those with a more moderate risk appetite. (Source: X ) However, for portfolios centered on wealth preservation and income generation, the firm advised a 0% allocation, due to the potential for elevated volatility during periods of market or macroeconomic stress. The GIC report acknowledged that, while cryptocurrencies delivered outsized returns over the past few years and seen a trend toward declining volatility, they still pose unique risks compared to traditional assets. Nonetheless, the fact that Morgan Stanley’s guidance now actually includes digital assets at all is a turning point for mainstream adoption. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley called the move “huge,” especially as the GIC’s recommendations reach around 16,000 advisors managing $2 trillion in client wealth. “We’re entering the mainstream era,” Horsley wrote, thanks to the growing role of crypto in professional portfolio management. The timing of Morgan Stanley’s report coincides with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of over $125,000. The bank’s analysts referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” due to its perceived scarcity and growing role in institutional treasuries and exchange-traded funds. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Data from Glassnode shows Bitcoin exchange balances fell to a six-year low, which suggests strong accumulation by investors. Analysts at The Kobeissi Letter added that a broader shift toward assets like Bitcoin and gold is underway as inflation rebounds and economic uncertainty deepens.

The report, titled “Asset Allocation Considerations for Cryptocurrencies,” comprehensively assesses the role of the rapidly growing digital asset market in investment strategies. The report notes that cryptocurrencies have attracted increasing investor interest in recent years due to their remarkable returns, high volatility, and $4 trillion market capitalization. It also notes that with growing support from the Trump administration and Congress, investors are now able to access cryptocurrencies through exchange-traded products (ETPs). The team that prepared the report included Lisa Shalett (Chief Investment Officer), Steve Edwards, Denny Galindo, Spencer J. Cavallo, and Jason Traum. GIC defines cryptocurrencies as “a speculative but increasingly popular asset class,” centering its analysis on Bitcoin. It emphasizes that Bitcoin is a “rare asset, akin to digital gold” and an investment vehicle. Related News: What's the Status of the Altcoin Season After the Recent Rallies? Has the Bull Market Arrived? Here's the Latest State of the Index Morgan Stanley states that while it does not include direct crypto investments in its formal allocation models, its advisors and clients can flexibly include crypto in their multi-asset portfolios: “We aim to support our financial advisors and clients who can flexibly invest in cryptocurrencies as part of their multi-asset portfolios.” GIC mentors 16,000 financial advisors worldwide who manage over $2 trillion in client assets. In its conclusion, GIC recommends investors adopt a cautious and conservative approach to cryptocurrencies. While crypto assets have historically yielded high returns, GIC maintains that they still face the risk of increased correlation during periods of high volatility and stress. Therefore, investors are advised to keep their crypto exposure limited and rebalance their portfolios regularly. *This is not investment advice.

At least $6 billion has passed through it since August after the U.S. sanctioned some of its players. This is tied to A7A5, a stablecoin sitting at the center of Russia’s cross-border payments network. The token belongs to A7, a parallel system created after Moscow’s banks were cut off from the U.S.-led financial order following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. According to a Financial Times analysis, more than 80 percent of A7A5’s supply was destroyed and instantly recreated to wipe links to a sanctioned exchange called Grinex, showing how the network reshaped itself after the U.S. move. Washington blacklisted Grinex in August, calling it an alleged successor to Garantex, a crypto exchange the U.S. shut down in March for “hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking.” Grinex has denied that connection. Yet the day after sanctions hit, administrators of A7A5 emptied two wallets tied to Grinex that held 33.8 billion tokens worth $405 million, using an instruction called “destroyBlackFunds” to label the assets as “dirtyShares”. New tokens for the same amount were then created in a fresh wallet, breaking the trace between old and new funds. Move billions with new wallets and destroy old funds The new wallet, named TNpJj, has since handled $6.1 billion in transactions.This tactic is not a simple transfer but a full reset of the coins, making it harder to link blacklisted tokens to clean ones. On March 10, 4.5 billion A7A5 tokens moved between four wallets in ten minutes in an effort to route funds back to Grinex after U.S. action against Garantex.On May 6, one of these wallets funded a new address, TChBA. On August 14, the U.S. sanctioned two wallets, one tied to Garantex and the other to Grinex. By August 15, funds in TChBA were destroyed and re-minted in TNpJj. On September 2, the same pattern repeated as TAhi7’s funds shifted into TNpJj, which by then had moved about $6 billion in A7A5 tokens. The activity on TNpJj mirrors older wallets. It shared 11 counterparties and executes transfers during Moscow working hours, peaking between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. local time with little movement overnight or on weekends. A7A5’s chatbot operates “weekdays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Moscow time,” and clients can buy the token in cash at the “over-the-counter section of Grinex” inside a Moscow skyscraper. Garantex previously used the same address — Federation Tower, 14th floor. Russia formalizes A7A5 and builds global alternative payment system A7A5 runs on Tron and Ethereum blockchains. Its operators appear to have learned from Garantex’s takedown, when Tether froze $28 million tied to Garantex wallets. The coin is registered in Kyrgyzstan, which Moscow calls a “friendly” jurisdiction.Its issuer, Old Vector, was also blacklisted by the U.S. in August.Last week Russia granted A7A5 formal digital financial asset status. Exporters and importers can now use it officially through a platform owned by Promsvyazbank, which backs each token with a rouble. Promsvyazbank, a state-owned defense lender already under sanctions, holds a 49 percent stake in the A7 network, which is expanding to Africa. The bank’s chief executive Petr Fradkov told President Vladimir Putin, “we are creating a system of cross-border settlements based on A7.” The network has also received large loans from VEB, a Russian state development bank. A7’s majority owner and chief executive Ilan Șor, a fugitive Moldovan oligarch living in Moscow, claims the network has moved more than $86 billion in 10 months. Two financial professionals told the Financial Times the A7 network may already represent a significant part of Russia’s cross-border payments market. Besides crypto, A7 also handles payments via promissory notes. The Centre for Information Resilience, a London-based research group, said “A7 is expanding at rapid pace funded in large part by loans from Russian state institutions” and predicted Russia’s war economy will raise the network’s “political significance” in enabling exports. In June, an A7A5 representative told the FT they had only “co-operated with the technical team of A7 at the early stage” and then “decided to separate completely” in May. Șor told Kommersant last month, “we’ve created a transparent and honest business: we pay taxes and operate openly,” and said other countries are showing interest in this “alternative payment system that is beneficial for the Russian state.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The surge reflected renewed investor demand as Bitcoin prices climbed to fresh record highs. Data from SoSoValue showed that only the week ending Nov. 22, 2024, saw higher inflows at $3.38b. The latest rebound reversed the previous week’s $902m in outflows and pushed four-week inflows close to $4b. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, known as IBIT, dominated the flows, capturing $1.8b of last week’s net inflows. IBIT now manages $96.2b in assets, cementing its lead over rivals. Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest fund by net asset value, took in $692m, or about 38% of IBIT’s total. Rapid Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Accelerate Rally As Bitcoin Climbs Past $125,000 Trading activity also tilted heavily toward IBIT, which saw several billion dollars worth of shares exchanged daily. By comparison, FBTC’s volume peaked at $715m. Analysts noted that BlackRock’s fund has become the preferred vehicle for institutional participation. The inflows came as Bitcoin surged past $125,000 on Sunday, breaking its previous record near $124,000 set in August. The rally points to October’s reputation as a strong month for Bitcoin, with the token already up more than 10% so far this month. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $125,700 on Sunday morning, breaking past its previous record of $124,500 set in August. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/ujDxDEvPFm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 5, 2025 Friday alone contributed $985m in net inflows, the second-highest single-day total since the $987m recorded on Jan. 6. The rapid rebound added momentum to Bitcoin’s price rally, which is increasingly being tied to the “Uptober” trend that traders anticipate each year. US Shutdown Drives Investors Toward Safe Havens Like Bitcoin, Gold Analysts said the US government shutdown may also be steering capital into perceived safe havens such as Bitcoin and gold. Gold hit fresh all-time highs during the week, while Bitcoin benefited from similar flows, reflecting investor caution in the face of political uncertainty. Adding to the bullish backdrop, the total Bitcoin balance on centralized exchanges has dropped to a six-year low of 2.83m coins. The shrinking supply has intensified buy-side pressure, amplifying the impact of ETF inflows. Market watchers see the $117,300 level as a strong support for Bitcoin, with upside potential toward $140,000 if momentum continues. The combination of record ETF demand and tightening supply has raised expectations for further gains. The latest performance shows how quickly sentiment around Bitcoin ETFs can swing. Just a week earlier, the sector was absorbing heavy outflows, yet the turnaround has reinforced confidence that institutional adoption remains on track. For investors, the growing dominance of IBIT and the accelerating pace of inflows reflect how spot Bitcoin ETFs are shaping the market.

She shared the cover of Ripple’s application, expressing excitement that it had become open for public review and declaring that Ripple is moving closer to officially becoming a bank. In July, Ripple revealed plans to establish Ripple National Trust Bank , a federally chartered institution under the oversight of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). While many in the XRP community rightly pointed out that the filing dates back several months, it has now entered the public review phase, an important regulatory milestone toward integrating the XRP ecosystem into mainstream finance. WOW! Ripple’s application for a banking license from the OCC is now open for public review! RIPPLE IS BECOMING A BANK! #XRP pic.twitter.com/qMbaLb67O9 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 5, 2025 What the OCC Charter Would Allow Ripple’s application seeks a national trust bank charter, a regulatory status that enables limited-purpose institutions to operate under federal supervision. If approved, the charter would help Ripple to provide custodial and payment-related services without functioning as a full retail bank. The proposed entity is not designed to handle consumer deposits or issue loans. Rather, it would manage assets, oversee trust operations, and support the expansion of Ripple’s XRP-powered financial ecosystem, including its stablecoin RLUSD. The charter application represents Ripple’s latest move to align its operations with evolving financial regulations in the U.S. By seeking direct oversight from the OCC , Ripple aims to position itself alongside other digital asset firms pursuing similar authorizations. When Will Ripple’s Charter be Approved? The timing of this review phase has renewed public focus on Ripple’s broader regulatory objectives, particularly its push for legitimacy within the traditional banking framework. One community member weighed in on a potential timeline. He noted that the OCC’s standard review process typically takes about 120 days after the comment period, placing a potential decision in late October or early November 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, complexities such as coordination with the Federal Reserve or crypto-related scrutiny could extend it to 180 days or more. He also mentioned that Coinbase’s new trust charter application could further slow reviews if the OCC processes them together. A Step Toward Institutional Integration Although the OCC has not yet issued a decision, public access to the charter application marks a decisive moment in Ripple’s transition toward regulated financial operations. The company’s effort to connect its blockchain-based payment systems with the conventional banking sector reflects a calculated strategy to expand the influence of XRP , RLUSD, and its institutional footprint in global finance.

Recently, there has been a lot of debate about whether Ripple will use the XRP Ledger to replace SWIFT , which processes trillions of dollars worth of transactions every year. However, it seems that Ripple is still far from this dream as its CEO has highlighted some key details that remain to be put in place before institutions can be properly onboarded. The Preparation Of The XRP Ledger In an X (formerly Twitter) post , an XRP Validator who goes by Vet_X0 revealed the contents of the conversation they had with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. According to Vet, they had asked Garlinghouse what the path to institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger was, and the CEO had simply replied that it was privacy . Basically, for institutional investors who carry out large transactions to be able to use a public ledger, they would want to be assured of the privacy of their transactions. This would allow them to transact with ease of mind without being worried that they were being tracked every step of the way. Given this, the pundit explained that all of the moves that Ripple had been making regarding the XRP Ledger finally make sense. The first of these was the fact that there have been many developments surrounding compliance on the ledger. This ranges from to implementation of a Decentralized Identifier (DID) and also Credentials, as well as the expected launch of Permissioned Decentralized Exchanges and Domains. Another giveaway is the fact that Ripple launched Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) on the XRP Ledger. This was another step in its domination of the tokenized assets space, allowing for easy and seamless tokenization of assets on the XRP Ledger. The Last Step To Institutional Adoption With the changes listed above already in place, only privacy, as well as lending and borrowing, remain to be implemented. Vet explains, though, that these are already on the way, especially with the XLS-66 expected to land soon. Vet explains that if Ripple is able to implement privacy for the XRP Ledger using ZK-Rollups, it helps to verify the transactions of institutions on-chain while allowing the computation to happen elsewhere. They would also be able to be issued secure credentials on-chain to help with KYC/AML stipulations, while being able to use DEXes, as well as use real-world collateral on-chain to borrow from other institutions. Finally, the validator also points out that XLS-101 smart contracts on the XRP Ledger could be the key to this. “For the security of the network and as a glue for all fixed functions tools we have,” he said.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-06 06:00:33

Some of the most promising ones include XRP , Kaspa (KAS) and Polkadot (DOT) , all of which are displaying accumulation and possible breakouts. These assets have built strong technical structures despite recent volatility, drawing analyst attention as likely outperformers in 2025. Beside them, another competitor, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is also being rated as one of the best altcoins to purchase at the moment after a great presale and increasing investor interest. XRP Price Eyes $10 in the Next Leg Up XRP price is still one of the most watched altcoins as analysts refer to the long-term resistance referenced as the “Chasm.” The token is trading around $3, and it seems to be stable following weeks of consistent accumulation and rising whale activity. Analysts are optimistic that a breakout above $10.30 may be a turning point for XRP, which is in line with measured targets between $11 to $37. XRPUSD 3-Week Chart | Source: X Technical charts indicate that XRP makes higher lows since the middle of the year, which is a sign of strength amidst the overall market consolidation. The capacity of the token to hold structure above $2.80 strengthens the bullishness. With volume stabilizing and capital rotation accelerating out of Bitcoin, XRP will perform well. Additionally, as crypto laws become clearer and liquidity more favorable, XRP rally to the $10 barrier will make it one of the top Layer-1 assets of 2025. Kaspa and DOT to Rally in 2025 Kaspa (KAS) is trading around $0.076 and is consolidating above a solid support of $0.074-$0.075. This area firmly held over multiple periods, indicating intense defensive interest. However, trading volume fell 30% in the last 24 hours, though the larger framework has not yet broken down. Should purchasing power recover, KAS may retest $0.078-$0.082 , and may break out to reach $0.085 , with a market capitalization of $2.04 billion and consistent on-chain growth. In the meantime, Polkadot (DOT) is drawing analyst interest as the price gains momentum toward the major resistance of $5. Market strategist observed that DOT started to turn after weeks of moving sideways and is now trading at about $4.20 . Polkadot (DOT) 1-Week Chart | Source: X A close above $5 would confirm a breakout from multi-month stagnation, potentially fueling a rally in Q4. The ecosystem’s ongoing development and scalability upgrades further strengthen fundamentals, supporting renewed investor confidence. Both Kaspa and DOT remain part of analyst watchlists as hidden gems for 2025. However, among emerging altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining attention as the best altcoin to buy now , owing to its explosive presale performance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Among Altcoins MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is based on Ethereum, raised more than $15.5 million during the presale , making it one of the most profitable early-stage coins in 2025. The project can be distinguished by strong fundamentals, such as a HashEx audit , Certik verification in progress , and transparent presale structure . Analysts and whale trackers have observed pre-emptive accumulation as MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that has been preferred by “smart money .” Its fast community growth in Telegram and X and solid stage sellouts signify actual investor interest instead of short lived buzz. As exchange listing and staking rewards will soon be available, there is a match between retail excitement and institutional interest in the hidden gem. Conclusion XRP, Kaspa, and Polkadot are poised to emerge as hidden gem altcoins that have a high potential to appreciate prior to the 2025 bull cycle. Their technical strength, expanding ecosystems, and analyst support put them in a position to realize huge profits when the market idea changes. Nonetheless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging to be the most successful with growing Ethereum-based structure. With presale momentum persisting, analysts consider it one of the top altcoins to purchase today .

It involved the use of three arrows: aggressive monetary easing, high public spending and cheap borrowing and structural reforms to boost investment and growth potential. Speaking at a press conference Saturday, Sanae made it clear that the government would lead fiscal and monetary policy setting, echoing the growing fiscal dominance worldwide aimed at prioritizing demand reflation. She said that the government and the central bank must work closely to achieve ""demand-driven inflation backed by rising wages and corporate profits."" The PM added that the Japanese economy is on a ""tightrope,"" and it is appropriate to maintain accomodative monetary conditions. Her comments have sparked hopes for fiscal easing, supported by low interest rates. According to Reuters, the probability of the BOJ raising rates this month has dropped sharply, and the bank is likely to be more cautious. The timing couldn't be more opportune for bitcoin bulls and gold investors. With traders pricing continued Fed easing over the coming months, the prospect of renewed Japanese easing is likely to bolster demand for cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Bitcoin hits record high, yen slides The bitcoin-yen pair (BTC/JPY) listed on BitFlyer has reached a record high of JPY 18,640,000, extending its five-day winning streak, according to data source TradingView. Meanwhile, the Coinbase-listed BTC/USD pair traded at $123,100, significantly below the record high of over $125,000 reached over the weekend, according to CoinDesk data. Sanae's comments also buoyed the Japanese equities, with the Nikkei index topping 48,000 points for the first time. The yen slid to a low of 150.35 per U.S. dollar, its weakest since Aug. 1. Traders have been wary of a yen rally driven by the Bank of Japan’s potential rate hikes for at least the past two years. However, some observers argue that the Japanese yen is no longer the premier safe-haven currency it once was and has increasingly been supplanted by the Swiss franc.",Markets|Bitcoin|Japan|Markets|yen|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ASIA|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-06 06:01:43
