It predicts Bitcoin will reach as high as $180K, and other major digital assets will reach record highs by the end of 2025. The firm projected in a December 13 blog post that the cryptocurrency bull market will experience a “medium-term peak” in the first quarter of 2025 before a period of consolidation and eventual recovery leads to new all-time highs. VanEck Predicts Bitcoin at $180K and Ethereum Above $6K in the Next Market Cycle According to a blog post published on December 13 by Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, at the anticipated market peak, VanEck expects Bitcoin (BTC) to reach approximately $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $6,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could see valuations exceeding $500 and $10, respectively. However, the firm forecasts a summer correction, with Bitcoin facing a 30% retracement and altcoins potentially declining by up to 60%. Despite these setbacks, VanEck expects a recovery by the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and achieving new highs before the end of the year. NEW: Spot #Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck is predicting in 2025: – $180,000 bitcoin price – Banks will be allowed to custody bitcoin – US will adopt Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Bitcoin ETFs will support in-kind creations & redemptions THIS WOULD BE MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/l6JyjFaaRc — Nikolaus Hoffman (@NikolausHoff) December 13, 2024 The firm has identified several key indicators to monitor for signs of speculative market peaks. For example, high funding rates on Bitcoin perpetual futures above 10% for three months could indicate speculative excess. Similarly, many Bitcoin holders with unrealized profits exceeding a 70% profit-to-cost ratio suggest market euphoria. An overvalued market cap relative to realized value, measured by MVRV scores above 5, often signals overheated conditions. Additionally, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance below 40% could indicate late-cycle speculative shifts into riskier altcoins. Increased speculation from non-crypto-savvy individuals is also a warning sign of mania near a market top. The blog post also reflects on previous predictions made by Sigel, including a projection that Bitcoin could climb to $2.9 million per coin by 2050 and Ethereum reach $22,000 per token by 2030 . Trump’s Pro-Crypto Administration: A Boost for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? The market outlook for Bitcoin reflects growing bullish sentiment among experts. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has predicted BTC will surpass $1 million by 2030 , citing increased participation from major investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Similarly, Henry Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Capital Management, believes President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration will drive institutional adoption. In a November 6 X post , he highlighted opportunities for asset managers and family offices to enter the U.S. crypto market. What is the impact of Trump’s win on the #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency markets? 3 things to watch: – change of US regulatory stance – further entry of institutional investors – wave of M&A in the space pic.twitter.com/9rJAJNO6h9 — Henri Arslanian (@HenriArslanian) November 6, 2024 Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Crypto research firm 10x Research suggests BTC could reach $100,000 by January 2025 , noting historical patterns where a six-month high typically leads to a 40% median gain over three months. Independent analyst Mags also predicts Bitcoin could hit $250,000 within a year , referencing its 360% post-election rally in 2020 and potential similar growth in 2024. MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy continues to yield massive returns. Since 2020, the firm has invested $23.5 billion to amass over 400,000 BTC, equivalent to 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. As of December 7, its holdings are valued at $40 billion, with an unrealized profit of $16.5 billion—a 70% return on capital.

In December 2024, it’s not just about the next viral meme—it’s about serious growth, explosive potential, and making those significant returns. If you’re looking to ride the hype and secure your spot in the future of meme coins, then you need to pay attention to the best meme coins for significant returns. From BTFD Coin raking in millions in presale sales to Goatseus Maximus battling a slight dip, and Degen steadily moving up—there are some coins you’ll want to keep on your radar. Let’s start with BTFD Coin —rapidly becoming a powerhouse in the meme coin world. The presale has already raised over $3.7 million, with 53 billion tokens sold and counting. The community is buzzing, and the BTFD Coin presale is already showing signs of massive returns. If you’re looking to snag a piece of this before it rockets even further, you better act fast. BTFD Coin: From Presale Success to 2025 Moonshot We can’t talk about the best meme coins for significant returns without giving BTFD Coin a serious spotlight. From the “Buy The Dip” mentality to staking rewards that could offer you an APY of 90%, there’s no shortage of reasons why this coin is making waves. The presale for BTFD Coin is already in full swing, with over $3.7 million raised and 53 billion tokens sold. That’s a lot of momentum to start with. With the presale price at $0.00013, this coin is set to see substantial growth as the price increases over time. The community is massive, and with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, BTFD Coin is taking off faster than we can keep up. But let’s talk numbers: if you were to invest $2,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013 per token, you’d be buying 15.3 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price were to reach $0.0006 by 2025 (a reasonable prediction based on current momentum), your $2,000 investment could turn into $9,180. That’s a 359% return on your investment—now, that’s the kind of growth you want in your portfolio. BTFD Coin has everything you could want for significant returns—staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn game , and a community-focused movement that will push it into the crypto stratosphere. Goatseus Maximus: Facing the Dip, But Long-Term Potential Remains Next up is Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that had all the hype earlier this year but has recently faced some volatility. The coin has seen a 24-hour -0.95% decline, but don’t be fooled by this temporary setback—it’s still one of the best meme coins for significant returns over the long term. At its peak, Goatseus Maximus was hitting highs, with prices that reflected its strong community and meme-driven popularity. But right now, it’s undergoing a bit of a retrace. The latest price sits around $0.7382, and despite the short-term dip, Goatseus Maximus still boasts a robust ecosystem with massive community engagement and ongoing development. This dip could present a perfect buying opportunity if you’re a believer in meme coins with long-term growth potential. As for predictions, Goatseus Maximus could very well rebound in 2025, potentially reaching prices around $0.73558 to $1.466409. For investors looking to buy and hold for significant returns, Goatseus Maximus is still one to consider, despite its current downtrend. Degen: A Steady Climb for the Bold Investor And then there’s Degen, the meme coin that refuses to quit. While Goatseus Maximus might be experiencing a brief hiccup, and BTFD Coin is on its way to the moon, Degen has been moving steadily upward, gaining traction among investors who believe in its quiet, consistent growth. Degen might not have the same viral hype as the others, but it’s proving to be one of the best meme coins for significant returns due to its consistent growth trajectory and strong community backing. The current price of Degen is sitting at $0.015359, but its solid fundamentals—paired with increasing interest from influencers and crypto communities—means it could experience strong growth moving into 2025. Looking ahead to 2025, Degen has the potential to hit between $0.027856 and $0.077508.It’s the steady Eddie of the group, but don’t sleep on its potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the BTFD Coin Presale—The Time to Act is Now! If you’re serious about grabbing the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is the one that’s impossible to ignore. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term growth, BTFD Coin has the community, the rewards, and the Play-to-Earn integration to make it a serious contender. So, why wait? Invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of the presale price before it skyrockets. At the current price, the potential for growth is massive. Don’t miss out on BTFD Coin—grab your tokens today and be part of the meme coin revolution!

French Hill plans to introduce clear regulations in the first 100 days of the new term, making it a key focus for Congress. His leadership could change U.S. crypto policy, creating a stable environment for the digital asset industry, a move long-awaited by crypto stakeholders. Hills Calls for a Shift Toward Crypto Regulation in the U.S. French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, was recently voted to chair the House Financial Services Committee. This comes after leading the panel’s subcommittee on digital assets. This committee is pivotal in crafting the nation’s crypto regulations, and Hill’s election marks a turning point for the industry. Hill has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly its chairman, Gary Gensler. Hill believes Gensler’s heavy enforcement approach to crypto regulation stifles innovation. In September, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer criticized Gensler’s SEC leadership, calling his tenure the most destructive and lawless. Hill argues that the U.S. needs a clearer market structure for digital assets, limiting the potential of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Many crypto leaders share this view, calling for necessary changes. The crypto community has praised Hill’s leadership, with groups like the DeFi Education Fund and Blockchain Association supporting his efforts to create clear regulations. They appreciate his focus on innovation and protecting the rights of developers and DeFi users. Hill is seen as a strong advocate for sensible crypto policies. Digital Assets: A Priority in the First 100 Days Hill’s vision for 2025 aligns closely with Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader. Scalise plans to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets within the first 100 days of President-elect Donald Trump’s term. The focus will include stablecoins and other key aspects of the crypto landscape, creating much-needed certainty for the industry. Scalise intends to establish a framework that will allow digital assets to grow with clear rules in place. The new bill will provide businesses and innovators with the confidence to build. A Potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In addition to regulatory work, discussions around a strategic Bitcoin reserve have gained momentum, both federally and at the state level. Hill will be tasked with navigating these discussions in his new role, including proposals from Senator Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Giovanni Capriglione. Lummis has proposed a bill directing the U.S. Treasury to purchase one million Bitcoins over five years. Capriglione has filed a state bill to create a Bitcoin reserve through donations, holding the assets for up to five years. When asked about the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, Hill acknowledged its appeal but was cautious in his assessment.

The analyst urges the XRP community to monitor this fractal closely, highlighting the need to monitor price movements in the coming weeks. XRP Price Eyes $16 As Analyst Spots Bullish Fractal An XRP supporter on X (formerly Twitter), known as ‘LUDXRP,’ has released a detailed chart analysis, predicting that the XRP price could climb to an ambitious price target of $16.15. The analyst mentioned the presence of a historic fractal on the XRP chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything The fractal pattern, indicated by the blue circle in the chart, highlights a significant upward movement in the XRP price. Following the movements of the chart, if XRP can replicate this fractal, it could trigger a significant price rally toward $16.15. Multiple green horizontal lines have also been shown in the chart, spotlighting different resistance and support zones that could trigger a reaction in the XRP price. With XRP trading at $2.42, the horizontal trend lines above its current price are seen as crucial resistance levels. The analyst highlighted intermediate price levels like $2.8, $4.1, $7.6, and $12.7 as crucial resistance levels, which XRP must surpass before reaching the ambitious target of $16.15. Additionally, the chart identifies $2 as a potential support level, warning that if the price drops below this mark, it could lead to a possible price dip to $1. With the possibility of breaking above $16, the XRP supporter has urged community members to monitor the fractal on the price chart closely. He emphasized the importance of XRP maintaining an upward trend within the blue circle, which could trigger his projected price increase toward $16. XRP To See “Face Melting” Rally This Christmas A crypto analyst identified as the ‘Charting Guy’ on X has expressed optimism about XRP’s future price outlook. According to the analyst, XRP could experience a ” face-melting “ rally to new highs by Christmas and in late January. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green The analyst has stated that if XRP continues to follow past bullish trends seen in 2017, the market will likely consolidate for another two weeks until Christmas. He disclosed that this bullish projection was primarily based on XRP’s fractal rather than relying on Fibonacci levels. In response to a comment from a crypto community member, the Charting guy agreed that by December 30, XRP would experience a series of strong green weeks, potentially driven either by the Christmas hype or the bullish sentiment surrounding the RLUSD stablecoin. The analyst also agreed that January 20, the inauguration day of Donald Trump as the United States (US) President, could mark the XRP price top, which the market would likely consider a “sell the news event.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-13 22:30:52

Solana faces competition as Lightchain AI, with AI-powered blockchain tech, offers a bold vision for decentralized creativity. Table of Contents Solana’s current position in the blockchain space What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Why experts see disruption potential The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities In the world of blockchain technology, Solana (SOL) has carved out a significant niche for itself. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low costs, and growing ecosystem, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for developers and investors. However, as technology evolves and new players emerge, questions arise about whether Solana’s dominance can be challenged. Enter Lightchain AI , a next-generation blockchain platform that combines unique artificial intelligence (AI) integration with creative scalability solutions. Boasting its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI presents a bold vision of the future—one where blockchain and AI work in tandem to power decentralized creativity. Can Lightchain AI challenge Solana’s supremacy? Experts believe the possibility is real, and here’s why. You might also like: Shiba Inu highlights and Lightchain AI’s blockchain solutions for December 2024 Solana’s current position in the blockchain space Solana’s rapid rise to prominence in the blockchain world can be attributed to several key factors: Speed and Scalability: Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant leap over Ethereum’s 15 TPS and other competing blockchains. Low Fees: Solana’s transaction fees are fractions of a penny, making it attractive for developers and users looking for cost-effective solutions. Developer Ecosystem: Solana’s active community has built an array of decentralized applications (dApps) spanning DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional Interest: High-profile backers like FTX and venture capital firms have provided financial and strategic support. Despite these strengths, Solana has faced its fair share of challenges: Network Downtime: Solana’s network has experienced multiple outages, raising concerns about its reliability and centralization. High Hardware Requirements: Running a Solana node requires powerful and expensive hardware, limiting true decentralization. Lack of Innovation in AI Integration: While Solana excels in transaction processing, its offerings in AI and advanced computational capabilities are limited. These pain points create an opportunity for a challenger like Lightchain AI to step in and disrupt Solana’s dominance. What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Lightchain AI is not just another blockchain—it’s a platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to address many of the challenges faced by traditional blockchains like Solana. Its core innovations include: 1. Proof of Intelligence: A smarter consensus mechanism While Solana uses a hybrid Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI): AI-Powered Validation: Nodes contribute by solving meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and optimization, rather than simply staking tokens or verifying blocks. Energy Efficiency: Unlike energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) systems, PoI aligns computational power with productive AI advancements. Decentralized AI Development: By decentralizing AI workloads, Lightchain AI ensures that its consensus mechanism contributes directly to solving real-world problems. This transformative approach positions Lightchain AI as a blockchain network with a purpose beyond simple transaction validation. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine: Redefining computation Lightchain AI’s AIVM sets it apart from other blockchain platforms by enabling the execution of AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. Key features include: Real-Time AI Execution: Unlike Solana , which focuses primarily on transaction processing, AIVM powers decentralized applications (dApps) that require advanced AI capabilities like predictive analytics and machine learning. Global Developer Collaboration: AIVM encourages developers worldwide to contribute AI models, creating a collaborative and evolving ecosystem. Interoperability: The AIVM integrates with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it easy for developers to adopt and deploy existing tools. 3. Scalability and speed While Solana’s high TPS is impressive, Lightchain AI employs advanced sharding and Layer 2 solutions to achieve comparable scalability without compromising decentralization: Parallel Processing: Lightchain’s architecture allows multiple nodes to process AI tasks and transactions simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks. Real-Time Applications: From supply chain tracking to high-frequency financial trading, Lightchain AI’s scalability supports applications that demand speed and precision. 4. Decentralized governance Unlike Solana, which has faced criticism for centralization, Lightchain AI prioritizes a community-driven governance model: Token Holder Influence: Through voting rights tied to its native LCAI token, the Lightchain community can propose and vote on changes to the protocol. Quadratic Voting: This system ensures smaller stakeholders have a proportional voice, fostering fairness and inclusivity. These are the key features that make Lightchain AI a potential challenger to Solana’s current dominance in the blockchain space. Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Feature Solana Lightchain AI Consensus Mechanism PoH + PoS PoI Transaction Speed (TPS) Up to 65,000 Comparable (via sharding) Energy Efficiency Moderate High (AI-aligned tasks) AI Integration Limited Advanced (via AIVM) Decentralization Partial Full (community-driven governance) Network Downtime Several outages reported Built for reliability Why experts see disruption potential 1. Bridging blockchain and AI “Lightchain AI stands out because it’s not just a blockchain—it’s an AI platform,” says Dr. Amelia Wang, an AI researcher. “By merging these two technologies, Lightchain enables use cases that traditional blockchains like Solana simply cannot address.” Potential applications include: Decentralized AI Model Training: Nodes collaborate to train global AI models without compromising data privacy. AI-Powered DeFi Protocols: Platforms that use machine learning for risk assessment and portfolio optimization. Data Marketplaces: Decentralized platforms where users can buy and sell AI-ready datasets. 2. Solana’s limitations leave room for competition While Solana excels in speed, it has struggled with reliability and decentralization. Matthew Ellis, a blockchain analyst, notes: “Solana’s network outages have shaken investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism offers a more sustainable and reliable alternative while adding value through AI computations.” 3. AI’s booming market The AI market is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2030, creating enormous opportunities for platforms like Lightchain AI. As more industries adopt AI-powered solutions, a blockchain that can integrate seamlessly with AI will be well-positioned for long-term success. The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities Challenges for Lightchain AI Adoption: Gaining traction in an already competitive market dominated by Solana, Ethereum , and others. Education: Convincing developers and enterprises of the value of integrating AI with blockchain. Scalability Tests: Proving its architecture can handle large-scale adoption without bottlenecks. Opportunities Early Adoption: Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale offers an entry point for investors looking to get in before the project gains mainstream attention. Industry Partnerships: Collaborating with AI and blockchain leaders to create real-world applications. Decentralized Innovation: Harnessing the power of its developer and token holder community to drive continuous evolution. Jump in before the rocket launches Solana who? The blockchain world is buzzing, and Lightchain AI is here to shake things up. With AI smarts, lightning-fast speeds, and a loyal crew of believers, this isn’t just another altcoin — this could be the next big thing. Experts are whispering about a potential 10x explosion by 2025, and the presale is your ticket to the ground floor of something epic.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP slows down but 5 altcoins, including Rexas Finance (RXS), could turn $300 into $6,000 by 2025. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Tron Floki Inu Dogecoin Polygon Conclusion Since November, XRP has been one of the strongest bull run performers, rising from $0.63 to $2.92. XRP’s momentum reversed when it failed to test $3, dropping to $2.52 levels. While XRP’s ascent has hit a snag, Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon might bring huge gains, potentially upgrading $300 portfolios to $6000l. Rexas Finance Investors looking to build a profitable portfolio from a low budget within the shortest time interval could consider Rexas Finance , one of the most inventive crypto projects. It seeks to digitise a variety of tangible things such as properties, commodities, and arts, thus enabling the retail investor to enter into otherwise untouchable investments. Considering the worldwide commodities, real estate, and financial assets market to be $121.2 trillion, $379.7 trillion, and $486 trillion, respectively, RWA tokenization is the future of money. Rexas Finance will open up investment options to a wider audience by allowing fractional ownership and digital trade of these precious assets, removing geographical and financial limitations. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem will include the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, making asset-backed token creation, management, and trading easy. The platform will also support Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that maximizes investor income with minimal effort. Moreover, it will offer a decentralized Launchpad for startups to raise funds and increase their reach. These features make Rexas Finance a key player in the DeFi movement. Rexas Finance’s presale has been a success so far, with the token price rising over 316% in three months. The project has raised $25.3 million and sold 334 million RXS tokens as investors flock to its current presale stage despite the price appreciation of $0.125. Rexas Finance opted for public presales over VC funding, a crucial step to creating a community-driven platform with decentralized ownership. A recent Certik audit improved Rexas Finance’s security and transparency. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, two major cryptocurrency tracking websites, have listed RXS, enhancing visibility and investor interest. Before RXS is listed on the proposed top crypto exchanges, investors have a limited time to buy it at its current presale price. Rexas Finance is also offering a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 entrants each receiving $50,000 in RXS tokens. Experts see a huge potential in the Rexas Finance project, with many projecting a massive surge to $10 immediately after its anticipated mega listings.

TRX is at $0.37, up 70% in 24 hours and 140% in 30 days. Tron founder Justin Sun continues to promote the project on social media. High-profile decentralized finance (DeFi) ventures like Sun’s investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) have boosted the Tron ecosystem’s reputation and attracted institutional investors. TRX’s complete DeFi applications are helping it grow as more people join the network. Floki Inu Floki Inu remains a top meme coin for its community-driven strategy and unique branding. FLOKI rose over 650% in 2024 and is expected to continue rising in 2025. Crypto expert Master Kenobi forecasts FLOKI will rise 700% to $0.0023 by March 2025. This prediction follows its impressive chart patterns, which suggest bullish momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin recently reached a yearly top of $0.4634, proving its market viability. A strong optimistic trend over the last month produced a 200% increase. Though its popularity and strong community support have kept it among the top cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is most renowned for its meme roots. After rising, DOGE still lags 37% below its all-time high of $0.73. Due to considerable accumulation by whales, recently launched DOGE ETP, and upcoming political shift in the US, Dogecoin might soon soar above $1. Polygon Polygon is recognized as an Ethereum Layer-2 scalability solution. The POL coin, which rose 18% to $0.64 in the previous week, is becoming a key player in Ethereum dApp scalability. Polygon’s long-term projections are good despite recent setbacks. The platform makes perfect use of Ethereum’s features, making it a necessary component of the Ethereum ecology. As the altcoin season nears, Polygon’s price will rise as Ethereum benefits from the anticipated clear regulatory climate following Gary Gensler’s recent resignation. Experts predict it might surge to $5 in the coming months. Conclusion Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon are predicted to rise dramatically in 2025. These solutions provide distinct promise and development potential for those looking to grow their portfolios from $300 to $6,000 by early 2025. Rexas Finance is a transformative project with a solid foundation. Its presale success, growing ecosystem, and upcoming exchange listings make it a great candidate for huge gains. At $0.125, RXS current price is a bargain for investors willing to jump in on the presale. To learn more about Rexas Finance, visit their websi t e , giveaway , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Here’s Why a “Santa Rally” Is Likely,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-set-to-pump-to-5k-before-years-end-heres-why-a-santa-rally-is-likely/,"As the Ethereum (ETH) price consolidates just above $3,900, traders are eyeing the possibility of a surge into the year’s end, a phenomenon referred to as a “Santa Rally”. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is looking good right now, sitting above all of its major moving averages and still in a clear uptrend. However, resistance in the form of the early 2024 highs just above $4,000 continues to cap the Ethereum price action. However, Christmas could be about to come early for Ethereum investors. While Polymarket betting odds only currently place a 14% chance that the Ethereum price will hit new all-time highs at $5,000, this may represent the market under-pricing the likelihood of a strong breakout. Here’s why. Ethereum Price to Pump to $5,000 Soon? Here’s Why That’s Likely Reason 1 – Vibes To say that vibes are good in the crypto market right now would be an understatement ahead of the arrival of an almost unimaginably pro-crypto incoming US administration in March. Trump promised this week to do great things for the crypto industry, his picks for Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair are ardently pro-crypto, and his family were spotted loading up their ETH, AAVE and LINK positions just days ago. U.S. President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial bought • 2,631 $ETH ($10M) • 3,357 $AAVE ($1M) • 41,335 $LINK ($1M) UNREAL pic.twitter.com/KubybniuBb — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 12, 2024 Its not hyperbole to say we are not he cusp of a new golden age for crypto markets as policy in the US swings decisively in a positive direction. That is a strong reason why buy pressure is likely to remain elevated into the year’s end, boding well for the Ethereum price. Reason 2 – Market Leadership and ETF Inflows The prospect of the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve in the USA suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) will be a massive winner amid the upcoming administration. However, altcoins like Ethereum which have been weighed so heavily by regulatory uncertainty in recent years may enjoy an even greater snapback. And Ethereum is in a great position to be one of the strongest-performing altcoins . It remains far and away the most dominant blockchain in DeFi, with a 56% market share of TVL per DeFi Llama , even if Solana has overtaken it in terms of speculative trading activities (thanks to its lower fees). For investors new to crypto looking to expand beyond BTC, Ethereum will likely stand out as the obvious next option. That is even more the case given Ethereum is the only other major crypto to have spot ETFs in the US. According to data presented by The Block , Ethereum ETF inflows have been ramping up since Trump’s election victory. And there is no reason for this to slow down into the year’s end, meaning upside risks to the Ethereum price in the coming weeks. Reason 3 – On-chain Activity Heating Up Another reason to be bullish on the Ethereum price into the year’s end is because the activity on its blockchain is really starting to heat up. Per Glassnode’s Ethereum core on-chain dashboard , metrics such as number of active addresses, number of transactions, and total transfer volume are all trending higher and challenging yearly highs. That strengthens the adoption narrative and can help to support prices. But it also contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as a deflationary asset – a portion of the ETH gas fees get burnt, so the more fees are generated, the more ETH is burnt. How Much Higher Can Ethereum Go? With Ethereum now close to its record highs, investors would be forgiven for fearing that the best part of the rally might now be over. But that would be a mistake – Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum price has historically moved in cycles, breaking into phases of aggressive price discovery, followed by large and prolonged drawdowns. Luckily for the bulls, a new phase of price discovery is likely just around the corner. Bitcoin entered its new phase of price discovery last month, as it historically always have within eight months of the BTC halving. Ethereum, meanwhile, has historically lagged Bitcoin by up to two months. That could mean an aggressive breakout to fresh record levels is coming in January. Various on-chain metrics also support the thesis that the top isn’t yet in – Ethereum’s “realized cap” (i.e. the market cap at the average price when each last coin moved) just hit new record highs at just under $248 billion. And the ratio of the ETH market cap to its realized cap, last around 1.5 per Glassnode , remains well below levels that have marked prior market peaks (above 3). Meanwhile, while high, the profitability of the Ethereum market also remains below levels that have marked prior Ethereum price peaks. Per Glassnode , NUPL was last just over 0.5, but prior market peaks have seen NUPL rise above 0.75. Regarding the question “how much higher can Ethereum go?”, no one knows for sure. But the answer is certainly a lot. The past cycle saw the Ethereum price rally over 4x beyond its prior record highs. A repeat of these gains is very possible, setting up the possibility of a near $20,000 Ethereum price. The post Ethereum Price Set to Pump to $5K Before Year’s End?

The report, gathered through open-source code activity, compiled notable industry developments in 2024 so far. The 2024 report includes data from StablePulse.org, NFTpulse.org and CodeSlaw.app. Electric Capital’s report confirmed perceptions about the significant growth the crypto industry has witnessed across multiple sectors and on a global scale this year. The continued adoption and adaptation of the industry has had a great impact on the world and shown the industry’s capacity to innovate. One of these notable trends in this year’s report is the Asian developer momentum. The population of programmers from that part of the world has increased, taking over North America’s dominance. Asia now ranks first, while North America is third in line after Europe. Back in 2015, 81% of crypto developers were in North America and Europe. Now, that stat has dropped to 55%. India and Ethereum were the biggest winners this year Despite Asia taking the lead over other continents, the US remains the country with the highest concentration of developers, with 19%. However, the country is down from 38% in 2015. India, on the other hand, has seen the most growth and is now the country with the second-highest developer share. The South Asian nation has come a long way from its 10th position in 2015. The country also onboarded the most new crypto developers in 2024, contributing 17% of new talent. Top five countries for crypto developers. Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Established developers with 2+ years of experience grew by 27% and now account for 70% of code commits. 39,148 new developers explored crypto this year, according to the Electric Capital report. Developers in the crypto space are also extremely diverse, with 1 in 3 developers working across multiple ecosystems. In 2015, less than 10% of developers had a similar level of diversity. Crypto developers have grown 39% per year since Ethereum’s launch in 2015, and it remains the leading ecosystem by developer share globally, boosted by the growth in Layer 2 adoption. EVM compatible chains continue to dominate, accounting for 74% of multi-chain developers. This year, Solana emerged as the favorite ecosystem of new developers, with over 57% of minting wallets. It grew by 83% YoY.

Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Stablecoin transactions are consistently active, rising by 2-3% during Asian, European, and African work hours. NFT trading peaks during American work hours, while minting peaks during Asian work hours. According to Electric Capital’s report, Base and Solana lead in low-fee use cases for NFTs, making them ideal for high-volume minting and trading. Base owns 97% of NFT minting volume, while Solana owns 64% of NFT mint transactions. NFT minting volume reached an all-time high of $1.5B this year. Minting wallets grew to 67M in 2024, with most of the activity on Solana (57%), Polygon (24%), and Base (13%). The all-time high volume for unique minting wallets was 23M. Minting transactions grew from 153M in 2023 to 568M in 2024, with the most activity on Solana (64%) and Base (26%). This year, NFT mints went beyond arts. The top NFT collections included finance, rewards, identity, gaming and more. NFT deployments tripled YoY, with Base and Zora leading in minting activity by 87%. DeFi also had a big year. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi grew 89% this year, with Ethereum taking the lead with 53%. Ethereum had 7x more TVL than Solana, its strongest competitor, with $16B. Restaking emerged in 2023 and grew to $30.6B this year. It has now become the largest sector in DeFi. EigenLayer spearheaded the growth in restaking as it saw its developer count grow more than twofold in 2024. 53% of EigenLayer developers are established and 39% of them are committed devs. Electric Capital’s report also shows stablecoins closing the year at an all-time high of $196B in circulation and $81B in daily transaction volume. Tether’s USDT is the runaway leader in stablecoin dominance, accounting for 72% of fiat-pegged tokens in circulation this year. Circle USDC’s 20% is its closest competition. Ethereum and TRON hosted the most issued stablecoins, with 59% and 35%, respectively. Arguably the catalysts for one of the best crypto years on record, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs had record-breaking launches. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $50B+ net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs achieved $13B in assets under management (AUM) since July.

Is it the technology, the community, or the potential returns for early investors? While the market evolves, three projects have captured the spotlight: Filecoin, EOS, and the innovative newcomer Qubetics ($TICS). These projects bring unique opportunities and updates, but Qubetics has generated a different buzz than any of them, particularly with its groundbreaking Web3 infrastructure and Top Crypto Presale to buy. Recent updates highlight exciting predictions for Filecoin and the potential of EOS. However, Qubetics takes centre stage with its ambitious plans, cutting-edge decentralised VPN service, and highly rewarding presale. This article will delve into the latest developments for all three projects, focusing on Qubetics and why it’s the most compelling opportunity for savvy investors. How Qubetics dVPN Is Changing the Game for Online Privacy Qubetics is making waves with its Web3 ecosystem, and a key highlight is its decentralised VPN (dVPN) . Unlike traditional VPNs that often log user data or are prone to censorship, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to ensure true privacy and security. Creating a peer-to-peer network eliminates centralised control, offering unrestricted and anonymous internet access. What makes this unique? First, the decentralised architecture ensures no single entity can control or compromise your data. This model provides unmatched transparency and censorship resistance. Additionally, users providing bandwidth are incentivised with $TICS tokens, transforming the service into a self-sustaining marketplace. Advanced features like multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption further enhance privacy and security. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session , connecting directly with its community to answer questions and share updates. This initiative underscores the project’s commitment to transparency and user engagement. With its dVPN, Qubetics isn’t just improving privacy—it’s setting a new standard for secure, decentralised internet access. Could this be the Top Crypto Presale to buy for those seeking long-term growth? Filecoin: Powering Decentralised Storage Solutions Filecoin continues to lead in decentralised storage, offering a secure and efficient alternative to traditional cloud providers. By enabling users to rent out unused hard drive space, Filecoin rewards participants with FIL tokens. This system, built on proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime mechanisms, ensures data reliability and long-term storage. Looking ahead, market analysts predict a steady price climb for Filecoin. By 2024, FIL is expected to average $17.28, with projections of $35.70 by 2027 and $58.80 by 2030. These forecasts highlight Filecoin’s potential as a long-term investment in the decentralised Web3 infrastructure. EOS: A High-Potential Altcoin for 2024 EOS offers a versatile blockchain platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. As Bitcoin sets the stage for another “Altseason,” EOS could see significant growth in 2024. Current projections suggest EOS might reach $1.165 by the end of the year, driven by increased developer adoption and market momentum. However, the token’s performance hinges on key factors such as adoption rates, competition from other blockchain platforms, and regulatory developments. Despite these uncertainties, EOS remains a promising contender for investors seeking exposure to altcoins in 2024. Qubetics Presale Is Exploding: The Top Crypto Presale to Buy Now Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS tokens at a low rate of $0.031. Each week, the token price rises by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike during the final phase. With over $5.9 million raised, 318 million tokens sold, and 9,000+ holders, Qubetics is rapidly gaining momentum. The numbers are compelling. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. For investors entering now, the potential ROI is staggering. A $10 target would mean a return of over 32,028%, while $15 could yield an ROI of approximately 48,092%. With the presale ending soon, this phase presents a golden opportunity to maximise gains. Qubetics has already demonstrated its appeal through its cutting-edge technology and growing community. The excitement surrounding the presale only strengthens its position as the top crypto presale to buy for 2024 . Will you seize this chance before the next phase kicks in? Conclusion: Why Qubetics Leads the Pack The cryptocurrency market offers countless opportunities, but few are as compelling as Qubetics. While Filecoin continues to innovate in decentralised storage and EOS positions itself for growth in the coming year, Qubetics stands out with its ambitious plans and exceptional ROI potential. Its decentralised VPN service and rapidly advancing presale make it the Top Crypto Presale to buy, offering a rare blend of technology and opportunity. As analysts predict meteoric growth for $TICS, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics revolution and secure your place in what could be the next major success story in the blockchain world.

The surge also follows a series of announcements, including new market listings and milestone achievements for the company. CZ’s Influence On December 11, Travala reported that its annual revenues had reached $100 million, up from $59.6 million in 2023. This achievement was made possible by the growing demand for flight and hotel bookings paid using crypto. It also coincided with the firm’s disclosure of a new strategy: It intends to hold a portion of its treasury reserve in AVA and Bitcoin in the manner popularized by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy . However, Zhao’s December 12 post on X highlighting his firm’s early investment in Travala, dating back to the pre-COVID era, tipped the scales, getting the market excited and fueling investor curiosity. Hailed as one of the “OG of Crypto” by some X users, Zhao’s influence within the blockchain and crypto sector is well-documented . By drawing attention to Binance’s early involvement, he not only reinforced Travala’s credibility but also signaled its potential for long-term growth – at least that’s how the market took it based on the price’s performance. According to the social metrics platform LunarCrush, CZ’s post, viewed more than 1.3 million times, caused a marked rise in AVA-related social activity. As a result, it experienced an explosive 350% price rally, jumping from $0.75 to a peak of $3.38 in just one day. Performance and Outlook At the time of this writing, the token was still almost 310% higher than its level from 24 hours ago. Its current price also represents a 286.6% improvement over seven days and an even more impressive 541% jump over 30 days. Additionally, it registered a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $890 million per data from CoinGecko, a 28,436% increase across the period, highlighting the catalytic nature of CZ’s post. With a circulating supply of 56.3 million units, each costing over $3.00, AVA now boasts a nearly $172 million valuation, placing it at #445 on the list of cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps. The token has massively outperformed the broader crypto market, which is down 2.20% in the last seven days, and similar Ethereum ecosystem assets, which are up 12.7% on average.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 23:53:00

This period of choppy price action has kept traders on edge, as Dogecoin’s price appears poised for a decisive move. Despite the temporary pause in upward momentum, market sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors anticipating another breakout. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s potential for a massive price surge. According to Hardy, it’s only a matter of time before DOGE breaks into new all-time highs. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is building a strong foundation, and continued consolidation at current levels is a bullish signal. If Dogecoin maintains support above $0.40, the stage could be set for a significant rally in the coming weeks. However, much will depend on broader market conditions and the ability of DOGE to sustain buying pressure. All eyes are on its ability to overcome resistance and resume its bullish trend. With whale activity and trading volumes showing signs of growth, Dogecoin could soon retest its highs, ushering in a new chapter of price discovery. Dogecoin Consolidates At Current Levels Dogecoin is consolidating below its yearly high of $0.484 after an impressive rally, and it appears this phase of sideways movement may persist for some time. While the price action has calmed, investor sentiment remains notably optimistic, with many viewing this consolidation as a stepping stone toward even higher price levels. Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, offering a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Hardy, DOGE’s current price action is a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend. He emphasized that the asset is building a solid base, which increases the likelihood of a significant breakout. Hardy’s projection suggests that Dogecoin is poised to surpass its yearly high and is also on track to achieve a new all-time high (ATH). In his analysis, Hardy highlighted key support levels around $0.40 and $0.36, indicating these areas as crucial for maintaining the bullish structure. He also mapped out a potential price trajectory, predicting that Dogecoin will consolidate at current levels for several weeks before resuming its upward momentum. His optimistic target for DOGE is $2, which he believes could be reached if the broader market remains favorable and buying pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength While consolidation may test the patience of traders, Hardy’s analysis aligns with the broader view that Dogecoin is preparing for another major leg up. A new ATH could be just around the corner as long as it holds key support levels and sentiment remains positive. DOGE Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.40 after a 24% retrace from its local highs. Despite this pullback, the price has exceeded this key demand level, signaling resilience among bulls. Market participants are closely watching the $0.40 zone, representing a critical point for determining the next move in DOGE’s price action. If DOGE can reclaim the $0.43 level in the coming days, it would likely set the stage for a retest of its yearly high at $0.484. A breakout above this resistance could reignite bullish momentum and pave the way for further upside, potentially attracting renewed interest from traders and investors. However, maintaining support and gaining traction is essential for this scenario to unfold. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details On the flip side, losing the $0.40 level could signal that bearish sentiment is gaining market control. In this case, DOGE might face a deeper correction, with the next critical support levels likely emerging near $0.36. Such a move would challenge the bullish outlook and delay DOGE’s efforts to reach new highs.

From humble beginnings as internet jokes, these coins have grown into investment powerhouses, delivering chef’s kiss gains to lucky holders. Financial freedom? It’s never looked this approachable—or this much fun. Leading the pack is none other than BTFD Coin, the rallying cry of every trader who knows how to “buy the dip.” The coin’s presale has bulldozed through the market, with a jaw-dropping $3.7 million raised, over 53 billion coins sold, and more than 5,000 holders locking horns for their share of the action. Don’t wait too long to grab yours, though—the bulls aren’t slowing down! 1. BTFD Coin: Where the Bulls Play to Win BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement. Inspired by the legendary trading mantra, “Buy the Dip,” this meme coin embraces chaos and turns it into opportunity. Built on Ethereum for rock-solid security, it offers insane features like staking rewards with an average APY of 90% and a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s already got gamers sharpening their horns. The ongoing presale is the real star of the show. In just weeks, BTFD Coin has raised $3.7 million, proving that the bulls are stampeding to get in. At its current presale price of $0.00013, it’s still early enough to lock in life-changing gains before the herd catches on. Let’s say you decide to invest $300 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price of $0.00013, that gives you 2,307,692 coins. If BTFD Coin soars to $0.0006 as predicted, your investment could balloon to $1,384—over a 361% return.

Here’s the kicker: Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu, the iconic dog behind the Doge meme. It’s like Doge’s little sister is stepping into the spotlight, and she’s not here to play small.

Days later, he publicly confirmed a $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund inspired by Neiro. But the journey doesn’t stop at celebrity nods. Neiro’s origin story is as heartfelt as they come. Originally abandoned by her owner and placed in a shelter, Neiro’s tale mirrors the coin’s trajectory. After being rugged by its initial developer, the community banded together to breathe new life into the project. Now, Neiro is 100% community-owned and driven, embodying a true decentralised ethos.

According to a Bloomberg article , the round now values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. OSS Capital, Duke Capital Partners, and PagsGroup also participated in the series A round. Liquid AI previously raised about $46.6 million in seed funding in 2023. Liquid AI wants to develop more efficient models The development comes as consumer generative AI, which captured global attention following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success has spurred developments across the world. The tech is now at the center of the fast-growing AI sector, which has seen investors pour billions of dollars into generative AI startups. For Liquid, the startup’s new models are known as Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) which the company says can deliver performance comparable or superior to traditional large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI, Google Cloud, and AWS. The LFMs are lightweight, general-purpose AI models requiring less data and compute power. The models strangely uses mathematical approaches discovered by studying a worm’s brain, as per Crunchbase. According to SiliconAngle , Liquid’s models are based on the concept of “liquid neural networks.” This classification is different from generative pre-trained transformer-based models or GPTs that support popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Google LLC’s Gemini. “At Liquid, our mission is to build the most capable and efficient AI systems at every scale.” Liquid CEO Ramin Hasani. “Since our inception, we have demonstrated the scalability of our technology by releasing text-based models, unveiling multimodal LFMs, and collaborating with key partners to showcase real-world impact,” added Hasani. AMD partnership will allow Liquid AI to optimize its LFMs According to SiliconAngle, the AI startup offers three model sizes, that is LFM-1B, a dense 1.3 billion parameter model for on-device such as mobile phones, LFM-3B, a 3.1 billion parameter model optimized for edge developments, and the LFM-40B Mixture of Experts, designed to tackle complex tasks. Liquid AI said LFMs have a reduced memory footprint compared to GPT architecture, which is more substantial for lengthy inputs, for instance when processing extremely long documents or video. The LFM-3.1B model, according to Liquid AI used significantly less memory than other small models when deployed than models such as Google LLC’s Gemma 2 2B-it or Meta’s Llama3.2 3B. Now, with this funding, Liquid AI has joined a strategic partnership with AMD bolstering its ability to optimize its foundation models with the chipmaker’s graphic, central, and neural processing units. The funding will also help the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup to develop tailored LFMs for industries like consumer electronics, biotechnology, telecoms, financial services, and e-commerce.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 00:58:00

ZK-Rollups current challenges ZK-Rollups are important for solving the issues blockchain has been struggling with for quite a while, such as scalability, cost, and privacy. They do this using an off-chain bundle of transactions that are validated using zero-knowledge proofs submitted to the main chain.

Despite these benefits, they also come along with several disadvantages. Some of them include complex development, computation-intensive proofs, difficulty in integrating dApps, and data availability issues for off-chain transactions, as seen previously in ZKsync . Sandor’s new position as co-founder of OpenZK can address ZK-Rollup’s present challenges and lay the ground for mass adoption and future growth of ZK-Rollups as a whole.

The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor,"" van Straten added. ""Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect.""

Holihan closed the account, but says new charges from the state of Pennsylvania poured in anyway, fully draining his life savings. “It was four different Giant supermarkets in Pennsylvania, where [scammers] took out a little over seven grand in under an hour… They still deny my claim, and it’s been over a year later, and I still haven’t seen my money.” Holihan says he can prove he was in New York when the charges were made, but Chase says each purchase was fully authorized and verified. “This customer’s claim was denied because the charges were authorized with their PIN and verified via phone call.” Holihan says he’s simply looking for the bank to stand by him and do the right thing. “It’s not even a thousandth of a percent. It’s nothing to them.

Table of Contents CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions FET nears key resistance Conclusion CYBRO, a new AI token valued at $0.06 is attracting keen interest from crypto millionaires. With some speculating a potential 20,000% surge, this digital asset is stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency world. CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain platform, is fast-tracking its plans to list on major exchanges following an impressive presale performance. The project secured $7 million in funding and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, cementing its position as a leader in DeFi. During the presale, CYBRO’s token price skyrocketed by 450%, rising from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, is scheduled for December 14th, with a listing price of $0.06. CYBRO attained several other milestones during its presale, including: CYBRO app launch: Introducing over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to cater to diverse investment strategies. Blast Index rollout: A one-click investment solution that streamlines DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Platform expansion: Establishing the foundation for a seamless, user-focused DeFi ecosystem. CYBRO is on a mission to democratize DeFi. Its roadmap through 2025 outlines plans for advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-driven tools. CYBRO’s listing coincides with a surge in interest in AI-enabled financial platforms. With its strong presale momentum and a launch price of $0.06, CYBRO is poised to attract attention from both retail and institutional investors. As the platform gears up for its market debut, its approach and rapid growth trajectory position it as a key player to watch. Interested investors can still be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum. You might also like: How this low-cap AI coin could outperform 2024’s top cryptos NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions NEAR Protocol’s price has climbed over 28% in the past month, currently ranging between $6.75 and $7.95. It sits slightly above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, both around $6.95. The Relative Strength Index is above 70, signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD indicates positive momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $8.32, with support at $5.67. If the upward trend continues, NEAR could reach the second resistance at $10.14, marking a significant increase from current prices. However, the high RSI suggests a potential pullback. Traders are watching for a break above resistance or a dip below support to determine the next move. FET nears key resistance FET has been trading between $1.78 and $2.17, showing a 26.98% increase over six months. The price is approaching the nearest resistance at $2.48. The Relative Strength Index is at 66.70, indicating momentum toward overbought levels. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close at $1.85 and $1.83, suggesting consolidation. The MACD level of 0.04 signals mild bullish momentum. If FET breaks above $2.48, it could target the second resistance at $2.97, offering substantial gains. However, if it fails to surpass this level, the price may pull back toward the support at $1.49. Conclusion Amid the ongoing bull run, established tokens like NEAR and FET may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO seeks to provide exceptional opportunities to amplify earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO will deliver a superior user experience featuring effortless deposits and withdrawals. Its strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality sets it apart, drawing significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Stellar (XLM) continues its mission of bridging global financial systems with seamless cross-border payments, while Render (RNDR) is redefining cloud computing with decentralized rendering solutions. Both are making headlines for their innovative approaches to real-world problems. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , a presale phenomenon with over 318 million tokens sold and $5.9M raised. With its cutting-edge non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is solving problems traditional cryptos have struggled with—making everyday payments easy and accessible for everyone. With a projected ROI of 900%, $TICS might just be one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Making Crypto Everyday-Ready Let’s face it—crypto adoption has been clunky. Between complicated wallets, volatile prices, and confusing payment systems, most people find it overwhelming. That’s where Qubetics steps in. Imagine paying for dinner with crypto and having it auto-converted to fiat without lifting a finger . That’s the kind of future Qubetics is building. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet works across iOS, Android, and desktops. Plus, it integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it as simple as tapping your phone. The standout feature? A smart contract conversion mechanism that turns digital assets into fiat currency instantly at the point of sale. This protects users from crypto’s wild price swings while ensuring smooth transactions. Let’s say you’re a freelancer based in Austin, Texas, working with clients in Tokyo and Berlin. With Qubetics, you can accept payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, and they’re auto-converted into USD in your account—no delays, no stress. Businesses love it too. Imagine an online retailer accepting crypto payments from customers worldwide, with every transaction auto-converted to their local currency. At $0.0311 per token in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is heating up. Weekly price hikes of 10% make this phase especially attractive.

Two coins currently garnering attention are NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) and Altura ($ALU). While both have their unique strengths, Altura emerges as the clear winner for investors seeking high-growth potential in an AI-driven era. Here’s why. Understanding NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) NEAR Protocol is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed to make decentralized applications (dApps) easy to build and use. Its focus on scalability, simplicity, and user-friendly tools has made it a popular choice for developers.Key Features:- Sharding Technology: NEAR uses a unique sharding approach called ""Nightshade"" to achieve scalability.- Developer-Friendly Tools: With support for languages like Rust and JavaScript, NEAR simplifies the dApp development process.- Eco-Friendly: NEAR operates with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, reducing its carbon footprint.Growth Potential:Despite its technological advancements, NEAR’s market capitalization limits its upside potential. With a current valuation in the multi-billion-dollar range, the coin might offer a 2-3x return in the best-case scenario. This is respectable but falls short compared to smaller-cap gems like Altura. Why Altura ($ALU) is the Superior Investment Altura is revolutionizing the gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors by providing a blockchain-based smart NFT platform. Its lower market cap and growing adoption position it as a coin with unparalleled potential for explosive growth.Key Features:1. Smart NFTs: Altura’s smart NFTs are dynamic, meaning their properties can change based on in-game events or external data, offering unprecedented utility in gaming and beyond.2. AI-Driven Innovations: Altura is integrating AI into its platform to personalize gaming experiences and automate NFT functionalities, making it highly relevant in today’s AI-driven market.3. Developer Ecosystem: Altura empowers game developers with tools to integrate blockchain technology seamlessly, bridging the gap between traditional gaming and Web3.Growth Potential:Altura’s current market cap is significantly smaller than NEAR’s, making it a prime candidate for exponential growth. Realistically, $ALU could achieve an 8-20x return, especially as AI and gaming sectors gain momentum. Market Cap Comparison: Why It Matters Market cap is a crucial factor when evaluating investment potential. Here’s how NEAR and Altura stack up:- NEAR Protocol: With a market cap in the billions, NEAR’s upside is limited by the law of large numbers. Even a 3x increase would place it among the top blockchain platforms, requiring substantial market adoption.- Altura: Altura’s smaller market cap means it has more room to grow. An 8-20x increase would still keep it within a reasonable valuation compared to other projects in the gaming and AI sectors. The AI-Driven Future: Why Altura is Better Positioned Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of industries worldwide, including blockchain. Altura’s proactive integration of AI gives it a competitive edge:- Personalized Experiences: AI-driven customization for gaming ensures users remain engaged.- Scalability: AI algorithms optimize performance, ensuring smooth operations as the platform scales.- Dynamic Growth: The fusion of AI and blockchain opens doors to innovative applications, giving Altura a head start in an untapped market.In contrast, NEAR, while technologically robust, lacks a strong AI narrative, which may limit its appeal as AI adoption grows Conclusion: The Case for Altura ($ALU) NEAR Protocol is a solid investment for conservative growth, but for investors looking for exponential returns, Altura stands out as the superior choice. Its focus on smart NFTs, gaming, and AI-driven innovation aligns perfectly with current market trends. With the potential for 8-20x growth compared to NEAR’s 2-3x, Altura represents a much better risk-to-reward ratio.For those ready to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation, $ALU offers a golden opportunity.

Thanks to Bitcoin’s momentum, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are seeing significant growth. But Cutoshi (CUTO) is promising in this bull run too. Solana Sees More Upward Potential Solana (SOL) is standing to gain from the coming meme coin market boom. Currently, SOL is trading at $211, with a month-to-date rise of 2% SOL seems to be losing momentum. However, with an all-time high upward of $260 this month, SOL could definitely see some gains again. The latest bull run for Solana started after the US elections, as the crypto market started to boom. Notably, investors expect the Trump administration to make some moves for crypto. At the same time, Elon Musk, who won a seat in the new administration, is a known Dogecoin advocate. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and Musk’s meme coin support have the potential to further catalyze the market. In this context, Solana, a DeFi giant and the biggest meme coin platform, stands to gain significantly. For this reason, analysts see SOL at roughly $240 in a month. Fueled by regulatory changes and a potential meme coin surge, Solana is in a strong position to grow further. Avalanche Is Melting Skepticism After a year of decline, Avalanche (AVAX) is finally recovering some of its losses. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $44 , with a modest year-to-date increase of 22%. Still, the token has recently gained momentum. Despite a year of underperformance, traders are turning back to Avalanche, seeing the potential of its technology. The token is specifically designed for dApps and features custom blockchain for specialized use cases, as such, it is attractive to institutional players. For that reason, Ava Labs already secured partnerships with major players such as Amazon and Visa. Still, the road for Avalanche is not easy. The project will have to counter trader skepticism over major token unlocks, which tend to depress the price. Despite this, analysts predict a price target of $56 in a month and $63 in three months for Avax. Solana And Avax Holders Look To Viral Cutoshi With Avax and Solana seeing mixed performance, their traders are diversifying. One of the tokens that recently caught their attention is the viral memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO). Just weeks after the start of its presale, Cutoshi raised over $1 million, gaining viral status on X. Currently, Cutoshi managed to raise over $1.36 million in presale investments. This success shows that traders are interested in its blend of memes and DeFi utility. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. It hopes to use the viral nature of meme coins to bring more people into DeFi, explaining the values of self-custody and decentralization. Its multichain DEX will offer a safer alternative to centralized exchanges while also benefiting users with low fees. At the same time, the project’s learning platform is all about onboarding people that are new to DeFi. With more people entering the crypto market, projects like Cutoshi are key to educating these new users on the benefits of DeFi. They offer a potential for decentralized technology to challenge the dominant centralized exchanges.

For the crypto travel agency, which lately revealed having reached $100 million in annual revenue, this increase marks a turning point. From $0.80 to $30.1, the price of AVA has exploded, courtesy of growing interest in the use of digital currency in the travel industry. Related Reading: Expert Eyes $35 XRP Price, Says Holders To Become ‘Filthy Rich’ Binance Early Investment Binance had already invested in Travala before the pandemic, as disclosed in Zhao’s tweet on December 12. Both investor confidence and Travala’s position as a frontrunner in the space of crypto bookings were bolstered by this statement. At the time of writing, AVA was trading at approximately $2.51, showcasing its remarkable recovery since hitting an all-time low earlier this year. Travala Strategic Initiatives Travala has come up with a new way to handle bank reserves, which includes both AVA and Bitcoin (BTC). This change was made purposefully to strengthen its market position and urge more people to use cryptocurrencies to book travel. According to Juan Otero, CEO and co-founder of Travala, the plan shows their commitment to better customer experiences while keeping their finances strong. We invested in this crypto travel platform pre-COVID, pre-crypto winter, and held on. BUILD! https://t.co/q40IZ4xfM3 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 12, 2024 Travala is changing the way people book travel as it accepts more than 100 cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. The platform allows users to reserve hotels, flights, and activities in 230 countries, offering a wide option for visitors looking to use digital currencies. AVA And Cryptocurrency In Travel The rise in AVA’s price points to a more general trend towards digital currency integration in the travel sector than just temporary change. Platforms like Travala are likely to get rather popular as traditional travel companies become convinced of blockchain technology’s possibilities. The disclosure of their treasury reserves is expected to attract more investors looking for innovative ideas in the crypto field. Related Reading: Solana Welcomes Ethereum Prodigy – Is A Price Surge On The Horizon? Analysts, meantime, envision a great future for AVA. Forecasts indicate that should present trends continue, the altcoin might see significant increase in 2024 and beyond. Through continuous innovations and cooperative efforts with reputable travel agencies, Travala is starting to take front stage in the evolving sector of cryptocurrency travel. The significant increase in Travala’s AVA token after CZ’s endorsement exemplifies the influence of social media and prominent individuals on market dynamics. As Travala persists in innovating and broadening its services, it might potentially usher in a new epoch of travel driven by digital currency.

Here's Why Investors Are Buying These Altcoins Instead,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/will-xrp-reach-3-heres-why-investors-are-buying-these-altcoins-instead,"There is much speculation that Ripple will soon reach the $3 level after its recent rapid appreciation. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks primed for a pump as one of its holders is about to reach the White House, and the promising Rollblock ($RBLK) presale rolls out sports betting as analysts predict incredible 50x returns! Ripple ($XRP) ETF Approval In The Works? Ripple has fallen 1% to $2.44. Many Ripple investors were wiped out by the recent leveraged flush to $2.35, as open interest in the Ripple market reached unsustainable levels. Despite this, Ripple holders found themselves up an astonishing 340% in a month, as this token that many crypto analysts had written off as a “dinosaur” coin rocketed its way up the rankings to become the third-largest crypto asset. Speculation is rife that Ripple will be next in line to receive its own dedicated spot ETF fund as more S-1 applications reached the desk of the SEC recently. This would be incredibly bullish for the Ripple ecosystem, as would the rollout of the imminent RLUSD dollar-backed stablecoin launch on Ripple. Recently, Ripple whales were detected adding over $4.7 billion to their holdings. This could be enough to launch Ripple to $3 in the near term. Avalanche ($AVAX) Counts Future VP As A Fan Avalanche has recovered 9% from 10% loss in the last 24 hours to find support at $52.15. Despite this short-term “buy the dip” opportunity, Avalanche holders are still riding high after adding over 74% to the value of their holdings in just one month. Avalanche recently rolled out the Avalanche9000 upgrade, improving the usability and scaling potential of the Avalanche chain. It was recently revealed that Donald Trump’s choice of vice president, J.D. Vance, is a fan of Avalanche and has been holding the Avalanche token for some time now. This is likely to result in favorable consideration for Avalanche products going forward, ensuring a bright future for U.S.-based Avalanche holders. Rollblock ($RBLK) Delivering On DeFi Gaming Vision Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is well on the way to achieving its goal of bringing decentralized finance to the Las Vegas gaming experience. $RBLK recently reached $0.041 as investors keep on piling in. This DeFi GambleFi upstart delivers on a truly outstanding gaming platform with its promise to bring trust and transparency back to the $450 billion online gambling sector where it belongs. Rollblock offers over 7,000 classic games, from old favorites such as roulette and Monopoly to many brand-new launches such as Candyland.

This surge follows a consistent price rally, with Dogecoin achieving a remarkable 350% increase in value over recent years. The heightened demand for the crypto has raised speculation about its potential to reach the $1 mark. Dogecoin Whales Buy 160M DOGE as Price Eyes $1 Milestone According to a recent post by Ali Martinez , DOGE whales have acquired 160 million DOGE within 24 hours, boosting market sentiment. This influx of large-scale purchases coincides with Dogecoin price maintaining its upward trajectory, reinforcing optimism for further gains. The accumulation by DOGE whales comes at a critical juncture as the cryptocurrency broke through the $0.46 resistance level. Analysts view this development as a key indicator of bullish momentum, with potential price targets set at $0.50 and the previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376. If this trend continues, the Dogecoin price could advance toward the highly anticipated $1 threshold. Source: Ali Martinez MACD and RSI Indicators Highlight Bullish Momentum Technical indicators further support the bullish outlook for Dogecoin price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows signs of recovery, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line, indicating a potential bullish momentum. Additionally, the histogram displays reducing bearish strength, hinting at a possible upward move. Dogecoin’s consolidation around $0.408 suggests buyers are gaining control. Source: TradingView In addition, the RSI for Dogecoin on the 4-hour chart stands at 47.91, showing a neutral trend. The indicator is slightly below the 50 midline, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures. This consolidation phase reflects indecision in the market, with the potential for either a bullish breakout or continued sideways movement Price Pattern Suggests Potential For an 85% Rally Recent technical analysis reveals that Dogecoin price is forming a double-bottom pattern , a bullish signal often indicating a sustained upward trend. This pattern emerges when an asset’s price tests a support level twice before rebounding, creating a “W” shape on the chart. For DOGE, this pattern has solidified around the $0.37 support zone, followed by a surge past $0.46. Such formations signify decreasing selling pressure and increasing buying activity, pointing toward further gains. If the momentum continues, Dogecoin price could see an 85% rally, pushing it past its previous ATH. At press time, DOGE price was $0.4089, up 0.77% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $60.18 billion. Its 24-hour trading volume stands at $3.79 billion, down 30.05%.

It allows smart contracts on the blockchain to access real-world data, enhancing their usefulness. Chainlink ensures data accuracy through a reputation system. The LINK token rewards those who provide data and supports staking to keep the network secure. By enabling interaction between blockchains and real-world applications, Chainlink has significant potential. Conclusion Though SOL, AVAX, DOT, and LINK may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, the alpha meme coin anticipates 700% growth by presale’s end and potential thousand-fold returns.

Bloodbath on Monday and Tuesday brought market chaos, and as we approach the final weekend before the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, all eyes are on the macro stage. Earlier this week, the European Central Bank cut rates, and the U.S. is widely expected to follow with a 0.25% reduction. According to the CME Group, the likelihood of this cut is a staggering 93.4%. source : https://www.cmegroup.com/ For crypto, rate cuts should be bullish—but, as always, ""should"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. In this weekend review, we’ll focus on three different projects:= $ HBAR (ranked 18, mcap: $11.85B), a blockchain favorite of institutions, as it seems &navigating critical support levels atm. $ PEPE (ranked 21, mcap: $10.34B): the leading large-cap memecoin defying market turbulence. $ TITS (ranked 3036, mcap: $128 million): the degen’s ultimate thrill ride, now at a pivotal chart juncture. Let’s dive into the charts and see where the opportunities lie. HBAR: Testing Its Limits—Critical Levels and Next Moves Hedera’s (HBAR) performance this year has been nothing short of impressive, with a 600% rally from its lows to a yearly high of $0.392. However, after hitting an overheated RSI of 88 (weekly) and 93 (4-hour), a 40% correction has brought HBAR to a defining moment. Key Levels and Scenarios Support at $0.228 (Golden Pocket) Why It Matters: This Fibonacci retracement zone (61.8%-65%) aligns with historical volume support, offering a high-probability bounce area in bullish trends. Strategy: Enter long only if confirmed by rising volume and a bullish close above this level. Set stop-loss below $0.206. Resistance at $0.33 Why It Matters: Former double bottom breakout target, now flipped into a major resistance zone. Strategy: Look for volume-backed breakout above $0.33 to target $0.40+. Use a trailing stop to secure gains. Structural Safety at $0.185 Why It Matters: This is the last support for HBAR’s broader bullish trend. Strategy: Consider long-term accumulation if prices return here. Moving Averages in Focus (4H Chart) 50 MA ($0.307): Immediate resistance for short-term momentum. 100 MA ($0.267): Now a flipped resistance after the recent breakdown. 200 MA ($0.187): Long-term structural support (also Fib 0.786); losing this could indicate a broader trend shift. Conclusion HBAR is at a crossroads. $0.228 remains the must-hold support long-term, while $0.33 is the next breakout level to watch. Follow volume, respect levels, and let the chart guide your moves. PEPE: The Strongest Frog in the Pond The memecoin juggernaut PEPE is on a roll, recently hitting an all-time high of $0.00000284. Unlike $DOGE , which is struggling to overcome $0.50 resistance (well, even 42c atm), PEPE has shown resilience, cementing its place as the current leader in the memecoin sector. Key Levels and Scenarios Support Zones $0.0000215 (50 MA): Holding this dynamic support keeps the short-term bullish structure intact. $0.0000157–$0.0000177 (Golden Pocket): Strongest structural support, reinforced by a 4-hour Fair Value Gap (FVG). Resistance Zones $0.00000284 (ATH): Breaking this level opens the door to the bullish pennant target of $0.00000410. What PEPE Needs Volume Surge: A breakout above $0.00000284 must come with a volume spike to confirm momentum. DOGE Revival: DOGE breaking $0.50 could trigger a broader memecoin rally, lifting PEPE higher. Conclusion PEPE has the momentum, but it needs DOGE to join the party. Watch for a breakout above $0.00000284 with volume confirmation—this could push PEPE to uncharted waters. $TITS: From Drama to Potential Comeback Few memecoins live up to the drama of $TITS, which tumbled from its rising wedge only to form a bullish falling wedge. This setup has the potential to flip the narrative entirely, with a breakout signaling a rally to 32 cents or beyond (currently around 12.5c). The Fundamentals (Yes, There Are Some) Fully Circulating Supply: 999.93M tokens, eliminating fears of sudden unlocks. Community Power: Entirely driven by hype and memes, $TITS relies on its ability to keep buzz alive. Why It’s an utmost Gamble: Rug Pull Risks: Without fundamentals, the project lives and dies by momentum. Thin Volume: With just $2.37M daily trading volume, whales can easily cause chaos. Actionable Play Watch for a falling wedge breakout. If confirmed, 15 cents is the immediate target. Failure, however, could send prices back to 2 cents in no time. Conclusion $TITS is pure speculation, but the wedge breakout could deliver outsized gains for degenswilling to take the risk. Final Thoughts The crypto market is teetering on the edge of opportunity and risk as macroeconomic pressures loom. A Fed rate cut might be bullish for digital assets, but markets are rarely that simple. Liquidity remains fragile, institutional interest is cautious, and retail enthusiasm, while improving, is nowhere near 2021’s peak. For HBAR, the key is whether the Golden Pocket holds at $0.228. This level represents a crucial line in the sand for its bullish structure. For PEPE, it’s a battle of momentum versus macro. Can it maintain strength while DOGE, its sector heavyweight, continues to flounder? And for $TITS, it’s a high-stakes gamble that’s as much about timing as it is about conviction. This weekend, play with discipline: Watch the volume: Momentum needs fuel, and low participation spells traps. Respect your stops: The market doesn’t care about your hopes or your account size. Stay realistic: A rally in one coin doesn’t mean the entire market will follow. The golden rule remains: plan your trade and trade your plan. FOMO is the quickest route to tears, while patience is a trader’s best weapon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37612933,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52066,1734141605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Crypto Predictions: Dogecoin Price To Reach $10, Shiba Inu Price At $1, And ETFSwap (ETFS) Price At $22",https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-predictions-dogecoin-price-to-reach-10-shiba-inu/,"A top crypto analyst has made bold predictions confirming significant price movements for particular cryptocurrencies. According to the top crypto analyst, the Dogecoin price is projected to surge to $10, and the Shiba Inu price to $1. While this top crypto analyst predicts these bold targets for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, he also predicts a $22 target for the trending Ethereum-based project ETFSwap (ETFS), which was recently listed on Uniswap . Why You Should Invest In ETFSwap (ETFS) First According to the top crypto analyst, ETFSwap (ETFS) is predicted to surge to $22 and possibly outperform the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price, even with their impressive prospects. The top crypto analysts attribute this anticipated surge of ETFSwap (ETFS) to its recent listing on Uniswap and its groundbreaking platform, which has ties to the trillion-dollar ETF market. For context, the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform is an innovative platform designed to enable the trade of tokenized ETFs backed by actual ETF securities on-chain. As the first decentralized ETF platform, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides investors with unique advantages like 24/7 accessibility and quick conversions of ETFs, Bonds, and Futures into cryptocurrencies. With no direct competition in this market segment, ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to lead the growth of tokenized real-world assets by 2025. The platform’s launch on Uniswap coincides with what could be a significant bull run, as the platform is further expected to flourish through robust partnerships with MiCa-compliant banks that engage in trading both securities and cryptocurrencies. In addition to its ETF offerings, ETFSwap (ETFS) will provide extensive trading services for cryptocurrencies, enabling users to leverage market-making expertise and profit margins up to 10x to maximize profits. Interestingly, the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has successfully completed the KYC audit using SolidProof . The ETFS token has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , so users can now track the live price. This is a unique opportunity to buy the ETFS token while it is still affordable on Uniswap before it surges to the $22 mark. Moreover, when investors buy the ETFS token, they get the opportunity to earn an 87% APY from its staking pool. They are also entitled to AI-powered trading tools like the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which analyze several market data points and recommend the best ETFs. With these interesting features and so many incentives, ETFSwap is bound to enjoy massive traction that will potentially send its price to $22 before the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Dogecoin Price Future Outlook The Dogecoin price has been consolidating after a significant surge in November. The Dogecoin price surged by over 160% in the past month, only just recently slowing down. Although currently experiencing a downturn, some analysts anticipate a significant rally for the Dogecoin price. Some analysts are projecting that it could surge by 2,272% to reach $10 in 2025 if historical trends hold. Renowned analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin’s historical performance could serve as a guide for its future trajectory. According to his analysis, if Dogecoin follows its historical trajectory, the Dogecoin price can break past the $10 mark. Can The Shiba Inu Price Touch $1? The Shiba Inu price is currently trading at approximately $0.000025, generating significant buzz within the crypto community. The excitement stems from Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution that has contributed to a remarkable 40% increase in the Shiba Inu price over the past month. Analysts think the Shiba Inu price will keep going up, predicting a target of $0.000041 to $0.000049 by 2025. Even though these numbers show that things are getting better, reaching a $1 price is virtually impossible. According to analysts, it would require a market cap of around $589 trillion – many times larger than the global economy and Bitcoin’s current market cap. Conclusion While the Shiba Inu price and Dogecoin price are predicted to hit $1 and $10, respectively, achieving these targets may be unrealistic. Reaching such prices would require their market caps to scale into the trillions, far exceeding the current market and economic conditions. ETFSwap (ETFS) , however, presents a genuine opportunity. Its innovative ETF platform and recent Uniswap listing have positioned it for significant growth. With major exchange listings expected soon, top crypto analysts predict the ETFS token could soar to $22. So, join the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform now when the token is at an attractive price.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 02:02:05

Expert Insights",https://coinpedia.org/news/xlm-price-prediction-could-stellar-hit-2-expert-insights/,"The post XLM Price Prediction, Could Stellar Hit $2? Expert Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XLM, Stellar’s native token, is poised for notable upside momentum, as predicted by a crypto expert in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). On December 13, 2024, the expert boldly predicted that XLM could reach $2, representing nearly a 350% increase in value. Expert Predicts XLM to Surge 350% to $2 However, experts believe the recent sharp price decline is just a temporary setback on the path toward XLM reaching $2. Current Price Momentum The past few days haven’t been favorable for XLM, as it hasn’t experienced any significant price changes. However, today the token saw an impressive price surge of over 5% in the past 24 hours. With this, the XLM price has now risen to the $0.437 level. Despite the price increase, its trading volume dropped by 13% during the same period, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Data also shows that over the past 7 days, the asset is still down by 13%. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level In addition to this prediction and recent price performance, CoinPedia’s technical analysis suggests that XLM is demonstrating bullish price action on its daily timeframe. According to the XLM daily chart, it appears that the asset is forming a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and is currently consolidating near the breakout level. Source: Trading View Based on price action, if XLM breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.47 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially rise by 32% to reach the $0.63 level. Furthermore, based on the pattern, XLM could potentially surge by 537% to reach the $3.04 level in the future. On the positive side, XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has sufficient room to rise in the coming days. $118 Million of XLM Outflow from Exchanges This bullish technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, XLM’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of XLM in recent days. Over the past 10 trading days, exchanges have witnessed a substantial $117.80 million worth of XLM outflow. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency landscape, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which signals bullish sentiment for the asset.

If you weren’t among the lucky few riding the Brett wave, here’s your shot at redemption. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the best meme coin presale of the year, raising over $3.7 million in record time and captivating the crypto world. With its presale currently in its 12th stage and a stellar combination of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and community-driven initiatives, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight. Boasting an irresistible entry price of $0.00013, the coin is poised to list at $0.0006 after the presale. Early buyers are snapping up over 53 billion coins, with more than 5,000 Bulls already on board. And it’s no surprise—BTFD doesn’t just ride the meme coin frenzy; it’s creating a revolution. Brett (BRETT): A Tale of FOMO and Fortunes Launched in early 2024, Brett (BRETT) skyrocketed to fame as one of the most promising meme coins of the year. With an all-time high of $0.2342, Brett transformed countless early adopters into overnight millionaires. However, its price of $0.1749 today tells a story of missed chances for those who hesitated. What made Brett so popular? Its seamless integration into the Base Chain ecosystem, unique branding, and early listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase propelled it to stardom. Yet, like many meme coins, Brett wasn’t without its hiccups. Concerns over insider supply and market corrections made headlines, reminding us how volatile and rewarding this sector can be. But here’s the kicker—history is repeating itself, and this time, it’s wearing BTFD Coin’s bull horns. If you missed out on Brett’s meteoric rise, you don’t have to be on the sidelines anymore.

Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, that $1,000 could become a whopping $4,615—a 361% return on investment. And it’s not just about returns. BTFD Coin offers unparalleled accessibility: 1 Ethereum buys 30,113,000 BTFD coins 1 Solana buys 1,739,846 BTFD coins 1 Bitcoin buys 769,053,846 BTFD coins Staking and Play-to-Earn Excitement The P2E game’s beta is now live, featuring the iconic Bulls Squad.

That’s just icing on the cake. Referral Programme: Double the Fun, Double the Gains BTFD Coin’s referral programme is a game-changer, rewarding not just buyers but community builders.

The AI-driven model has forecasted that SHIB could climb approximately 21.9% to $0.000035 by Christmas Day. This projection has stirred excitement among SHIB enthusiasts, especially as the token currently trades at $0.00002869, marking a slight 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT’s Christmas Price Prediction for SHIB When asked about SHIB’s potential during the festive period, ChatGPT shared its bullish outlook: “Given current market dynamics, SHIB has the potential to climb to $0.000035 by December 25. This estimate reflects a 21.9% increase from its current price, buoyed by ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.” This optimistic projection aligns with the holiday spirit, as the Shiba Inu team rolls out strategic initiatives to bolster the token’s utility and user engagement. Holiday Cheer from the Shiba Inu Team One of the primary factors underpinning ChatGPT’s prediction is the Shiba Inu development team’s latest collaboration with K9 Finance . Together, they have announced a reward initiative aimed at increasing participation in Shibarium’s liquid staking feature. This program, timed strategically for the holiday season, seeks to incentivize first-time users, thereby driving more engagement and transaction volume within the ecosystem. The initiative underscores the team’s commitment to expanding the Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain, a crucial element of Shiba Inu’s roadmap. By offering financial rewards for staking, the team aims to attract retail and institutional participants, further strengthening SHIB’s position as a multi-functional asset rather than just a meme coin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Factors Supporting SHIB’s Rise Growing Ecosystem: Shibarium continues to gain traction as developers integrate more decentralized applications (dApps) and enhance its functionality. The staking reward initiative could accelerate this adoption, creating a positive feedback loop for SHIB’s utility and value. Holiday Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies often see heightened trading activity during the holiday season, as retail investors look to capitalize on end-of-year market trends. This seasonal bullishness could provide additional momentum for SHIB. Broader Market Recovery: With Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing positive price movements, the overall crypto market sentiment appears to be shifting towards optimism. Altcoins like SHIB typically benefit from such trends, as investors diversify into smaller-cap assets with high growth potential. ChatGPT’s 21.9% SHIB rally prediction is not just wishful thinking but backed by tangible developments and market sentiment. The Shiba Inu team’s focus on innovation and the holiday-themed incentive program, positions SHIB for a potential breakout.

The analyst has grounded his bullish projection on Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands (BB), highlighting that these indicators are expanding while BTC displays a similar price action observed in 2023. BTC Price Targets $120,000 ATH On December 12, Severino shared a chart demonstrating a technical analysis of Bitcoin using the Bollinger Bands and a historical correlation of late 2023 price behavior. The analyst predicted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could reach a $120,000 all-time high by next week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green Severino disclosed that Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands are expanding, while its current price action reflects a similar bullish trend observed in 2023. Looking at the analyst’s 2024 price chart, Bitcoin’s upper and lower Bollinger Bands are represented by a respective red and green trend line. Typically, an expanding Bollinger Band indicates increasing price volatility. Bitcoin could start a bullish trend if it breaks above the upper band or enter a bearish phase if it drops below the lower band. Bitcoin has also tested the lower Bollinger Band at $92,560 and is now steadily approaching the upper band at $102,323. Additionally, the analyst has placed Bitcoin’s Bollinger Band basis at $97,442. Severino observed that the Bitcoin price chart on the right shows a historical instance in late 2023 when BTC broke above the upper Bollinger band and followed with a substantial price rally as it walked the bands higher. This historical trend is currently being replicated in Bitcoin’s 2024 price setup, indicating a potential for a significant upward price movement if similar conditions seen in 2023 are met. If Bitcoin’s price closes above the upper Bollinger Band with a buy signal, it could spark a rally toward $120,000. Currently trading at $100,219, Bitcoin would need to increase by 20% to reach the analyst’s projected target by next week. Analyst Confirms Bitcoin Bollinger Band Bullish Signal Also commenting on Bitcoin’s recent price action, Trader Tardigrade, an analyst on X, revealed that BTC’s Bollinger Bands and Bollinger Band Width (BBW) are signaling the potential for a strong uptrend continuation. Sharing a price chart, the analyst noted that Bitcoin previously dipped to the middle of the band but quickly recovered, underscoring the supportive nature of the mid-band. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything Trader Tardigrade has revealed that Bitcoin’s BBW has hit a lower contraction, while its recent price movements resemble those of early November, just before its price skyrocketed from $70,000 to $100,000. If Bitcoin’s price maintains its current bullish trend, the analyst predicts a surge that could drive the cryptocurrency to a new all-time high at $136,000. This substantial price increase would represent a massive 36% rally from Bitcoin’s current price.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 03:25:00

At one end of the spectrum is Bonk, a meme-inspired coin that thrives on community engagement and viral momentum. On the other side stands Lightchain AI ($LCAI) , a revolutionary token that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to address real-world challenges. Don’t miss out on the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this groundbreaking project. In this article, we’ll compare Bonk and Lightchain AI, examining their core features, unique value propositions, and potential in the constantly evolving crypto market. Discover how meme coins measure up against innovation-driven tokens in today’s competitive landscape. Bonk: A Meme Coin with Community Appeal Bonk burst onto the scene as a dog-themed cryptocurrency designed to capture the attention of meme enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk leans heavily on its community for growth and adoption. Key Features of Bonk: Community-Driven Growth: Bonk’s strength lies in its loyal community, which drives engagement through social media campaigns, memes, and word-of-mouth. Low Entry Barrier: Like many meme coins, Bonk’s low price and minimal technical requirements make it accessible to novice investors. Entertainment and Virality: Bonk’s lighthearted branding and focus on fun have helped it carve a niche in the meme coin space. Challenges: Lack of Utility: Bonk’s value is largely speculative, with little real-world application to sustain long-term growth. High Volatility: Meme coins like Bonk are subject to rapid price fluctuations driven by social sentiment rather than intrinsic value. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence In stark contrast to Bonk, Lightchain AI is a tech-driven token that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver real-world solutions. Its focus on innovation and utility sets it apart in a market often crowded with speculative projects. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s unique consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization. This creates a system where network security directly contributes to advancements in AI. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM serves as a dedicated computational layer for executing AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. From predictive analytics to real-time decision-making, AIVM expands the scope of decentralized applications (dApps). Real-World Applications: Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance by integrating blockchain transparency with AI’s computational power. Eco-Friendly Design: By prioritizing meaningful computations, Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism reduces energy consumption compared to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Decentralized Governance: $LCAI token holders actively shape the ecosystem’s future, ensuring transparency and community-driven innovation. Comparing Bonk and Lightchain AI 1. Utility: Bonk: Bonk’s primary utility lies in its role as a meme coin. Its appeal is more about entertainment and community engagement than solving real-world problems. Lightchain AI: $LCAI stands out for its tangible utility, addressing real-world challenges through AI-driven solutions and decentralized technology. 2. Technology: Bonk: Bonk operates on a basic blockchain infrastructure with no unique technological innovations. Lightchain AI: Lightchain AI’s PoI and AIVM represent cutting-edge advancements in blockchain and AI integration, positioning it as a leader in decentralized intelligence. 3. Market Potential: Bonk: While Bonk’s virality can lead to short-term gains, its long-term sustainability is questionable without a clear use case. Lightchain AI: With applications in high-demand industries and a focus on sustainability, Lightchain AI has significant growth potential and long-term viability. 4. Investor Appeal: Bonk: Bonk appeals to risk-tolerant investors looking for quick, speculative gains. Lightchain AI: $LCAI attracts investors seeking innovation, utility, and long-term value. Real-World Applications: Bonk vs. Lightchain AI Bonk’s Applications: Community Engagement: Bonk’s primary application is fostering a sense of community and entertainment through memes and social campaigns. Lightchain AI’s Applications: Healthcare: AI-driven diagnostics and predictive modeling transform patient care, making processes more efficient and accurate. Supply Chain: Blockchain transparency combined with AI-powered insights ensures efficient inventory management and logistics. Finance: Smarter risk assessment, fraud detection, and DeFi applications are enabled by $LCAI’s technology. Risks and Challenges Bonk: Volatility: Like other meme coins, Bonk’s value is highly volatile and susceptible to market sentiment. Sustainability: Without a clear use case, Bonk’s long-term viability remains uncertain. Lightchain AI: Market Awareness: Educating industries and investors about $LCAI’s value proposition is critical for adoption. Competition: As blockchain and AI integration gains traction, Lightchain AI must stay ahead through continuous innovation. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out While meme coins like Bonk have their place in the crypto world, Lightchain AI’s focus on solving real-world problems gives it a distinct advantage. Its unique features—such as PoI, AIVM, and real-world applications—make it a compelling choice for investors and enterprises alike. Final Thoughts Bonk and Lightchain AI represent two vastly different approaches to cryptocurrency. Bonk thrives on community engagement and meme culture, offering short-term excitement and speculative opportunities. In contrast, Lightchain AI focuses on innovation, utility, and long-term value, addressing real-world challenges with cutting-edge technology. For investors seeking sustainable growth and meaningful contributions to the blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI emerges as the clear choice. While Bonk’s appeal lies in its entertainment value, $LCAI offers a vision of blockchain’s future—one that combines transparency, scalability, and the transformative power of artificial intelligence.

Market Challenges The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a sharp downturn, wiping out over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions across nearly 584,000 traders. XRP was among the hardest-hit assets, particularly on Coinbase, where it suffered one of the steepest selloffs. The altcoin’s value declined by 14.87% on Monday, closing near the $2 price level. Despite these setbacks, the asset has demonstrated resilience, maintaining investor interest and optimism. This resilience is a key factor behind the confidence in the token’s long-term potential. Digital G, a former regulated fund manager in the U.K., recently highlighted XRP’s potential as an unparalleled opportunity for investors seeking to build generational wealth. He identified the token alongside Stellar (XLM) and XDC Network (XDC) as cryptocurrencies with significant potential for future growth. Linda P. Jones, a Wall Street analyst and author, has strongly supported XRP and XLM’s wealth-building potential. Jones, known for her expertise in wealth management, emphasized this view in her book, 3 Steps to Quantum Wealth . According to Jones, these digital assets offer life-changing returns on investments and could transform the financial landscape. I agree with this statement so much, I wrote a book about them and the life changing wealth building opportunity. #xrp #xlm #xdc https://t.co/yuULOtvc2B — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 9, 2024 Addressing Real-World Financial Challenges The appeal of XRP, XLM, and XDC lies in their ability to address critical challenges in the global financial system. These cryptocurrencies focus on improving cross-border payments and enabling efficient, low-cost, and scalable financial transactions. Partnerships with banks, governments, and financial institutions further strengthen their ecosystems, highlighting their real-world applicability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While these tokens faced underwhelming performance in previous years, recent developments and market activity have reignited interest. XRP, for instance, has seen a remarkable 303% increase since November. Similarly, XLM has surged by 448%, and XDC has recorded a 175% rise during the same period. Expert Price Predictions The impressive performance of these assets has led to optimistic forecasts from market analysts. EGRAG, a well-known analyst, recently compared the token’s price movement to Tesla’s 2018 growth pattern, suggesting a potential 50% decline before a significant rally of over 3,500%, potentially driving its price beyond $40. Other projections include a bullish outlook for XLM, with analyst, Charting Guy, identifying a pattern that could lead to a price target of $5. Meanwhile, Javon Marks has set a breakout target of $0.1814 for XDC based on its technical charting structure. The digital asset’s resilience and potential, alongside similar assets like XLM and XDC, continue to attract attention from financial experts and investors alike. As these tokens grow to solve real-world financial challenges, they are positioned to deliver significant long-term value. These developments make XRP, in particular, a great investment option for those seeking transformative wealth-building opportunities.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/10-trillion-shib-in-24-hours-heres-what-happened/,"Recent data reveals that over 10 trillion Shiba Inu tokens were transacted within 24 hours, primarily driven by whale activity. While the figure appears substantial, it falls short of historical transaction volumes during SHIB’s peak growth phases. This raises questions about the current state of the asset’s market momentum and its prospects for recovery or growth. Comparing Current Volumes to Historical Peaks In previous bullish cycles, Shiba Inu saw transaction volumes significantly surpassing 18 trillion tokens, particularly during rapid price increases. Such heightened activity often indicated strong interest from large holders and a robust market trend. By contrast, transaction volumes during bearish periods tended to dip below 10 trillion tokens, reflecting reduced enthusiasm and lower market engagement. The current figure of 10 trillion tokens places the asset above bearish thresholds but still far from the volume levels that typically signal a strong bullish trend. This subdued activity indicates that the market is neither experiencing significant accumulation nor facing aggressive selling pressure. Price and Support Analysis Chart data shows SHIB hovering near a key support level, with its recent rebound from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) providing a sign of attempted recovery. However, the current transaction volumes do not align with the levels of market participation needed to sustain a prolonged uptrend. This disparity between price action and trading activity suggests limited momentum, leaving the asset in a state of consolidation. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity According to analytics from IntoTheBlock , high transaction volumes are often a precursor to notable market movements, reflecting heightened activity from major stakeholders. However, the present volume does not display the clear patterns of accumulation or distribution that typically precede significant price swings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This moderate activity indicates that the token may be at a critical juncture. A sharp increase in transaction volumes, particularly from whales, would be required to generate the momentum necessary for a bullish breakout. Until such a catalyst emerges, the token will remain in a consolidation phase. Although 10 trillion SHIB tokens were exchanged in a single day, this figure lacks the significance to signal a decisive market shift. The transaction volumes remain well below historical peaks, reflecting a lack of strong bullish sentiment. For SHIB to regain its former upward trajectory, renewed interest, and significantly higher trading volumes will be essential. Until then, market participants may need to exercise patience as the asset waits for a more definitive catalyst to drive its next major move.

37616938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52113,1734149729,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin vs. Gold: Which One Is the Better Choice in 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-vs-gold-which-one-is-the-better-choice-in-2025/,"In this decade, Bitcoin outperformed gold-the prior reigning champion of safe-haven investments. Where gold was conventionally used to hedge against economic downturns, Bitcoin has had such an incredible run that it attracted both retail and institutional investors into its fold. At the same time, some critics labeled Bitcoin a speculative bubble. Still, the constant growth and ever-growing utility told a different story. Perform secure and fast transactions of BTC to USDT via the well-known cryptocurrency exchange platform, Exolix. Why Bitcoin is Better than Gold 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity While it creates a deflationary asset with its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin provides some degree of predictability in supply and a store of value. In contrast to gold, which can be mined, or fiat currencies, which are printed and affected by inflation, the supply of Bitcoin is hardcoded. Thus, scarcity in itself fosters demand; investors popularly regard it as “digital gold” for the modern age. 2. Institutional Adoption and Credibility Large companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets to illustrate digital currency’s role as a store of value. Further, giants in payments like Visa and PayPal have onboarded Bitcoin into their systems, making it more mainstream at large. Unlike other bubbles, Bitcoin developed some legitimacy as a financial asset because it was being taken up in more and more industries. Increased institutional interest has led to stronger market infrastructure that provides greater long-term stability for reduced volatility. 3. Hedge Against Inflation With governments printing trillions of dollars to curb economic crises, fears of inflation have rocketed. Bitcoin emerged as a hedge, but with a difference from gold: it is digital and borderless, thus even more versatile in a borderless economy. Investors seeking protection from the devaluation of fiat currencies have sought shelter in Bitcoin as a safe alternative increasingly. 4. Global Accessibility and Liquidity By design, Bitcoin is decentralized, and thus it can be accessed and sent essentially anywhere in the world without any of the constraints of physicality. Unlike gold, which is expensive to store and transfer, Bitcoin has unparalleled efficiency in terms of liquidity. Its borderless nature facilitates instant transactions. That makes it a plausible option for storing and sending wealth. So Why Is Bitcoin Not a Bubble? 1. Expanding Infrastructure Unlike other traditional bubbles, the value of Bitcoin is underpinned by an ever-growing ecosystem. Blockchain technology allows for secure, decentralized transactions; and platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken make access to buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin very easy. This growing infrastructure helps Bitcoin fulfill both roles of store of value and medium of exchange and thus secures its viability in the long term. 2. Real-World Use Cases But Bitcoin is much more than a speculative asset, with actual use cases in the real world. From cross-border payments to remittances, Bitcoin has become a lifeline for countries like Venezuela and Argentina facing hyperinflation or economic instability. In that aspect, the capability to shelter one’s wealth and transact is a distinguishing feature from other classic speculative bubbles. 3. Market Maturity In the last few years, the Bitcoin market has matured with increased institutional involvement and the development of financial instruments such as Bitcoin futures and ETFs. This has contributed to decreased volatility and a more diverse investor base. Unlike early speculative periods driven by retail hype, today’s market is supported by structured financial products and a mature investor base. 4. Regulatory Progress The governments of the day are working to develop regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies. Although varied by region, regulation, of a sort, means growing acceptance and a path to legitimacy for Bitcoin. Clearer rules also reduce fraud risk and encourage institutional participation, further stabilizing the market. Bitcoin’s in a Changing Financial Industry The utility of Bitcoin extends beyond being a speculative asset. It has proven to be a strong tool for financial inclusion, opening up global markets to underserved citizens of the world. Its decentralized nature rhymes with the growing demand for financial systems free from traditional gatekeepers. Therefore, for those who want to double their Bitcoin or move towards more stable currencies such as USDT, tools like BTC to USDT at Exolix offer secure, as well as efficient, means toward your goals. Bitcoin as a Transformative Asset Bitcoin’s rise to outperform gold underlines its transformation into a leading financial asset. With its capped supply, institutional support, hedging against inflation, and global accessibility, Bitcoin is anything but a speculative bubble. It represents a paradigm shift in how value is stored and transferred in a digital age. As the infrastructure for Bitcoin expands and adoption continues to grow, it is positioned to be a cornerstone in the financial landscape for years to come. For secure and seamless Bitcoin transactions, turn to trusted platforms like Exolix for BTC to USDT swaps and other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Whether you are an experienced trader or a newcomer to the space, identifying the best coins to buy and hold for the short term requires careful research and analysis. In this article, we will examine four standout options that present potential for quick gains: Qubetics ($TICS) , Arweave, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA), and Ondo. Each of these projects offers unique features and promising growth trajectories, positioning them as key contenders in the current market. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Leading the Web3 Revolution Qubetics has positioned itself as a transformative force in the blockchain world. With its 12th-stage presale already amassing over $5.9 million and more than 318 million tokens sold, Qubetics is rewriting the rules of crypto adoption. At just $0.0311 per token, the current price offers a golden opportunity for investors aiming for substantial short-term returns. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a stunning 703.21% ROI, with long-term prospects soaring even higher. What makes Qubetics a standout is its innovative multichain wallet . Picture this: a tech startup in New York is juggling assets across multiple blockchains. With Qubetics, they can seamlessly manage everything from one interface, saving time and reducing operational headaches. For individuals, the wallet offers unparalleled ease of use—whether you’re trading on the go or securing your assets with advanced encryption. Let’s crunch the numbers. A $8,500 investment at $0.0311 gets you 273,922 tokens. If $TICS hits $0.25, your investment skyrockets to $68,480. That’s the kind of short-term gain that’s hard to ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? With its visionary approach, robust ROI predictions, and practical tools like the multichain wallet, Qubetics is undeniably one of the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 2. Arweave: The Perpetual Storage Pioneer Arweave stands out in the blockchain space with its unique focus on decentralised permanent storage. At a time when data security and immutability are critical, Arweave’s “permaweb” technology offers a revolutionary solution. This project is particularly attractive for content creators, businesses, and institutions seeking to store data forever without recurring fees. Currently trading under $10, Arweave’s AR token has been tipped by analysts to rally to $25 in the coming months, driven by increased adoption and strategic partnerships. Its seamless integration with blockchains like Solana further boosts its credibility and utility. Why did this coin make it to this list? Arweave’s innovative use case, growing market demand, and significant short-term price potential make it one of the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 3. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA): A Visionary Leap Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) brings together blockchain and artificial intelligence in a partnership aimed at solving real-world problems. With AI becoming a cornerstone of modern technology, ASIA’s mission to decentralise and democratise AI development puts it on the map as a project with immense potential. Currently, ASIA’s token has shown impressive growth in adoption within tech-savvy communities. Projections indicate a near 200% gain in the coming quarter, as businesses and developers increasingly turn to decentralised AI platforms for innovation. Why did this coin make it to this list? ASIA’s unique value proposition in integrating AI with blockchain makes it a frontrunner among the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 4. Ondo: The DeFi Innovator Ondo is redefining decentralised finance (DeFi) with a focus on structured investment products. It offers opportunities for both conservative and risk-loving investors, making it an accessible gateway into DeFi. Ondo’s products include fixed-income instruments, which appeal to those seeking stability in the often volatile crypto market. With its ONDO token trading at modest levels, analysts predict a 150% increase within the next six months, fuelled by growing interest in DeFi and Ondo’s strong user base. Its emphasis on transparency and security has earned it a reputation as a reliable platform for both individual and institutional investors. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Bitcoin Open Interest & Leverage Ratio Have Shot Up As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has registered a sharp increase alongside the asset’s return above the $100,000 level. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Above $100,000 As Monthly Inflows Hit $80 Billion Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past month: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a sharp positive change recently, which implies a large number of positions have popped up on the market. In the chart, Maartunn has highlighted the previous instances of the indicator observing a large percentage increase. It would appear that the price generally saw a cooldown when this pattern formed during the past month. As for the reason behind this trend, the answer is that more positions usually imply the presence of a higher amount of leverage in the sector. A chaotic event known as a squeeze can become more likely to occur in these circumstances. During a squeeze, a large number of positions are liquidated at once and provide fuel to the price move that caused them. The elongated price move then unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. A squeeze can be more probable to affect the side of the market that has the more leveraged positions. The previous increases in the Open Interest came alongside uptrends, so the new positions were likely long ones. This may be why the market ended up seeing a long squeeze to wipe out these excess positions. It’s possible that the latest Open Interest increase could also lead to a similar outcome for Bitcoin, since these fresh positions have also come alongside a rally. It all depends, however, on whether these positions are overleveraged or not. Unfortunately for the cryptocurrency, this requirement also seems to be fulfilled, as data for the Estimated Leverage Ratio shared by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post suggests. The Estimated Leverage Ratio tells us, as its name implies, the average amount of leverage that the users on the derivatives market are opting for. Given that this metric has also spiked alongside the Open Interest increase, the new positions that have appeared could be carrying significant leverage.

The cryptocurrency has recently experienced remarkable growth, setting the stage for a bullish outlook. In November 2024, the token surged by 283%, its most significant monthly increase in seven years. The positive momentum has continued into December, with a 26.4% gain recorded in the first 12 days. Drawing comparisons to XRP’s performance in 2017, EGRAG suggests the current market behavior could lead to milestones at $6 and $27. $6 and $27 XRP Price Targets Explained EGRAG’s predictions are based on Fibonacci retracement levels and historical price patterns. He highlighted parallels between XRP’s 2017 cycle and its ongoing rally. In March 2017, it gained 150% from a critical support level, which the analyst named the Purple Foundation. This initial move was followed by an extraordinary 1,330% rally two months later in May 2017. EGRAG believes the cryptocurrency is poised to replicate a similar trajectory. His analysis points to an immediate target zone between $4.3 and $6.4, corresponding to Fibonacci retracement levels of 1.414 and 1.618. He anticipates this could be achieved by the end of December 2024. Looking ahead to January 2025, EGRAG predicts a larger surge, potentially mirroring the 1,330% rally observed in 2017. This would place the asset in a secondary gold region, which spans prices between $13.7 and $27.3, aligning with another significant retracement zone. Addressing XRP Market Cap Concerns Skepticism surrounding these ambitious price targets often revolves around XRP’s market cap and liquidity requirements. EGRAG addressed these concerns by comparing the cryptocurrency market’s total valuation in 2017 and 2024. In May 2017, the total cryptocurrency market cap (TMC) was $60 billion. By December 2024, this figure had grown to $3.7 trillion, representing a 61-fold increase. Applying this multiplier to XRP’s 2017 market cap of $15 billion would result in a potential valuation of $900 billion for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP to achieve this, it would need to command a market share of 9% to 18%, depending on whether the TMC grows to $5 trillion or $10 trillion. According to EGRAG, such dominance is feasible given the asset’s established use cases, particularly in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously projected the TMC could reach $5 trillion in the near future. Currently, the token is priced at $2.34, with a market cap of $133 billion and a dominance of 3.59%. If it regains its 2017 peak dominance of 31%, its market cap could exceed $1 trillion. These projections underscore the potential for significant growth, provided the token maintains its current momentum and market relevance. EGRAG’s analysis draws attention to XRP’s strong performance and potential to achieve substantial gains in the coming months. By leveraging historical patterns and technical indicators, the analyst has outlined a roadmap for the token to reach $6 and potentially $27. While challenges remain, the token’s role in global payments and the expanding cryptocurrency market make these targets worth monitoring.

The market is still in the midst of a larger upward trend, potentially forming a third wave in an Elliott Wave structure. However, an internal correction seems to be occurring, which is not fully visible on the broader time frame. XRP is currently positioned between the all-time high and the 2021 breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.47 and is up by more than five percent in the last 24 hours. A key level to watch is the $2.48–$2.49 range. A break above this level could signal a move higher. A sustained breakout above the price channel would suggest that XRP may target $2.76 or even higher. Key Support and Resistance Levels From a technical perspective, XRP’s key support levels are between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as prices hold above this range, there could be further upside. On the resistance side, the $3.23–$3.30 range, which includes the all-time high, is important. Longer-term, there is potential for XRP to reach $5–$10, but this could occur during either the third or fifth wave of the larger cycle. The overall trend remains upward, and close attention is being paid to any signs of additional upward momentum. Risk Factors to Consider The main risk areas lie between $1.50 and $1.79. There’s a chance XRP could stay above the 2021 high, avoiding a deep pullback. Instead, the price might experience a sideways correction. If the price moves higher, support levels will shift upward along with the price. Looking at the Shorter Time Frame On the smaller time frame, XRP is attempting to break out of its current price channel, though the breakout has not yet been confirmed.

With time running out on the congressional calendar, the delay could lead to big changes at the SEC. What caused this holdup, and what happens if her term ends? The Vote That Didn’t Happen The committee was supposed to vote on December 11, 2024, to decide whether Crenshaw would get another term. But at the last minute, Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee’s chair, called off the meeting. No real explanation was given. When Brown tried to reschedule for later that day, Republicans blocked the effort. Now, there’s not much time left. If Congress doesn’t act soon, Crenshaw’s term will expire, leaving the SEC with just three commissioners. All of them would be Republicans. This could change how the SEC approaches major issues, especially in cryptocurrency regulation. Crypto Isn’t a Fan One reason Crenshaw’s renomination is getting pushback is her stance on crypto. Many in the i ndustry are unhappy with her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs and what they see as her tough approach to regulation. The CEO of famous crypto exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, has urged senators to block her renomination calling her a “ failure of an SEC Commissioner ”. Source : X.com This isn’t just about Crenshaw, though. It’s part of a bigger battle between the SEC and the crypto world. Crypto leaders want less oversight, and with Crenshaw gone, they might get it. Politics Are in the Mix This delay isn’t just about policy or crypto, though. Politics are playing a big role. Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s top Republican, accused Democrats of rushing Biden’s nominees before President-elect Trump takes office. He called it a “last-minute effort” to stop Trump from shaping the SEC. Donald Trump could appoint someone else if Crenshaw’s renomination does not move forward. Names of other candidates for this position are already being floated. One name being in the highlights is Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner. He is well known for crypto friendly views. Such a shift would likely lead to a more business-friendly SEC, especially when it comes to crypto. What Happens Next? The committee needs to reschedule the vote, but with the congressional session wrapping up soon, time isn’t on Crenshaw’s side. With the expiration of her term, the SEC’s balance of power will shift immediately. That means a new commissioner could step in as early as January 2025. All this fuzz is not just about Crenshaw or her being the commission of SEC. It’s more about the future of the SEC and how it handles emerging industries like crypto. The stakes are very high as the decisions made will pave the path for many years to come.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 04:49:00

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 05:06:48

The price recently hit a new ATH at $0.4245 and this breakout comes after the price passed key resistance levels. VLO’s price had recently traded above the $0.1722 resistance on December 6th but pulled back. On December 10th, the market printed a higher low and has now broken out once again. Velodrome is part of the Optimism network, aimed at making transactions faster and more efficient. The recent surge in Velodrome’s price came after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, listed its token with a seed tag. This listing exposes Velodrome to millions of Binance users. Even more exciting, its fork, Aerodrome, just secured over $20 million from Coinbase Ventures, straight from the open market. With big money backing it, VELO is rapidly gaining attention. What’s Next For VELO? Analyst Louie said that Velodrome is performing well, but with its price entering new territory, it’s unclear when or where it will peak. The analyst spotted a similar price pattern in PEPE before its big breakout, which helped identify the current movement. In PEPE’s case, the price hit resistance at the 2.618 Fibonacci level, marking its all-time high after just two weeks of breakout. If Velodrome follows a similar pattern, the 2.618 level could be a short-to-mid-term target. In the past, cryptocurrencies often saw a price spike when major exchanges list them, but these gains are usually short-lived as the excitement fades. However, with the start of the altcoin season approaching, Velodrome, like Aerodrome, is positioned to benefit from the market’s growing interest in altcoins. Velodrome is a coin with real-world utility, and as more investors look toward altcoins, it could see significant gains.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 05:07:27

37618953,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52119,1734153298,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Why NYDFS RLUSD Approval Is A Big Deal For Ripple and XRP,https://timestabloid.com/heres-why-nydfs-rlusd-approval-is-a-big-deal-for-ripple-and-xrp/,"Vincent Van Code, a prominent crypto figure, recently emphasized the significance of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approving RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. The crypto community has been anticipating this approval for weeks and was the final step delaying the stablecoin’s launch. In a post on X, Van Code described it as “one of the biggest things that has happened in crypto,” noting that RLUSD is the first token classified as a regulated financial instrument, or “bank-grade.” This sets it apart from other stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Implicit Recognition of XRPL and Ethereum The NYDFS approval of RLUSD carries broader implications for the ecosystems supporting it. Van Code highlighted that this approval indirectly validates the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchains, which host RLUSD, as suitable platforms for financial-grade operations. While these blockchains are not officially certified as banking grade, the approval signifies their capability to meet rigorous regulatory standards, as they meet the technical and security requirements necessary to host a regulated financial instrument. Key operational features of XRPL and Ethereum, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency, align with the stringent standards of financial regulators. Furthermore, NYDFS oversight ensures that the platforms can support compliance needs, including real-time audits and reserve tracking. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why RLUSD Is Bank-Grade, but Blockchains Are Not While the NYDFS approval highlights the viability of XRPL and Ethereum for hosting regulated assets, it does not formally certify the blockchains themselves as banking grade. Van Code explained that the approval applies specifically to RLUSD under U.S. banking laws, rather than the broader suitability of the underlying blockchains for core banking functions. Van Code noted that for a blockchain to be classified as banking grade, it would require explicit recognition by major banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve or the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Additionally, it would need to demonstrate widespread adoption for critical banking services like lending or central clearing. A Significant Moment for the XRP Ledger While RLUSD is revolutionary for many reasons, Van Code emphasized that the NYDFS approval of RLUSD is a milestone that signals the growing maturity of blockchain technology. In another post , he explained that this could be significant for the XRPL, as Ripple launched RLUSD on the Ethereum network to funnel people into the XRPL ecosystem. Launching on the Ethereum network allows exchanges that don’t support XRPL tokens to list RLUSD at launch, while the XRPL provides a cheaper and faster alternative to draw investors toward it.

The company, led by Michael Saylor, is set to join the prestigious Nasdaq-100 index, which includes big names like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. This has created excitement among investors and could push Bitcoin to new ATH soon. Why MicroStrategy’s Inclusion Matters MicroStrategy’s entry into the Nasdaq-100 is a big deal. The index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, and MicroStrategy’s rapid growth this year secured its place. With a market value of $92 billion as of November, the company is expected to hold a 0.47% weighting in the index. This move means funds tracking the Nasdaq-100, such as the $300 billion Invesco QQQ ETF, will indirectly hold Bitcoin through MicroStrategy’s investments. The company currently owns around 423,650 Bitcoin , worth over $42 billion, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. Bitcoin’s Rising Popularity Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time, fueled by hopes of regulatory changes under President-elect Donald Trump. MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin purchases , even at high prices, show the company’s confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Analysts say MicroStrategy remains comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95,000 to $100,000 range. Speculation On MicroStrategy’s Sustainability While this is a significant milestone, some experts believe MicroStrategy’s stay in the Nasdaq-100 could be temporary. Since most of its value comes from Bitcoin rather than its core business, it might eventually be classified as a financial company. Founder Michael Saylor has also hinted at transforming MicroStrategy into a “Bitcoin bank,” which could change its status further. For now, though, this inclusion is seen as a major milestone, further intertwining the world of cryptocurrencies with mainstream financial markets. As ETFs like SPY and QQQ align themselves with this shift, millions of investors may gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin, adding momentum to its broader adoption.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 05:44:08

The exchange operator said on Friday, after a meteoric surge in the shares of the Bitcoin buyer. According to Nasdaq, the change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23. Being added to the index usually drives up the stock’s price, as exchange-traded funds aiming to mirror the index’s performance purchase shares of the newly included company. According to a statement released by Nasdaq on December 13, MicroStrategy is one of three companies to join the index, alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON). However, Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer, and vaccine maker Moderna were removed. MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq-100 as Bitcoin bet drives $94B surge MSTR now ranks among Nasdaq’s top 100 stocks by market cap. The aggressive investor in the world’s largest crypto asset has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion. MicroStrategy, a software company, began buying and holding Bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the most significant corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have stated that MicroStrategy’s choice to acquire BTC to safeguard the value of its reserve assets has increased the attractiveness of its stock, which generally tracks the cryptocurrency’s performance. Bernstein analysts predict that the market will likely focus on MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the S&P 500 in 2025 after its addition to the Nasdaq-100. The brokerage also believes the company’s outlook will continue improving next year as it anticipates “greater visibility and recognition beyond new ETF inflows.” Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks as the election of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump boosted the crypto sector’s optimism about reduced regulatory obstacles. Earlier this month, the digital asset soared above $100,000 for the first time. Bernstein analysts noted that management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and is comfortable buying the asset in the $95K-$100K range. The crypto industry reacts as MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq inclusion sparks optimism MicroStrategy held roughly 423,650 Bitcoins acquired for about $25.6 billion, based on the average purchase price as of Dec. 8. Based on Bitcoin’s previous close, the investment is worth around $42.4 billion. Crypto analyst Will Clemente shared his thoughts in a December 13 post on X, saying: Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure. — Will (@WClementeIII) December 14, 2024 Jeff Park , head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, commented that the trade of the decade is just getting started and advised to buckle up.

This surge in interest saw crypto products surpass $35 billion in net inflows since January, underscoring Bitcoin’s growing appeal and dominance in the financial world. Riot Platforms has made a strategic move to expand its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 5,117 BTC for $510 million. This purchase was funded through the company’s recent $525 million convertible bond issuance, which carried a 0.75% interest rate and matures in 2030. After deducting expenses, Riot secured $511.5 million in net proceeds, strategically deploying these funds to purchase Bitcoin at an average price of $99,669 per coin, including fees. With the net proceeds from Riot’s recent $525 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 5,117 BTC at an average price of $99,669 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses.

This positions Riot as a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, reinforcing its commitment to scaling operations and capitalizing on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Institutions are driving Bitcoin adoption to new heights! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how this trend could impact future prices. Market Optimism Drives Bitcoin Surge Bitcoin’s recent rally, crossing the $100,000 milestone , reflects heightened market optimism. Key drivers include macroeconomic factors such as the potential for a 25 basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has a 96% probability according to CME Group data. Plus, the possibility of favorable crypto policies under a new Trump administration has further boosted sentiment. Analysts Eye a Bullish Period Ahead The broader market outlook for Bitcoin remains highly optimistic. Analysts predict a potential price target of $160,000 by 2025, driven by increasing adoption, institutional interest, and Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Riot’s well-timed acquisition aligns with these projections, placing the company in a strong position to benefit from future price increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Mining Giants Follow MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, but at What Cost? , Riot’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation highlights its confidence in the asset’s long-term value and its role in the present market scenario.

In this context, a CryptoQuant analysis highlights a key BTC metric that can serve as a valuable tool for crafting an exit strategy. Have Profits In Bitcoin? Keep An Eye On This Indicator In a Quicktake blog post published today, CryptoQuant contributor Onchain Edge shared insights into timing the sale of BTC during the current bull market. The analyst emphasized the importance of the Bitcoin supply in loss metric, noting its potential to signal when to start exiting the market to preserve profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report For those unfamiliar with Bitcoin, the supply in loss measures the percentage of BTC held at a loss based on its last moved price. A low percentage of supply in loss typically indicates peak market euphoria and serves as a warning to secure profits before a bear market correction begins. According to the CryptoQuant analysis, when BTC supply in loss drops below 4%, it signals a good time for investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their BTC holdings and wait for the next bear market lows. Currently, the BTC supply in loss sits at 8.14%. DCA is an investment strategy where investors allocate a fixed amount of money to an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This method helps reduce the impact of market volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time. The analyst adds: Why? Below 4% means a lot of people are in a profit this is the peak bullrun phase. Trust me you don’t want to be bagholding because you thought we will never see a bear market again. Be fearful when others are greedy. Analysts Confident Of Further Upside In BTC Price While tracking the BTC supply in loss metric can help investors safeguard their profits, recent forecasts from crypto analysts suggest there might still be room for further upside before this indicator becomes crucial. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC forms a classic cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. The premier cryptocurrency looks poised to break out of the bullish formation, with targets as high as $275,000. Similarly, Donald Trump’s victory has brought fresh optimism in the crypto industry. In the recently concluded Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, noted that BTC investors can “expect more than $100,000” during the ongoing market cycle. Other forecasts remain equally bullish. Tom Dunleavy, Chief Investment Officer at MV Global, projects BTC to reach $250,000, while Ethereum (ETH) might climb to $12,000 during this market cycle. BTC trades at $100,983 at press time, up a modest 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

This altcoin could potentially yield returns of up to 25,000%. Explore how this under-the-radar digital asset could become a game-changer in the crypto landscape. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win .

DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point . Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop !

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it gained popularity due to its community and social media influence, notably from figures like Elon Musk. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, it remains a subject of interest due to these factors. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run gains momentum, tokens like DOGE show limited short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN is poised for significant growth. Designed for those embodying success and luxury, DOGEN expects 700% presale growth and potential thousand-fold returns. Following BONK, WIF, and Popcat, it builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 06:11:45

The incomparable @_JiKim will be stepping into a new role as President and Acting CEO of CCI, and I will provide support as Senior Global Policy Advisor.… — Sheila Warren (@sheila_warren) December 13, 2024 CCI champions for stronger crypto regulations The CCI promotes fair cryptocurrency regulations globally, frequently comments on proposed regulations, and engages with government officials. The crypto advocacy group expects to expand its influence across Asia, Europe, and Africa via several new partnerships and adding a new advisor. Earlier this year, Warren participated in a roundtable discussion with U.S. Congress members, a Biden administration adviser, and crypto executives, calling the conversation a “productive step forward” in approaching crypto as a nonpartisan issue. Warren reflected that when she first took on the role as CCI’s CEO three years ago, it was a different era, before the FTX collapse and as Gary Gensler’s scrutiny of the industry was beginning. Crypto executives expect growth under Trump’s administration and SEC changes Warren’s resignation news comes as growing confidence emerges among crypto executives, who believe Trump’s administration will support global crypto adoption. Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder and chief operations officer at RedStone, recently said that Trump’s presidency “could significantly accelerate” the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) . He noted that s uch an administration could advocate for policies that push DeFi from niche to mainstream, sparking an influx of innovation and investment . Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto regulation, is set to leave the agency on Jan. 20, 2025. Donald Trump recently nominated cryptocurrency proponent Paul Atkins to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This move has been met with enthusiasm across the finance industry, which anticipates a more favorable regulatory environment under the upcoming administration. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, stated that the past four years under Chair Gensler felt like a continuous anti-crypto campaign.

The bull swing continues to gain momentum, with experts tipping more gains ahead of Donald Trump’s second term. However, on-chain factors could spark a major sale, leading to a drop in sentiments. In a recent publication, Onchain Edge informed users of the impact of BTC supply loss in the market. According to the release, when the metric goes below 4%, users should mark exits out of the crypto leader and reposition assets for the next bearish low. BTC supply loss is used to determine the number of coins whose prices are lower than their previous transfer prices over a period of time. It shows the profitability or loss of Bitcoin in circulation and is commonly used to determine the wider market sentiment. Current values stand at 8.14% amid recent asset fluctuations. A 4% mark in BTC supply loss shows that more holders are in profits, creating a dicey situation for traders. According to the release, holding when most users become extremely greedy could lead to losses. The crypto market is determined by cycles due to volatility. As seen in previous downtrends, a major swing could impact its price, leading to huge liquidations. “ When the BTC supply loss % goes below 4% you should start dcaing aggressively out of BTC and wait for the next bear market lows. The current value is 8.14%. Why? Below 4% means a lot of people are in a profit this is the peak bull run phase. Trust me you don’t want to be bagholding because you thought we would never see a bear market again. Be fearful when others are greedy.” What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin trades at $101,923, a slight 1.89% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.59% surge this week, wiping off previous losses. The present upward climb above $100K came with lots of optimism as macro factors flipped green for the asset. Most traders have projected the price to hit $150K amid surging institutional inflows. Institutional investors increased exposure to Bitcoin, driving an upward movement in price.

Here’s an Expert Opinion,https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-serve-as-rlusd-reserve-heres-an-expert-opinion/,"After a lengthy regulatory process, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has officially approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. This marks a significant milestone for Ripple and its community, which has been anticipating the launch of the USD-backed digital asset for some time. Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, recently weighed in on details surrounding the stablecoin, noting that “RLUSD requires cash or cash equivalent backing, like Treasury bills, bonds, or cash, as per NYDFS approval of the token.” This regulatory mandate ensures that RLUSD maintains its peg to the U.S. dollar, reinforcing trust and transparency in its operations. Ripple promised this would be the case when the stablecoin was announced , and the NYDFS approval adds credibility to Ripple’s promises. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Assets and RLUSD Collateralization Digital assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, are currently not acceptable to back RLUSD under NYDFS guidelines. Van Code noted, “XRP or any digital asset (including BTC) are currently NOT approved as cash equivalent to back RLUSD.” There were rumors that Ripple might custody its escrowed XRP as a reserve for RLUSD . This was quickly debunked by experts, pointing out that the regulators would not accept that. However, Van Code also speculated on the possibility of such assets being considered in the future, provided they meet stringent requirements. He also noted that the digital assets backing the stablecoins would need to be over-collateralized in case their prices drop. Such a scenario would allow digital assets to play a role in RLUSD’s collateral structure, though this remains purely speculative. Any move in this direction would require extensive regulatory approval and mechanisms to mitigate the volatility of digital assets. RLUSD Launch Timeline Addressing questions about potential hurdles delaying RLUSD’s launch, Van Code clarified that the asset has fulfilled all regulatory requirements. “NYDFS approved it. Now they are turning it all on. It takes a fair bit of time,” he stated. The implementation process involves creating the necessary infrastructure and demand for the stablecoin, ensuring a seamless rollout. Ripple’s stablecoin has already generated considerable excitement within the community, with many trustlines being created in anticipation of its debut. While the community remains optimistic about RLUSD’s potential to drive adoption and utility, immediate price impacts on XRP, Ripple’s native token, Van Code expects its impact on XRP to be modest. He emphasized that “the impact on XRP price won’t be immediate.” He pointed out that creating demand and utility takes time. He also mentioned that any price trend at this time is driven more by enthusiasm than by sustained utility-driven demand.

XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost, and Borderless Cryptocurrency on the XRP Ledger XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. With an initial supply of 100 billion XRP, 80 billion were gifted to Ripple for further development and ecosystem support. Ripple utilizes XRP to enhance network liquidity and has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, offering a digitally native, programmable currency that is resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on efficient cross-border payments may make it an attractive option for those interested in cryptocurrency technologies. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB’s visibility. SHIB’s Ethereum basis allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans include an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This integration may enhance its utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s potential for broader application could make it an attractive option. Conclusion With XRP and SHIB showing less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by the end of its presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Mirroring tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real perks for early adopters.

Last week, the total assets under management for the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) crossed $100 billion with market analysts expecting it to overtake Gold ETF by the year-end. Of course, this would happen if the inflows keep the momentum along with the Bitcoin price surging to fresh all-time highs. Can Bitcoin ETFs OverTake Gold ETFs By Year-End? Crypto industry expert and ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, suggested a possibility that the spot Bitcoin ETFs could overtake Gold ETFs by the end of this year. As said, the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market has already grown to $100 billion in size in less than a year of launch. On the other hand, the Gold ETF market size surged to $271 billion by the quarter ending September, per the World Gold Council . Also, data shows that while Bitcoin ETF inflows surged in November and December, the Gold ETFs saw outflows first time in six months. Thus, the gap between the two has been shrinking fast. Geraci noted that the outcome of his prediction would likely hinge on the comparative performance of Bitcoin and gold prices in the coming weeks. He also pointed out that physical gold ETFs were launched two decades ago, making such a development in BTC ETFs “astounding.” BackRock’s iShares BTC ETF (IBIT) has already attracted over $4 billion in inflows since Thanksgiving, an achievement that would rank it as the second-best ETF launch of 2024. On Friday, BlackRock’s IBIT saw another $393 million in inflows thereby taking its total inflows closer to $36 billion. BTC Can See A Short Squeeze A tightening Bitcoin supply could set the stage for a potential price squeeze, according to a recent analysis by 10x Research. The report highlights notable Bitcoin outflows from exchanges, driven by growing demand from Bitcoin ETFs and corporate accumulators like MicroStrategy. All eyes will be on the FOMC meeting next week to decide the BTC price trajectory to new all-time highs. Over the past 30 days, a net of 124,000 Bitcoins have exited exchanges, signaling reduced liquidity. Top crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, OKX, saw BTC withdrawals to the tune of 7-10% from its reserves. If these trends persist, combined with robust demand, the market may face a severe Bitcoin supply squeeze. This scenario could be intensified by the introduction of options on Bitcoin ETFs, potentially triggering gamma squeezes that amplify price pressures further As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 2% up at $101,953 with its market cap crossing $2 trillion. Per the Coinglass data, the 24-hour liquidations stand at $38.6 million with short liquidations soaring to $26.6 million.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are actively venturing into new investment opportunities, with the intriguing 1Fuel catching their eye. Thanks to its innovative features and strong presale momentum, 1Fuel is emerging as the best crypto for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios amidst the ongoing market rally. 1Fuel Could Launch a New DeFi Era of Wallet-Enhanced Features Although it recently joined the crypto space, 1Fuel is already making a name for itself as the best crypto to buy now. 1Fuel is designed to simplify how a crypto wallet works by removing extra network fees and the complexity of using multiple wallets. At the core of 1Fuel is its innovative one-click cross-chain transaction feature. In the past, users faced the daunting task of managing multiple wallets and tokens to complete safe crypto transactions across different networks. This often involved lengthy processes and technical jargon that could easily overwhelm anyone. In terms of security and privacy, 1Fuel prioritizes your safety. The secure crypto wallet includes a privacy mixer and cold storage, ensuring your assets are secure and shielded from unwanted scrutiny, facilitating safe crypto transactions. Avalanche Could Hit A New Price High Soon As the altcoin market continues its November rally this December, many cryptos like AVAX have maintained their upward trajectory. AVAX has exceeded the $50 mark and is approaching an 8-month high. The Avalanche token has risen over 50% in the past month and its market cap now stands at $22.09 billion (at the time of writing), which places it at the 11th rank of the top 20 cryptos on Coinmarketcap. If AVAX’s bullish momentum holds, it could test the $60 level this week. Sustaining this price might push AVAX toward the next resistance at $65. New Price Prediction for Shiba Inu Energes Following Impressive Surge So Far As a result of the current positive influence of the DeFi market, investor interest in SHIB has grown. This has fueled predictions that it could reach $0.0002 before 2025 ends. This projection is supported by SHIB’s track record in 2024. Since 2024 started, SHIB has risen by a whopping 206.32% and now has a market cap of almost $18 billion. While SHIB is currently in an upward earning phase, investors also focus on the new 1Fuel and its benefits. Hope In Sight For Dogecoin to Reach $1 While its market rival SHIB is growing impressively well, DOGE is also included in this growth trend. Over the past month, DOGE’s price has jumped 13.96% and it has been trading around $0.41 for the past week. As a result, DOGE now ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $61 billion. Based on its recent trajectory, analysts are starting to suggest that DOGE is steadily heading toward $1, with some predicting a bullish target between $1.30 and $1.50. However, it must first break past its $0.44 resistance. As DOGE investors hope this happens soon, they are also looking for new and potentially profitable projects to add to their crypto portfolios like 1Fuel. Conclusion While AVAX is set to reach a new price high, SHIB and DOGE investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel despite their current profitable positions. This shift is driven by 1Fuel’s significant growth potential in its ongoing presale, where OFT tokens are available at an attractive price of just $0.012 each. Don’t miss out—buy 1Fuel today!

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 07:13:00

This means you have two more weeks to grow your money and all that you have to do is select the right crypto to invest in. So if you want to enter 2025 with a bang, we have picked the top 5 best cryptos to invest in at the moment. All of the tokens listed below are currently in their presale so you’ll definitely get a great deal. As per expert predictions, all 5 of them are expected to do great in 2025. Let’s take a closer look at some of the best meme coins to see which one might be the best fit for you. 1. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is still in its presale phase and has already managed to raise over $4 million. Its drastic growth has led some experts to believe that it has the potential to offer a x100 return. The platform is also offering staking rewards , encouraging investors to hold onto their tokens for 145% APY. This has driven countless investors to the project, further fuelling its value. Anyone interested in the staking rewards should definitely hurry up because the staking reserve is reaching its limit and the reward will also go down with time. 2. Cat Slap Cat Slap ($SLAP) has been off to a great start. Since its launch, its price has already increased by x20, hinting that it might have the potential to become the next x100 meme coin. This is an Ethereum-based meme coin based on the angry cat-slapping meme. It currently has a market cap of $33 million. Its current value is $0.004757. Experts predict that by the end of the year, it might hit an average price of $0.00746. By next year, its average price might jump to $0.0143 which is a 200% jump from the current price. 3. Flockerz Flockerz is another popular token that’s gone viral. In just 2 months of its presale, it has managed to raise more than $5.6 million. Its growth so far has led some experts to predict that it might be the next $PNUT (a very popular meme coin) and might give an x4000 return like the chill guy meme coin. But those are just speculations. For now, all that we know is its current price is $0.0062995 and it’s expected to double up to $0.0124 in 2025. Interestingly, 25% of the token supply is reserved to be distributed through a vote-to-earn mechanism, where investors can vote on simple questions to earn FLOCK tokens. 4. Crypto All Stars Crypto All Stars has already raised over $10 million in its presale. Currently, the token is only available to strategic investors and its presale is ending very soon. In the second half of December, it’s expected to launch on exchanges. As for its growth, there won’t be any major change in the last two weeks of the year. Its current value is $0.0016582. So by the end of December, the maximum value it’s expected to reach is $0.0067128. However, in 2025, experts are predicting an x24 growth. 5. Sponge V2 SpongeV2 is a second-generation token of the $SPONGE coin (the first one was called V1). It’s important to note that you cannot have both the tokens together. If you want V2 tokens, you need to permanently lock your V1 tokens which will ensure that the V2 tokens replace the V1 ones. Now speaking of growth, right now the average price of each token is $0.0025 but by the end of 2025, it can hit $0.0060, which is a 140% jump. Plus, the V1 tokens gave early investors a whopping x100 return on their investment. Who knows, maybe it can happen again. Invest Before the Year Ends From the predictions, it looks like Wall Street Pepe, Flockers, and Sponge V2 are expected to have the best year ahead.

For instance, Sui token is having a bullish momentum as it sets a new all-time price high. The token has also struck a new significant partnership with First Digital Labs (FDUSD). Meanwhile, crypto experts are bullish on the market trajectory of the XRP token. Some analysts are projecting as high as $18 surge for the XRP price in this alt season. In the same vein, Lunex Network (LNEX) presale has hit another milestone, reaching $5 million in cryptocurrency ICO funding with the price jumping up once again. Sui Token Sets New ATH, Partners with First Digital USD It has been a significantly bullish month for the Sui token. Firstly, the token has gained over 51% within the last 30 days. This has seen the Sui price climb past the $4 mark to a new all-time price high of $4.86, according to CoinMarketCap stats. As it is, the bullish momentum is strong and is likely to propel the token above the $5 threshold in the coming days. In another development, the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stable coin is now available on Sui wallet through the Binance platform. Following this integration, investors can now deposit and withdraw FDUSD on the Sui network on Binance. The announcement was made public via Sui’s official X handle, signaling the start of transactions involving FDUSD in Sui’s wallet. Meanwhile, both the Sui trading volume and market cap are witnessing massive rallies. Other technical indicators, like the Fear and Greed index, MA, MACD, and Momentum, are flashing buy signals. Is the $18 Price Target for XRP Token Viable? The XRP crypto is riding on one of the biggest rallying trajectories that is only rivaled by the bull run of December-January 2018, which saw the token reach its standing all-time price high of $3.84. Having gained over 290% in price value in the month-to-date chart , it is looking likely that XRP’s price can finally set a new all-time high. As the token trades at $2.4, it is just 36% away from matching its ATH. Several crypto analysts and experts are projecting continuous bullish momentum. From the perspective of Dark Defender on X, one of the analysts that are bullish on XRP’s growth, the token could rally to $18.22. While it may still be early days for some investors, the XRP token remains one of the top crypto coins in the industry. Another XRP influencer that goes by the username Amonyx on X thinks that the XRP price breakout has not started yet. The analyst thinks it will go crazy above $20. With the growing interest, the altcoin could hit 10x this season. More Incoming Presale Milestones for Lunex Network (LNEX) Lunex Network (LNEX) is onboarding a new milestone of raising over $5 million so far in the presale. This development is made possible by the continuous influx of investors who’ve found the Lunex project to be a key player in the crypto industry. Thousands of investors now hold over 2.2 billion LNEX tokens. A significant number of these investors are already swimming in profits as the LNEX price has jumped from $0.0012 to $0.0044, over 260% gains. With a projection of another 50x growth, now is the best time to jump into this DeFi project, which is set to revolutionize the $131B DeFi industry. Holding the token grants you access to the revenue-sharing model. Outside that, traders can stake the token for as little as 30 days and earn high APY yields. Holders are given discounts on transactions. With the listing fees set to be paid in LNEX, there is a high likelihood of the buying pressure pushing the token towards $1 soon. All these make LNEX one of the promising DeFi coins to accumulate at this early stage. As a platform, Lunex Network is developed to allow for on-chain buying, selling, and swapping of digital assets without the need for KYC or wallet connections. Built with advanced trading features, users have access to over 50k trading pairs at the lowest cost, a portfolio tracker to track multiple assets, and a unique DeFi wallet that allows traders to buy, sell and swap cryptos. Investment Choice Between SUI, XRP and LNEX There is no doubt that the Sui and XRP tokens are on raging bullish momentum. However, Lunex Network is presenting investors with the opportunity to be pioneer investors in a project that could become the next Binance. Investing now on LNEX will put investors in the position of recording exponential ROIs soon.

Deaton Calls for SEC-CFTC Merger to Simplify Crypto Regulations,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-e-deaton-calls-for-sec-cftc-merger-to-simplify-crypto-regulations/,"The post John E. Deaton Calls for SEC-CFTC Merger to Simplify Crypto Regulations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News John E. Deaton, a vocal advocate for the crypto industry, has once again shared his views on the need for better regulation. He has often criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his approach, which many see as stifling the growth of cryptocurrencies. This time, Deaton is highlighting a potential solution: merging the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission). One Crypto, One Rule! On Mornings with Maria, Perianne Boring discussed how having two separate agencies oversee financial markets creates confusion and inefficiency. Deaton agreed, explaining that combining the two agencies into one could clear up the overlapping responsibilities and conflicts between them. This would make it easier for companies to follow the rules and provide a consistent approach to regulating both securities (like stocks) and commodities (like Bitcoin and other cryptos). Deaton believes that as cryptocurrencies often fall into gray areas between securities and commodities, having one unified regulator could simplify things for everyone. It would also align the U.S. with other countries that have a single financial regulator, making it easier for the U.S. to stay competitive in global markets. DOGE and the Push for Consolidation Moreover, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both supporters of Dogecoin (DOGE), are emerging as potential advocates for merging the SEC and CFTC. This proposed merger could simplify regulations for new technologies like cryptocurrencies, providing much-needed clarity for investors and businesses navigating the current complex regulatory landscape. John E. Deaton also highlighted payments as another area where consolidation is urgently needed. He pointed out that over a dozen federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, FinCEN, and the SEC, are involved in regulating payment systems. A unified regulatory framework could streamline these processes. Deaton used XRP as a prime example of regulatory discord. Despite being classified as a virtual currency by FinCEN in 2015, the SEC declared it a security five years later, causing massive investor losses. Uniting Forces for Crypto Clarity U.S. Congressman John Rose introduced a bill on Sep 12, to foster collaboration between the SEC and CFTC via a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets. Part of the “Bridging Regulation and Innovation for Digital Global and Electronic Digital Assets Act,” the committee would include industry experts, users, and academics to guide the agencies on harmonizing laws, measuring digital assets, and using blockchain for efficiency and consumer protection. The committee, with at least 20 non-government members and one representative each from the SEC and CFTC, would meet twice annually, with two-year member terms. Their recommendations would require public responses from the agencies, ensuring accountability. A strong crypto advocate, Rose aims to replace “regulation-by-enforcement” with a cooperative framework that fosters U.S. innovation. His pro-crypto stance includes backing the FIT21 Act and opposing excessive government control over digital assets.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:18:58

Recent developments have sparked increased speculation about XRP’s traditional investment prospects, driven by key market indicators and regulatory developments. Grayscale’s XRP Trust , launched in September 2024, has emerged as a significant point of interest for market observers. The trust has demonstrated remarkable performance, with its share price experiencing a substantial surge of over 300%. Initially priced at $10.85, the trust has climbed to $47.48, catching the attention of prominent market commentators and investors. Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, a.k.a Bitboy, highlighted this performance as a promising signal for a potential XRP ETF. The dramatic price appreciation of the Grayscale trust suggests growing institutional interest and potential market readiness for a more accessible investment vehicle for XRP. Greyscale's $XRP trust has recorded over 300% returns since May! Good sign an ETF is coming. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 12, 2024 Is An XRP ETF Coming? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) historical stance toward XRP has been a significant hurdle for XRP ETFs. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and its executives in December 2020, and both parties have been embroiled in this legal battle since. Although the court ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security, the SEC has not budged on its stance and appealed the ruling after the final verdict in August. However, the crypto market is as relentless as the SEC. Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the lawsuit, and multiple asset management firms have submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs, indicating substantial institutional interest. Considering the current landscape and the impressive performance of the Grayscale XRP Trust, Armstrong is confident that an XRP ETF is coming. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 When Will We See XRP ETFs? According to regulatory timelines, the SEC typically requires 240 days to review ETF applications. With the most recent XRP ETF applications submitted in November 2024, potential approval could extend to July 2025 under optimal circumstances. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store has also argued that the timeline could be extended , as XRP ETF approval would require an established Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated futures market. The SEC has also revealed that it will not approve Solana ETFs under the current administration. This might extend to other altcoins. However, a new administration will come in on January 20, and this pause will likely be lifted. While the timeline for an XRP ETF is uncertain, the asset is one of the most popular among investors and institutions, and this pressure could expedite the approval process.

Bluwhale , an AI Web 3.0 start-up, today announces an innovative competition on its platform between two of the biggest and fastest-growing exchange wallet teams – OKX Web 3.0 versus Gate Web 3.0 – to see which exchange’s wallet holders will reach 1,000 common nodes first. The winning exchange wallet community receives 1,000 free nodes to distribute to its members who purchased Bluwhale nodes. The two exchanges have grown and demonstrated dramatic traction over the last year. OKX, one of the largest CEXs (centralized exchanges) globally, has more than $2 billion daily transaction volume for just Bitcoin, while OKX Wallet has more than 100,000 active users daily. The CEX Gate is an established blockchain platform founded in 2013. One of the fastest-growing exchanges this year, it is approaching the peak of the top 10 CEXs and delighting its users with a strong diversity of token offerings. Gate Web 3.0 is a comprehensive platform that drives blockchain technology innovation and adoption, providing DeFi (decentralized finance) services, wallet, Web 3.0 startup, Web 3.0 tasks, DApp and other features. With Gate Web 3.0, users engage in the crypto ecosystem and experience decentralized digital asset management and trading with efficient and secure on-chain services. The OKX Web 3.0 versus Gate Web 3.0 competition starts December 12, 2024, at 2:00 a.m. PST and ends when one exchange wallet team reaches the target of 1,000 common nodes sold. Participants can support their preferred exchange in the Bluwhale common node sale by logging in using either Gate Wallet or OKX Wallet and purchasing a common node at a 10% discounted price. Bluwhale launched the master codes capable of creating communities in November 2024, selling out tier one and tier two within 48 hours. It is now transitioning into common nodes that give buyers a lower entry price point – $50-$60 – and allow them to join communities for higher reward boosts. Han Jin, co-founder and CEO of Bluwhale, said, “Node sales have been quite technical where licenses with hardware requirements are being distributed to buyers, limiting attractiveness for retail to participate. “At Bluwhale, we turn nodes into a simple and fun concept by allowing communities to compete and run them on their smartphones. “We are extremely honored to have OKX and Gate Web 3.0 support our mission of decentralizing AI through nodes on mobile devices. “Like this year’s excitement around PvP (player versus player) competitions like Mike Tyson versus Jake Paul, we are hosting this digital one on our site , giving the winner community 1,000 free nodes to reward its members.” Bluwhale AI is the fastest-growing AI network on blockchains, an intelligence layer contextualizing cross-chain and off-chain information, powered by millions of mobile devices acting as nodes to share data, storage and computing for rewards. More than 3,000 businesses and approximately one million verified users currently are part of Bluwhale’s decentralized AI ecosystem. Purchasers of both Bluwhale master nodes and common nodes will have a more integral role in the network by running nodes on their smartphones and participating in the ecosystem’s revenue streams. Since the master node launch on November 22, 2024, the Bluwhale node sale has seen considerable traction. Over 100,000 people from 32 countries have expressed interest in viewing and participating in the sale. More than 30,000 master nodes have already been sold to verified owners. The common node sale begins on December 12, 2024, at 2:00 a.m. PST. Users can visit here to follow the competition’s progress and make their bets.

SEC’s current chair Gary Gensler is set to step down on January 20. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, as the next chairman. The SEC claims Ripple violated securities laws by issuing XRP. Some of the XRP issuance was considered a security, while other parts were not. The SEC is appealing the ruling, and with a new SEC administration under Trump, there’s speculation on whether the case will be dropped. After Atkins takes office, many experts believe that the U.S. crypto market urgently needs clear, written laws, rather than inconsistent rulings from courts. Nevertheless, the Ripple case remains a significant moment in the ongoing battle against crypto regulation in the U.S. With major events unfolding, especially with the upcoming changes at the SEC, it’s a crucial time for anyone involved in crypto. When Patrick Bet David asked MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, “The community with XRP & Ripple, has anything changed since you and I were last together?” Saylor shared his view and said that he believes the current administration is supportive of crypto, particularly Bitcoin, and focused on freedom. He also pointed out the need for a digital assets framework that defines various crypto categories clearly, from digital currencies to NFTs and tokenized assets. If regulators provide this clarity, Saylor predicts significant growth for digital assets in the U.S. Saylor said, “I think you’ll have a pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets Treasury, a pro-digital assets White House, and a pro-digital assets House & Senate.” However, a lot of users and XRP enthusiasts noticed how Saylor dodged the question. A user said, “He literally didn’t answer the question which tells us exactly how he’s feeling.”",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:27:04

Ahlgren, who failed to accurately report $4 million in Bitcoin sales between 2017 and 2019, was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay over $1 million in restitution. His case serves as a stark warning for crypto investors about the serious consequences of tax evasion. While many are rooting for the Trump administration to streamline tax policies, this case is a stark reminder for investors who think crypto assets are an easy way to dodge taxes. What Went Wrong? Ahlgren, an early Bitcoin adopter, made substantial profits by selling 640 bitcoins in 2017 for $3.7 million and additional sales in subsequent years. However, instead of reporting these earnings accurately, he inflated the purchase price of his bitcoins (cost basis) to understate his taxable gains. To avoid detection, he used multiple wallets and even exchanged Bitcoin for cash in person, aiming to reduce his digital trace. Despite these efforts, blockchain’s inherent transparency enabled investigators to track his activities. IRS’s Stance on Crypto Tax Evasion Taking the case as a serious crypto tax compliance issue Stuart M. Goldberg, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General highlighted that Ahlgren deliberately hid over $1 million in taxable earnings.

Shehan emphasized that cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, and the IRS treats tax defaulters in this sector very seriously. He noted that blockchain’s transparency makes crypto one of the worst asset classes to evade taxes since all transactions are permanently recorded and traceable. To avoid legal troubles, he stressed that crypto gains are taxable and advised investors to use tools like crypto tax software or consult with a CPA to ensure accurate reporting. His key takeaway is to be honest, as attempting to hide gains can lead to severe consequences, including prison time and hefty financial penalties.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:27:56

Once this phase ends, analysts are predicting an 80% pump. However, with many uncertain when this pump will be, this AI-powered newcomer has caught the spotlight by offering a 100x potential surge as we enter 2025. Read on to find out why analysts are so positive about it and why you should get on board today. Dogecoin News: Accumulation Phase and Potential Gains Doge was originally designed to poke fun at cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, and has grown to become one of the most prominent meme coins in existence, making news thanks to its passionate community and endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s price history shows the extreme volatility of meme coins, seeing Dogecoin soar to the moon in 2021 to its ATH of $0.73 and then crashing. Since its launch in 2013, DOGE has experienced numerous rallies. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.4 with a market cap of $59.93 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $4.8 billion. In the last month, DOGE’s price seems to have been consolidating, trading around the $0.4 level and seeing only a 5% increase. According to the latest Dogecoin news, as DOGE continues to consolidate, analysts predict an 80% increase in price after the accumulation phases end. However, while DOGE offers the potential for moderate gains, as shown in the predictions, its large market size may limit its upside compared to smaller, emerging projects like this newcomer.

Following a period of subdued activity, recent metrics suggest renewed confidence among investors, potentially signalling an upward trend. At the center of this observation is the 90-day percent return metric, which has historically been a reliable indicator of market sentiment for Toncoin. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally — Can TON Sustain The Momentum? Toncoin Sees Renewed Positive Momentum: What Lies Ahead? CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared insights into the TON market in a recent post titled “TON Positive Momentum is Getting Back.” The analyst noted that the 90-day percent return has turned positive, currently sitting at around 9%. While this is a modest figure compared to the explosive 200% gains seen during TON’s previous rally, it marks a shift that could lead to greater market optimism. Notably, the 90-day percent return metric turning positive is a noteworthy development for Toncoin. This indicator reflects the average returns over a 90-day period, offering insights into investor behaviour and market sentiment. Historically, positive returns have often preceded significant upward trends in TON’s price. While the current 9% return signals growing investor confidence, it remains a cautious indicator, suggesting potential gains without confirming a definitive rally. Darkfost further reveals that during TON’s last significant rally, this metric soared beyond 200%, showcasing its capacity for really strong momentum when “conditions align.” He then emphasized that while this shift in returns is promising, it is too early to predict whether TON will replicate its previous performance. TON Market Performance Meanwhile, despite the positive momentum observed by Darkfost, Toncoin has been in a downward turn over the past week, dropping by nearly 10%. Even in the past 24 hours, TON is still seeing a form of bearishness in its price as it currently trades at a price of $6.27 pushing its price further away from its all-time high of $8.25 recorded in back in June. Particularly, at current market prices, TON is down by 24.2% from this peak and 3.1% in the past day. This decrease has also unsurprisingly affected the asset’s market cap which has decreased from over $17 billion seen earlier this month to now at $15.9 billion as of today. Related Reading: Toncoin Liquidity and User Activity Reviewed by Analyst: Insights on Market Impacts TON’s daily trading volume has also plunged from over $1 million on December 10 to roughly $402.8 million as of today. Regardless of this bearish performance, analysts seem to continue to be bullish on TON. In a recent analysis uploaded on X, The Moon Show revealed that as TON recently formed a symmetrical triangle on its 1-hour chart, a break to the upside could bring its price to trades as high as $7.55. $TON is forming this 1h symmetrical triangle.

The proposal echoes similar initiatives by lawmakers in Argentina, Russia and other countries. Hamada, a representative of the People’s Protection Party, told NHK in a formal written request to the government, asking for Bitcoin to be considered a strategic reserve asset. According to media outlet CoinPost and official records from the parliament, Hamada’s request speaks to the growing global trend towards Bitcoin being considered a national strategic reserve asset. Hamada specifically pointed to developments in Brazil and the United States, where authorities are reportedly exploring the possibility of holding Bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves. He suggested Japan follow suit by converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Hamada highlighted the unique qualities of Bitcoin, stating: “Bitcoin’s neutrality and decentralized nature allows it to support economic activity without relying on any particular currency or institution.” Related News: World's Largest Digital Asset Manager Announces Fund Launch for Two Surprise Altcoins Hamada’s proposal highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to act as a buffer against geopolitical risks, arguing that Bitcoin, which is less influenced by specific countries or institutions, could provide economic stability in uncertain times. In a document titled “The Question of Understanding the Move to Create a National Bitcoin Reserve in the United States and Other Countries,” Hamada noted that Bitcoin could soon be recognized globally as a ‘national strategic asset.’ The Japanese government is expected to respond to Hamada's proposal in the coming weeks. His party has only two seats in parliament. *This is not investment advice.

However, not many manage to offer their customers the payment methods they’re looking for, nor do they offer customers their local currencies and low fees. After over 2 years of operations, Swapped.com has now gotten to a point where the site supports 30+ payment methods, 20+ currencies to pay with, and industry-low fees. The site started out as an option only available to Danish people in Denmark but decided to go international last year in August 2023. Since then, it has gained large popularity in jurisdictions where customers don’t just want to use bank transfers or credit cards. Among its available payment methods are Revolut Pay, Interac, Local Bank transfers in GBP, DKK, USD, EUR, AUD, and others, PIX, Google Pay, Apple Pay, PaySafeCard, Skrill, Neteller, and lots of other methods. And the fees? They start as low as 0.50%, ensuring customers can get their hands on their desired crypto without breaking the bank on currency conversion, deposit, and withdrawal fees. With Swapped.com you can pay in your local currency avoiding any currency conversions you might be used to when using large exchanges or crypto onramps. Also, the conversion rates are mid-market rates which means you aren’t subject to any gaps in the foreign exchange rates (no hidden fees). Non-custodial platform Swapped.com was launched and has been designed to ensure customer funds are kept safe and not connected to Swapped.com and its potential successes or failures. As such, you can not hold funds on the Swapped platform but instead, Swapped provides instruction on how to easily and for free, set up your own cryptocurrency wallet in no time. This means that you get familiar with setting up your own cryptocurrency wallet which you can keep and use as you please, without any exchange or platform telling you what you can and cannot do and who you can and cannot transact with. This also means that in the case of bankruptcy or something like FTX or Mt. Gox, your funds will be safe. If Swapped.com goes bottoms up, your funds will be with you and they won’t be pulling any of your funds into the depths of their bankruptcy—instead, your keys, your coins. Why would someone invest in cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency has been “the next big thing” in recent years and has also come with a lot of speculation, poor investments, and other stories of rags to riches. People often choose to invest in cryptocurrency to get exposure to a different asset class than traditional ones, such as stocks, bonds, rare metals, and real estate. Contrary to traditional assets, cryptocurrency is known not to correlate with the general market. As such, if everything else is plummeting, cryptocurrency might be a bet in the other way, acting as an investment hedge. It is very important to figure out your risk profile, however, and make sure that cryptocurrency is the right investment for you. Cryptocurrencies come with significant risks and are very volatile assets. Make sure to do your research before investing. To ensure that you don’t end up with random coins or pump-and-dump coins, Swapped has strict criteria for the cryptocurrencies that they make available to you. As such, only cryptocurrencies that are within the top 25 of most valuable cryptocurrencies are available on the website. A regulated way to buy crypto A lot of exchanges and sites are registered and operate out of unfamiliar jurisdictions with questionable regulators and laws that might not be in your interest. Swapped.com on the other hand is a Danish company, registered and incorporated in Denmark and is regulated by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Denmark, FINTRAC Canada, and ASIC Australia. This means that should you encounter any issues with Swapped.com paying out your crypto or FIAT currencies, you can reach out to the relevant regulator and have them look into the case for you. A provider ready to help out when things aren’t working Who doesn’t hate going through 10 steps, 2 help centers, and 3 different AI Agents/Live chatbots? We don’t know. Swapped hates that process as well. As a result, Swapped has live agents available 24/7 for your convenience. Also, no need to go through lots of submenus, help centers, etc. The agents are there to help and you can get in touch with them within a minute should you experience any issues while trying to transact on Swapped, setting up your first-ever cryptocurrency wallet, and whatever else you might have on your mind. How to get started If it’s your first time considering buying crypto, we would advise that you first discuss the matter with an investment advisor to figure out if the asset class fits within your investment needs. If it is, consider heading to Swapped , and have a chat with one of the live chat agents who sit ready to help with any questions, concerns, etc. you might have with cryptocurrencies. They will also be able to provide instructions and guidance on how you can securely set up your first cryptocurrency wallet so that you can get started on your cryptocurrency adventure. If you decide that you want to buy crypto , the agents will once again be ready to help you through the process, explaining the risks of cryptocurrency and how to store them. Make sure that you do your own research before making any investments.

Besides, MicroStrategy has entered the Nasdaq 100, primarily led by more than $42 billion in BTC and over $550 billion in ETF assets, which is believed to be a big win for Bitcoin adoption. In this case, it is not only important for the BTC price to sustain above $100K but to achieve new highs before the end of the year. BTC’s dominance is rising again, while the inclusion of MicroStratergy is expected to have a wider adoption, inviting more buying pressure. Meanwhile, the recent BTC price movements show that psychologically, people are finding it difficult to buy the token at $100,000. A strong squeeze on the BTC chart indicates the weakness of the buyers and validates the above claim. Therefore, the price is believed to chop around the levels for a while before going higher before the end of the year. If the BTC price closes below $100K by the end of the year, how will the markets begin the 2025 trade? The short-term price action of BTC suggests the bulls are trying hard to keep up the bullish trend, mainly utilising all their strength to keep the price over $100K. The rally trading within the symmetrical triangle displays both bullish and bearish possibilities while the volume remains within a decent range. The price hovers in and out of the 50-day MA in the short term which has been a strong support at the moment. On the other hand, the RSI remains consolidated within a parallel channel since the start of the month. Therefore, the price is expected to maintain an ascending consolidation and reach the apex in the coming week. Besides, the bulls are exhibiting some more power compared to the bears which suggests the selling pressure may not hinder the progress of the rally. Therefore, the price is expected to test the ATH in the next 4 to 5 days which could also test the stability of the bulls. If they manage to withstand the bearish pressure at these levels, then a breakout from the pattern may enable the token to rise above $105K and eventually push the price above $108K to $110K by the end of the year. If the bulls fail to do so, then a similar drag below $98,000 may be expected. As long as the RSI remains within the range and the 50-day MA acts as strong support, then the possibility of a new ATH remains evident. Otherwise, a bearish start for 2025 could slightly delay the formation of new highs but cannot refrain as 2025 is expected to be the bullish year for the entire crypto space.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:42:54

ChatGPT and Perplexity weigh in on the factors needed for its market cap to skyrocket to the $1 trillion mark. XRP at $1T? Recall the price developments around XRP shortly after Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential elections. After a sluggish start, while the rest of the market was climbing, Ripple’s native token exploded in the following weeks, especially after current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his upcoming departure from the agency. At one point, XRP’s price tag had skyrocketed by over 400% and neared $3 on a few occasions. While the community anticipated a surge past that level and a new all-time high of over $3.4, the asset retraced and even slumped below $2 earlier this week during the market-wide correction. Now, though, XRP stands around $2.5, with a market cap of just over $140 billion. In order to tap the coveted $1 billion mark in market cap, its price would have to go up to around $17.5 per token. As of now, it seems like a tall order, but ChatGPT has outlined the potential factors that could lead to such a massive increase. Perhaps the most important part is the overall market sentiment. As long as the bull market remains intact, XRP has the potential to rise further, even perhaps going into double-digit territory. The other factor highlighted by ChatGPT and Perplexity is the adoption levels. “Ripple has positioned XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. If financial institutions globally adopt Ripple’s solutions, it could drive demand for XRP. Partnerships with banks and payment providers could lead to increased transaction volume and liquidity.” Further utilization of the native cross-border token, as well as the upcoming stablecoin RLUSD, could also impact the former’s price movements and send it higher, said the two chatbots. Challenges ChatGPT and Perplexity also outlined a few challenges that XRP could face on the way up. Competition from other projects, including other, more established stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, is among those. The XRPL network also faces different competitors, and XRP’s price could be suppressed if it fails to dominate the market. The regulatory environment needs to be mentioned in both categories. Should it change and become more crypto-friendly, as Trump promised, it could affect XRP positively. However, if the landscape remains similar during the Trump administration as it has been under Biden, the asset, as well as many other US-based crypto projects, could be harmed significantly. ChatGPT also mentioned the growing supply of XRP tokens and the potentially growing selling pressure, which could halt its price growth. “Ripple Labs holds a significant portion of XRP, releasing it periodically. This could create selling pressure, limiting price appreciation.” The post We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Reach $1T Market Cap This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-14 07:45:27

Is a new all-time high on the horizon? Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has consistently been making higher highs and lows since rebounding from the $52K support level. It has also broken above several resistance levels and now sits well above the resistance of $100,000. Meanwhile, the RSI is showing clear bullish momentum, and it’s likely for the market to finally decisively conquer $100K and move toward the $120K psychological resistance zone. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a more clear picture of recent price action, as the market has been climbing higher inside a large ascending channel. Yet, with the lower boundary of the pattern remaining intact, the market is now paving its way toward the higher trendline and potentially the $105K level in the short term. A breakout above the ascending channel is likely to lead to an aggressive rally higher. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Coinbase Premium Index American investors, including US institutions, are mostly the ones responsible for market moves. As a result, analyzing their behavior can be beneficial in making an accurate prediction about short-term market moves. This chart presents the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index, which is a metric that measures the relative buying and selling pressure on Coinbase compared to Binance. Coinbase is mostly used by American traders, while Binance is utilized worldwide. Therefore, this metric can indicate whether American investors are buying or selling at a higher or lower rate than other parts of the world. As the chart demonstrates, the Coinbase Premium Index has demonstrated highly positive values over the last couple of months, indicating the buying pressure from the US post-election, which is likely responsible for the market’s recent rally. As long as this metric shows positive readings, BTC could expect more upside.

Now, it has grown to as high as 16.8%. Some believe that Binance’s stablecoin inflow played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s rally to the milestone of $100K. Let’s examine the scenario for better clarity. Ready? Binance’s Record-Breaking Stablecoin Inflows A crypto market analyst, identified as Darkfost, states that in the year 2024 alone, Binance reported at least $22 billion in stablecoin inflows. Explaining why the exchange stands out, he notes that on December 5, when OKX saw a $1.6 billion stablecoin netflow, Binance witnessed a netflow of at least $13 billion. The Rise of Stablecoin Holdings on Binance Another analyst, named joaowedson, highlights that Binance stores at least 16.8% of the total market cap of stablecoins. He mentions that since March 2023, Binance’s share of the market cap has swelled from just 4% to over 16.8%. Impact on Bitcoin’s Rally to $100K Bitcoin recently attained a crucial milestone of $100K. Experts assert that Binance’s stablecoin inflows supported Bitcoin heavily to achieve its milestone, emphasising the fact that higher stablecoin reserves enhance liquidity, pushing prices higher across the crypto market. The Importance of Exchange Stablecoin Reserves As per joawoedson, at least 24.16% of the total market cap of stablecoins is held by cryptocurrency exchanges. This indicates that exchanges can easily influence crypto prices. In conclusion, Binance’s growing stablecoin dominance highlights the critical role of liquidity in driving Bitcoin’s price and the broader crypto market.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:54:04

So the question becomes, will other trending Pepe alternatives, Turbo and Wall Street Pepe, explode next? Pepe Unchained Soars After Biggest ICO of 2024 Pepe Unchained is trading at a staggering $335 million market cap after launching just two days ago. Before its exchange launch, $PEPU underwent the biggest presale of 2024, raising $73 million. This was a massive commitment from the community, underlining just how much support this project had garnered. Pepe Unchained is not just a meme coin. It has built the first Pepe-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. It’s 100x faster and much cheaper than the Ethereum main network, and it launched without a hiccup. Now, traders can buy, sell, and create meme coins with Ethereum’s security and Solana-grade scalability. As such, its out-the-gate success was no surprise. PEPE UNCHAINED L2 IS LIVE! Yesterday’s launch went off without a hitch. Our L2 network handled the massive volume effortlessly and is now ready to welcome the masses! Check out our official block explorer, Pepuscan, and witness this greatness firsthand.… pic.twitter.com/0EJ7itirOz — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 11, 2024 Currently, Pepe Unchained is trading at $0.04103, up 75% today and 336% since CoinMarketCap began tracking its price data on Tuesday. And its position as the number one trending token on CoinMarketCap provides a huge spotlight that could enable continued growth. On continued growth, analysts believe that Pepe Unchained has much more gains ahead. Analyst Says Gains Still to Come For PEPU Pepe Unchained has caused a huge buzz on social media, with top analysts hailing its early momentum and suggesting that it could become one of the top meme coins. 99Bitcoins analyst Jacob Bury dubbed Pepe Unchained a “success story” and suggests that the coin could “absolutely pump.” Bury underscored that Pepe Unchained’s price action shows real momentum, concluding that “we could see more continuation to the upside.” It’s also worth noting that the team has multiple high-potential moves planned for the forthcoming weeks. This includes the launch of Pepe Pump Pad, a no-code launchpad that allows anyone to create a meme coin in seconds. $PEPU will also launch on tier-1 exchanges, and there is speculation that Coinbase is interested, given its recent listings of Peanut the Squirrel, Moo Deng, and Turbo. $PEPU @pepe_unchained might be the next Coinbase listing. It’s day 2 and has reached $300Million MC. Wait until it’s given to the masses. $Wepe @WEPEToken will be the next gold mine. — Pallu Israel (@israel_pallu) December 11, 2024 Lastly, the Pepe Unchained team will purchase an add-in for Times Square, New York, to promote $PEPU in one of the world’s most iconic tourist attractions. We are ready. Are you? pic.twitter.com/xFddvk7FrU — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 6, 2024 So yes, Pepe Unchained still has room for growth. However, those seeking to maximize their returns are positioning in other projects that could explode even more. Turbo Can Rise, But Wall Street Pepe Is the Next Moonshot Pepe Unchained’s growth underlines the huge potential of Pepe alternatives. Right now, Turbo is another popular Pepe alternative, also claiming the title of “first AI-created meme coin.” The project has enjoyed notable success recently, especially after being listed on Coinbase this week. Given its Pepe roots and proximity to the AI meme coin narrative, analysts expect the token’s uptrend to continue. $TURBO price hit ATH #TURBO #TURBOUSDT pic.twitter.com/t0eiD9EsaX — HexaTrades (@HexaTrades) December 11, 2024 However, Turbo is already well-established, with a whopping $851 million market cap. While it can still rise from here, its upside is limited compared to a newer alternative, such as Wall Street Pepe . Traders are tipping Wall Street Pepe as the next Pepe Unchained, citing its similar launch pattern and innovative approach. Like Pepe Unchained, Wall Street Pepe has launched via a token presale, allowing traders to buy at a ground floor price. And also like Pepe Unchained, the project is focused on utility rather than pure memetics like the original Pepe. Wall Street Pepe brings in the high-octane energy of Wolf of Wall Street, aiming to turn its cohort of holders into profit-maximizing wolves. It’s doing this by equipping them with institutional-grade trading tools. This includes buy and sell signals, meme coin picks, data insights, a trading insider’s group, trading rewards, and even staking. RJ, the host on the Cryptonews YouTube channel, suggests that anyone who missed the Pepe Unchained presale could buy Wall Street Pepe as an alternative. The project’s presale is ongoing, and it has raised $6 million so far. The current price is $0.000211, but this will rise in three days.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 07:54:38

In a world where utility-focused tokens have traditionally dominated, meme coins are staking their claim with viral potential, community-driven hype, and massive ROI potential. With the crypto market surging on renewed enthusiasm and fresh innovations, meme coins are proving to be much more than internet jokes—they’re serious contenders for big gains. From retail investors to crypto whales, everyone’s chasing the next big thing in meme coins. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Floki Inu (FLOKI)—three meme coins redefining the space with unique narratives, strong communities, and exciting developments.

Here’s the kicker: BTFD isn’t just about the memes. This project packs a punch with its upcoming Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, where players can earn BTFD tokens while diving into immersive gameplay.

If you invest $5,000 at Stage 12, where the current price is $0.00013, you’d snag a whopping 38,461,538 BTFD tokens. Now, if BTFD hits its projected presale-end price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $23,076—an ROI of over 360%. That’s not just an opportunity; it’s a call to action. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin combines meme appeal with real utility, delivering unmatched growth potential, community perks, and a sense of belonging for its investors. Don’t miss out—this could be the next meme coin moonshot . Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): A Token with Charm and Cheek Peanut the Squirrel has stormed onto the scene, armed with one of the quirkiest mascots the crypto world has seen. Inspired by the everyday hustle of squirrels preparing for winter, PNUT’s branding taps into a sense of light-hearted fun and relatability. But make no mistake—there’s more to this coin than just cute cartoons. What sets PNUT apart is its focus on gamification and community-building. Holders gain access to a squirrel-themed universe filled with NFT collectibles, where they can participate in games and earn rewards. PNUT has also teased an ecosystem expansion that includes a charity initiative focused on environmental conservation—because who doesn’t want to save trees while stacking crypto? Investors are flocking to PNUT not just for its unique theme but also for its explosive growth potential. It’s already making waves on social media, with Gen Z and Millennials latching onto its cheeky charm and feel-good vibes. Plus, its relatively low entry cost makes it an easy addition to any meme coin portfolio. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel combines whimsy with purpose, offering a fun yet meaningful investment opportunity that appeals to both the heart and wallet. It’s quirky, it’s fresh, and it’s primed to ride the meme coin momentum. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Meme Coin with Real-World Utility Floki Inu isn’t just another dog-themed token—it’s a movement. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI has carved out a unique niche, blending meme culture with serious utility. And the results are stunning: FLOKI has already gained traction in NFTs, decentralised finance (DeFi), and real-world applications, proving that meme coins can be more than just a passing trend. What’s really exciting about FLOKI is its multi-pronged approach. From the Valhalla P2E metaverse to the FlokiFi DeFi suite, this token has diversified its offerings to ensure long-term relevance. FLOKI’s emphasis on education through the Floki University initiative is another feather in its cap, demonstrating a commitment to empowering its community with knowledge. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu has proven itself as more than just a meme coin, with its blend of innovative features and community-driven initiatives. It’s got the charm, the hype, and the utility to make waves in the crypto world.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced some notable shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 8.43%, indicating a short-term decline. However, over the last month, SHIB’s price increased by 5.44%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the bigger picture, the price has surged by 34.42% over six months, highlighting significant long-term growth. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002805 and $0.00003489. The nearest support level is at $0.00002390. If the price dips to this point, it would mean a decrease of about 15%. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00003759. Breaking through this could lead to gains of around 30%. If momentum continues, SHIB might reach the second resistance at $0.00004442, offering further potential growth. If Dogecoin gains upward momentum and breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.54, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.64. This would represent a potential increase of approximately 28% from its current price. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.35, it might decline to the second support at $0.25, a decrease of around 39%. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they could signal the next significant move in Dogecoin’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.41 and $0.50. Over the past week, its price has decreased by 4.86%. In the past month, it has seen a growth of 7.10%. Looking back six months, Dogecoin’s price has surged by 198.68%. This shows that while there has been a slight dip recently, the long-term trend remains positive. Based on the data, Dogecoin’s momentum appears neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47.38, which is in the middle range, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The MACD level is at -0.0013236, suggesting slight bearish momentum. The Stochastic oscillator reads 41.54, supporting a neutral stance. These indicators suggest that Dogecoin’s price might consolidate before making a significant move. If Dogecoin gains upward momentum and breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.54, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.64. This would represent a potential increase of approximately 28% from its current price. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.35, it might decline to the second support at $0.25, a decrease of around 39%. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they could signal the next significant move in Dogecoin’s price.

While authorities listed several causes for the rolling blackouts, illegal crypto mining was found to be one of the biggest causes of Iran’s power crisis. Crypto Miners Exploit Iran’s Government-Subsidized Electricity Iran’s capital city, Tehran and its neighbouring provinces faced a major power crisis in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people’s lives and businesses. While several factors are likely involved in the disruptions, illegal cryptocurrency mining has been named a major contributing factor. Iran’s government-subsidized electricity has become a global hotspot for crypto mining since 2022. With the world's lowest estimated cost of mining, many cryptocurrency miners have exploited the country’s cheap electricity. Cryptocurrency mining was able to resume in 2022 after the Iranian government lifted a four-month ban on these energy-consuming activities after multiple cities across the country suffered crippling blackouts. After the government lifted the ban, Iran said crypto mining could continue , but only under strict conditions. Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade (MIMT) said it would only issue licenses to mining farms supplied by power from renewable energy sources to ease the stress on power plans and avoid blackouts. Electricity in Iran costs a mere $0.002 per kilowatt-hour, the lowest in the world by a large margin, according to data by Statista . The cost of mining one Bitcoin in Iran is estimated to be around $1,320, compared to the $100,000 it costs in the United States or the $300,000 in Ireland. Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, CEO of Iran’s state electricity company, Tavanir, recently highlighted the impact of illegal mining activities on the region’s power grid. Mashhadi explained that the power used by 230,000 unlicensed devices equals the total electricity demand of a key manufacturing hub, the Markazi province. News agency Iran International reported the capital introduced “a bounty of 1 million toman” to incentivize citizens to report unlicensed crypto mining equipment. The bounty , roughly $24 at the current exchange rate, came into play as the country faced power shortages amid a severe heatwave that recorded temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country. Mashhadi explained the challenges to Iran International, stating: “Opportunistic individuals have been exploiting subsidized electricity and public networks to mine cryptocurrencies without proper authorization. This unauthorized mining has led to an abnormal surge in electricity consumption, causing significant disruptions and problems within the country's power grid.” Sanctions and Geo-Political Tension Drive Iran to Turn to Crypto Iran has embraced cryptocurrency to mitigate economic challenges and circumvent US-imposed sanctions that restrict the country’s access to global financial networks. The low-cost energy framework and increased need for ways to participate in the international economic framework have forced the country to participate in the cryptocurrency arena. Last week, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) approved a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies to balance the oversight of the industry with economic development. The Tehran Times reported the country is taking a unified approach to regulating the industry with a policy mandating licensing for crypto brokers and custodians to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules, and tax obligations.

In a new complaint, BiT Global accuses Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before ultimately delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” According to BiT Global, similar actions were taken against competitors years ago by tech giants such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook. BiT Global goes on to say that Coinbase’s actions were in violation of US commerce laws as they were an attempt to monopolize the market and intentionally debase wBTC. “Coinbase engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct to accomplish [its] monopolization. It has used its dominant power in one market – the market for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States – to attempt to exclude wBTC from that market. It has made false statements about the reasons for its delisting (with implications that the delisting was based on an in-depth review of wBTC using neutral standards, and implications that Coinbase possesses damaging information about wBTC which caused the delisting). These activities have created ‘FUD’ (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) surrounding wBTC and were part of an intentional strategy to do so.” On November 20th, Coinbase announced that after its most recent review, it would suspend trading for WBTC on December 19th. Coinbase first announced Coinbase Wrapped BTC ( cbBTC ) – its own wrapped version of the crypto king – earlier this year. wBTC is trading for $101,122 at time of writing, a 1.7% increase during the last 24 hours.

Analysts Are Betting On These Altcoins Instead,https://timestabloid.com/can-dogecoin-reach-0-5-analysts-are-betting-on-these-altcoins/,"Dogecoin is facing a major setback after a hacker crashed 69% of its network nodes. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is picking up bullish momentum as top market experts predict a $20 price target for the AI coin. Meanwhile, Rollblock is dominating Q4’s altseason already by raising more than $7 million during its viral presale. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hacker Crashes 69% Network Nodes by Exploiting Vulnerability Dogecoin investors have raised genuine concerns about security in Dogecoin’s ecosystem since the network was recently infiltrated by a hacker. Although this hack was carried out by known cryptocurrency expert Andreas Kohl, it is still making analysts question Dogecoin’s future potential. Since Kohl easily crashed nearly 70% of Dogecoin’s network nodes, analysts believe Dogecoin’s price will experience a setback after this major security concern. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.4018 after an intraday dip of 2.36%. Dogecoin’s volume has already crashed by 35.81% which suggests low network activity. Since Dogecoin’s MACD indicator is also flashing strong sell signals, Dogecoin’s price could retrace towards the $0.3482 support trendline. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Gains Traction in Crypto AI Space Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has experienced a 36.77% increase in value during the last month as whales showed interest in AI coins. Since Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is the fifth largest AI coin in terms of market cap, analysts believe Artificial Superintelligence Alliance could retest its critical resistance at $2 within the next few days. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is currently trading for $1.76 after an intraday increase worth 1.42%. If Artificial Superintelligence Alliance can break above the $2.10 mark, the token’s price could experience a massive rally towards the $20 mark. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s technical indicators support the bullish trend as the token’s RSI is in neutral territory. If Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s MACD indicator turns positive soon, investors can expect a massive AI coin rally before the end of Q4. Rollblock’s (RBLK) GambleFi Project to Experience Massive100x Rally in Early 2025 Rollblock’s viral GambleFi project is already poised for a massive 100x rally because of its impressive features, native RBLK utility token and attractive staking rewards. Since Rollblock’s gaming library combines features of both decentralized and centralized gaming, analysts believe this new project will mark a significant revolution in the GameFi world. If these bullish predictions stand true, Rollblock’s price could jump by 880% even before the end of its presale stages. Since Rollblock is committed to user experience, the platform offers a massive collection of 7,000+ AI-powered games that are all audited and regulated by SolidProof and Gaming Curacao. All bets placed on any of these games are automatically encrypted on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain which makes Rollblock the most secure iGambling platform in the market. To make things even better, Rollblock also allows users to view transparent betting analytics which can help improve their odds of winning over time. Rollblock’s entire ecosystem is powered by the platform’s native RBLK token which also functions as an independent utility token on the open market. This means traders can add RBLK to their staking pools and start earning a weekly passive income through Rollblock’s revenue sharing model. Since Rollblock pays staking rewards with up to 30% APYs through a token buyback and burn mechanism, analysts expect RBLK’s price to remain under deflationary pressure on the open market. For a limited time, Rollblock is selling its native RBLK tokens for a low price of only $0.041. Since this low price is only to break barriers to entry, market experts are predicting another huge demand-induced price jump before the end of this week.

This has sparked immense discussions in the market, especially after the SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently targeted Elon Musk. On the other hand, the prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the agency has also fueled discussions in the market amid pro-crypto regulatory anticipation in the US. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Backs Elon Musk Elon Musk’s criticism of the US SEC gained widespread attention when he called the agency a “political tool” used for “dirty work.” His remarks followed news of the US SEC Chair Gary Gensler sending a notice to his company Neuralink, sparking reactions from political figures and crypto advocates alike. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse backed Musk by reposting his comment, signaling solidarity in their shared frustration with the agency. Ripple has long been entangled in a legal battle with the agency, with the XRP lawsuit challenging its native crypto’s status as a security becoming a flashpoint in the crypto regulation debate. Meanwhile, legal experts and politicians have joined the conversation. Cory Liu, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law, highlighted a recent court ruling against the SEC. The court declared the SEC had overstepped its authority by enforcing a Nasdaq policy requiring diversity quotas for corporate boards. Liu argued that the SEC should focus on ensuring fair markets, not enforcing identity-based quotas. Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy criticized the SEC, suggesting repeated legal losses undermine its credibility. U.S. Senator Mike Lee echoed this sentiment, stating that the US SEC “cannot be trusted” as an independent body. Crypto Market Eyes Pro-Crypto Regulation Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also previously criticized the US SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler for their stance against the crypto market. The recent developments have gained widespread attention from market enthusiasts. On the other hand, the D.O.G.E., led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy has also sparked discussions in the market. Besides, the timing of these developments has intensified scrutiny of the SEC’s practices, especially with Gary Gensler set to step down in January. Gensler, often criticized for his tough stance on crypto, has faced backlash over his approach to regulatory enforcement. For Ripple, the stakes remain high as its ongoing case with the SEC could shape the future of crypto regulations in the U.S. Garlinghouse’s alignment with Musk adds momentum to growing calls for a pro-crypto regulatory framework. The incident also highlights broader concerns about regulatory overreach. Many industry leaders argue that the agency’s focus on political agendas detracts from its primary mission of market fairness. As discussions heat up, all eyes are on how these critiques might influence U.S. crypto policies in the post-Gensler era.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 08:14:00

Ripple has officially begun following the X Verified account, igniting widespread discussion in the cryptocurrency community about the possibility of XRP integrating into X Payments, the platform’s upcoming payment system. Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) highlighted this possibility in a recent post , suggesting that big things are coming for the digital asset. Her sentiment aligns with the broader enthusiasm in the crypto sector, which views XRP’s potential integration into X Payments as a milestone for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. BREAKING: RIPPLE HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED FOLLOWING X VERIFIED! CONFIRMATION THAT #XRP WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO X-PAYMENTS SOON? pic.twitter.com/8Z6Gmv7zbo — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 13, 2024 Will X Payments Adopt XRP? The excitement surrounding this potential partnership is fueled by XRP’s strong market performance and an evolving regulatory landscape in the U.S. XRP recently surpassed $2 for the first time since 2018 and briefly reached $2.86, its highest level in over five years. Ripple’s momentum coincides with significant changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure who has previously shown interest in the XRP lawsuit , as Gensler’s successor. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market participants anticipate that the incoming administration may foster a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, including resolving the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The cryptocurrency community views these developments as pivotal, particularly for Ripple’s prospects in the U.S. market. The regulatory clarity could open new avenues for XRP adoption, including its integration into mainstream platforms like X. Following the final ruling in August and before the SEC appealed the case, Fred Rispoli, a prominent attorney and popular figure on X, recently called on Musk to integrate XRP into X Payments as a way to get back at the SEC for its pattern of unnecessary legal actions against Musk and the crypto world. However, instead of an act of defiance, Musk’s integration of XRP can be done properly under the new, crypto-friendly administration. An X employee also revealed earlier in the year that XRP would be integrated into X Payments , and it’s only a matter of time before the digital asset receives the spotlight it deserves.

With 50 million users and 6 million daily active users, the team is going to launch the token with a massive token distribution for eligible users. With that, the anticipation is building around the TOMA price performance. Interestingly, the team has already allocated a 30% airdrop in October, and another 30% is going to happen this month with the token launch. Tomarket Airdrop Launch Date and New Updates Previously, the team planned to launch the TOMA token on the TON blockchain, but that has now changed to the Aptos. With a heavy allocation to the community, this is going to be one of the biggest crypto airdrops , especially with the Telegram games category, in which Hamster Kombat and X Empire took place. However, that failed, leading to the HSMTR and X Empire prices struggling on the charts. Regardless, the team has allocated 80% of the total supply (1 Trillion) to the Tomarket airdrop, which will take place in four stages. The first stage included the revelation of 30% of the TOMA tokens, which has already taken place, and the second stage will take place before the listing token listing on December 20, 2024. The players will witness their TOMA airdrop snapshot two days before the launch. The first stage of the Tomarket airdrop ended with allocation only, as the players could not withdraw or trade their tokens. The team clarified that although the tokens were generated, these were just allocations within the app. Next, around 17% of the total supply will be distributed among the eligible users. The early adopters will receive another 3% of the token supply in the last stage. Eligibility and TOMA Token Claim Process Along with preferring the Aptos blockchain over TON, which most Telegram games opted for, the team has also introduced some fun eligibility tasks to earn these TOMA tokens. It includes adding the Tomato emoji to the Telegram username, playing the Tomarket game and reaching the Silver level, connecting the Bitget wallet, and following the Tomarket Channel on the Telegram application. Interestingly, users can complete one more option task to receive additional perks, including 100% token unlock during Tomarket airdrop. For this, the users need to spend $5 to buy a premium medal to earn these extra perks. Once the players have completed these steps, they are automatically eligible for the TOMA airdrop. Next, the players can withdraw their tokens through the Tomarket mini app on Telegram to their wallets. However, the one with a $5 medal buy will receive the full allocation at the launch itself, but the players without that medal will receive only a portion of the token at launch, locking the rest for a vesting period. What Will Be The TOMA Price on Listing? Due to the last-minute change in the total supply of the Tomarket token to 1 Trillion, the players have shown disappointment, especially as the allocation has remained the same despite the increased supply. Moreover, the last two tokens launched from Token games failed, where both the HMSTR and X Empire tokens faced a heavy downtrend. With that, the players are worried about the performance of the TOMA Price. $TOMA supply increased to 1 Trillion I’ve nothing to say pic.twitter.com/nH9rmjJiH5 — Crypto with Khan ( SFZ ) (@Cryptowithkhan) December 13, 2024 For now, it is unclear what the TOMA price will be on the listing. For now, the popular crypto exchange Gate.io has announced its listing with the launch this month, slowly building enthusiasm for the launch. What’s Next For Tomarket Airdrop Waiters? The much anticipated Tomarket airdrop is going live this December before the TOMA token launch on December 20. The team has planned the snapshot reveal two days before the listing, letting the players know their eligibility. The eligible candidate will receive 30% of the total supply of 1 Trillion. Interestingly, the premium medal buyer will receive their allocation all at once on the launch day. However, the non-buyer will receive only a portion of the allocation, and the rest after a vesting period. The team has plans to launch a launch pool and other tasks to earn extra tokens in the meantime, but now it has to see how TOMA price will perform on the charts.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Bitcoin investor, “falsely underreported the (realized) capital gains” from selling Bitcoin worth $3.7 million between 2017 and 2019. The DOJ stated: “All taxpayers are required to report any sale proceeds and gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, on a tax return.” Ahlgren began investing in Bitcoin in 2011 and purchased 1,366 BTC on Coinbase in 2015 when Bitcoin was under $500. In October 2017, he sold approximately 640 BTC at an average price of $5,807.53, generating $3.7 million, which he reinvested in real estate. However, discrepancies were found in Ahlgren’s 2017 federal income tax return. “Ahlgren then filed a false 2017 federal income tax return that substantially inflated the cost basis of the bitcoins, thereby underreporting his true capital gain from his sale of bitcoins,” the DOJ noted. In addition, Ahlgren failed to report over $650,000 in Bitcoin sales in 2018 and 2019. He attempted to conceal the movement of funds using wallet transfers, crypto mixers, and in-person cash transactions. The DOJ revealed: “In total, the tax loss from Ahlgren’s criminal conduct was over $1 million.” Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart Goldberg commented that Ahlgren’s underreporting and concealment “earned him a two-year sentence.” In a landmark decision, the two-year sentence marks the “first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency,” according to Lucy Tan, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Houston Field Office. Tan stated, “Ahlgren will serve time because he believed his cryptocurrency transactions were untraceable.” Ahlgren has also been ordered to serve one year of supervised release and pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 08:29:45

While Synthetix and SolarX have carved out niches in decentralized finance (DeFi), an emerging contender, FX Guys , is turning heads with its innovative ecosystem. Here’s why FXGuys is increasingly favored by long-term holders over these established platforms. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FX Guys: Redefining DeFi and Trading At its core, FXGuys merges the worlds of decentralized finance and proprietary trading. Positioned as a Top PropFi Project, it combines the benefits of staking and trading rewards to offer a robust value proposition for investors. The platform’s $FXG token is gaining traction due to its utility in the ecosystem, particularly with its unique Trade2Earn program, which rewards users for every trade they make. For long-term holders, these features provide consistent incentives to remain engaged in the platform, setting the FXguys apart from competitors like Synthetix and SolarX . Why Long-Term Holders Prefer FX Guys 1. High Rewards Through Staking Long-term investors love assets that provide passive income. With FXGuys , staking $FXG tokens allows holders to earn a 20% profit and revenue share from broker trading volumes. This feature not only rewards loyalty but also drives engagement, ensuring the token’s value remains stable and promising over time. In comparison, while Synthetix offers synthetic assets, it lacks the hands-on, trade-driven rewards that make FXGuys so appealing. 2. Trader Funding Program for Greater Market Access The Trader Funding Program by FX Guys opens opportunities for retail traders to scale their trading activities. By successfully completing trading evaluations, traders can access accounts with up to $500,000 in trading capital, splitting profits 80/20 in their favor. This initiative has positioned FXGuys as one of the best proprietary trading firms, giving traders a chance to maximize their earning potential in a structured, secure environment. For long-term holders, such programs ensure a continuous influx of activity on the platform, further boosting token demand and value. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 3. No Buy/Sell Tax and Decentralized Trading Another major advantage for FXGuys investors is the platform’s no buy or sell tax policy. Combined with no KYC decentralized trading , it ensures a seamless and secure experience for users across the globe. These features make the FXguys attractive to privacy-conscious traders and investors, providing them with the flexibility they need. While SolarX focuses on sustainability and green blockchain initiatives, it doesn’t provide the same direct financial incentives or seamless trading experience that FXGuys offers. How FX Guys Stands Out From the Competition Unlike other platforms, FXGuys isn’t just a DeFi project; it’s a complete ecosystem for traders and investors alike. Whether through the Trade2Earn program, staking opportunities, or its custom trading platform—compatible with MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade— The FX Guys ensures users have multiple avenues to earn and grow their wealth. The ongoing presale of FXGuys, now in its Stage 2, has already raised over $2.6 million, with the token priced at just $0.04. These impressive numbers showcase the growing confidence in the project and its potential as one of the top DeFi coins for the future. Why FX Guys Is a Smart Long-Term Investment For investors seeking high potential altcoins , FXGuys offers a unique blend of DeFi rewards and trading benefits. By staking $FXG tokens , holders can enjoy passive income, while the Trader Funding Program creates continuous activity on the platform, driving token utility. The Trade2Earn initiative further solidifies FXGuys as a leader in incentivized trading ecosystems. In contrast, while Synthetix excels in creating synthetic assets and SolarX focuses on eco-friendly blockchain solutions, neither matches the holistic benefits provided by FXGuys . >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion: FX Guys Is Leading the Way With its Stage 2 presale raising over $2.6 million and a promising future in the crypto trading and DeFi space, FXGuys is quickly becoming the go-to choice for long-term holders. Its innovative approach—combining staking , Trade2Earn , and the Trader Funding Program —ensures a thriving ecosystem that benefits both traders and investors. For those looking to build sustainable wealth, FXGuys provides a compelling alternative to Synthetix and SolarX . Whether you’re a trader or a long-term investor, the opportunities with The FX Guys are unmatched.

XRP has breached a key hurdle, which hints that the next phase involves a massive uptrend. With Ripple emerging as the top gainer in the past 24 hours, investors wonder if this momentum is enough to push XRP price to hit $3 this weekend. Will Ripplle manage to pull off this move? Or will profit-taking trigger a correction? Can Weekend Rally Propel XRP Price to $3? XRP price hitting $3 this weekend is not something unnatural or outside the real of possibility. The spike in bullish momentum that propelled it to become one among top gainers in the past 24 hours could easily push it to the $3 mark. Considering that this target is just 20% away, XRP price can hit $3 this weekend. Apart for the increased momentum, weekends often witness lower liquidity and trading volumes, creating conditions for manipulation that lead to significant price swings in either direction. As mentioned, XRP only requires a 20% rally to reach $3, a move that is not uncommon in the volatile crypto market . This outlook is attainable if BTC continues it move above $100k. Technical indicators also support the possibility of this bullish outlook. With market sentiment improving and crypto assets gaining traction, XRP appears poised for a strong upward movement. If the momentum holds, the $3 target is achievable, marking a significant milestone for Ripple’s native token. XRP Technical Analysis: Ripple’s $3 Weekend Target XRP price has successfully breached its downward-sloping trendline, signaling a reversal in the previous bearish trend. This breakout is the first indication of bullish strength and opens the door for higher price movements. At the time of writing, the value of the XRP is trading at $2.48, with a surge of 7% in the past 24-hours, hovering below the $3 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 63, indicating a bullish trend nearing the overbought region. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators are currently at a positive trend and must hold above their midpoint levels. A decline below these midlines indicates weakening momentum and a rise in bearish pressure, potentially derailing the current outlook. If XRP maintains the above conditions, the price could see a significant 20% upside toward $3. The next few trading sessions will determine whether bulls can hold momentum and push XRP toward this ambitious target. XRP price chart: TradingView The top altcoin must maintain the critical support level at $2.23. A drop below this zone would weaken buyer momentum and cast doubts over a sustained rally. If this level fails, XRP could retrace sharply by approximately 15% to the $1.95 region. The XRP price potential to hit $3 this week depends on sustained bullish momentum and market conditions. Holding key support at $2.23 is critical, while broader crypto optimism could drive the rally further.

Over the last few months, the platform has been under immense pressure to purge its messaging application of illicit content. The pressure led to the arrest of its CEO Pavel Durov in France, where he faces charges over the harmful and illegal content shared on the application. While Durov, who has had his first day in court, is still under strict restriction, the platform seems to have gotten to work. According to Telegram , it has now removed more than 15.4 million illicit groups and channels related to fraud and other illegal activities. In its statement, Telegram highlighted that the feat was achieved using cutting-edge artificial intelligence moderation tools. The move comes after the platform announced a crackdown in September, with Durov noting that they were trying to comply with government requests. Telegram launches new moderation page to monitor efforts The new moderation page aligns with the company’s policy of transparency in its dealings. According to a post from Durov’s Telegram page, the company wants the public to see its efforts at combating these illicit activities. He noted that the moderation team has been working behind the scenes over the last few months, removing the contents that violated its terms, and thanking the users for their help in curbing the menace. Durov promised to bring regular updates that users can see in real-time, showing how much work the moderation team is doing. Telegram moderation overview in 2024. Source: Telegram According to the moderation page, the platform has carried out a higher rate of enforcement after Durov’s arrest. The page notes that the removal of illicit accounts has been in effect since 2015. Blocked illegal groups and channels currently stand at about 15,474,022, representing the figure for only 2024. Telegram also increased its crackdown on Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM) this year, banning a total of 703,809 groups and channels. Aside from user reports and the proactive work from the moderation team, Telegram also reported thousands of instances processed via third-party organizations against CSAM, leading to instant bans. Breaking down the figure, it highlights the top four groups that provided the most reports, including the Internet Watch Foundation, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Child, the Canadian Center for Child Protection, and Stitching Offlimits. Since 2016, Telegram has actively combated violence and terrorist propaganda by providing daily updates on its efforts, which have been recognized by Europol. The company noted that it has worked with numerous organizations on these fronts since 2022, banning 100 million terrorist content. In 2024, Telegram revealed it blocked 129,099 terrorism-related content. Durov’s continued restriction amid moves to combat illicit materials Durov will continue to be under the watchful eyes of French authorities after his first day in court. The Telegram CEO was accompanied by his legal counsel, answering several questions related to the platform’s activities. Although Durov refused to comment on the case after the session, he noted his belief in the French justice system and his innocence. However, if he is found guilty, he could spend up to 10 years in prison, in addition to a $550,000 fine. Meanwhile, Telegram recently announced a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), signaling an attempt to combat illicit child sexual exploitation materials shared on the platform. The charity will identify, and remove these materials, using its cutting-edge AI tools. IWF’s CEO, Derek Ray-Hill, mentioned the great feats both firms could achieve together. “ We look forward to seeing what further steps we can take together to create a world in which the spread of online sexual abuse material is virtually impossible ,” he said.

The conversation highlighted key developments and speculations, including potential pro-crypto policies under a new U.S. administration and rumors about Ripple’s leadership meeting with former President Donald Trump. BREAKING: MICHAEL SAYLOR & PATRICK BET-DAVID DISCUSS $XRP & RIPPLE CEO MEETING WITH TRUMP! “The community with XRP & @Ripple , has anything changed since you and I were last together?” — @patrickbetdavid “I think you’ll have a pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets… pic.twitter.com/yxrnc7G5lU — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) December 13, 2024 Pro-Crypto Regulatory Shift Michael Saylor, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, expressed optimism about a potential shift in U.S. policy favoring digital assets. He predicted that by January, the U.S. could see a “pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets Treasury, a pro-digital assets White House, and a pro-digital assets House and Senate.” Saylor emphasized the need for an ethically, technically, and economically sound regulatory framework to ensure the growth and prosperity of the cryptocurrency sector. Saylor also critiqued the outdated financial compliance systems that hinder innovation and capital formation. He questioned the logic of imposing excessive compliance costs on smaller companies seeking to raise capital, arguing that such policies stifle economic freedom and progress. Ripple’s Growing Influence Saylor acknowledged Ripple’s efforts in exploring use cases beyond Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, noting the proposed launch of Ripple’s RLUSD and its advancements in tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger. These developments underscore Ripple’s commitment to expanding the functionality of blockchain technology and highlight its potential impact on the future of finance.

XRP Community Reactions The crypto community has responded enthusiastically to the video, with many expressing optimism about the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment. Some view Saylor’s recognition of XRP and Ripple’s broader use cases as a significant shift, given his historical focus on Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency. The conversation also highlighted the diverse perspectives within the crypto space, from Elon Musk’s involvement with Dogecoin and Bitcoin to Ripple’s focus on cross-border payments and tokenized assets.

Her tough stance on digital assets, combined with some controversial votes, has made people question whether she’s the right person to lead the commission. With her reconfirmation on the table, it’s clear that the stakes are high, especially for those in the crypto industry. A Concern for Crypto Industry Crenshaw doesn’t exactly have the best track record with crypto. She’s called the markets “petri dishes of fraudulent conduct,” which, yeah, doesn’t exactly sound like someone who’s on the crypto bandwagon. And when she voted against the spot Bitcoin ETF? A lot of people saw that as a direct hit to the progress crypto has been making in becoming a bigger part of the financial world. But—Crenshaw’s defenders will say she’s just trying to protect investors. After all, crypto has seen its share of scams and shady practices. For Crenshaw, her caution is about ensuring that there’s less risk for the little guy, especially when it comes to things like fraud and manipulation in the markets. Source : X.com Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Gemini, has been particularly vocal about the SEC’s actions under Democratic leadership. He’s argued that the SEC has lost credibility and that its enforcement-driven approach isn’t working. Winklevoss even suggested that the SEC’s current stance is causing more harm than good, criticizing the agency for frequently losing cases in court. He believes a shift in leadership, possibly with a GOP-led SEC, could bring more balance and credibility back to the commission. Why Democrats Are Still Backing Her While some in the crypto world are shaking their heads , Democrats are pretty solid behind Crenshaw. Her priority? Protecting regular investors. Crenshaw pushed for stricter rules, more transparency, and a safer market for everyday people. If you’re thinking “Isn’t that a good thing?” Then you’re on the same page as many Democrats who want to make sure there is no growth freedom for the crypto sector. For them crypto is a scam and a threat to the currency and economy. But it’s not just about being cautious. Crenshaw has also supported building a framework to regulate digital assets. Democrats see this as a necessary step to prevent any wild, unpredictable market crashes. And with the SEC already under a microscope, Crenshaw’s reconfirmation gives them a chance to keep some consistency in how things are done. What Does This Mean for Crypto? Let’s say Crenshaw gets reconfirmed, well that might bring the worst time for the crypto sectors. The regulations could get more restricted along with more enforcement actions and fewer approvals for crypto ETFs. On the other hand, Crenshaw is a win for Democrats. With her in power, they could push their own goals of financial stability. But for crypto advocates, it’s a missed opportunity to allow freedom to innovation growth.

While Bitcoin was speculated to lose the $95,000 support after just one test, the sluggish behaviour of Ethereum has also raised many concerns. Meanwhile, the latest recovery of the BTC price has revived the possibility of a healthy ascending trend with the ETH price, and the second-largest token continues to follow the star crypto pretty closely. The ETH price has been maintaining a steep ascending trend since the start of the quarter, and hence, despite the bearish interference, it is believed to slice through the important resistance levels. The major reason for the continuation of the bullish momentum this upcoming week is the strong on-chain metrics, like a massive rise in the daily active addresses. The Intotheblock data shared by popular analyst Ali , the active addresses are up by over 4.24%, while the new addresses surged by 2.65%. Meanwhile, the zero-balance addresses have plunged by over 4%, suggesting that market participants are optimistic about the upcoming trend. With this, the ETH price has surged above the crucial resistance levels between $3700 and $3810, wherein more than 3 million wallets have bought over 4.6 million ETH. Therefore, the traders are now confident of a potential weekend jump, which may help the price to break $5000 as demand and supply dynamics strengthen. The end of the sluggish behaviour of the ETH price can be determined by the growing strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC pair is stuck within a descending parallel channel, and regardless of a rebound, the levels do not display any possibility of a steep rise. As seen in the above chart, the weekly ETH/BTC pair has failed to rise above the average bands of the channel with a rise in the bearish activity. Moreover, the bearish pattern remains intact since Q4 2022, suggesting the second-largest token failing to trade independently. Therefore, it is required for the BTC price to rise above the current ATH, which may help the ETH price to not only cross $4000 but also achieve the important resistance at $4200. This move may slightly increase the strength of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, which could compel the ETH/BTC to surpass the average levels of the band and eventually elevate close to the resistance. Back in 2021, the ETH/BTC broke above the consolidation and soared high to mark highs which enabled the price to mark a new ATH. Therefore, a breakout of the ongoing consolidation may also have an equal impact over the Ethereum (ETH) price rally, which may rise and reach a 5-digit level in the upcoming bull run.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 08:45:39

Delays, opposition from the crypto industry, and disagreements have made her confirmation a challenge. The outcome will impact cryptocurrency regulations and the Ripple case. Crenshaw’s renomination is hanging in the balance as the U.S. Senate has just five days left before adjourning for the year. Delays, disagreements, and opposition from the crypto industry have turned her reappointment into a tight deadline challenge. To confirm Crenshaw, two key votes are needed: one by the Senate Banking Committee and another by the full Senate. However, time is short. Senator Sherrod Brown must give three days’ notice for a committee vote, and even if it happens soon, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have just two days to schedule the full Senate vote. With the Senate focused on budget and defense bills, there’s little time left for Crenshaw’s nomination. Recent delays have made things worse. On December 11, a committee vote was delayed due to scheduling rules. Republican Senators, led by Tim Scott, stopped a waiver that would have let the committee meet longer. Now, Senator Brown must reschedule the vote, but with little time left, completing the entire confirmation process seems unlikely. Crypto industry opposes Crenshaw Crenshaw’s renomination faces strong opposition from the crypto community, with arguments that her strict regulations hurt innovation . She has been outspoken against spot Bitcoin ETFs and is skeptical about the crypto market overall. The Digital Chamber, a group supporting blockchain and digital assets, has asked the Senate Banking Committee to reject Crenshaw’s renomination. In a December 11 letter , they called for an SEC Commissioner who supports innovation while ensuring proper regulation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has also criticized Crenshaw, calling her a failure and urging lawmakers to block her reappointment. The Cedar Innovation Foundation, a dark-money group linked to undisclosed crypto interests, has launched a digital ad campaign portraying Crenshaw as “more anti-crypto than Gensler.” For Ripple and the SEC leadership Crenshaw’s renomination is important for both the Ripple case and the SEC’s crypto policies. If reappointed, she could influence whether the SEC moves forward with its appeal in the Ripple case, with a deadline of January 15. This situation is similar to former SEC Chair Jay Clayton’s decision to file the Ripple lawsuit before leaving. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is stepping down on January 20, might file the appeal brief as one of his last actions. Additionally, Crenshaw’s renomination could affect the SEC’s future approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. If she isn’t reappointed, a new commissioner from former President Trump’s team could bring a more crypto-friendly perspective to the SEC. Democrats push for confirmation Democrats are in a hurry to confirm Crenshaw before they might lose their Senate majority in January. Some critics believe this rush is a strategic move to secure Crenshaw’s role and keep the SEC’s current approach to regulations in place. Although Democratic senators support Crenshaw, the strong pushback from the crypto industry and delays in the process make her renomination uncertain. If all the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee vote for her, her nomination could move to the full Senate. But with limited time left and growing opposition, it’s unclear whether she’ll be confirmed. Whether she stays at the SEC or is replaced will have a big impact on the agency, crypto regulations, and the ongoing Ripple case. The next few days are crucial in deciding the future of the SEC and its approach to cryptocurrency.

Most altcoins are also in the red today with modest gains. XRP and BNB stand out as the biggest daily gainers. BTC Eyes New ATH? The start of the business week was quite painful for the primary cryptocurrency as it dumped toward $94,400 on a couple of occasions. However, it managed to bounce off after touching that support line the second time and shot up to $98,000 on Wednesday. The gains continued in the following days, with BTC going back into six-digit territory on Thursday. Aside from a few brief price slips below that level, bitcoin has managed to remain above it for the most part. Furthermore, it skyrocketed to over $102,500 earlier this morning to mark a nine-day peak. It has lost some ground since then and sits below $102,000 as of now, but it is still 1.5% up on the day. This has pushed its market capitalization to well above $2 trillion. Its dominance over the alts has retraced slightly from the weekly high of 53% to 52.5%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 14.12.2024. Source: TradingView XRP, BNB on the Rise Most larger-cap alts are with minor gains today. ETH has reclaimed $3,900 after a slight 1% increase. SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB have marked similar gains. Binance Coin is up by 3% and trades above $725. XRP has stolen the show from the larger caps, having surged by 6%. It even tapped $2.5 earlier today but has retraced slightly since then. LINK, XLM, and TRX are the other notable gainers. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets still sits above $3.8 trillion after a 1% increase in the past 24 hours. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The cryptocurrency surged 4.5% to near the $5 barrier for the second time this week, fueling investors’ optimism about the token’s future price action. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analysts Eye $4,100 Target As ETH Reclaims Key Support Level SUI Nears $5 After New ATH SUI has been one of the leading cryptocurrencies this bull run, rising over 521% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 182% since Q4 started. The token also outperformed the market throughout the Q2 and Q3 retraces, registering massive gains while most altcoins struggled. As the crypto market started to gain steam in preparations for the US elections, SUI saw a brief consolidation period after surpassing its March ATH. The token hovered between the $1.7-$2.3 price range before continuing the “price discovery” mode in November. The post-US election pump propelled the cryptocurrency’s price past the $3 barrier and near the $4 mark before retracing. Nonetheless, SUI’s momentum resumed on December 5 when it hit the $4.5 mark, fueled by Bitcoin’s first-ever surge above $100,000. The token’s rally continued this week, with SUI registering a 14% increase in the last seven days, which led to its latest $4.92 milestone on Friday morning. SUI’s remarkable performance also drove the token to the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after flipping Polkadot (DOT). SUI’s Price To Peak In June? Amid SUI’s performance, several analysts noted that the token, often called “Solana’s “killer,” seems to be repeating SOL’s 2021 path. Market watcher Mags compared the two charts, suggesting investors won’t be ready for SUI’s upcoming movements. During the 2020-2021 cycle, Solana saw a massive rally that drove its price to its previous ATH. Its price action saw SOL gain steam at the end of 2020 and surge to its first major high of the year in May 2021. Then, Solana consolidated for a few months before resuming its run, peaking at $259 in late November 2021. According to Ali Martinez, SUI’s performance earlier this year resembled Solana’s initial climb last cycle, jumping to its $2.3 high before consolidating for a few months. Now that it has broken past its March ATH, SUI continues to move similarly to SOL, which could suggest that the token is poised for a massive surge soon. If it continues this pattern, the cryptocurrency could hit the $5 mark in the coming days after a brief consolidation in the $4.5-$4.8 price range. Trader Crypto Rand highlighted that SUI is in “full bullish momentum,” also forecasting it will hit the $5 mark soon.

Another pseudonym crypto trader predicted that the token could be near the $8 barrier by early 2025 and hit the $16 mark by Q2, following SOL’s path. Based on the chart, SUI could see its rally extended until June 2025, when it would hit its peak around the $40 mark. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $4.79, a 50% surge in the monthly timeframe.

With clearer regulations coming, he believes Bitcoin and the entire crypto market are set to soar. But that’s not all—Morehead also revealed the top 3 altcoins he’s betting on to skyrocket during the upcoming Bitcoin bull run. Institutional Investors Are Ready to Move In Dan Morehead is especially confident that 2025 will be a turning point. He thinks the regulatory environment will become clearer, making it easier for big institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Right now, most institutions don’t have much exposure to crypto. But once the rules are clearer, a lot of institutional money could flow into the market, driving Bitcoin’s price much higher even $1 million price is possible. One of the most interesting ideas Morehead discussed was the possibility of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . He pointed out that the U.S. already owns about 1% of the world’s Bitcoin, and he thinks the U.S. could increase its holdings. Morehead thinks this is a smart move, as Bitcoin could become a valuable asset in the digital age, just like gold has been for centuries. Dan Morehead’s Big Bets: TON, Solana, ONDO While Bitcoin is always a big focus for Morehead, he’s also making big investments in several promising altcoins. He mentioned that Pantera Capital has significant positions in TON, Solana, and ONDO. Morehead believes these altcoins have great potential and could rise in value as Bitcoin leads the next bull run. His strong confidence in these tokens suggests they could see impressive growth in the coming months.

That’s the vibe BTFD Coin (BTFD) is riding as it dominates the meme coin scene with a killer presale and an innovative ecosystem. Meanwhile, Brett Coin, the mascot of Base Chain, continues to draw attention with its unique community, and Popcat’s rollercoaster volatility keeps investors intrigued. With so many options, which are the best meme coins to join today? Let’s dive in to see what makes these three coins buzzworthy—and why BTFD might just be your golden ticket. BTFD Coin: A Community on the Rise, Turning Dips into Dreams Picture this: A P2E game beta that’s already live, presale stages selling out like hotcakes, and over 53 billion tokens grabbed by more than 5,000 holders. That’s BTFD Coin for you! This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a rallying cry for those ready to flip the script on market downturns. The BTFD’s meme coin presale is making waves, sitting proudly in its 12th stage with $3.7 million raised so far. It blew past the $1 million mark in just 10 days and smashed $2.5 million within 14 days. At $0.00013 per coin right now, early adopters stand to reap serious rewards. When the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006 per coin. Imagine putting $500 into this presale now—you’d bag 3,846,153 coins. When the listing price hits, that same stash would be worth over $2,300. Not bad for catching the dip early, right? But the presale is just the tip of the iceberg. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is already live. While rewards aren’t up for grabs just yet, the gameplay sets the stage for a revolution in crypto gaming. Add staking rewards averaging a jaw-dropping 90% APY, and it’s clear why BTFD is causing such a stir. With its Ethereum backbone, secure tokenomics, and a loyal community known as the Bulls Squad, BTFD isn’t just about buying dips; it’s about building wealth. The maximum supply is capped at 173 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and value for early holders. From a well-thought-out roadmap to bold marketing campaigns, everything about BTFD screams opportunity. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to join today, BTFD’s presale is your chance to be part of something big. Brett Coin: The Mascot of Base Chain Holds Steady Brett Coin has become a cultural icon in the crypto world, representing the thriving Base Chain ecosystem. Its all-time high of $0.2342 earlier this year turned heads, but it currently trades at $0.1749. Despite a 47% drop in April due to insider supply concerns, Brett has bounced back with steady community support. Its integration into the Base Chain ecosystem is a game-changer. With listings on major exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io, and OKX DEX, Brett has built a reputation for accessibility and liquidity. Brett’s appeal lies in its simplicity and cultural resonance. It’s more than just a token; it’s a symbol of a community uniting under a shared vision. Speculation about future listings on Binance and Coinbase adds an air of excitement. While Brett isn’t as dynamic as BTFD in terms of ecosystem innovation, it’s a solid choice for those looking for a reliable meme coin with potential for long-term gains. If you’re after the best meme coins to join today, Brett offers a different kind of opportunity—one rooted in community and steady growth. Popcat: Volatile, Unpredictable, and Intriguing Popcat is the wildcard of this trio. As a Solana-based meme coin, it’s gained a reputation for its extreme volatility and unpredictable price swings. Trading at $1.31 with a market cap of $1.21 billion, Popcat has attracted a mix of risk-tolerant investors and meme enthusiasts. Recent market trends have been a rollercoaster. Popcat saw an 11% decline over 24 hours in December, showcasing just how unpredictable it can be. Yet, analysts see potential for a 25% rally, with a price target of $1.53. It’s a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. What makes Popcat unique is its cultural cachet. Despite downturns, it’s occasionally outperformed stalwarts like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its presence in the meme coin sector speaks volumes about its staying power. However, Popcat’s volatility is a double-edged sword. While it offers opportunities for quick gains, it requires a steady hand and a solid risk appetite. For those who love a good gamble, Popcat could be one of the best meme coins to join today. Just remember this cat’s got claws. Don’t Miss the Dip—Join the Movement The meme coin market is buzzing with opportunities, but few stand out like BTFD. With its record-breaking presale, innovative P2E game, and unbeatable staking rewards, it’s a no-brainer for those ready to seize the moment. Brett Coin offers stability and community, while Popcat brings the thrill of volatility. Based on current trends, BTFD’s crypto presale is a golden opportunity you don’t want to miss. With over $3.7 million already raised and a listing price set to soar, now’s the time to jump in. Visit the BTFD website and join the presale today. It’s your chance to turn the dip into your next big win. These are the best meme coins to join today. Don’t wait—the dip won’t last forever!

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 09:30:00

Amid this, a major listing announcement for Ripple’s native crypto has further bolstered investors’ confidence in the asset. Notably, the listing or any positive developments by the major exchanges tend to fuel hopes for investors, showcasing the exchanges’ soaring interest in the assets. XRP Sees Major Listing Sparking Optimism XRP has recorded a massive surge today as investors started regaining confidence in the asset. Amid this, a leading crypto exchange has announced that it is listing the token on its platform, which has gained significant attention from investors. For context, Arkham Exchange said on December 13 that it planned to list Ripple’s native crypto on its platform. Besides, it said that it would list the token for both spot and perpetual pairs, further showcasing the exchange’s confidence in the asset. Source: Arkham, X Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that in a following post regarding the listing, the exchange said “XRP TRADING IS NOW LIVE”, which has caught the eyes of market enthusiasts. Besides, it also comes amid a time when the crypto has recorded a strong rally recently, indicating strong market confidence towards the crypto. On the other hand, a flurry of other positive developments has also fueled market hopes. Besides, the investors also shifted their focus towards the asset as the January 15, 2025, deadline for the principal brief in the Ripple Vs SEC case approaches . However, many anticipate the US SEC Chair Gary Gensler to cause significant problems in the ongoing legal battle before he steps down on January 20. What’s Next For Ripple? In the latest XRP lawsuit news , plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit against Ripple Labs have filed appeals in the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court. The appeal challenges recent judgments in favor of Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and XRP II. Notably, the plaintiffs are seeking to overturn orders on summary judgment and other pending arguments that Ripple won in the district court. However, despite the recent challenges, the market optimism remained strong towards the asset. Besides, the latest listing by the top crypto exchange has also fueled market discussions over its potential impact on the asset’s price ahead. Notably, the latest XRP price showed a surge of around 6% to $2.46, while its trading volume jumped 10% to $10.29 billion. The token has touched a 24-hour high of $2.52, with a monthly gain of nearly 250%. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed Ripple’s native crypto’s Futures Open Interest jumped 13%, suggesting a strong market interest in the crypto. Meanwhile, the recent NYDFS approval for Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD has also fueled investors’ confidence in the firm. On the other hand, these recent developments also indicate a potential XRP ETF approval in the US by next year. Besides, a recent price analysis for Ripple’s native crypto indicates a potential rally to $3 this weekend.

The cryptocurrency market has gained momentum over the last month, attracting significant attention from investors. Shiba Inu maintains a strong upward trajectory, signaling potential for further growth. Elliott Wave analysis predicts the possibility of SHIB doubling its value soon. Elliot Wave Analysis Hints Shiba Inu Price Could 2X Crypto analyst shared an X post illustrating a bullish Elliot Wave pattern for Shiba Inu ($SHIB). The chart reflects an ABC wave structure, signaling a possible significant price movement in the coming months. Wave A was initiated during late Q4 2023, establishing the foundation for this pattern. Wave B concluded in early Q3 2024, marking a correction phase. Based on the analyst’s projection, Wave C could drive SHIB’s price toward $0.00050, representing an approximate 100% surge from its current value. Source- X Over the past week, the meme-based coin has seen a slight bearish trend after a market consolidation. However, the SHIB price has recently resurged in the crypto market, with BTC hovering above $100K, fueling the surge. At the reporting time, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00002849, with a surge of 2% in the past 24-hours. SHIB’s Supply on Exchanges Plumment As Whales Accumulate The whale activity surrounding SHIB has become a focal point as key metrics reveal bullish trends. The supply of SHIB on exchanges, represented by the red line, has significantly dropped. This decline suggests that investors transfer their tokens to cold wallets, signaling growing confidence in the asset’s long-term value. A reduced exchange supply often results in lower selling pressure, a positive development for price stability and growth. The supply of SHIB held by top non-exchange addresses, shown by the yellow line, steadily increases. This indicates active accumulation by major investors, or whales, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Whales are typically seen as market leaders, and their growing holdings suggest optimism about SHIB’s future potential. Together, these trends point to a stronger market position for SHIB, driven by reduced sell-side pressure and increased accumulation. Source- Santiment SHIB Technical Analysis After a recent market correction, SHIB’s price shows signs of recovery. The cryptocurrency trades above $0.000028. Despite this, key technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum ahead. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displays cautious optimism. The MACD line remains above the signal line, albeit slightly narrowing. If accompanied by stronger volume, continuing this positive divergence could trigger a price rally. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.14, indicating significant capital inflow. A consistent rise in this metric suggests growing investor confidence, which could fuel further upward momentum for SHIB. SHIB/USDT price Chart: TradingView Immediate resistance lies at $0.00003, followed by $0.000035. If the bullish trend sustains, the Shiba Inu price prediction might target $0.00004. If bullish momentum strengthens, SHIB could test the $0.00005 mark in the coming weeks. On the downside, strong support is observed at $0.00002500, with another layer at $0.00002000. The Shiba Inu price shows potential for a 2X surge, driven by bullish Elliott Wave patterns and whale accumulation. Technical indicators signal sustained upward momentum, reinforcing optimism for significant price growth in the coming months.

Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Minotaurus (MTAUR), XRP (XRP), and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) have captured the attention of large-scale investors. Here’s an analysis of why these whale-favored tokens could turn $1,000 into a six-figure portfolio. Top Whale-Favored Tokens to Turn $1,000 into $100,000 in the Next Altcoin Rally 1. Dogecoin (DOGE): Riding the Whale Wave to $1 Dogecoin whales have recently bought 160 million DOGE in just one day, according to an X post by Ali Martinez. This showcases a renewed interest in the meme-based cryptocurrency. The accumulation by DOGE whales coincides with DOGE exceeding the $0.46 resistance level, suggesting favorable momentum. Price Predictions and Bullish Indicators Next Targets: $0.50 and the prior all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376. Potential rally: Analysts indicate that an 85% price increase is feasible, bringing DOGE nearer to the eagerly awaited $1 threshold. Technical Indicators: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays bullish crossover signals, while the RSI at 47.91 suggests that buyers are regaining control following a consolidation period. Why choose DOGE? DOGE’s lasting appeal, significant whale investments, and Elon Musk’s occasional promotions position it as a contender for substantial growth in the upcoming altcoin surge. At the present cost of $0.407, a rise to $1 would result in considerable profits for this best meme coin to buy . 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Rising Star in Blockchain Gaming Minotaurus blends blockchain technology with immersive gaming, offering users unique experiences like premium features, avatar upgrades, and exclusive zones. The whale-favored token is positioned as a central asset in the burgeoning blockchain gaming industry. Current Market Highlights Presale Opportunity: MTAUR tokens are available at $0.00006001 USDT, well below the anticipated listing price. Audited Security: Trusted firms like SolidProof and Coinsult have certified the platform’s integrity. Community Engagement: Minotaurus has raised over 300,000 USDT, with additional incentives like a 100,000 USDT giveaway. Why choose MTAUR Early buyers could see exponential gains as MTAUR taps into the rapidly expanding gaming sector. With its innovative model and strong backing, MTAUR has the potential to deliver outsized yields in the coming altcoin market surge. 3. XRP: Poised for a Historic Breakout XRP whales have been active, with one whale buying over 100 million XRP in the recent dip, and another one t ransferring $329 million worth of tokens. Such large-scale movements align with expectations of a bullish breakout, possibly driving XRP toward new ATHs. Price and Technical Analysis Current Price : $2.46 Resistance Levels: Breaking $2.52 could trigger a rally to $5.85, aligning with Fibonacci extension levels. Long-Term Target: Analysts project an upward trajectory to $18.22, contingent on market conditions and Ripple’s legal developments. Why XRP? Ripple’s legal progress with the SEC, increasing institutional adoption, and significant whale activity position XRP as a top crypto to buy for explosive growth. Its technical setup suggests a breakout is imminent, offering an opportunity for transformative gains. 4. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): The Whales’ New Favorite Virtuals Protocol has seen substantial whale interest, with two wallets acquiring 4.25 million VIRTUAL tokens for $2.35 each. Another whale spent 406 ETH to secure 664,361 tokens at $2.39, according to Lookonchain . Source: Lookonchain Price and Market Sentiment Current Price : $2.46 Whale Activity: Large purchases indicate confidence in VIRTUAL’s growth potential. Unique Value Proposition: As a next-gen blockchain protocol, VIRTUAL aims to revolutionize decentralized applications, drawing significant investor interest. Growth Potential The increasing whale activity and innovative applications of VIRTUAL suggest that early investments could yield substantial returns. With the token already attracting major capital inflows, it’s poised for a strong performance in the next bull run. Final Thoughts: Transforming $1K into $100K with Whale-Favored Tokens DOGE: Established popularity and whale-driven momentum toward $1. MTAUR: Early-stage cryptocurrency with significant upside potential in the crypto gaming sector. XRP: Strong technical indicators and legal clarity could trigger a rally to new ATHs. VIRTUAL: Whale-backed innovation in blockchain applications. For those seeking to maximize gains in the next altcoin surge, these whale-favored tokens represent some of the best opportunities for exponential returns. However, as with any investment, risks remain, so conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before diving in.

Hill, who took the reins on December 13, laid out a clear agenda on CNBC’s Squawk Box . Hill’s top priority? To fix the regulatory chaos that’s been crippling the crypto industry while pushing innovation and making U.S. financial markets more competitive. He has come into this role amid huge political changes, including the Republican Party’s sweeping victories in November. These changes, along with SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s upcoming resignation, have triggered a full-on bull run. Crypto regulation, stablecoins, and FIT21 Hill wants to end the SEC’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, he said. “We need a market structure for digital assets… This is not helping America succeed.” At the heart of Hill’s strategy is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21. This comprehensive bill proposes a regulatory framework for crypto, dividing oversight between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) based on a project’s level of decentralization. Despite passing in the House earlier this year, the bill stalled in the Senate. Hill is determined to push it forward, with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise promising to prioritize the legislation within the first 100 days of the new congressional session. Stablecoins are another pillar of Hill’s agenda. He’s advocating for a U.S.-backed stablecoin as part of broader efforts to modernize payment systems and keep America competitive. “Our Majority Leader Steve Scalise has it on his first 100 days of the House to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets,” Hill said. A strategic Bitcoin reserve? One of the most intriguing topics Hill addressed is the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. This concept has gained traction among Republicans, with President-elect Donald Trump pledging to establish such a reserve during his campaign. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent crypto lover, has already drafted a bill that would require the U.S. Treasury to acquire one million Bitcoin over five years. Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione is pursuing a similar plan at the state level, proposing a Bitcoin reserve funded through donations. When asked about the federal government adopting a Bitcoin reserve, Hill expressed caution. “I’d have to think long and hard about what value that is to the United States or the Treasury,” he said during the interview. His response suggests a more measured approach compared to the outright enthusiasm shown by some of his Republican colleagues. Trump is considering handing the CFTC oversight of digital assets, a move that would classify most crypto projects as commodities if they meet certain criteria. Trump has also nominated Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, to replace Gensler as SEC chair. Atkins’ past work as co-chair of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance is seen as a promising sign for the industry, which has long been calling for leadership that understands the nuances of blockchain technology. Banking reforms and capital markets Hill isn’t just focused on crypto. His agenda includes reforms aimed at easing the regulatory burden on smaller banks and improving capital formation for public companies. He criticized the current banking regulations for driving consolidation toward the largest financial institutions. “The regulatory burden actually pushes consolidation in the banking industry to the largest bank because nobody can cope with the regulatory burden,” Hill said. His focus on capital markets is just as sharp. Hill wants to remove what he calls “barnacles on the ship of state,” referring to outdated rules that make it harder for companies to go public. He’s pushing for a streamlined regulatory environment that encourages innovation while maintaining strong consumer protections. These reforms, Hill argues, will make U.S. markets more attractive and competitive on a global scale. Hill also emphasized the need for stronger partnerships between banks and fintech companies. He believes fintech can play a critical role in improving compliance and customer service, two areas where traditional banking often falls short.

We expect this pro-Bitcoin stance to ripple across the broader U.S. crypto ecosystem. Crypto rails promise a better financial system through improved efficiency, decentralization, and greater transparency. By the end of 2025, we project that Blob Space fees will exceed $1 billion, up from negligible levels today. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Before we get into our 2025 predictions, let's take a moment to review how our 2024 calls stacked up. Out of 15 predictions made back in December 2023, we score ourselves 8.5/15. A 0.566 batting average might not be perfect, but it's enough to keep us in the game. With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) smashing $100k and Ethereum (ETH-USD) breaking $4k, even some of our misses were part of a year to remember. Crypto Predictions Review for 2024 Debut of spot BTC ETP s - (1 point) Bitcoin halving proceeds smoothly - (1 point) Bitcoin reaches all-time high in 4Q2024 - (1 point) Ethereum remains #2 to bitcoin - (1 point) L2s dominate Ethereum activity (but L2 TVL still below Ethereum's) - (0.5 points) Stablecoin market cap hits record high - (1 point) Decentralized exchanges attain record share of spot volumes - (1 point) SOL outperforms ETH - (1 point) DePIN network adoption grows - (1 point) Now, let's get into the main event: our crypto predictions for 2025. 1. Crypto bull market hits a medium-term peak in Q1, sets new highs in Q4 We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle's apex, we project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000 , with Ethereum trading above $6,000 . Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL-USD) and Sui (SUI-USD), could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year. To gauge when the market is nearing its top, we are monitoring these key signals : Sustained High Funding Rates: When traders borrow to bet on BTC price increases, they are willing to pay funding rates exceeding 10% for three months or more, which indicates speculative excess. BTC Perps Funding > 10% For Months Would be Bearish 10% For Months Would be Bearish"" contenteditable=""false""> Sources: Glass Node as of 12/8/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Excessive Unrealized Profits: If the proportion of BTC holders sitting on significant paper gains (a profit-to-cost ratio of 70% or higher) stabilizes, it suggests market euphoria. Overvalued Market Cap Relative to Realized Value: When MVRV (market value to realized value) scores exceed 5 , it shows BTC prices are far above average purchase prices, often signaling overheated conditions. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: If Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market drops below 40% , it implies a speculative shift into riskier altcoins, a classic late-cycle behavior. Mainstream Speculation: A flood of texts from non-crypto-savvy friends asking about questionable projects is a reliable signal of speculative mania near the top. These indicators have historically been reliable signals of market exuberance and will guide our outlook as we navigate 2025's anticipated market cycles. 2. U.S. embraces bitcoin with strategic reserve(s) and increased crypto adoption The election of Donald Trump has already injected significant momentum into the crypto market, driven by his administration's appointments of crypto-friendly leaders to pivotal positions, including VP JD Vance, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Mary Bessent, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Jelena McWilliams, and HHS Secretary RFK Jr, and more. These appointments signal not just the end of anti-crypto policies, such as the systematic de-banking of crypto companies and their founders, but also the start of a policy framework that positions Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Crypto ETPs: in-kind creations, staking, and new spot approvals New SEC leadership, or possibly the CFTC, will approve multiple new spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S., including the VanEck Solana offering. Ethereum ETP functionality expands to include staking, further enhancing its utility for holders, while both Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs support in-kind creations/redemptions. The repeal of SEC Rule SAB 121, either by the SEC or Congress, will pave the way for banks and brokers to custody spot crypto, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure. Sovereign bitcoin adoption: federal, state, and mining expansion We predict that by 2025, either the federal government or at least one U.S. state-likely Pennsylvania, Florida, or Texas-will establish a Bitcoin reserve. Federally, this is more likely to occur through an executive order utilizing the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), though bipartisan legislation remains a wildcard. Simultaneously, state governments may act independently, viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal uncertainty or a tool to attract crypto investment and innovation. On the Bitcoin mining side, the number of countries mining Bitcoin with government resources is expected to reach double digits (currently at seven) as BRICS adoption grows. This trend is fueled by Russia's stated intent to settle international trade in crypto, highlighting Bitcoin's increasing importance in global economic strategies. Number of Countries Mining Bitcoin with Government Resources Source: VanEck Research as of 12/2024. We expect this pro-Bitcoin stance to ripple across the broader U.S. crypto ecosystem. The share of global crypto developers based in the U.S. will rise from 19% to 25% as regulatory clarity and incentives draw talent and companies back. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Bitcoin mining will flourish, with the U.S. share of global mining hash rate increasing from 28% in 2024 to 35% by the end of 2025, driven by cheap energy and potentially favorable tax policies. Together, these trends will solidify America's leadership in the global Bitcoin economy. U.S.-Listed Company's Share of Bitcoin Hash Rate to Reach 35% Source: JPMorgan, VanEck Research s of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Corporate bitcoin holdings: poised to surge 43% In terms of corporate adoption, we expect companies to continue accumulating Bitcoin from retail holders. Currently, 68 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a number we project to reach 100 by 2025 . Notably, we boldly predict that the total Bitcoin held by private and public companies-currently 765,000 BTC -will surpass Satoshi Nakamoto's holdings of 1.1 million BTC by next year. This implies a remarkable growth rate of 43% in corporate Bitcoin holdings over the coming year.

The value of tokenized securities exceeds $50 billion Onchain Securities Grew 61% in 2024 Sources: RWA.xyz, Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Crypto rails promise a better financial system through improved efficiency, decentralization, and greater transparency. We believe that 2025 will be the year that tokenized securities take off. Already, there is ~$12B worth of tokenized securities on blockchains, with the majority ($9.5B) being tokenized private credit securities listed on the Figure's semi-permissioned blockchain called Provenance. In the future, we see enormous potential for tokenized securities to launch on public chains. We theorize that there are many incentives for investors to push for tokenized equity or debt securities launched exclusively onchain. In the next year, we project that entities like the DTCC will enable tokenized assets that seamlessly transition between public blockchains and private, closed infrastructure. This dynamic will result in standards for performing AML/KYC for on-chain investors. As a wildcard bet, we forecast that Coinbase will take the unprecedented step of tokenizing COIN stock and deploying it to its BASE blockchain. 4. Stablecoins daily settlement volumes reach $300 billion Monthly Stablecoin Transfers ((USD)) Were Up 180% YoY in 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Stablecoins will leapfrog their niche role in crypto trading to become a core part of global commerce. By the end of 2025, we project stablecoins will settle $300B daily transfers-equivalent to 5% of DTCC's current volumes, up from ~$100B daily in November 2024. Their adoption by major tech companies (think Apple and Google) and payment networks (Visa, Mastercard) will redefine the economics of payments. Beyond trading, the remittance market will explode. U.S.-Mexico stablecoin transfers, for instance, could grow 5x, from $80M to $400M monthly. Why? Speed, cost savings, and the growing trust of millions who see stablecoins not as experiments but as practical tools. For all the talk of blockchain adoption, stablecoins are its Trojan Horse . 5. AI agents' onchain activity surpasses 1 million agents Total Revenue for AI Agents is $8.7M in 5 Weeks Sources: Dune @jdhpyer as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results One of the most compelling narratives we believe will translate into massive traction in 2025 is AI Agents. AI agents are specialized AI bots that direct users to achieve outcomes such as ""maximizing yield"" or ""spurring X/Twitter engagement."" The agents optimize these outcomes by utilizing their abilities to change their strategies autonomously. AI agents are often fed data and trained to specialize in one domain. Currently, protocols like Virtuals give anyone the tools to create an AI agent to perform on-chain tasks. Virtuals allow non-experts to access decentralized AI agent contributors such as fine-tuners, dataset providers, and model developers so that non-technical people can create their own AI agents. The result will be the enormous proliferation of agents their creators can lease out to generate income. The current focus of agent building has been DeFi, but we believe that AI agents will transcend financial activities. Agents can be employed to act as social media influencers, computer players in gaming, and interactive companions/helpers in consumer applications. Agents have already become important X/Twitter influencers, such as Bixby and Terminal of Truths , who reached 92k and 197k followers, respectively. As such, we believe the enormous potential for agents will result in the birth of over 1 million new agents in 2025. 6. Bitcoin layer-2s reach 100,000 BTC in total value locked (TVL) Bitcoin L2s TVLs Reach 30k BTC, 600% Increase YTD 2024 Sources: Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We are closely monitoring the emergence of Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) blockchains, which hold immense potential for transforming Bitcoin's ecosystem. Scaling Bitcoin enables these L2 solutions to enable lower latency and higher transaction throughput, addressing the limitations of the base layer. Moreover, Bitcoin L2s enhance Bitcoin's capabilities by introducing smart contract functionality, which can power a robust decentralized finance ((DEFI)) ecosystem built around Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin can be moved off the Bitcoin blockchain to smart contract platforms through bridged or wrapped BTC, which rely on third-party systems prone to hacks and security vulnerabilities. Bitcoin L2 solutions aim to address these risks by offering frameworks that integrate directly with Bitcoin's base layer, minimizing reliance on centralized intermediaries. While liquidity constraints and adoption hurdles remain, Bitcoin L2s promise to enhance security and decentralization, giving BTC holders greater confidence to use their Bitcoin in decentralized ecosystems actively. As shown in the chart, Bitcoin L2 solutions have experienced explosive growth in 2024, with total value locked (TVL) surpassing 30,000 BTC-a 600% increase year-to-date, amounting to approximately $3 billion . Currently, over 75 Bitcoin L2 projects are in development, though only a select few are likely to achieve significant adoption over the long term. This rapid growth reflects strong demand from BTC holders seeking yield generation and broader utility for their assets. Bitcoin will also become an integral part of DeFi as chain abstraction technology and Bitcoin L2s mature into usable products for end users. For instance, platforms like Ika on Sui or Near's chain abstraction used by Infinex highlight how innovative multi-chain solutions will enhance Bitcoin's interoperability with other ecosystems. By enabling secure and efficient on-chain borrowing, lending, and other permissionless DeFi solutions, Bitcoin L2s and abstraction technology will transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active participant in decentralized ecosystems. As adoption scales, these technologies unlock substantial opportunities for on-chain liquidity, cross-chain innovation, and a more integrated financial future. 7. Ethereum blob space generates $1 billion in fees Ethereum Blobs Posted Per Day Sources: Dune @hildobby as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Ethereum community is actively debating whether Ethereum accrues sufficient value from its Layer-2 (L2) networks through Blob Space, a critical component of its scaling roadmap. Blob Space serves as a specialized data layer where L2s submit a compressed history of their transactions to Ethereum, paying fees in ETH on a per-blob basis. While this architecture underpins Ethereum's scalability, L2s currently remit minimal value to the Mainnet, achieving gross margins of approximately 90% . This has sparked concerns that Ethereum's economic value could shift too heavily toward L2s, leaving the base layer underutilized. Despite a recent slowdown in Blob Space growth, we project a sharp expansion in its usage by 2025, driven by three key factors: Explosive L2 Adoption: Transaction volumes on Ethereum L2s are growing at an annualized rate exceeding 300% as users migrate to lower-cost, high-throughput environments for DeFi, gaming, and social applications. The proliferation of consumer-facing dApps on L2s will significantly increase the demand for Blob Space as more transactions flow back to Ethereum for final settlement. Rollup Optimizations: Advances in rollup technology, such as improved data compression and reduced costs for posting data to Blob Space, will encourage L2s to store more transaction data on Ethereum, unlocking higher throughput without sacrificing decentralization. Introduction of High-Fee Use Cases: The rise of enterprise-grade applications, zk-rollup-powered financial solutions, and tokenized real-world assets will drive high-value transactions, prioritizing security and immutability, increasing willingness to pay Blob Space fees. By the end of 2025, we project that Blob Space fees will exceed $1 billion , up from negligible levels today. This growth will cement Ethereum's role as the ultimate settlement layer for decentralized applications, while reinforcing its ability to capture value from its rapidly expanding L2 ecosystem. Ethereum's Blob Space will scale the network and serve as a key revenue stream, balancing the economic relationship between Mainnet and L2s. 8. DeFi hits all-time highs with $4 trillion DEX volumes and $200B TVL Total DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Total Value Locked (TVL) Source: Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Despite record-high decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized finance total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate that DEX trading volumes will surpass $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of CEX spot trading volumes, driven by the proliferation of AI-related tokens and new consumer-facing dApps. Additionally, the influx of tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi growth, providing fresh liquidity and broader utility. As a result, we project DeFi TVL to rebound to over $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in an evolving digital economy. 9. NFT market recovery with trading volumes reaching $30 billion NFT Volumes Fell in 2024; We Expect a Rebound in 2025 Source: as of: 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The 2022-2023 bear market dealt a severe blow to the NFT sector, with trading volumes plummeting 39% since 2023 and a staggering 84% since 2022. While fungible token prices began to recover in 2024, most NFTs lagged behind, marked by weak prices and low activity until a turning point in November. Despite these challenges, a few standout projects have defied the downward trend by leveraging strong community bonds to transcend speculative value. For instance, Pudgy Penguins have successfully transitioned into a consumer brand through collectible toys, while Miladys have gained cultural prominence within the realm of sardonic internet culture. Similarly, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) has continued to evolve as a dominant cultural force, attracting widespread attention from brands, celebrities, and mainstream media. As crypto wealth rebounds, we expect newly affluent users to diversify into NFTs, not merely as speculative investments but as assets with enduring cultural and historical significance. Established collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) are well-positioned to benefit from this shift, given their strong cultural cachet and relevance. While BAYC and CryptoPunks remain significantly below their all-time trading peaks, down approximately 90% and 66% in ETH terms, respectively, other projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have already exceeded their previous price highs. Ethereum continues to dominate the NFT space, hosting the majority of significant collections. In 2024, it accounts for 71% of NFT trading, a figure we project to rise to 85% by 2025. This dominance is reflected in market capitalization rankings, where Ethereum-based NFTs occupy the entire top 10 and 16 of the top 20 positions, underscoring the blockchain's central role in the NFT ecosystem. Although NFT trading volumes may not revisit the euphoric highs of previous cycles, we think a $30 billion annual turnover is doable, approximately 55% of the 2021 peak, as the market shifts toward sustainability and cultural relevance over speculative hype. 10. DApp tokens narrow the performance gap with L1 tokens In 2024, Layer 1 Tokens Outperformed Leading dApps by 2x Source: Market Vectors as of 12/8/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The MVSCLE index tracks Smart Contract Platforms. The MVIALE index tracks Infrastructure Application tokens. A consistent theme of the 2024 bull market has been the significant outperformance of Layer-1 (L1) blockchain tokens compared to decentralized application ((DAPP)) tokens. For instance, the MVSCLE index, which tracks Smart Contract Platforms, has gained 80% year-to-date, while the MVIALE index of application tokens has lagged with a 35% return over the same period. However, we anticipate this dynamic will shift later in 2024 as a wave of new dApps launches, delivering innovative and useful products that drive value to their respective tokens. Among the key thematic trends, we see artificial intelligence as a standout category for dApp innovation. Additionally, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects offer immense potential to capture investor and user interest, contributing to a broader performance rebalancing between L1 tokens and dApp tokens. This pivot underscores the growing importance of utility and product-market fit in determining the success of application tokens in the evolving crypto landscape.

With ETH flirting around $3,900 again, investors are cautious about another pullback. However, on-chain metrics indicate strength hinting at upward momentum ahead. Ethereum Price Needs to Hold This Key Support Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a critical support zone for Ethereum, ranging between $3,700 and $3,810. This level holds significant importance as approximately 3 million wallets collectively purchased 4.6 million ETH within this range. Source: Ali charts Martinez stated that there’s a strong buying interest at this level and would act as a strong support for ETH preventing further downside in case of market volatility. Furthermore, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted a strong surge in Ethereum network activity with new wallet creations hitting an 8-month high. In December, the network averaged 130,200 new addresses daily, a level of interest not seen since April. Source: Santiment This shows growing interest among ETH enthusiasts eyeing potential upside. On the other hand, the robust inflow into Ethereum ETF has further fueled optimism. Notably, BlackRock Ether ETF has recently recorded a $3 billion influx, suggesting a growing interest of investors toward the investment instrument. ETH On-Chain Metrics Show Strength Ethereum’s on-chain metrics are showcasing notable growth this week, reflecting increasing network activity and momentum for the cryptocurrency. This includes a 4.24% rise in active addresses and a 2.65% uptick in new address creation. Below are some of the other indicators showing strength. Also, the Ethereum whale activity suggests a further upside. Ethereum Price MVRV Bands Ethereum’s MVRV pricing bands, a key market indicator, remain relatively flat, signaling that the cryptocurrency may not have entered its primary bull market phase yet, according to analysts. Historically, Ethereum has only approached cycle tops after reaching 3.2 times its realized price (RP). While this multiplier is expected to rise during a bull run, the current projection places Ethereum’s potential peak at $6,575, with a similar projection by asset manager VanEck . Courtesy: Glassnode ETH Realized Cap Signals Early Expansion Ethereum’s realized cap—a key metric tracking the total value of all coins at the price they last moved—undergoes distinct periods of expansion and contraction during market cycles. In the previous cycle, Ethereum experienced a three-year contraction phase followed by one year of expansion leading to its cycle peak. This cycle appears to follow a similar pattern. The contraction phase ended in May 2024, with the realized cap beginning its expansion phase in November. This shows that the Ethereum price has much room ahead for a continued rally. Source: Glassnode, venturefounder Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Chart Hints at Major Upside Popular crypto analyst venturefounder noted that the Ethereum vs Bitcoin chart set up in the post-Bitcoin halving period hints at a major upside ahead for the Ethereum price. Historically, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin for no longer than eight months post-halving before experiencing a significant surge against BTC. With the current halving cycle in its eighth month, ETH appears to be right on schedule for an upward breakout. If the trend holds, the ETH/BTC ratio could climb as high as 0.39, a 700% increase from the halving. At a projected $100,000 Bitcoin price, this would place Ethereum’s value at an estimated $39,000 per coin, noted the analyst. Courtesy: Glassnode ETH price today traded 1% up at $3,927 with a market cap of $473 billion.

The hourly price chart confirms that bulls induce buying pressure to hold the price; however, sellers may soon return. If the LTC holds momentum above $125.35, it may climb toward $141.45. LTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the LTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $115.84, which may result in a correction to $100.97. Is Litecoin a good investment? Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC up today? As Bitcoin price is aiming to surpass the $100K mark, there’s an increasing buying demand in the altcoin market. As a result, Litecoin’s price is attempting to hold above $140. Will Litecoin reach $100? Litecoin price already touched the $100 mark this year; however, it is now well below that price point. By the end of 2024, Litecoin might surge above $150. Will LTC price reach $500? According to our Litecoin price prediction, LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a very high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might even reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Almost 80% of Litecoin (LTC) investors are currently making a profit, reaching the highest level since 2021, resulting in an impressive rally. Litecoin price prediction December 2024 Litecoin’s price shows signs of a bullish move as it has been surging heavily for the past few days. As BTC’s price aims for a move above the $100K mark, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note. As a result, we might see the LTC price record a low of $115 with a maximum price of $156 and an average price of $138. Litecoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Litecoin Price Prediction December 2024 $115 $138 $156 Litecoin price prediction 2024 Investors are looking for top cryptocurrencies to buy now in the dip, with the market slump hinting at big opportunities. A critical point for Litecoin is its 2023 halving event, which reduced the mining reward. Initially, miners received 50 LTC per block, but the halving lowered this to 6.25 LTC. This reduction means fewer Litecoins are available, potentially driving up the price if demand remains steady or increases by the end of 2024. However, past halvings haven’t always led to significant price hikes, with prices even falling after the 2019 event. With a projected network and increasing adoption, in 2024, Litecoin’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $54. The maximum price could reach up to $115., with an average trading price around $80.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 10:53:00

He talked about AI’s transformative potential to become “unpredictable” while highlighting its challenges and implications. Sutskever, speaking at the NeurIPS conference on Friday, explored the concept of “superintelligent AI,” which he defined as systems surpassing human capabilities in a wide array of tasks. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever believes superintelligent AI will be ‘unpredictable’ https://t.co/vLHmqwQOJQ — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 14, 2024 He predicted that such systems would be qualitatively different from today’s AI and, in some respects, unrecognizable. According to Sutskever, these advanced systems will possess self-awareness, a level of reasoning, and the ability to understand complex scenarios from limited data. “ [Superintelligent] systems are actually going to be agentic in a real way, ” he said, contrasting them with current AI, which he described as only “very slightly agentic.” Sutskever: Current AI models are limited Receiving a “Test of Time” award at the conference, Sutskever acknowledged the limitations of pre-training models like those used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT. While current systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities, he warned that the finite nature of internet data is becoming a bottleneck. Full @ilyasut TALK! about Pre-training is dead and more pic.twitter.com/PigZVvcEGB — Diego | AI 🚀 – e/acc (@diegocabezas01) December 14, 2024 Sutskever proposed alternative approaches, including AI systems generating their own data or refining their responses to enhance accuracy. These innovations, he suggested, could help overcome existing limitations. The OpenAI co-founder also touched on the ethical implications of superintelligent AI, including the potential for such systems to demand rights. “ It’s not a bad end result if you have AIs, and all they want is to co-exist with us and just to have rights, ” he remarked. However, he emphasized the inherent unpredictability of agentic and self-aware AI, presenting both opportunities and challenges for developers and regulators. OpenAI CEO Altman predicts disruption and the advent of AGI Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared similar views with Sutskever about the ceiling of superintelligent AI performances. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, Altman outlined his vision for artificial general intelligence (AGI). He predicted that AGI-AI systems capable of performing complex tasks with human-like reasoning—could become a reality as early as 2025. “ I think it’s possible … in 2025 we will have systems that we look at … and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected, ’” Altman said. Altman compared the potential impact of AI to the invention of the transistor, which revolutionized industries and economies worldwide. He described a future where this will be “shockingly capable.” “ AI models become widely available and are used across industries for various applications. “AI itself, the reasoning engine, will become commoditized ,” Altman opined, suggesting that its integration into everyday life will be as transformative as past technological breakthroughs. During his appearance, Altman highlighted ChatGPT’s widespread adoption, revealing that the AI tool now has more than 300 million weekly users. He acknowledged ongoing debates about its safety but maintained that the iterative development and deployment approach has been crucial. “ There are definitely people who think ChatGPT is not sufficiently safe, ” he said but noted that OpenAI believes early adoption when the stakes are lower is vital for gradual improvement. Altman’s emphasis on safety echoed the industry concerns about responsible AI development. He acknowledged that while ChatGPT is “now generally considered by most of society to be acceptably safe and acceptably robust,” continued refinement and oversight remain priorities. Reflections on leadership and OpenAI’s evolution Altman’s leadership journey has played a pivotal role in shaping OpenAI’s trajectory. Co-founding the organization in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, he aimed to advance AI technologies for the benefit of humanity. Before joining OpenAI full-time in 2019, Altman served as president of Y Combinator, a leading startup accelerator, from 2014 to 2019. OpenAI transitioned from its nonprofit origins to a capped-profit model to secure the funding needed for large-scale AI projects. Under Altman’s leadership, the company launched ChatGPT and DALL-E, which have reshaped the AI landscape. However, the journey has not been without challenges. In November 2023, Altman was briefly ousted from his role by the OpenAI board over concerns related to his communication with board members. The dispute, which unfolded publicly, concluded with Altman’s reinstatement less than a week later, as the board claimed they were now on “good terms” with the CEO.

Here’s what’s driving this, according to on-chain data. Chainlink Price Has Been Sharply Moving Up Recently The past few weeks have been an excellent time for LINK investors, as the asset has almost tripled in value as compared to the start of November. At the start of this week, the coin saw a bit of a setback, but the sharp bullish momentum has already resumed in the last couple of days. Below is a chart that shows what LINK’s performance has been like over the last few months: From the graph, it’s visible that after a jump of over 47% from the bottom earlier in the week, Chainlink has managed to break above the $28 mark. The asset now sits at weekly profits of more than 22%, making it the best performer among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap . Speaking of market cap, LINK is now the 12th largest in the sector in terms of this metric, sitting just above Shiba Inu (SHIB). As is visible in the above table, the next asset to beat for Chainlink is Avalanche (AVAX). Its market cap is still $3.5 billion more than LINK’s, so it would be a while before a flip happens, assuming the bullish momentum doesn’t die out. As for what has been fueling the cryptocurrency’s surge, perhaps on-chain data can provide some hints. LINK Sharks & Whales Have Been Busy With Their Accumulation In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the behavior has differed between the small and large entities on the LINK network recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Supply Distribution ,” which keeps track of the total amount of Chainlink that the members of a given wallet group are holding right now. In the context of the current topic, the two address ranges of interest are 0 to 100,000 coins and 100,000+ coins. At the current exchange rate, the 100,000 boundary between the two groups converts to about $2.8 million. Addresses who hold greater than this value are considered the key investors of the market, known as the sharks and whales . Thus, the Supply Distribution for the group tracks the behavior of the large investors. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how this indicator compares between the sharks and whales and the regular investors: As displayed in the above graph, the small Chainlink investors have been selling during the last couple of months, potentially because they didn’t think LINK would turn itself around. The sharks and whales, however, smelled the opportunity and bought a total of 5.69 million coins from this group. As Santiment explains, Throughout the history of crypto, large wallets scooping up coins from impatient or panicked retail traders is typically a recipe for market cap rises.",Chainlink News|chainlink|Chainlink Bullish|Chainlink Sharks & Whales|Chainlink Surge|LINK|LINKUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-14 11:00:26

Bitcoin’s price, now hovering above $100k has further boosted optimism. Analysts hint that Dogecoin’s rally could exceed 30,000%, adding excitement to the market recovery. Analyst Hints Next Dogecoin Price Rally Will be “Bigger Than” 2021’s 30,000% Gain A crypto analyst shared an X post describing the possibility of an imminent DOGE price rally. The analysis suggests that this potential rally could surpass the massive gains seen in 2021, where DOGE skyrocketed by over 30,000%. The expert demonstrates Dogecoin’s long-term price movements, showcasing a repeated trend of bullish breakouts following consolidation phases. In 2021, a similar breakout pattern resulted in a notable price surge. Currently, Dogecoin price appears to be approaching a comparable structure, with a sharp upward trajectory possibly ahead. If history repeats itself, the upcoming rally could yield returns even greater than its historic 2021 run, making it a crucial moment for DOGE enthusiasts and traders. Source: X The Dogecoin price reached an all-time high of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, during a bullish market rally. The value of DOGE is currently trading at $0.4075, reflecting a 1% gain in the past 24 hours.

By December 14, this figure had risen to 1.96 billion DOGE, marking an accumulation of 40 million DOGE within a span of just over five weeks. While retail investors are growing their holdings, whale investors appear to be taking profits. On November 6, whales held 9.31 billion DOGE. However, by December 14, this figure had declined to 9.02 billion DOGE, reflecting a reduction of 290 million DOGE over the same period.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reflects waning bullish momentum. While the MACD line remains above the signal line, the convergence hints at potential price consolidation. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) highlights diminishing bullish strength, with a noticeable decrease in the green histogram bars. If bullish forces prevail, the meme coin could surpass its $0.50 resistance level and eventually reach $0.60. In an optimistic scenario, the Dogecoin price forecast could challenge its all-time high (ATH) at $0.73. Extended bullish sentiment could also drive the price towards the psychological $1 mark. However, if bearish trends dominate, the price might decline towards the $0.40 support level or even lower. ​​Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView Dogecoin’s potential for a rally surpassing 30,000% ignites excitement among traders.

These equipment costs and payment delays create real problems—from delayed supplier payments to missed inventory deals. Meanwhile, customers increasingly ask to pay with crypto, but fears about price swings and complex setups keep merchants hesitant. SpacePay addresses these common frustrations by turning existing payment screens into crypto-ready terminals. It has also raised over $700,000 from investors who see how this solution helps real businesses. The platform changes standard Android-based card machines into complete payment terminals that handle both traditional and crypto transactions. When customers pay using any of the 325+ supported wallets, merchants receive their local currency instantly—no equipment costs, no settlement delays, and no crypto price risks. Traditional Payment Systems Vs. Spacepay: The Real Cost Difference Standard payment equipment creates a heavy financial burden for small businesses. A typical retail store pays $600-1,200 per card terminal annually in rental fees. For businesses needing multiple terminals, these costs multiply quickly. Add monthly maintenance fees, software updates, and replacement costs, and stores often spend over $3,000 yearly just to accept card payments. SpacePay eliminates these equipment expenses entirely. Store owners keep their current Android-based payment screens, which now handle both card and crypto payments through a free software update. Switching to SpacePay instantly saves store owners thousands in annual fixed costs. The platform’s 0.5% transaction fee replaces the traditional 3.5% rate, creating additional savings on every sale. The impact becomes clearer when looking at monthly transactions. A store processing $20,000 monthly pays $700 in traditional card fees (3.5%). With SpacePay, the same sales volume costs just $100 (0.5%). Combined with eliminated equipment costs, a business could save over $10,000 annually. These savings help stores invest in growth, improve inventory, or simply increase their profit margins. Why Three-day Settlement Delays Hurt Local Business Payment delays create real problems for small business cash flow. When a store processes card payments on Friday, traditional systems hold that money until Wednesday. During busy seasons like holidays, these delays trap thousands of dollars that businesses need for daily operations. Holiday periods make these delays even more challenging. Consider a toy store during December – their biggest sales days happen just before the holidays, but three-day settlement times mean they can’t access this money for restocking during the crucial shopping period. Many stores resort to expensive short-term loans or credit cards to bridge these payment gaps. SpacePay changes this dynamic with instant settlements. When customers pay with any supported crypto wallet, merchants receive their local currency immediately in their account. This immediate availability of funds helps businesses operate more efficiently and take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. Protection From Crypto Price Changes: How It Works Price protection forms the core of SpacePay’s merchant-first approach. When a customer pays in crypto, SpacePay locks the local currency value instantly. For example, if someone buys a $50 meal using Bitcoin, the restaurant receives exactly $50 in their account – regardless of what happens to Bitcoin’s price afterward. This protection removes the biggest worry that keeps merchants from accepting digital currencies. The system works through automatic real-time conversion. Let’s walk through a real transaction: A customer scans the QR code to buy a $75 shirt using Ethereum. At that moment, SpacePay checks current market rates and locks in the $75 value. Even if Ethereum’s price drops 10% during the next hour, the store still gets their full $75. This price locking happens invisibly in the background, requiring no action from the merchant or customer. With SpacePay’s instant conversion, shop owners now confidently accept any of the 325+ supported cryptocurrencies, knowing they’ll receive the exact sale amount in their local currency. The platform handles all market calculations, leaving merchants free to focus on their business. The technology behind this protection creates true risk-free crypto acceptance. A café can sell a $5 coffee for $5, without worrying about cryptocurrency markets or exchange rates. This simplicity helps merchants expand their payment options while maintaining stable pricing and predictable income. Becoming A Part Of Spacepay’s Journey As the platform raises over $700,000 in presale funding , new supporters can join at $0.002315 per SPY token. The investment process starts at SpacePay’s official website , where investors connect their crypto wallets. The platform accepts payments in USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, ETH, and BNB. Those new to crypto can purchase directly with bank cards, making entry accessible to everyone. SpacePay helps in removing payment barriers that help local businesses compete in the digital economy.

A local store owner spends thousands of dollars a year just to rent credit card machines while waiting up to three days to access money from weekend sales. These equipment costs and payment delays create real problems—from delayed supplier payments to missed inventory deals. Meanwhile, customers increasingly ask to pay with crypto, but fears about price swings and complex setups keep merchants hesitant. SpacePay addresses these common frustrations by turning existing payment screens into crypto-ready terminals. It has also raised over $700,000 from investors who see how this solution helps real businesses. The platform changes standard Android-based card machines into complete payment terminals that handle both traditional and crypto transactions. When customers pay using any of the 325+ supported wallets, merchants receive their local currency instantly—no equipment costs, no settlement delays, and no crypto price risks. Traditional Payment Systems Vs. Spacepay: The Real Cost Difference Standard payment equipment creates a heavy financial burden for small businesses. A typical retail store pays $600-1,200 per card terminal annually in rental fees. For businesses needing multiple terminals, these costs multiply quickly. Add monthly maintenance fees, software updates, and replacement costs, and stores often spend over $3,000 yearly just to accept card payments. SpacePay eliminates these equipment expenses entirely. Store owners keep their current Android-based payment screens, which now handle both card and crypto payments through a free software update. Switching to SpacePay instantly saves store owners thousands in annual fixed costs. The platform’s 0.5% transaction fee replaces the traditional 3.5% rate, creating additional savings on every sale. The impact becomes clearer when looking at monthly transactions. A store processing $20,000 monthly pays $700 in traditional card fees (3.5%). With SpacePay, the same sales volume costs just $100 (0.5%). Combined with eliminated equipment costs, a business could save over $10,000 annually. These savings help stores invest in growth, improve inventory, or simply increase their profit margins Why Three-day Settlement Delays Hurt Local Business Payment delays create real problems for small business cash flow. When a store processes card payments on Friday, traditional systems hold that money until Wednesday. During busy seasons like holidays, these delays trap thousands of dollars that businesses need for daily operations. Holiday periods make these delays even more challenging. Consider a toy store during December – their biggest sales days happen just before the holidays, but three-day settlement times mean they can’t access this money for restocking during the crucial shopping period. Many stores resort to expensive short-term loans or credit cards to bridge these payment gaps. SpacePay changes this dynamic with instant settlements. When customers pay with any supported crypto wallet, merchants receive their local currency immediately in their account. This immediate availability of funds helps businesses operate more efficiently and take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. Protection From Crypto Price Changes: How It Works Price protection forms the core of SpacePay’s merchant-first approach. When a customer pays in crypto, SpacePay locks the local currency value instantly. For example, if someone buys a $50 meal using Bitcoin, the restaurant receives exactly $50 in their account – regardless of what happens to Bitcoin’s price afterward. This protection removes the biggest worry that keeps merchants from accepting digital currencies. The system works through automatic real-time conversion. Let’s walk through a real transaction: A customer scans the QR code to buy a $75 shirt using Ethereum. At that moment, SpacePay checks current market rates and locks in the $75 value. Even if Ethereum’s price drops 10% during the next hour, the store still gets their full $75. This price locking happens invisibly in the background, requiring no action from the merchant or customer. With SpacePay’s instant conversion, shop owners now confidently accept any of the 325+ supported cryptocurrencies, knowing they’ll receive the exact sale amount in their local currency. The platform handles all market calculations, leaving merchants free to focus on their business. The technology behind this protection creates true risk-free crypto acceptance. A café can sell a $5 coffee for $5, without worrying about cryptocurrency markets or exchange rates. This simplicity helps merchants expand their payment options while maintaining stable pricing and predictable income.

Notably, ADA is among the notable beneficiaries of the current cryptocurrency market rally , having broken out from a prolonged consolidation below $1. This surge was partly inspired by the post-election optimism following Donald Trump’s re-election. Trump is anticipated to spearhead the rollout of crypto-friendly regulations. ChatGPT predicts ADA’s price for December 31 Looking ahead, ChatGPT noted that heading into the final day of 2024, the value of ADA will likely be influenced by market sentiment, technologica l developments, investor behavior, and broader economic trends. To this end, the AI tool pointed out that ADA will likely trade between $1.25 and $1.40 in a bullish scenario on December 31. The high target reflects a growth of about 26% from the current valuation. ChatGPT predicted that ADA would trade around $1.10 to $1.15 in a neutral situation, where the current market conditions remain stable. However, if the cryptocurrency sector experiences bearish sentiments, the AI tool foresees Cardano dropping below $1 by December 31. ADA price prediction for December 31, 2024. Source: ChatGPT ADA’s key fundamentals Several fundamental and technical indicators support a possible short-term price increase for ADA, with whale accumulation standing out. According to data from prominent cryptocurrency on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, on December 12, whales accumulated over 80 million ADA tokens within 48 hours. ADA whale transactions chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts The data indicates that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA are behind this recent uptick in buying. Whale movements have historically signaled pivotal moments, often preceding upward price momentum or strategic accumulation phases. At the same time, according to crypto on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock , as of December 14, a significant share of ADA holders are in profit , a factor likely to influence selling activity. ADA holders making money at current price. Source: IntoTheBlock Indeed, 67% of holders are in profit, with 9% breaking even and 24% at a loss. With a significant number of investors in profit, ADA is likely to have strong support, as investors are less likely to sell, supporting possible continued momentum. However, profit-taking could slow momentum if the price stalls. Meanwhile, the ADA community will likely be banking on Cardano network developments for a possible boost. For instance, the community is anticipating the full impact of Cardano’s ‘Chang’ upgrade, which shifts governance to ADA holders through voting and elected representatives. The upgrade introduced a decentralized structure, transferring upgrade authority from founding entities to user-led groups. This move will likely enhance ADA’s utility and align with its decentralization goals. ADA price analysis ADA was trading at $1.10 by press time, gaining over 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Over the past month, the asset has rallied 94%. ADA one-month price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding the next price movement, a cryptocurrency trading analyst with the pseudonym CryptooELITES , in an X post on December 12, observed that ADA has broken out of a multi-year downtrend, signaling strong bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency’s technical setup shows that ADA has formed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern , which indicates a continuation of the upward trend. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In this case, ADA’s move above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $1.73 points to growing investor confidence. Further targets include $2.50 and $3.00, representing significant psychological and technical milestones, with $6.00 aligning with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension—a key indicator for measuring projected price movement beyond previous highs. Should this momentum persist, the analyst believes a bull market end goal of $12 remains a realistic target. For now, attention is focused on how ADA will interact with the $1 support level, as a drop below this point could signal trouble for the asset.

What’s Next for Crypto in 2024,https://coinpedia.org/news/cryptos-new-era-bitcoins-highs-altcoin-momentum-and-bold-u-s-plans/,"The post Has Bitcoin Reached Its Peak? What’s Next for Crypto in 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin has made a historic milestone crossing $100k this month, the market is happy as well as skeptical. Crossing this psychological resistance is a great achievement, but would it be possible for BTC to move forward or is it exhausted for the season? There are many questions looming around for the future of crypto. From bold government proposals to shifts in market trends, the crypto space is buzzing with developments that could shape what happens next. Let’s take a closer look at what’s unfolding and why these changes matter more than ever. Huge Achievement, Global Impact Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is not just a price milestone—it shows how much cryptocurrency has grown. But there’s more to the story. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently proposed a plan for a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , which would involve acquiring 1 million BTC—about 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Why does this matter? If the U.S. moves forward with this plan, it could change how governments worldwide view Bitcoin. However, experts warn that such a big move could cause short-term market instability. Large actions like this come with risks. Bitcoin Dominance Drops, Altcoins Gain Ground Even though Bitcoin is hitting new highs, its share of the total market has dropped to 55.2%, a decline of over 7% in just a month. This is opening the door for altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are all starting to gain more attention. XRP has reclaimed its spot as the third-largest crypto, and Solana (SOL) has moved up to fifth place on CoinMarketCap. But experts caution that altcoin season won’t happen overnight. The market is still volatile, and altcoins will face challenges before they can take off. The road ahead could be rocky, but it’s one to watch. Bitcoin Remains a Strong Investment Despite the rise of altcoins, Bitcoin remains a favorite among institutional investors. It’s increasingly being seen as digital gold, and analysts from VanEck predict that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 in this market cycle. This shows that Bitcoin is becoming more recognized as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin-focused ETFs are also seeing significant investment. It’s been a long journey from ETF approval delays to having Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs up and running. Source : Sosovalue The introduction of options on Bitcoin ETFs has added more positivity to the market. More cryptocurrencies are also preparing for their chance to tap into similar funding opportunities. Good Buying Opportunity? Short-term price drops could work in favor of larger investors. A dip below $100,000 might be seen as the ideal moment to buy more Bitcoin. This confidence shows how Bitcoin is becoming a bigger part of the global financial system. What to Expect Next Looking ahead, analysts predict Bitcoin might drop 20-30% before it rallies again. While this may seem like a setback, it could present an opportunity for long-term investors to get in at a better price. As for altcoins, patience is key. Cryptos like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction, but it won’t be an overnight change. The market is still volatile, and that’s likely to continue for some time. Finally, the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve proposal could shake up the market. If it moves forward, it may change the market in ways we can’t fully predict yet.

For all the latecomers, XRP sure did come back from devastation, however, some analysts are looking at five potential coins that seem to be gaining traction and would be worthwhile in the near future. It is safe to say that out of all the top five candidates, Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), Bonk (BONK), Sei (SEI), and Rexas Finance (RXS), Rexas Finance is one of the bigger bets for exponential growth. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Underdog That Ended Up Making It Big Today, Rexas Finance is one of the most highly discussed tokens, and for a good reason as well. Rexas has already sold over 335 million tokens and raised an astonishing $27 million, which is staggering for a presale price of $0.15. What makes them unique is their approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Through this, a significantly larger number of individuals can invest in traditionally difficult-to-access markets by letting them allocate fractions of high-value assets like real estate and fine art.What differentiates Rexas from its competitors is its well-rounded ecosystem. Rexas provides tools such as Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder, which enable tokenization of assets and let developers build and market blockchain projects. Furthermore, it’s CertiK audited, which adds security, while its presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko adds trust. Recently, the project announced an ongoing giveaway worth $1 million, in which 20 selected investors are expected to get $50,000 each in RXS tokens, raising interest in the project even further. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain Veteran Cardano is arguably one of the most successful blockchain projects. It remains faithful to its academic approach and focus on sustainability. The introduction of Hydra, the second-layer scaling solution, places Cardano in a better position to handle a higher volume of transactions at low costs. Cardano’s steady growth has created a strong base of investors, and its emphasis on practical applications, such as collaborations in education or agriculture, enables it to survive in a saturated market. ADA is now trading at $1.12 as of this writing, and analysts expect the gains to be modest as it continues to strengthen its ecosystem. Sui (SUI): Explosive Growth and Scalability Sui recently has emerged as a blockchain that can handle a large number of transactions at affordable rates. It was developed by ex-Facebook engineers and it uses the Move programming language that allows the development of secure and scalable applications. At the current price of $3.96 as of this writing, Sui promises unrivaled effectiveness and has positioned itself as a competitor to Solana. Its user-friendly tools and strong infrastructure have made it a developer favorite. Its huge potential for mass adaptation certainly makes it one of the major coins to look out for during the next bull run. Bonk (BONK): Not Your Ordinary Memecoin Bonk is a community-driven memecoin that’s built on Solana. It was created to serve as an alternative coin to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Bonk has a very big community due to the constant airdrops in the past, during which early investors were rewarded for holding Bonk tokens. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00004261 and has a market cap of $3.22 billion, according to Coinmarketcap. Over the past month, Bonk has gained over 91.56%, which shows that it has attracted the attention of investors. Sei (SEI): The Next Step In The Evolution Of Decentralized Finance Sei is a layer-one blockchain focusing solely on decentralized finance (deFi) applications. Sei, with its cutting-edge technology, promises to execute transactions efficiently and faster than other traditional chains. Currently valued at $0.63 as of this writing, Sei has been on a growth trajectory owing to its relations with top deFi networks. With the growth of the DeFi market, the lending protocol is suited well to gain a lot of traction owing to its compatibility with other blockchains around the globe. Why Rexas is the Best Pick Of the five coins highlighted above, Rexas Finance is the best investment opportunity as it has the most advancement and room for growth. It’s not that coins such as Cardano and Sui do not have promise, but they are built on already established systems. Rexas, conversely, is about disrupting the space as it enters the market, effectively blending traditional finance with blockchain, which is a true game changer. Analysts think that it won’t take less than a month after the currency is listed to exceed $1, making the early adopters gain over 7x their initial investment. Unlike the speculative nature of some altcoins, strong fundamentals and real-world use of Rexas set it up to thrive over the long term. Conclusion Markets will always mature, and in the coming wave of the crypto market, alts and diversification in trading strategies will be key to maximizing all returns. Even though Ripple has had its moment in the market, the other projects that stand to take over the dominance of the crypto world are Rexas Finance, Sui, and Sei, focusing on driving innovations and expanding what blockchain technology can extend into using its capabilities. As an investor, if you are preparing for the next bull run, then placing your bets on these emerging tokens will be a smart decision. Among them, Rexas Finance is the front runner alongside opportunities for short-term and long-term gain.

But as the crypto market matures, new projects are stepping into the spotlight, offering innovative solutions to long-standing challenges. This December, the blockchain world is buzzing with speculation about a “next big thing” poised to disrupt the industry and shake up the status quo. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could December 2024 mark the beginning of a new chapter in blockchain evolution? Let’s explore the landscape and what this mysterious contender might bring to the table. Bitcoin’s Legacy: The Original Disruptor Bitcoin revolutionized finance by introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system free from centralized control. Its impact as a store of value and a hedge against inflation cannot be overstated. Despite its strengths, Bitcoin’s limitations have become increasingly apparent: Energy Usage: Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining mechanism consumes massive amounts of energy, raising environmental concerns. Scalability Issues: The network struggles with high fees and slow transaction times, making it less practical for everyday use. Limited Use Cases: Bitcoin’s design prioritizes security and simplicity over versatility, limiting its application beyond digital gold. These factors have opened the door for newer, more versatile projects to capture market share and address unmet needs. The Search For the ‘Next Big Thing’ In recent years, Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchain platforms have gained significant traction by expanding on Bitcoin’s foundation. However, as users and developers demand more scalability, sustainability, and innovation, a new contender seems ready to take the stage. This project, shrouded in mystery, has crypto enthusiasts speculating that it could redefine what’s possible in the blockchain space. What’s Driving The Buzz? Next-Gen Consensus Mechanism: Reports suggest the use of a groundbreaking system that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining decentralization and security. AI Integration: This new blockchain reportedly bridges artificial intelligence and decentralized technology, unlocking smarter applications and decision-making tools. Scalability Without Layer 2: Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional scaling layers, this project is said to deliver native scalability for high transaction volumes. Inclusivity: A design that ensures fair participation by rewarding meaningful contributions rather than just computational power or staking capacity. These features align with the evolving demands of the blockchain ecosystem, positioning the project as a strong contender for widespread adoption. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Why December 2024 Is Pivotal Timing is everything in the crypto world, and December 2024 appears to be the perfect moment for a shake-up. The industry is reaching a critical juncture: Environmental Focus: Increasing scrutiny on energy usage means greener blockchains are in high demand. Mainstream Adoption: As more enterprises and governments explore blockchain solutions, the need for scalable, efficient, and versatile platforms has never been greater. Investor Interest: With institutional investors diversifying into crypto, the spotlight is on projects that offer both innovation and stability. A new project with the right features could seize the moment and establish itself as the market’s next leader. What This Means For The Crypto Market If the speculation proves true, this project could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance and set a new standard for blockchain technology. By addressing issues like scalability and energy efficiency while introducing cutting-edge AI integration, it could attract developers, investors, and businesses looking for a platform built for the future. Potential Impacts: New Use Cases: The combination of blockchain and AI could unlock applications in fields like healthcare, logistics, and predictive analytics. Increased Competition: Established players like Ethereum and Solana may need to innovate further to keep up. Mainstream Adoption: User-friendly design and eco-conscious architecture could drive adoption among non-technical users and institutions. From Bitcoin’s emergence as digital gold to Ethereum’s innovation in smart contracts, the crypto market has been shaped by transformative moments. December 2024 could be the next milestone, as the blockchain industry braces for the arrival of a project that combines sustainability, scalability, and cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re an investor, developer, or blockchain enthusiast, now is the time to pay attention. The crypto world is poised for a shake-up, and the ‘next big thing’ could be just around the corner.

On the eve of December 13, the company revealed that it has begun rolling out an upgraded version of its Grok 2 chatbot model to users on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk also owns. According to a report from TechCrunch, the enhanced Grok is “three times faster” than its predecessor and boasts “improved accuracy, instruction-following, and multilingual capabilities.” X gains a faster Grok model and a new ‘Grok button’ https://t.co/QZCKleQagD — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 14, 2024 Grok leverages the X platform to deliver real-time insights by integrating web search and citations. These features allow the AI model to draw from posts on X and broader internet sources, providing timely and context-rich responses to user queries. The chatbot will also reportedly integrate a new “Grok button” on X, which aims to help users explore trending discussions, gain deeper insights into current events, and find relevant context. Grok AI announces API changes In addition to the consumer-facing updates, xAI announced major changes to its enterprise API. Two new Grok models have been introduced, featuring improved efficiency and enhanced multilingual capabilities. As a result, the company has reduced pricing for API usage, slashing input token costs from $5 to $2 per million tokens and output token costs from $15 to $10 per million tokens. Each token corresponds to approximately four characters of text. The upgraded API will also soon include xAI’s image generation model, Aurora . Aurora debuted on X this month as part of the Grok chatbot experience. It offers users a largely unfiltered image-generation capability, further expanding xAI’s creative tools. xAI launched its API back in August, fulfilling a promise to make its generative AI capabilities available to developers. Currently, the API is in a relatively basic stage, featuring a single model, “grok-beta.” The initial offering is priced at $5 per million input tokens, equivalent to approximately 750,000 words, and $15 per million output tokens. Tokens represent units of raw data, such as the syllables “fan,” “tas,” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.” On December 6, X announced that users no longer need to subscribe to X Premium to access Grok. Instead, the platform introduced a freemium model, granting all users ten free chatbot prompts every two hours. Asked @Grok to draw a picture of @GaryGensler . Very flattering, I think! https://t.co/NJnAj1nKIS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Freemium X users can also generate up to ten images in the same period, though they are limited to analyzing three images per day unless they subscribe. This move marks a shift from Grok’s earlier availability, which was restricted to X Premium subscribers paying $8 per month or $84 annually. Integration with X and the broader AI Ecosystem Grok’s updates outline its developer’s xAI strategy of leveraging the X platform’s social media ecosystem to enhance its AI capabilities. The AI model draws its info from real-time data and user-generated content on X to differentiate itself from traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained datasets. This integration positions Grok as a dynamic tool for navigating and understanding live events, trending topics, and nuanced discussions. Moreover, Aurora complements Grok by enabling users to create visual content. Its upcoming inclusion in the API echoes xAI’s commitment to offering a comprehensive suite of AI tools that cater to diverse user needs, from textual analysis to creative design. xAI’s recent updates place it in direct competition with established players like OpenAI and Anthropic. The introduction of multilingual capabilities and efficiency gains could help position Grok as a viable alternative to competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. The pricing adjustments for API usage reflect xAI’s commitment to attracting enterprise customers who seek cost-effective solutions.

Warren shared her decision in a heartfelt December 13 X post , describing her departure as bittersweet. While stepping down, Warren will continue to contribute as Senior Global Policy Officer to support the organization during its leadership transition. Ji Kim, CCI’s current chief legal officer, will assume the role of acting CEO. Under Warren’s stewardship, the CCI became a prominent voice advocating for balanced cryptocurrency regulations worldwide. Reflecting on her tenure, Warren expressed optimism about the industry’s future, particularly in the U.S., where regulatory clarity remains a crucial goal. “I am confident that CCI will achieve a smart regulatory outcome in Washington,” she stated, referencing the organization’s success in shaping crypto policy in other global markets. Changing Dynamics in Crypto Regulation Warren’s announcement coincides with a pivotal period in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. As the industry navigates post-FTX challenges and heightened regulatory scrutiny, there is growing anticipation that the upcoming administration, led by Donald Trump, may adopt a more favorable stance toward digital assets. Trump has already signaled a pro-crypto agenda by nominating Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner and vocal advocate for transparency and investor protection, to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Known for his stringent approach to crypto oversight, Gensler’s departure on Jan. 20, 2025, leads to many expecting potential turning point for the industry. Warren herself acknowledged the transformative nature of the past three years, describing the crypto industry as being in a “different era” compared to when she first joined CCI. Optimism for a Pro-Crypto Future Industry leaders have expressed hope that Trump’s administration will spur the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain innovations. As Warren steps back from her role, her legacy at CCI underscores the importance of advocating for fair and pragmatic crypto regulations. With new leadership at both the CCI and SEC, the industry also stands at the cusp of potentially significant regulatory and technological progress.

BONK struggles with bearish momentum, testing key support levels for stability. WIF and DOGE show consolidation patterns, with critical resistance limiting gains. The crypto market experienced a notable shift this week, with a selloff that triggered a decline in the open interest-to-market cap ratio for many altcoins, according to Kaiko data. This indicates reduced leverage and trading activity in the altcoin market, highlighting a growing sense of caution among investors. Meme tokens, including Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF), PEPE, and Dogecoin (DOGE), felt the brunt of the downturn, with substantial declines in their market metrics.

From decentralized exchanges and hardware wallets to social media accounts and entire blockchain networks, hackers have targeted some of the industry’s most trusted platforms. These attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities that have remained hidden, raising questions about the true security of the crypto space. The dangers are more alarming than ever! Read on to know more. Clober DEX Suffers Major Reentrancy Attack A reentrancy attack recently targeted Clober’s decentralized exchange liquidity vault on the Base Network. The hackers exploited the Rebalancer smart contract’s _burn() method, making off with 133.7 ETH, valued at over $501,000. This attack shows us the ongoing threats faced by decentralized exchanges and their users, emphasizing the need for stronger security protocols. URGENT: Security Breach Alert We regret to inform our community that the Clober Liquidity Vault has been compromised in a security breach. We want to reassure our users that the Clober protocol itself is unaffected, and all core functionalities continue to operate… — Clober | Fully on-chain CLOB DEX (@CloberDEX) December 10, 2024 Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hacked The official X account of the Cardano Foundation was hacked, resulting in unauthorized posts being made from the account. While no funds were lost, the incident raised significant concerns about the safety of social media accounts linked to cryptocurrency projects. The foundation quickly urged followers to disregard any posts during the investigation. The Cardano Foundation X account @Cardano_CF has been compromised. Please ignore any posts from the account at this time while we address this. — Cardano Community (@Cardano) December 8, 2024 Ledger Nano S Wallet Hack: A $2.5 Million Theft A Reddit user recently claimed that hackers stole $2.5 million in digital currencies from their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, 10 Bitcoin, and $1.5 million in NFTs. Though the user encrypted the seed phrase and avoided the unsafe transactions, he said that the hacking happened after two months when the wallet was idle. Charles Guillemet, CTO of Ledger, responded by reiterating that phishing scams remain a significant threat. He also reminded users that Ledger never asks for private account information, urging vigilance in protecting sensitive data. Dogecoin Network Hit by ‘DogeReaper’ Attack A major vulnerability called “DogeReaper” was exploited to launch a damaging attack on the Dogecoin network. As a result, 69% of active nodes were brought offline, dropping the number of active nodes from 647 to 205, before partially recovering to 331. Although centralized exchanges and custodians remained unaffected, this attack revealed serious concerns about the decentralization and resilience of the network, raising questions about its long-term stability. India Cracks Down on Gate.io Exchange The Indian government recently took action by shutting down access to the Gate.io cryptocurrency exchange, affecting a large number of users. The exchange has yet to issue an official statement, but this move highlights the growing regulatory pressure on the crypto industry in India, which could significantly impact crypto trading for Indian citizens in the future. WallStreetBets X Wallet Hack: $2.2 Million Stolen WallStreetBets X’s digital wallets were hacked and the attackers made away with an estimated $2.2M in meme coins of various types: $1.43M PNUT tokens, $400K ZEREBRO tokens, and $130K ALCH tokens. The exploit was about passkey weaknesses present in the mobile application of X. The post revealed that, sometimes, clicking on links in social media can be risky especially those offering at prices which seem to be too good to be true.

Deaton reveals",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-cftc-merger-will-ease-crypto-regulations/,"Vocal crypto advocate John E. Deaton has revealed the need to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to simplify crypto regulations. The issue of regulating the crypto market has become a widely discussed subject in the United States, with experts and advocates alike giving their opinions. However, Deaton thinks the way forward will be to merge the SEC and CFTC into one big organization for effective regulations. He has been critical of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who he describes as a ‘Bad Faith Regulator’ in the past. This was due to Gensler’s stifling crypto regulations and his unwarranted legal actions against crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase. Deaton gave his opinion while replying to a post on X where Digital Chamber CEO Perianne Boring was discussing how Trump’s crypto vision could help the United States’ regulatory clarity. John E. Deaton makes his case for joint regulatory bodies On the morning show with Maria, Boring made a case of the confusion and conflicts it causes the financial markets by having two separate regulators oversee their activities. Deaton, in his post on X, agreed with Boring, highlighting the confusion and inefficiency it causes for the agencies. He said that by merging both regulators, they would be able to eliminate overlapping responsibilities and conflicts that have risen in the past. It would also make it easier for firms, helping them follow the rules. Outstanding job by @PerianneDC on @MorningsMaria with @MariaBartiromo discussing how @elonmusk and @VivekGRamaswamy ’s @DOGE may want to push for merging the @CFTC & @SECGov . There’s a strong case to be made for merging the two agencies. Merging the SEC & CFTC would eliminate… https://t.co/dLdSSVXyxs — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 13, 2024 Deaton also mentioned that the move will also help the agencies provide a consistent and straightforward approach to making rules for securities like stocks, and commodities like Bitcoin and other assets. He believes that grey areas in the financial market should be removed, and having one regulator would help the United States achieve this. “This would simplify compliance for market participants, especially as financial products increasingly blur the lines between securities and commodities,” he said. The United States in a competitive global crypto market John E. Deaton also mentioned the need for the United States to step up its regulatory clarity, highlighting the competitive global crypto market. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) could be the mouthpiece and advocate achieving the much-needed merger. Aside from the merger providing clear and precise regulations in the market, it could also help the country cut costs by reducing funds allocated to them. The new merger would also assure crypto investors and firms alike of a new dawn in the country. With the pro-crypto Paul Atkins set to replace the outgoing Gary Gensler as SEC Chair, there is already optimism in the country about the direction of the crypto sector under the new administration. Adding the merger of these two organizations would only bolster that optimism, helping the industry in the long run. John E. Deaton also touched on the payment sector, noting that it is another area that needs work. He highlighted the federal agencies overseeing the payment sector, pointing out that there are over a dozen. With a unified agency, which would bring about a unified regulatory framework, these agencies would be streamlined to achieve more efficiency. He used XRP as an example, noting that the FinCEN said it was a virtual currency in 2015, only for the SEC to say it was a security years later. This is not the first advocacy for a joint relationship between the SEC and CFTC, with Congressman John Rose submitting a proposal to foster collaboration between both bodies on September 12. In the ‘Bridging Regulation and Innovation for Digital Global and Electronic Digital Assets Act,’ the committee will involve experts, and users to help the agencies streamline laws that will enable efficient use of blockchain technology and consumer protection. The committee will comprise 20 members of non-government staff and a representative of the SEC and CFTC. The meetings will be twice annually, with their recommendations requiring public input to foster transparency.

In a formal letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Meta urged the state to block the AI firm’s restructuring, claiming it undermines its nonprofit origins and risks distorting Silicon Valley’s startup ecosystem. Meanwhile, concerns over AI ethics and transparency have escalated following the tragic death of whistleblower Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI researcher, adding a somber tone to the ongoing debates. Meta Aligns With Musk To Block OpenAI’s For-Profit Plans Meta Platforms has joined Elon Musk in opposing OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model. According to a Wall Street Journal report , Meta sent a formal letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, warning that the AI firm’s restructuring could exploit nonprofit resources for private gain. The letter accuses the firm of betraying its foundational goals, established when it launched as a nonprofit organization in 2015. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed Musk’s concerns that the company’s shift could pave the way for Silicon Valley startups to misuse nonprofit models for financial advantage. Both Zuckerberg and Musk are calling for a legal investigation to ensure accountability in the firm’s transition. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has long criticized the company’s for-profit trajectory. He claims it contradicts the original vision of OpenAI as a public-serving nonprofit, free from corporate incentives. Besides, Musk has also filed a lawsuit recently against Microsoft and OpenAI over anti-trust claims. With Zuckerberg now in the picture, the opposition gains significant momentum. Mark Zuckerberg and Musk: A United Front in the Fight Against OpenAI Mark Zuckerberg, despite his history of rivalry with Musk, has emerged as a key ally in this legal battle. Meta’s letter emphasizes that the AI firm’s shift to for-profit status could disrupt Silicon Valley’s innovation ecosystem. It further warns that the move might encourage other startups to exploit nonprofit models for financial benefits. As per Wall Street Journal, Meta has called for an investigation into OpenAI’s practices, including potential misuse of tax-free donations. Zuckerberg’s involvement signals Meta’s vested interest in maintaining ethical boundaries in AI development. Meanwhile, OpenAI defended its for-profit model in an X post, claiming Elon Musk had previously supported the idea to secure investments for advanced AI research. OpenAI also shared Musk’s 2017 proposal for a for-profit entity within the company. Tragic Suicide Sparks Broader AI Ethics Debate The fight over OpenAI’s future has taken a grim turn with the death of whistleblower Suchir Balaji. The 26-year-old former OpenAI researcher, who previously raised concerns about copyright breaches in AI systems, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, with no evidence of foul play. Balaji’s passing has amplified discussions around the high-pressure environment in AI research. Critics argue that OpenAI’s pursuit of profit compromises its ethical responsibilities, further escalating tensions in the industry. Amid this, the recent developments from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has sparked further discussions in the market. As the case unfolds, critics argue that OpenAI’s profit-driven approach contradicts its foundational goals. This raises broader questions about accountability, transparency, and ethical responsibility in AI development. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s video generation platform has gone live adding another layer to its evolving AI capabilities.

But the panic didn’t last long! However, XRP price has bounced back, rising by almost 9% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile some experts are boldly claiming that XRP will never drop below $2 again. Here’s why they are so confident! Why XRP’s Price May Continue to Rise XRP, a cryptocurrency linked to Ripple Labs, is riding the wave of optimism in the crypto market. As Bitcoin’s rally boosts altcoins, XRP is gaining momentum . Experts believe it could soon aim for its all-time high (ATH), with on-chain data pointing to further growth. One key factor is the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), which measures how long tokens stay inactive on the blockchain. A high MDIA usually indicates a stagnant market. But for XRP, the MDIA has recently dropped, showing that long-held tokens are now being traded actively. This increase in activity is a positive sign, as it brings more liquidity to the market and supports price growth. Another important metric is the Taker Buy Ratio, which tracks the number of buy orders compared to total trades in the derivatives market. Currently, XRP’s ratio is at 0.55, which shows strong buying interest. Data from CryptoQuant highlights this as a bullish signal, with buyers gaining control of the market. Bulls Take the Lead As of now, XRP is trading around $2.45 , supported by a market cap of $139.3 billion. Its 10-day simple moving average of $2.42 and 100-day average of $2.37 further confirm the upward trend. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52.27 suggests a balanced market, while the MACD indicator signals potential for further gains. If this buying pressure continues, XRP could climb toward $3.50 in the short term. However, if the recent increase in token circulation slows down, the price might drop back to $2.13. For now, the bulls seem firmly in control, and XRP’s future looks brighter than ever.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 11:50:39

During his first term, he openly pushed for a weaker buck, often clashing with the norms of presidential behavior. You know, typical Trump. Back in 2019, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted at more monetary stimulus, Trump pounced, tweeting that: “Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.” That was a direct shot at traditional US dollar policy and a signal that Trump was willing to take matters into his own hands. Now, as the president prepares for a second term, the conversation around the dollar is heating up again. His pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is trying to sell a different narrative. Scott claims that Trump’s new administration believes in free-market dynamics, saying, “If you have good economic policies, you’re naturally going to have a strong dollar.” But anyone who’s followed Trump knows that his actions often speak louder than his administration’s talking points. A strong dollar and Trump’s trade tactics The dollar isn’t waiting for Trump to decide. Since his re-election, the DXY dollar index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, has climbed nearly 3%. This rise goes against Trump’s earlier preference for a weaker currency and puts pressure on key trading partners like the eurozone and China. Both are already grappling with economic challenges. Europe’s position is especially precarious. The European Central Bank has been slashing rates to fight off recession risks. Deposit rates could drop as low as 1.5% from 3%, while inflation remains below the ECB’s 2% target. In contrast, US inflation has ticked up to 2.7%, keeping the Federal Reserve cautious about cutting rates further. These dynamics make the dollar naturally stronger, creating a headache for European exporters and widening the trade gap with the US. China is in no better shape. Its economy is struggling to find footing, with leaders calling for more fiscal and monetary stimulus. The renminbi, China’s currency, has been a key battleground in past US-China trade wars. Deliberate efforts by Chinese authorities to weaken the renminbi by buying up dollars are nothing new, and many analysts expect more of the same in the coming months. If Trump revives his tariff-heavy policies, China could respond with currency manipulation, setting the stage for another round of economic brinkmanship. This is where Trump’s unpredictable nature becomes a factor. During his first term, he didn’t hesitate to lash out at foreign stimulus measures, accusing them of undercutting American trade. If the dollar continues to rise, Trump could easily take a similar stance, especially if it helps him sell his trade policies as a win for American workers. A new currency accord or another Twitter storm? Trump has never been one to play by the rules. In 1985, the Plaza Accord saw major economies agree to weaken the dollar to balance global trade. Could he attempt a modern version of this, perhaps branded as a “Mar-a-Lago Accord”? It’s not far-fetched to imagine him demanding currency concessions from US trading partners in exchange for tariff relief. But pulling off such a deal would require diplomatic finesse—something Trump’s impulsive approach often lacks. The problem with currency negotiations is their complexity. Exchange rates aren’t just numbers; they reflect the economic health, trade dynamics, and monetary policies of entire nations. Coordinating these factors across multiple economies is like playing chess on multiple boards simultaneously. Trump’s tendency to simplify issues into win-or-lose terms makes this an especially risky path. Some analysts are already bracing for what they call “currency wars.” Despite these risks, markets seem to have priced in much of Trump’s potential impact. The dollar index has surged 6% since late October when investors started betting on his victory. This could limit the dollar’s upward momentum next year. But if Trump begins actively pressuring foreign governments to weaken their currencies, all bets are off. Social media-driven diplomacy could return with a vengeance, making financial markets as unpredictable as ever.

Aave price, for instance, seems to have taken off after making a somewhat tame performance in the remarkably bullish month of “Moonvember.” According to data from CoinGecko, the price of AAVE has increased by more than 26% over the past week. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the DeFi token may face some hurdles in its bullish trajectory and suffer a slight setback in the short term. Is AAVE Price Going To Witness A Correction? In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the investor sentiment around the Aave token has become increasingly positive following its latest price upswing. This on-chain observation is based on the Social Volume and Weighted Sentiment metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week The Social Volume metric measures the total number of mentions of a particular crypto asset on various social media platforms in the last 24 hours. In essence, it tracks the degree of discussion surrounding a cryptocurrency on social media. Meanwhile, weighted sentiment is a product of sentiment score and social volume. Typically, there is a significant shift in this metric when the social volume is high and there is a specific average sentiment (either positive or negative). Based on data from Santiment, the social volume and positive sentiment around the AAVE price action have grown significantly over the past few days. As shown in the chart below, this soaring positive sentiment correlates with the Aave price surge over the past week. According to Martinez, a brief price correction might be on the cards for Aave, especially with the crypto crowd seemingly hyped about the DeFi token’s price performance. This is based on the notion — backed by historical data — that crypto prices often in the opposite direction of the crowd. Recent price action data shows that the Aave price might be falling into something of a consolidation range, having failed to hold above the $380 mark on Friday. As of this writing, the Aave token is valued at $365, reflecting a mere 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours. DeFi Coins Back At It? Most of the attention has gone to the meme coins — and deservedly so — in this bull cycle. However, it appears that prominent DeFi coins are beginning to pull their weight and stake a claim for the spotlight.

When investors decide which stocks or ventures to invest in, they usually have a set of criteria to evaluate which options best align with their financial goals. One main factor to consider is risk appetite , which refers to investor willingness to take on risk in pursuit of potential returns. You might also like: VCs come and go, but launchpads will remain a fundamental part of web3 | Opinion Those with a lower risk appetite prefer more stable blue-chip stocks with steady but modest returns. On the other hand, investors with a higher risk tolerance may seek out more volatile stocks or emerging markets, enticed by the possibility of substantial returns. They are often willing to endure market fluctuations, believing the potential long-term rewards outweigh the risks. However, when it comes to crypto, retail investors have remained conservative. Despite the industry’s notorious promises of high returns, many retail investors cautiously approach crypto. Their hesitation is due to crypto’s well-known volatility, the perception that frauds and scams are prevalent, and a general lack of technological understanding compounded by a complex user experience. With 2025 on the horizon and Bitcoin ( BTC ) soaring amid bullish vibes, crypto has steadily gained traction as a legitimate investment class. While recent price jumps stem from Donald Trump’s election victory and his crypto-friendly appointees , the industry has been gaining traction for some time. The industry has found a new product-market fit for stablecoins, DeFi is booming, and newly improved infrastructure has enabled a variety of new applications while also reducing transaction costs. As such, many retail and institutional investors are becoming enamoured with crypto’s investment potential and growing technological capabilities. This begs the question: How can blockchain-based projects effectively convert conservative retail and institutional investors into active participants beyond their comfort zone? Enter crypto launchpads Crypto launchpads grant investors early access to tokens before they list on public exchanges. In practice, this offers investors enticing investment opportunities as they have the potential for higher ROIs. Cryptocurrency uncertainty can be unsettling for those who prefer investing in safe stocks with steady growth. Launchpads address these concerns by helping make crypto approachable, challenging the perception that it is unsafe, and emphasizing transparency to foster trust among hesitant new investors. The concept wasn’t always perfect. For one, ICOs became notorious during the 2017 bull run due to scammy token launches and straight-up fraud. However, the next generation of crypto launchpads incorporates stronger vetting practices to bolster safety and informed investment. This allows investors to engage with early-stage projects with a sense of security they might not get when exploring projects independently. Investors gain here in two ways. They get to actively engage with projects with some level of protection and gain bragging rights to say they helped launch an innovation in a growing field. As crypto expands and matures, so do the launchpads that propel many of the industry’s most promising projects, even putting community-focused spins on the “auction house” vibe launchpads sometimes inhabit. For instance, Gems’s launchpad emphasizes community and networking as it seeks to establish an exclusive ecosystem for crypto investing and fundraising. At the heart of Gems’s platform is a diverse network of “Leaders,” eager and discerning investor influencers who then rally their community around projects on the launchpad based on their interests and speciality. Compared to other launchpads, Gems recognizes the unpredictability of crypto investments and offers an optional protection program through a trusted insurance provider. To make sure the projects utilizing their launchpad are the cream of the crop, Gems’s investment committee also conducts a thorough vetting process to pinpoint teams with the most disruptive potential. It’s understandable why investors may be cautious about investing in unknown crypto projects. However, launchpads are an irreplaceable asset for an industry that is in the midst of expansion by helping demystify early-stage investing and broadening access to everyone.

Investors are giving precedence to innovative projects that focus on utility. Among these, BlockDAG and Cutoshi have surprised analysts with their wildly successful presales. BlockDAG Unique Technology Nets it $160.73M In Presales Ever since Bitcoin, there has been relatively little innovation in proof of work (PoW) technology. Instead, most crypto assets opted for an alternative model. Most recently, however, BlockDAG broke this trend with its unique take on PoW technology. This unique approach was successful, as so far, BlockDAG secured $160.73 million in its presale. The team is not stopping there and is aiming for a total of $600 million in investments. While the goal is ambitious, BlockDAG is on track to break new presale milestones soon. The key to its success is the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG’s unique take on PoW. Unlike most blockchains, DAG technology enables the creation of multiple blocks at the same time. This makes BlockDAG much more scalable than most blockchains. What is more, BlockDAG has the added advantage of PoW chains, which is higher security and decentralization. Unlike PoS chains, which are typically controlled by a small number of validators, PoS chains rely on miners. This creates a more decentralized validation infrastructure, protecting the network from attacks. The technical sophistication is not the only reason why investors are looking into BlockDAG. Namely, the project also offers tiered rewards to presale investors. The goal of these rewards is to incentivize those that support it early on. Cutoshi Blends Memes With DeFi Just like BlockDAG, memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) is also attracting attention thanks to its unique vision. In just weeks after starting its presale, Cutoshi raised $1 million in investments, gaining viral status. Now, the project is on track to sell out all its presale tokens. As of December 12, Cutoshi raised a total of $1,363 million in presale investments. The reason why traders are excited is its unique blend of memes and DeFi. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi token. It is based on the famous lucky cat, a symbol believed to bring luck and prosperity. At the same time, it is also a utility token for a DeFi ecosystem run by its users. Its ecosystem will feature a multichain DEX, a learning platform and various essential DeFi utilities. All of these are designed to make DeFi more accessible to average users. Cutoshi’s use of memes broadens its appeal to regular users and traders. While BlockDAG appeals to a section of tech-savvy investors, Cutoshi appeals to both meme coin traders and DeFi enthusiasts. Its focus on memes is also in line with its ability to attract regular users to DeFi. This is particularly important now that the crypto industry is increasingly focusing on end users and consumer applications. By bringing regular users to DeFi, Cutoshi has the potential to grow the entire DeFi ecosystem.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 12:10:52

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a sharp decline below the overbought range in the daily time frame. However, the average trendline continues hovering around the overbought range.

These are what custodial wallets are. They take the burden of asset protection off users, however, they may or may not bear the full brunt for the misplacement of the asset. Think Mt. Gox or FTX. This is the reason the crypto market has evolved in the last few years to be more personal, truly decentralized and non-custodial. This has birthed a plethora of decentralized and non-custodial services that facilitate borderless and trustless transactions. These services, especially wallets, literally give users the keys – and magic words – to their assets. Here, we explore five of such wallets. 1. NOW Wallet Supporting over 70 blockchains, 1500+ tokens, including coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monero (XMR), NOW Wallet enables a range of transactions: storing, sending, receiving, buying, selling, exchanging, and staking. Speaking of staking, users can stake Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA) and several other tokens. They also enjoy the flexibility of personalizing their asset management and transactions by adding custom tokens that run on supported EVM-compatible and Tron networks, and connecting to favorite dApps through WalletConnect. Furthermore, NOW Wallet ’s user-friendly interface and fiat-to-crypto function provide newbies with an easy pathway to the crypto market. This functionality allows the conversion of 60+ fiat currencies to crypto using Mastercard, Visa, Apple/Google Pay, or bank transfers. Though users do not need to go through KYC verification for crypto-to-crypto transfers with the wallet, its partner services require KYC for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions. Powered by the instant crypto exchange ChangeNOW, NOW Wallet also features free and paid Pro plans including a cashback of up to 0.2% for every swap made. Users also do not need to worry about shady transactions since they can run AML checks on their transactions. Other Pro features include unique domain names for receiving crypto payments and unlimited access to crypto loans. NOW Wallet is accessible on Google Play and App Store and macOS , Windows , and Linux devices. There’s also an efficient 24/7 customer support with a 99% resolution rate to attend to the diverse needs of users. 2. Metamask MetaMask is one of the most popular non-custodial wallets, boasting over 30 million monthly active users. It is not just a secure wallet for storing funds, but a way through which users connect to several blockchain-based applications. One of its key features is its portfolio platform that provides users with detailed insights about the performance of their assets across all networks. Thus, users can track price movements, know the total value of their portfolio, and monitor trends. With this data, they can make informed investment decisions. While Metamask supports a myriad of assets, they are all Ethereum- or EVM-based. This means that the wallet is not an option for users who have only non-Ethereum or non-EVM assets like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). 3. Coinbase Wallet Launched by Coinbase, US leading exchange, Coinbase Wallet offers users the opportunity to buy, swap, and stake their assets. The wallet supports thousands of digital assets, including NFTs. Furthermore, Coinbase Onramp makes it easy to purchase crypto. It gives users access to over 60 fiat currencies and more than 100 cryptocurrencies with a single integration. Recently, it added Apple Pay to this Onramp service, making fiat-to-crypto conversions even more convenient by allowing users to fund their wallet with 100+ tokens, enjoy no fees on USDC, and access to a range of fiat currencies. However, a downside to the wallet is that it has the tendency to accumulate transaction fees, particularly for smaller transactions. Also, its strict vetting policy makes it support a limited number of crypto assets and dApps. 4. Trust Wallet Supporting more than one million assets and 100+ blockchain networks, this is a great choice for users whose portfolios are a diversity of assets. Like other non-custodial wallets, Trust Wallet gives users total autonomy over their assets. Like NOW and Coinbase Wallet, users can also buy crypto with their local fiat currency. This service is managed by Trust’s global partners like MoonPay, Ramp Network, and Transak. They allow the wallet to handle over 100 different currencies and facilitate the easy purchase of cryptocurrencies with only a few clicks directly from the app. While Trust Wallet’s capacity to accommodate millions of assets makes it a powerhouse, it also indicates a significant security risk, especially for new users who are yet to differentiate between fake and legitimate assets. Also, its lack of two-factor authentication is a significant flaw in its security design. 5. Zerion Wallet Zerion is a perfect fit for DeFi users. It supports 60+ DeFi protocols and comes with an interface that allows its 200,000 monthly users to invest, lend, borrow, and swap their assets. While many non-custodial wallets that have integrated DeFi protocols give users a chance to earn passive income through staking, Zerion offers an alternative opportunity whereby users earn interest by lending tokens. Users can also access yield farming protocols and liquidity pools to earn rewards. This unique function is, however, constrained since the supported blockchains on Zerion are quite limited. Summary Non-custodial wallets are essential tools for secure, autonomous, and effective management of crypto assets. NOW Wallet, Metamask, Coinbase, Zerion and Trust Wallet are some of the most reliable non-custodial wallets designed to cater to crypto needs. NOW Wallet offers a truly personalized experience by allowing the addition of custom tokens and favorite dApps, the creation of unique domain names for receiving payments, while AML checks, cashback rewards, and access to unlimited crypto loans just add to the appeal. These functionalities easily make NOW Wallet a trendsetter for others. However, this doesn’t mean that other wallets fall short, because they all empower crypto users to easily navigate the dynamic crypto market, irrespective of their features or offerings. And since they are non-custodial, they enable users to flex their power of choice and unlock the full potential of their crypto journey.",Information,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 12:19:48

Despite recent struggles and a significant pullback earlier in the week, some analysts have predicted ETH could surge to $5,000 due to growing institutional demand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: A Recap Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to move beyond $4,000 as it faces considerable resistance, with buyers pegged back by selling activity at upper levels. ETH has been bullish since the US elections, with demand increasing substantially as markets surged following Donald Trump’s victory. ETH’s bull run peaked last week, reaching an intraday high of $4,093 before settling at $4,003, a level not seen since March 2024. However, sentiment waned over the weekend as the price registered a marginal drop on Saturday and fell to $3,999. ETH registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,007. Source: TradingView However, markets collapsed on Monday as they faced a sudden pullback. As a result, ETH plummeted over 7%, falling to an intraday low of $3,536 before recovering to reclaim $3,700 and settle at $3,715. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped over 2%, hitting a low of $3,521 before settling at $3,630. Sellers attempted to drive ETH below $3,500 on Wednesday as it fell to an intraday low of $3,558. However, it recovered from this level as sentiment changed, registering an increase of almost 6% and settling at $3,834. ETH attempted to go above $4,000 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $3,988. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and ultimately settled at $3,882 after registering an increase of 1.26%. Buyers retained control on Friday, and ETH registered a marginal increase to $3,907. In the current session, ETH is marginally up as buyers look to build momentum and move towards $4,000. What Next For Ethereum (ETH)? So, where does Ethereum (ETH) go from here? ETH is facing considerable resistance at $4,000, a level it has been unable to conquer as yet. Despite its recent struggles, analysts are confident ETH can surpass $4,000 and even hit $5,000 as institutional demand for the asset grows. Looking at the price chart, we see ETH has support at around $3,700. If sellers overwhelm this level, ETH could drop to $3,500. On the other hand, if buyers retain control and build enough momentum, a move beyond $4,000 is a realistic scenario. Analysts favor the latter scenario, with some predicting an unprecedented surge that could take ETH beyond $5,000. This prediction is backed by a significant spike in on-chain activity and a substantial increase in inflows to the new Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum funds reported $1.2 billion in inflows from investors as ETH emerged as a viable alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). According to CryptoQuant, renewed investor demand could take ETH well beyond $5,000. “Based on valuation metrics, ETH could be heading above $5,000 if current demand and supply dynamics continue.” CryptoQuant also noted the spike in on-chain activity, with daily transactions hovering between 6.5 million and 7.5 million for the current year, compared to around 5 million during the previous year. “Higher network activity on Ethereum signifies increased usage and demand for the network’s capabilities, reflecting growing adoption of decentralized applications.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, BlackRock has no plans to file an ETF application for XRP or any other altcoins, disclosed BlackRock ‘s ETF department head J ay Jacobs. This has sparked a major debate in the crypto community as the $12 trillion asset manager was the leading force behind spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. BlackRock XPP ETF Plans Off Table Jay Jacobs, head of BlackRock’s ETF department, turned down recent rumors surrounding the company’s plan to file an XRP ETF application . He said that even Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have only reached a few people yet, and the company will focus on expanding the coverage of these two types of ETFs currently. Jacobs confirmed that BlackRock is not planning to file an ETF application for XRP or any other altcoins. Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree filed applications for XRP ETF, with expectations of approval by the end of 2025. The comment from BlackRock came after rumors of an imminent XRP exchange-traded fund amid recent positive developments in the crypto industry. Donald Trump’s building a crypto-friendly administration and SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down boosted the sentiment. Rumors are circulating that BlackRock is planning to file for an $XRP ETF application. If that happens, it will bring a shit ton of liquidity to the crypto market. — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 13, 2024 Experts Believe XRP ETF Launch Is Imminent While BlackRock has decided to delay further Crypto ETFs, experts such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and The ETF Store president Nate Geraci have remained bullish on the launch. Contrarily, BlackRock’s decision has received appreciation from some investors. As per a comment, a step-by-step approach is better than launching a new ETF too soon as it will only worsen volatility. However, recent data suggests that spot XRP ETF launch could be significant for issuers and the crypto market. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that Coinbase whales are primarily driving the XRP rally. He said “Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13%” amid the ongoing price rally.” Moreover, Grayscale XRP Trust has recorded a robust 300% return since May. Prominent crypto market figure Ben Armstrong, aka “The BitBoy”, claimed robust return is a “good sign” of a potential XRP ETF launch in the US soon. XRP Price Ready to Rally After RLUSD Stablecoin Launch The recent approval of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD by NYDFS sparked further speculation on an XRP exchange-traded fund as it will help create a regulated market for XRP. This will also trigger a rally in Ripple’s native crypto price. The RLUSD stablecoin launch is the big catalyst coming up, along with Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. CME and CF Benchmarks launched the reference rates and index for XRP. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart argued it is a major catalyst for a potential XRP ETF launch. XRP price jumped 3% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $2.43. The 24-hour low and high are $2.34 and $2.52, respectively. The crypto has rallied more than 400% in recent weeks, with the price consolidating currently for a potential XRP rally to $5.

After leading the organization for three years, she is now resigning. She is not leaving the organization but now she will join as the Senior Global Advisor. Let’s have a look at her work and how she has contributed towards the crypto ecosystem. A Tough Time for Crypto When Warren took over at CCI, things weren’t exactly smooth sailing. The crypto market was in a rough spot, and there were serious regulatory challenges to face. Even so, she helped CCI gain a reputation for advocating for clear and transparent crypto regulations.

She stayed focused on making sure the crypto world wasn’t written off because of a few bad apples. Her leadership kept CCI in the game, and she’ll be remembered for that. What Happens Next at CCI? Warren’s departure leaves some big shoes to fill, but CCI isn’t worried. Ji Kim, the Chief Legal Officer, will take over as Acting CEO. Warren’s confident Ji will keep things moving forward with the same level of commitment and vision. At the same time, the SEC is about to see changes as well. Gary Gensler, known for his strict policies, will step down in January 2025 , and industry experts are hopeful that his replacement, Paul Atkins, could signal a more crypto-friendly approach. What’s Coming Up for CCI? Though Warren’s leaving the CEO position, she’s not leaving the mission behind. She’s proud of the work done so far and hinted at some exciting things coming next, though she’s keeping details close to her chest. Under Ji Kim’s leadership, CCI is going to continue pushing for the kinds of crypto regulations that let innovation happen without making the whole industry a free-for-all. It’s a time of change, and there’s a lot of hope for the future of crypto, both at CCI and in Washington. Stay tuned for what’s coming.

Musk recently labeled the SEC a “political tool” after his company Neuralink came under scrutiny . Garlinghouse, no stranger to clashes with the SEC, amplified Musk’s message, sparking intense discussions in the crypto and political circles. What he said https://t.co/sHs1aLkf8Z — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 13, 2024 Industry Openly Lashes Out at SEC It seems like the crypto industry has waged an open war against the SEC’s overreach. Recently Elon Musk vented his frustration over the SEC for their aggressive approach toward companies, including Neuralink. His remarks, accusing the SEC of being a “political tool,” is a voice many have been raising for a long time who feel the agency is not fair. Musk once again stirred the controversial pot which points out that the SEC’s actions are to protect markets or if it’s pushing a broader political agenda. For Garlinghouse, the frustration runs deep. Ripple has been locked in a prolonged legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP, its native token, should be classified as a security. This case has become a symbol of the larger struggle between innovation in crypto and regulatory oversight. Many in the industry argue that the SEC’s actions stifle growth, creating unnecessary roadblocks for projects trying to bring blockchain technology to the mainstream. Due to this XRP faced massive losses and SEC is also accused of causing this damage deliberately to suppress XRP over Bitcoin and ETH. In his interview with 60-minute Garlinghouse pointed out the need for clear regulations for digital assets, stating that Ripple isn’t seeking deregulation but rather asking for “clear rules of the road” to guide the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Michael Saylor Dodges Question About Ripple Vs SEC , Growing Criticism of the SEC However, it’s not just Musk and Garlinghouse speaking out. Political figures like Senator Mike Lee and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have also criticized the SEC . Lee has questioned the agency’s trustworthiness, while Ramaswamy highlighted its repeated legal losses as a sign of overreach. Legal experts have also pointed to recent court rulings that suggest the SEC may be stepping beyond its authority, raising questions about its focus and priorities. On the other hand, Chamath Palihapitiya criticized the SEC for wasting government resources and using legal tactics to target individuals they disagree with, labeling the behavior as corrupt. He highlighted how only wealthy individuals like Elon Musk can defend themselves against such actions, while others would struggle without similar resources.

The record leveraged shorts happened as open interest in Ethereum futures on the CME reached a record high of over one million ETH. Overall, open interest in Ethereum has increased over the past few weeks, setting a new record high of 6.91 million ETH ($27 billion) across all exchanges. While the heightened open interest indicates more speculative activity, the short positions raise concerns about the ETH price. ETH shorts reach new highs on the CME. Source: Zerohedge Meanwhile, record shorts on CME suggest that institutional investors (hedge funds) are shorting ETH. This has led to speculation about whether this is a basis trade, i.e., investors hedging their bets on spot ETH by shorting its futures to take advantage of the price gaps. Nevertheless, the leveraged short positions pose a risk of massive liquidation if the price of ETH should rise unexpectedly. This could also mean extra sell pressure for the asset, as the short squeeze could force more people to become cautious and reduce their exposure. Onchain analysts bullish on ETH due to increased demand Despite the record short positions, many analysts believe that ETH will rise in value soon and point to on-chain signals to prove their point. According to data from CryptoQuant , Ethereum will likely surpass $5,000, as its realized price upper band is at $5,200. The blockchain analytics platform notes that demand and supply are gaining the strength to play out this scenario. It said: “The realized price upper band, currently at $5.2k, matches the level seen during the 2021 bull run peak, signaling strong potential for further growth.” Most of that growing demand comes from Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen more investor interest recently. The net inflow into ETFs now stands at $2.268 billion despite Grayscale ETHE seeing over $3.5 billion in outflows. BlackRock ETHA also has over $3 billion inflow after ten consecutive days of inflows. These continuous accumulations have driven the upward movement of ETH price. With the accumulation increasing, many believe ETH will see massive gains in 2025. VanEck , in its predictions for next year, projected that ETH would reach $6,000, while BitWise was even more bullish, with a $7,000 prediction. $3,700 to $3,810 is a key support level for ETH price. Source: Ali Martinez However, whether ETH will even finish 2024 above $4,000 still depends on its ability to maintain its price above $3,700. Technical analyst Ali Martinez has noted that $3,700 to $3,810 is one of ETH’s most important support levels, as three million wallets bought 4.6 million ETH at that level. Ethereum is seeing a surge in scarcity Meanwhile, ETH supply, which is currently around 120 million, has also witnessed a turnaround in the burn rate. The network was at the center of a debate about L2s earlier in the year due to the high emissions of ETH on the L1 network and low transaction volume, which has caused the burn rate also to fall. However, the average daily burn rate has increased to 2,700 ETH, compared to 80 ETH in August. This means that ETH supply has once again become deflationary due to heightened network activity, and many believe this will cause the ETH price to increase further. Most of the network activities seem to be trending up for Ethereum. The network has seen an 8-month high in new wallets, with an average of over 130,000 new addresses created daily throughout December, a 2.63% increase this week. The last time it saw this much activity was in April. Additionally, active addresses on Ethereum also increased by 4.24% this week, while addresses with zero balance fell by 4.06%.

The news caught fire when Justin Sun’s BiT Global, which recently took a major stake in the wBTC ecosystem, slapped a lawsuit on Coinbase for the delisting of wrapped Bitcoin. Justin Sun Questions Coinbase on wBTC Delisting Justin Sun’s BiT Global will be suing crypto exchange Coinbase, which decided to delist wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and instead launched a competing product cBTC back in September. On November 19, Coinbase announced plans to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) starting December 19, 2024, citing a periodic review of its listing standards. However, delisting the largest tokenized version of Bitcoin i.e. wBTC has grabbed the attention. Earlier this year, BiT Global Trust took custodial rights for WBTC. Now it alleges that Coinbase isn’t following its “fair” listing standard and is removing wBTC to weed out competition for its newly launch cBTC. Law firm Kneupper & Covey, representing BiT Global, has filed a lawsuit alleging that Coinbase’s decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is anti-competitive and violates multiple state and federal laws. The suit claims the delisting will cause significant harm to BiT Global, which recently assumed custodial responsibilities for WBTC under a new arrangement. In a statement on Friday, attorney Kevin Kneupper said: “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” However, Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal has justified the exchange’s actions noting: “When an asset no longer meets our listing standards, we will drop it. When another asset can meet or exceed market requirements without sacrificing those standards, we will list it. Thank you Bit Global for the chance to show this to a US federal court and on the entire global crypto stage”. Responding to this, Justin Sun pointed out an earlier statement by Armstrong back from 2021, wherein he stated: “Outside of our listing standards, we do not offer an opinion on the value of each asset. We are asset agnostic because we believe in free markets”. Sun told Grewal that his views don’t match that of Coinbase founder’s. Listing “Valueless” Meme Coins? The law firm representing BiT Global stated that Coinbase has recently listed several “fundamentally valueless” memecoins, yet has now deemed Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as failing to meet its standards. The recent one includes the listing of Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) . It added: “Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform—and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC”. In September 2024, Coinbase introduced cbBTC on Ethereum and its Layer 2 network, Base. Since its launch, cbBTC has become the second-largest tokenized version of Bitcoin, boasting a market capitalization of just over $2 billion.

A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Physical Networks,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-is-depin-a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-physical-networks/,"The post What is DePIN? A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Physical Networks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News DePin, short for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, represents the natural evolution of blockchain technology beyond Web3 and into the physical world. As blockchain and decentralized solutions gain traction, DePin has emerged as a topic of growing interest. While still in its early stages, this innovative concept has the potential to disrupt existing technologies and create more efficient solutions across various sectors. But, what exactly is DePin? How does it work? And why is everyone suddenly talking about it? What is DePin? DePin is just an umbrella term for all networks that use blockchain to decentralize control or ownership over physical infrastructure. So, DePin includes a network of crowd-sourced providers. Here, these providers offer real-world services to users and use blockchain to keep a record of these services. In turn, they receive rewards (for the services) via cryptocurrency that might run on the same or a completely different blockchain network. Imagine a world where, instead of relying on large corporations, we depend on OURSELVES to run systems. By sharing resources like computers, internet access, or even solar panels, we collectively build and sustain infrastructure. Let’s simplify it further. Say you and your friends need a wifi network. However, instead of relying on one big company to provide it, you all chip in by setting up your own small Wi-Fi devices. These devices can now create a big network together and everyone has access. What’s cool is that no single person owns the network. It’s run by everyone who contributes to it. In addition, say, when you build or maintain the network by setting up the device, you can earn rewards too. This is an idea of sharing both responsibilities and rewards. Right? DePin is based on this idea. Think of teamwork but on a broader, more global scale. DePin leverages blockchain and token-based rewards to decentralize infrastructure, reducing reliance on large corporations and breaking their monopolies. It’s a concept applicable across diverse sectors, from transportation and energy to wireless connectivity. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore the different categories of DePin. Categories of DePin. DePin networks can be broadly classified into two categories: Physical Resource Networks (PRNs): These focus on tangible, physical resources such as raw materials, transportation, or facilities. Digital Resource Networks (DRNs): These manage intangible, digital resources like data, software, or information. While both aim to optimize resources, their domains of operation—physical versus digital—set them apart. How Does DePin Work? DePin combines blockchain technology with real-world physical infrastructure to create shared, decentralized networks. Here’s how it works: Start with a Physical Resource Examples include a wireless hotspot, an electric vehicle charger, or a data storage device. These assets aren’t controlled by a single company but are instead distributed among individuals contributing to the network. Think back to the Wi-Fi example we discussed earlier. Blockchain for Coordination A blockchain network manages and coordinates these distributed resources, ensuring transparency, security, and decentralization. Rewards for Contributors Contributors earn tokens for sharing their resources. This incentive model encourages broader participation. End-Users Pay for Services Users accessing these services can pay using tokens or, in some cases, traditional payment methods, depending on the network’s setup. Smart Contracts at Work Smart contracts automate transactions, rewards, and agreements, eliminating the need for central authorities. They execute predefined actions seamlessly and securely. For example, let’s consider the Helium Network project. It is a DePin project where individuals deploy wireless hotspots for IoT devices and earn HNT (cryptocurrency) to share network coverage. Then people can connect their devices to hotspots and pay in tokens for the data they use. Interesting, right? Technology Used in DePin DePin is like a smart system where people share physical resources—Wi-Fi, storage, energy—and get rewarded for their contributions. Here’s a breakdown of the core technologies that power DePin: Blockchain: Say you find a giant, super-secure notebook where every action is written down and can’t be erased. That is blockchain! It keeps track of who’s sharing what and makes sure everyone gets rewarded fairly. And there’s no way for unfair practices. Tokens: When you help out by sharing something, you can earn in tokens. These are like digital reward points and you can use them to buy something cool or even trade for real money. It’s how DePIN says, “Thanks for helping!” IoT Devices: If you’ve seen gadgets like sensors, cameras, or Wi-Fi hotspots, they are the little helpers in DePIN. They collect data or provide services and return that information to the network. You can say they are the worker bees of the system. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are automated agreements that execute actions based on predefined conditions. For example, if someone shares a Wi-Fi hotspot, a smart contract can instantly reward them with tokens without needing any middleman. P2P Networks: Instead of going through a big company’s server, people in DePIN talk directly to each other. It’s like sharing files or streaming a movie directly from a friend’s computer. It’s of course faster and cheaper, with no bossy middlemen. Storage and Compute: You also have a giant shared garage where everyone offers some of their unused space or computer power. Did you say you need a place to store your files or run some heavy tasks? DePIN’s got your back through this shared system. AI and Data: What happens to all the data from devices and users? AI can make sense of it—like figuring out where a Wi-Fi hotspot is most needed or how to use certain resources more efficiently. It’s the brain behind the scenes. Governance: Since there’s no almighty leader in DePIN, everyone who owns tokens can vote on important stuff. We can decide about making upgrades or changing how rewards work. It’s teamwork at its best! So, in short, DePIN uses cutting-edge tech like blockchain, tokens, and smart gadgets to let people share resources directly, get rewarded, and make decisions together. Core Principles of DePin DePin is guided by key principles that set it apart from traditional systems. Think of them as the “rules of the game” that ensure fairness, inclusivity, and growth. We go back to decentralization. As we already know, here, power is in the hands of people. There’s no one individual controlling everything. Power is spread out among people who participate in the game. Everyone has a role and no matter what they are sharing or using, they benefit from it. Incentives are driving participation DePin supports a give-and-get model. You share something that adds value and get rewarded for it. The reward is tokens that have real value. They keep the motivation on. The more you contribute, the more you earn. Digital weds physical DePin doesn’t just work on the internet, it connects the real world with the virtual one. Say: Wifi hotspot provides internet Sensors collecting weather data Storage devices hosting files You use tech to solve problems in the real world in an efficient and helpful way. Everyone has open access: DePin is an inclusive system. You don’t need technical expertise to participate. If you have a resource to share, you can join—no special qualifications required. Transparency for Trust Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and changes are visible to everyone. Whether it’s a token reward or a network upgrade, everything is transparent. No hidden deals, no sneaky edits—just open and fair processes. Decisions have to be community-driven If you participate in the network, you can have a say in how it runs. You can vote and hold important decisions on upgrades and changes in rewards too. In this game, every member decides what happens next. Scalability drives growth DePin is designed to grow. As more participants join and share resources, the network becomes stronger, faster, and more useful. This scalability benefits everyone involved, creating a win-win ecosystem. Use Cases of DePin Across Industries We already know DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) can really shake up a lot of sectors. While the idea seems simple, it can transform industries in amazing ways. We can go sector by sector and find out how: Telecommunications Say instead of big telecom companies owning all the towers and hotspots, people like you and me set up small devices and get paid for providing internet in our neighborhoods. Hold on to the thought for once. That’s the future! Use Case : The Helium Network is already doing this. Individuals set up IoT hotspots and provide wireless coverage for things like smart sensors. Don’t forget that they earn tokens as a reward. Why It’s Cool : It expands coverage to areas traditional telecoms overlook. It is cheaper for users too because it does not depend on the big middleman companies. Energy and Utilities What if your rooftop solar panels or home battery could contribute to a decentralized energy grid? You could sell your extra energy to neighbours and get paid directly. Use Case : Networks like Voltus help people contribute energy savings to grids and in turn earn rewards. Why It’s Cool : Firstly, it encourages renewable energy sharing. Next, it makes energy cheaper and more reliable, especially if you consider the remote areas. Transportation and Mobility Say there is a city where you share resources like electric vehicle (EV) charging stations or even parking spaces, and the system rewards you for participating. Use Case : Decentralized networks for EV charging can let us individuals host charging points at home or businesses. We can then earn tokens from drivers who use them. When someone has a shared bike or scooter program, they can use DePIN to ensure fair distribution and rewards. Why It’s Cool : It makes transportation more accessible and sustainable. DePin reduces reliance on big companies to build infrastructure. Cloud Storage and Computing Instead of paying big companies like Google or Amazon for cloud storage, you could store your files on a decentralized network where regular people like us can provide the space. Use Case : Filecoin and Storj let users rent out unused hard drive space to others. Why It’s Cool : We don’t have to worry about the security of files because they’re split into pieces and stored across multiple locations. It’s cheaper too because it uses people’s spare storage instead of giant data centers. Healthcare and Life Sciences Consider a world where your wearable fitness tracker (like a smartwatch) contributes health data to a decentralized network for medical research. And again, you get rewarded for it. Use Case : Decentralized networks can gather data for research on diseases like diabetes or Alzheimer’s but still keep your data private. Why It’s Cool : Patients can stay in control of their data. It helps researchers access more diverse and accurate information. Smart Cities and IoT Cities need lots of data to run efficiently. You need to have a check on traffic patterns, air quality, temperature, etc. Instead of governments installing expensive sensors everywhere, we can just deploy devices as we want and earn tokens to provide the data that they need. Use Case : Helium or similar networks can easily power smart city applications like air quality monitoring or traffic management. Why It’s Cool : It saves cities money while involving the community. The system makes smart city technology more accessible for smaller towns. Supply Chain and Logistics You know how tricky it can be to track goods as they move from factories to stores. DePIN can use sensors to monitor conditions like temperature and location in real-time and reward people who provide the infrastructure. Use Case : A decentralized network of GPS trackers and IoT devices keeps tabs on goods in transit. Why It’s Cool : You know the value of transparency, and you know exactly where your stuff is. It reduces costs by removing middlemen. Media and Entertainment Say you could share your unused bandwidth to help others stream videos or play games and earn rewards for it, would you skip it? Use Case : Decentralized video streaming platforms could use shared resources to host videos. Gamers could share unused computing power for rendering graphics or even hosting servers. Why It’s Cool : DePin makes streaming and gaming cheaper and faster. We can have our power back to users and leave out the giant platforms. Finance and Insurance You create micro-networks for peer-to-peer lending or decentralized insurance pools using DePin. Here people contribute funds to a shared pool and earn returns. Use Case : Farmers in rural areas could form insurance networks to protect against crop failures. Why It’s Cool : We can now make financial services accessible to underserved areas. DePin reduces reliance on big banks or insurers. The Big Picture DePIN stands out with its flexibility. It’s like the ultimate sharing economy—but actually powered by blockchain and real-world resources. Benefits of DePin DePIN is a cool concept but it’s more than that. It’s because it solves real-world problems while making systems fairer, more accessible, and more efficient. Perfect, right? But, what’s in it for us? For Individuals: Earn and Participate Earn Rewards: If you have something to share, you can earn tokens. These tokens often have real-world value. Example: Running a Helium hotspot to provide Wi-Fi earns you tokens. Low Barriers to Entry: The best thing is the fact that anyone can participate. You do not need to be a tech wizard or have a big company backing you. You just need a resource to share! It’s like getting paid for letting others borrow your extra stuff. How cool is that? For Businesses: Efficiency and Cost Savings Lower Costs: Businesses don’t have to build massive infrastructure themselves anymore. They can just use DePIN networks to access storage, bandwidth, or data from people already providing them. Example: A startup can use Filecoin for cheap, decentralized file storage instead of paying for expensive centralized services. Scalability on Demand: DePIN can grow with demand. As more participants join, businesses can tap into more resources when they need them. And you do not need heavy upfront investments. It’s like renting instead of owning—use what you need when you need it, and save money. For Communities: Fair and Open Systems Local Benefits: People in communities can now set up and maintain infrastructure (like Wi-Fi hotspots or energy-sharing systems) to earn tokens. It keeps the benefits local instead of sending our profits to big corporations. Example: A rural area can set up a DePIN network to provide internet where big companies won’t invest. Democratic Governance: Decisions about the network—like how rewards are distributed—are often made by community voting. It’s like having a neighborhood project where everyone contributes and shares the rewards. For Technology and Innovation: Cutting-Edge Solutions Better Use of Resources: DePIN taps into unused resources like idle computers, extra internet bandwidth, or renewable energy. Instead of wasting these, they’re put to good use. Example: Unused storage on your computer becomes part of a global decentralized storage network. Innovation Without Monopolies: Since DePIN is decentralized, no single company can monopolize it. This encourages innovation and competition, making the system better for everyone. It’s like turning leftovers into a gourmet meal—making the most of what’s already there. For the Environment: Greener Solutions Energy Efficiency: DePIN often uses distributed networks, which can be more energy-efficient than centralized systems that rely on massive data centers or infrastructure. Example: A solar-powered device contributing to a network while earning tokens. Promotes Renewables: Networks can be built using clean energy sources shared by participants, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. It’s like sharing a carpool to save gas—efficient and eco-friendly. For Users: Better Services and Lower Costs Improved Access: Services like internet, file storage, or computing become cheaper and more widely available because no middleman is hiking up prices. Example: A DePIN storage network can be more affordable and reliable than a big tech company’s service. More Choices: You get more choices because DePIN systems are decentralized, users can choose between multiple providers rather than being stuck with one big company. It’s like shopping at a farmer’s market instead of a giant supermarket—you get more variety and better deals. For the World: A Resilient Future No Single Point of Failure: As DePIN is decentralized, it might be harder for the network to go down. Even if one part fails, others keep working. Example: If one storage node goes offline, your data is safe on other nodes. Global Collaboration: DePIN connects people worldwide, creating a global network of contributors and users. It’s like having a backup for your backup—always on and reliable. Challenges of DePIN Now that we all agree that DePIN is an amazing idea, it’s not easy. Like any big change, there are some tough corners we need to glide through. Scaling Participation The Challenge: DePIN thrives on user participation, but onboarding individuals can be slow. Many are unfamiliar with blockchain or hesitant to contribute their resources. Why It Matters: The network’s effectiveness depends on widespread adoption. Without enough contributors, the system’s value diminishes. The Fix: Simplify onboarding with user-friendly interfaces and education campaigns that demystify blockchain and DePIN processes. Handling Growth The Challenge: Small networks are manageable, but scaling up introduces technical bottlenecks. A sudden influx of users can lead to slower performance or even network failures. Why It Matters: A poor user experience during growth can drive participants away and damage trust in the network. The Fix: Develop scalable infrastructure and stress-test systems to ensure they can handle surges in demand without disruptions. Regulation and Trust Issues The Challenge: Operating in the blockchain space often places DePIN networks in a regulatory grey zone. Users may also hesitate to trust a system that feels unfamiliar or lacks guarantees. Why It Matters: Without legal clarity and user trust, adoption becomes an uphill battle. The Fix: Work proactively with regulators to establish compliance and transparency. Build trust through open governance and robust security measures. Balancing Rewards The Challenge: Designing fair incentives is tricky. Rewards that are too low fail to attract participants, while overly generous rewards can invite exploitation and unsustainable practices. Why It Matters: A poorly balanced reward system undermines network sustainability and participant satisfaction. The Fix: Use dynamic reward models that adjust based on contributions and market conditions to ensure fairness and sustainability. Bridging the Tech Divide The Challenge: Rural or underserved areas, where DePIN could make the biggest difference, often lack the resources or knowledge to participate. Why It Matters: These gaps prevent DePIN from realizing its full potential as a tool for global equity. The Fix: Provide affordable starter kits, community-driven support, and partnerships to bridge the digital divide. Competing with Centralized Giants The Challenge: Established companies like internet providers or cloud storage giants already dominate the space, with trust, money, and infrastructure on their side. Why It Matters: Competing against these giants can slow DePIN’s growth and adoption. The Fix: Highlight DePIN’s unique advantages like fairness, affordability, and community-driven governance to carve out a niche. Managing Technical Complexity The Challenge: Blockchain and decentralized networks can be intimidating for newcomers, creating a barrier to entry. Why It Matters: High technical complexity limits participation to a small tech-savvy group, reducing inclusivity. The Fix: Develop intuitive interfaces and abstract the technical complexities to make participation accessible to all. So, while DePIN has incredible potential to change how we share and use resources, it’s not without its growing pains. Want to hear the good news? These are challenges worth solving, and every step forward makes the system better for everyone. The Future of Decentralized Physical Networks When we try to imagine the future of Decentralized Physical Networks (DePIN) , it’s exciting because it’s not just about technology. It’s also about changing the way we work, share, and live. If we think about how the internet made the world smaller and connected us all, DePIN is like the next step. Now rather than just sharing information, we’re sharing real things : Wi-Fi, energy, storage, sensors, and more. In the future, DePIN could make our lives much easier and more fair. Just consider living in a place where everyone contributes to building local networks for the internet or energy. You do not have to wait for giant companies to show up, communities can create their own systems and keep the rewards. Rural areas could finally have reliable internet. Cities could use smart sensors to manage traffic and pollution, all owned and run by the people who live there. We would finally be part of the process. For businesses, this means a low barrier to entry. A small startup could access global resources and they don’t have to build massive infrastructure. This opens the door to new innovations and ideas because the tools are affordable and available to all of us. It’s also super eco-friendly too. In the future, we could even see solar-powered DePIN nodes everywhere, turning clean energy into something valuable for everyone. And let’s not forget how secure and resilient it will actually be. There would be no central point of failure. So, DePIN networks are much harder to shut down or control. Your data and services will always be accessible, no matter what happens in one part of the network. Ultimately, the future of DePIN is all about empowerment . It puts control back in the hands of people, creating systems that are fair, inclusive, and long-lasting. It’s like creating a world where collaboration drives progress. That’s a future we’d all want to be a part of—no? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As such, Best Wallet is establishing itself as a top crypto and Bitcoin wallet brand, marketing itself as a one-stop shop for all things Web3. Its multi-chain, non-custodial and no-KYC features have appealed to users tired of legacy products like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Experts believe that Best Wallet could become the go-to crypto wallet for retail investors in this bull cycle. With $BEST unlocking lucrative monetary perks within the ecosystem, it is no surprise that prominent investors are bullish on its upside potential. A few experts are even calling it the next 10x crypto. Best Wallet - The Best Crypto Wallet? Best Wallet is branding itself as “the smartest way to buy, store and swap crypto”, eyeing a lion’s share of the incoming retail investors during this bull market. One of its key selling points is its multi-chain nature. Crypto investors no longer need to have a separate wallet for each chain and another for Bitcoin. Thanks to its integration with Onramper, Best Wallet users can buy cryptocurrencies from 60+ chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and BNB. Similarly, users can remove their holdings from risky CEXs and store them in Best Wallet. Swapping crypto coins is also faster, cheaper and more seamless with Best Wallet, thanks to its native decentralized exchange Best DEX, which finds the best rates and lowest trading fees. As previously stated, this next-gen wallet isn’t limited to buying, storing and swapping crypto. Instead, it aims to be an all-in-one platform, offering users all they need to succeed in the upcoming bull market. For instance, Best Wallet has unveiled its own presale aggregator, the “Upcoming tokens” feature. Investing early in new cryptocurrencies remains one of the best avenues to seeing attractive returns in this bull cycle. The “Upcoming Tokens” feature lists some of the best-performing presale cryptos and allows users to buy the coins without leaving the platform. For instance, it played a key role in helping Pepe Unchained (PEPU) raise over $73.7 million in ICO. The PEPU coin went live on Uniswap on Tuesday and has already appreciated more than 200% in its value. Similar high-upside crypto coins in their presale are available for buying on Best Wallet. The product’s other attractive features include a staking aggregator for earning passive income at an industry-high rate, the Best Card for spending crypto directly on retail shops and iGaming partnerships, which allow users to play with their crypto and earn attractive bonuses, free spins and exclusive lootboxes. Features like Portfolio Management and Market Insights are coming down the pipeline. Thanks to its unique value proposition, Best Wallet is quickly becoming one of the top crypto and Bitcoin wallet brands on the market. Its attractive features make it one of the must-have tools for the upcoming bull market. It is not without any reason that Best Wallet is seeing 50% MoM growth and could capture 40% of the $11 billion non-custodial market. Download Best Wallet from the App Store or Google Play today. Is $BEST The Next 10x Crypto? Experts are viewing investing in the $BEST presale like buying MetaMask’s native cryptocurrency early. As mentioned earlier, Best Wallet has the potential to become one of the most sought-after products in the upcoming crypto bull market. At the same time, the Best Wallet Token enables holders to unlock maximum rewards within the ecosystem. For instance, $BEST holders can purchase “Upcoming Tokens” coins at their Stage 0 presale prices. They will also benefit from reduced transaction fees while buying, selling or swapping their crypto coins as well as earning higher staking rewards. They will also receive an 8% cashback on every Best Card transaction. Perhaps, most importantly, Best Wallet Token holders will be part of the project’s Community Governance initiative. They will vote on all key decisions, including marketing, new features and exchange listings, and decide the direction of the project. With such attractive perks, it is no surprise that smart money investors are bullish on BEST’s prospects in the coming bull market, especially since it is a microcap crypto. A growing number of experts are calling it the next 10x crypto while others are eyeing up to 100x returns. However, interested buyers have an extremely short window to stack $BEST at the lowest possible price. The high demand for the crypto means its presale stages are quickly selling out, which means that the token price is climbing rapidly.

Whales Make Big Moves in Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin",https://coinpedia.org/news/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dip-whales-make-big-moves-in-cardano-xrp-dogecoin-and-bitcoin/,"The post Is it Time to Buy the Dip? Whales Make Big Moves in Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Whale activity has surged in the last 24 hours, Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently observed significant whale activity in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and XRP during a market dip. His insights shed light on how deep-pocketed investors are taking advantage of market corrections to accumulate more assets, signaling strong confidence in these digital currencies despite short-term price drops. Whale investors are buying the dip – should you too? Let’s find out. Cardano Whales are Charged with a Strong Comeback Cardano (ADA) has seen impressive growth , surging over 100% in the past month. However, it has experienced a near 4% decline in the last week, suggesting some short-term selling pressure. Martinez pointed out that in the last 48 hours, Cardano whales have been particularly active. Over 80 million ADA tokens were purchased during this period, showing that large investors are undeterred by the current 6.22% drop in its price. At $1.14 per token, Cardano remains a key asset for those looking to capitalize on its long-term potential. Whales seem to believe in its smart contract capabilities, continuing to accumulate ADA even amid market fluctuations. Dogecoin Whales Raising the Bar for Memecoins In the meme sector, Dogecoin has faced difficulty breaking above the $0.5 mark, despite significant whale activity. However, Martinez noted that investors holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE tokens bought a massive 210 million DOGE during the recent market correction. Despite a 4.7% decrease in its price, now at $0.402, Dogecoin remains a popular asset for whales who are betting on its future growth, regardless of its volatility . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market This Week: Top Performers, Losers, and Key Trends , Buy-the-Dip Strategy Continues XRP Whales Adding Coins Despite the Drop Finally, XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency took a dip of 5% today and currently trading at $2.43 yet the coin is making some massive moves with significant whale activity. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens bought over 100 million XRP during its recent price dip. This suggests that whales are confident in XRP’s future despite its price fluctuations, indicating strong long-term interest in the asset. Big players are shifting significant amounts—could be a sign of a market shake-up ahead. We will come to know. Interestingly, coins like Cardano and XRP are quite noteworthy, this shows that the fear of the SEC is fading from investors ’ minds. Are we expecting an early bell of Altcoin season?

Notably, the discussions stem from the exchange delisting the wBTC token from its platform, which has sparked discussions in the market. Besides, Bit Global, backed by Justin Sun, has sued the leading exchange for delisting the token from its platform recently. Coinbase CLO Reaffirms Exchange’s Listing Standards The controversy erupted after Coinbase announced it would delist wBTC on December 19, 2024, following a review of its listing standards. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of the crypto exchange, addressed the matter in a recent social media post, stating, “When an asset no longer meets our listing standards, we will drop it. When another asset can meet or exceed market requirements without sacrificing those standards, we will list it.” Grewal also expressed confidence in defending the exchange’s position in a U.S. federal court, stating: “Thank you Bit Global for the chance to show this to a US federal court and on the entire global crypto stage.” BiT Global, backed by Tron Founder Justin Sun, has recently sued the crypto exchange for delisting the token. Besides, the firm, BiT Global, has also acquired a key stake in the wBTC ecosystem. The delisting decision has raised questions, especially after BitGo, the wBTC custodian, announced a new custody structure involving BiT Global. Critics, including major DeFi players like MakerDAO and Aave, voiced skepticism about this partnership, though wBTC remains part of their platforms. Meanwhile, Justin Sun challenged Grewal’s remarks, sharing a screenshot of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s earlier statement that emphasized listing “every asset where it is legal to do so.” In response, Grewal pointed out that safety and legality are central to the leading crypto exchange’s listing decisions. He added a sharp rebuttal to Sun, saying he looked forward to Sun’s deposition under oath in California. wBTC Price Soars Amid Listing Debate The Coinbase-wBTC dispute underscores the broader challenges crypto platforms face in balancing innovation with due diligence. For the exchange, the focus remains on ensuring only safe and compliant assets make it to its platform. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal reinforced this point in his recent X post. Notably, Justin Sun’s criticism also drew attention to his role in the wBTC ecosystem. The partnership between BitGo, BiT Global, and the Tron ecosystem has faced skepticism within the crypto community. The exchange’s decision to delist wBTC may reflect these concerns. However, despite the news, wBTC price today noted a surge of more than 1% and exchanged hands at $101,152 as Bitcoin soars. Its trading volume fell 5% to $353 million, while the token saw a 24-hour high of $101,772.65.

37633492,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627439,1734182397,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37633492.jpeg,China’s stubborn deflation really is a global economic problem,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-deflation-global-economic-problem/,"China is spiraling deeper into deflation, and it’s not just Beijing’s problem anymore—it’s everybody’s. Prices have been falling for six straight quarters. One more, and China ties the grim record from the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s. But it’s not like Beijing is sitting around doing nothing. Policymakers are trying to fix it, but nothing seems to be sticking. And as Donald Trump preps his return to the White House with promises of crushing Chinese exports with a 60% tariff, things are about to get even worse. What is deflation anyway, you ask? Well basically, it’s when prices across the board don’t just rise slowly or stagnate—they straight-up drop. This isn’t your standard “less inflation.” It’s a full-blown economic retreat where falling prices scare consumers into hoarding cash instead of spending. Why China’s deflation feels unstoppable Unlike in the U.S., where people rushed to spend after COVID-19 restrictions lifted, Chinese consumers stayed cautious. There’s a reason for that. The real estate crash in China hasn’t just affected homebuyers—it rattled everyone. Big-ticket purchases? Forget it. Consumers are holding on to their money, waiting for prices to drop even more. But that’s not the only thing dragging China into deflation. The government clamped down on high-paying industries like tech and finance. Layoffs and pay cuts followed, and people stopped spending. On top of that, China pushed for more manufacturing and advanced tech, flooding the market with goods no one wanted to buy. Businesses had no choice but to slash prices. Here’s the thing: falling prices don’t help the economy. When people think prices will keep dropping, they stop buying. And when they stop buying, businesses make less money, which leads to layoffs and even deeper price cuts. Bloomberg economists call this “debt deflation,” where rising inflation-adjusted interest rates make paying off debt even harder. It’s a vicious cycle that’s impossible to escape without aggressive intervention. Beijing knows this but has been unusually cautious. After the pandemic, China didn’t go back to its old playbook of massive infrastructure projects and housing booms. President Xi Jinping is all about advanced technology and sustainable growth now. While that sounds good in theory, it means there’s no big money injection to save the day. Does Beijing have a plan? The People’s Bank of China has tried cutting interest rates multiple times over the past two years, hoping to get people spending again. It’s not working. Real estate restrictions were loosened, down payments were slashed, and mortgage rates were cut to revive the housing market. But none of this has stopped the spiral. Banks have been told to lend more to developers so they can finish stalled projects. Local governments have even been asked to buy unsold apartments and turn them into public housing. Meanwhile, the central government launched a $1.4 trillion program to help local governments manage their debt. On top of that, China has tried handing out subsidies for cars and home appliances. Low-income families and students got some aid too. Still, economists aren’t convinced this is enough. The housing market is still a mess, and consumer confidence is dead in the water. What about the numbers? China uses three major indicators to measure deflation. First, the consumer price index (CPI), which tracks household spending, hit a five-month low in November. Then there’s the producer price index (PPI), which measures industrial prices—it’s been shrinking for over two years. Finally, there’s the GDP deflator, which looks at price changes across the entire economy. And it’s not looking good either. The products dragging prices down Transportation is one of the biggest drags on consumer prices right now. Car prices are falling, and even gas prices are down. Carmakers like BYD are in full panic mode, asking suppliers to cut costs to stay competitive. The result? A full-blown price war in China’s auto market. Real estate is another major problem. The housing market is bloated with unsold apartments, and there’s no quick fix for it. Manufacturing is just as bad. China’s push for more production created a glut of goods no one is buying. It’s basic supply and demand—except here, supply is winning, and it’s crushing the economy. Then there’s the highly-expected trade war with America. Trump has threatened to add another 10% tariff on all Chinese imports as soon as he takes office next month. If these tariffs go through, China’s export growth—one of its few bright spots—will take a massive hit. Anyone holding Chinese equities is feeling the pain as corporate earnings drop. Luxury carmakers and high-end brands that rely on China’s wealthy consumers? Their sales are tanking. On the flip side, China’s bond market is doing great. Low-risk government bonds are attracting investors who expect even more rate cuts from the People’s Bank of China. But this is hardly good news. The broader economic picture is bleak, and the bond market boom is just a symptom of the larger problem.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 13:27:00

While the prominent cryptocurrency struggles to make any significant breakout past $4,000, certain developments on its underlying network have drawn investors’ attention. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aims Higher: A Smooth Path To $4,000 and Beyond? Ethereum Weekly Fees Rise By 18% Amid DeFi Ecosystem Boom In a recent report on December 13, crypto analytics company IntoTheBlock stated that weekly Ethereum network fees rose by 17.9% in the past week reaching an estimated $67 million – the highest-ever value since April. According to analysts at IntoTheBlock, these high network fees can be attributed to ETH’s price balancing as Bitcoin retraced to $100,000. In addition, there has been a significant increase in DeFi activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Providing more insight into Ethereum’s vibrant DeFi ecosystem, the Satoshi Club highlights that DeFi lending has been on the rise, with traders leveraging their Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to borrow stablecoins. These wrapped assets allow users to maximize their collateral utility by tapping into the liquidity and stability of DeFi protocols while maintaining exposure to major cryptocurrencies i.e. Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, the demand surge for lending drove interest rates to exceptional levels, now exceeding 10% on average and reaching as high as 40% on certain platforms. Interestingly, these figures mirror the peak dynamics seen in the 2022 bull market. Aave, one of Ethereum’s major DeFi protocols with a TVL of $22.46 billion has been a focal point on this increased DeFi activity, recording an impressive $500 million in net inflows over the last week. While heightened network activity driven by increased DeFi activity can indicate growing interest in the Ethereum network, investors should note that elevated Ethereum fees will pose challenges for smaller users being rewarding only for those who can capitalize on high interest rates.

With Donald Trump already elected, his biggest dilemma will be the issue surrounding the US dollar. While his policies might need the dollar to be weak to boost exports, the reverse is also a possibility that cannot be dismissed, which may increase global financial instability if it happens. With Trump promising tariffs upon assuming office, the movement of the dollar could pose distinct implications. One of the possible scenarios could see the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin play a prominent role. Its status as a safe haven could be crucial, as investors and users adopt the asset as a shield from the fallout of trade wars, inflation, and market uncertainty. Trump faces a big dollar problem While Trump will prefer to keep the dollar weak to boost exports, his actions might push it in the other direction, increasing the already high financial instability. Over the last few years, the dollar has swung in the same direction as the global economic momentum. Although it experienced a decline after 2001, the currency rode on the back of the European and Chinese economic weakness to ride to the top post-2011. From all indications, it looks like the trend will continue under the Trump administration. David Lubin, a senior research fellow in the Global Economy and Finance Program at Michael Klein, stated that the policies will only boost the dollar while piling pressures on the currencies of trading partners to depreciate. In addition, Trump’s upcoming fiscal expansion and tighter monetary policy show an inkling toward sustained dollar growth. If the dollar gains strength , it could cause unprecedented negative issues including hindering global trade, limiting the financial access of developing nations, and increasing inflation on weaker currencies. If things get out of hand, then it could lead to chaotic adjustments like sudden market shifts or the need for United States intervention. Lubin thinks that Trump may ignore the risks, seeing the benefits the country stands to gain from the dollar’s decline. However, the case may be, an overvalued dollar will cause issues for the global economy under Trump’s leadership. Bitcoin’s win and promising future under Trump With trade tensions already high, additional impending tariffs may cause issues for currencies. For instance, the dollar gained 0.4% while that of countries like China and Mexico dropped after Trump announced tariffs. Historically, these issues have always pushed investors to evade the volatility in the traditional market using assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has always responded in times of economic uncertainty, with the trade war between 2018 and 2020 a typical example. However, the case of the US-China trade war has shown that China’s actions may affect Bitcoin’s price. While the inflation from the dispute may affect the asset for a while, it promises a safe bet against the dollar in the long run. Bitcoin miners could also be another major factor, with the increased tariffs affecting imports of some parts, and impacting the overall mining operations. A US-China trade war could likely have a short-term impact on Bitcoin, its design and role as a store of value in such times may make it attractive. Meanwhile, Trump’s reelection has triggered a good feeling in the crypto industry, leading many to make bullish predictions about the industry entering 2025. However, the market remains a volatile endeavor with corrections as high as 30% in the past. However, increased adoption through mainstream adoption and ETFs has done a world of good for the asset and its legitimacy.

In 2025, it will range between $6.89 and $8.44, with an average price of $7.14. In 2030, it will range between $52.26 and $59.84, with an average price of $54.03. Toncoin (TON) has risen 44.80% over the last 30 days and is up 1,534% since inception. Looking ahead, TON is anticipated to trade higher. It will cross the $10 mark in 2026 and $20 in 2028. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Toncoin Ticker TON Current price $6.35 Market cap $16.2B Trading volume $229.06M Circulating supply 2.55B All-time high $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024 All-time low $0.3906 on Sep 20, 2021 24-hour high $6.44 24-hour low $6.23 Toncoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.79% 50-day SMA $5.65 200-day SMA $6.16 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 83 (Extreme Greed) Green days 18/30 (60%) Toncoin price analysis Defillama (on December 14) shows that TON’s total value locked (TVL) is dropping in December despite gradually recovering last month.TheTVL now stands at $298M. Similarly, the blockchain’s stablecoin market cap has been rising and is now at $1.21B TON Total Value Locked and Stablecoin Market Cap. Source: Defillama TON/USD 1-day chart price analysis TON/USD 1-day chart Despite a waning TVL, Toncoin has been moving sideways over the past four days. In the past 24 hours, TON saw a form of bearishness in its price as it currently trades at a price of $6.36 pushing its price further away from its all-time high of $8.25 recorded in back in June. Particularly, at current market prices, TON is down by 23% from this peak and 0.07% in the past day. This decrease has also unsurprisingly affected the asset’s market cap which has decreased from over $17 billion earlier this month to now at $16 billion as of today. Toncoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 6.58 SELL SMA 5 6.41 SELL SMA 10 6.54 SELL SMA 21 6.37 SELL SMA 50 5.65 BUY SMA 100 5.51 BUY SMA 200 6.16 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 6.20 BUY EMA 5 6.36 SELL EMA 10 6.45 SELL EMA 21 6.28 BUY EMA 50 5.90 BUY EMA 100 5.77 BUY EMA 200 5.64 BUY What to expect from TON price analysis next? Our analysis shows the current sentiment is neutral, while the Fear and Greed Index shows extreme greed among investors. The move comes as TON corrects to the $6.35 mark. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market and its recovering TVL. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2026. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2030. Will TON reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2030. Is TON a good investment? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON is set to trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Recent news: TON Foundation launches DAO The Open Network is transforming on its path to decentralization, with the TON Foundation introducing a new governance model called Society DAO. The DAO’s aim is to address a wide range of issues related to decentralization and fair access to capital in the TON ecosystem.

Take, for instance, this meme coin trader who purchased $227 worth of $TRENCHES immediately after its Pump Fun launch. His investment is now worth $165,000 in a span of just 2 hours. 2 hours ago someone bought $227 $Trenches at pumpfun which now worth over $165,000 pic.twitter.com/03c5X9jzsm — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) December 13, 2024 An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or presale is one of the best crypto investments for high returns, although selecting legit projects and avoiding rugpulls is crucial. All of the top-rated cryptos below have passed an audit with a third party smart contracts auditing company. Best Crypto To Buy Now On Presale Pepe Unchained (PEPU)’s explosive post-ICO performance has resulted in a strong demand for other presale tokens. For the uninitiated, PEPU raised over $73.7 million in its crypto presale behind heavy whale bidding. Following its launch, the meme coin skyrocketed by nearly 500%, reaching an all-time high valuation of $550 million. We previously rated it the best crypto to buy now. In this article, we list several contenders for the next best crypto to buy now, including projects that are attracting whale wallets during their own presale stage and could potentially replicate PEPU’s success. Crypto All-Stars (STARS) Crypto All-Stars (STARS) is one of the most popular presale tokens on the market and has already raised over $16 million in its ICO. Similar to PEPU, STARS is a high-utility meme coin, with MemeVault as its key selling point. MemeVault is the first-ever unified staking protocol. This multi-chain, multi-token platform will accept 11 of the top meme coins after its launch and offer attractive passive income in return. The tokens include Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ) and Bonk (BONK). STARS is already seeing strong demand from holders of the aforementioned meme coins. STARS buyers could also stake their holdings and earn thrice the rewards. They are already benefitting from the presale staking protocol which is currently offering a reward rate of 173%. Prominent crypto investors are bullish on STARS’ upside potential, with many calling it the next 100x meme coin. New whales are also jumping on the bandwagon almost every day. For instance this week a whale wallet swapped 50 ETH, worth nearly $200k, for Crypto All-Stars. This ICO ranks highest on our list of the best cryptos to buy now considering how much investment it has seen so far from crypto whales. Visit Crypto All-Stars Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Investors who missed out on Pepe Unchained aren’t looking to repeat the same mistake with Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , a new frog-themed meme coin. As usual, whales are quick to recognize the token’s upside potential. Just today, a whale swapped 69 ETH , worth $269k, for Wall Street Pepe. With such strong whale interest, it is no surprise that the WEPE presale has already raised over $19 million in its ICO. In fact, it has added over $10 million to its tally in just 2 days after PEPU’s success. Wall Street Pepe is not a run-of-the-mill project. It is challenging the hegemony of whales and insiders in the meme coin sector. Very soon, WEPE holders will be members of an exclusive VIP group and receive alpha calls, market insights and trading strategies. They may even find the next 100x meme coin to invest in. Wall Street Pepe also has a native staking platform, which is currently offering a reward rate of 50%. WEPE is in high demand, with some of the best crypto YouTube channels positively covering the upcoming meme coin. Visit Wall Street Pepe Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Unlike other inclusions in this list, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a utility coin. Some analysts have predicted the best cryptos to buy now for Q1 2025 gains may be utility tokens, if we see a new ‘utility summer’ meta. After quickly raising $1 million in private fundraising, the BEST crypto presale has added another $3 million to its tally, bringing the total to above $4 million. $BEST is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet, one of the top Bitcoin and crypto wallet brands on the market. Unlike chain-specific wallets like MetaMask, Best Wallet’s multi-chain, non-custodial and no-KYC nature has appealed to whales and retailers alike. For instance, users can buy, store and swap crypto from over 60 chains on Best Wallet, thanks to its integration with cutting-edge tools like Onramper. Meanwhile, features like the Best DEX, Best Card, presale aggregator and native staking protocol have made it a one-stop shop for all things crypto. It’s not without any reason that the product is seeing a 50% MoM growth and aims to capture 40% of the $11 billion non-custodial wallet market by 2026. Considering BEST is a micro-cap cryptocurrency, experts believe that it could offer up to 10x returns immediately after its launch, especially considering the growing user base of Best Wallet. Visit Best Wallet Token Flockerz (FLOCK) Flockerz (FLOCK) , the self-proclaimed people’s meme coin, rounds up our picks for the best crypto to buy now. This chicken-inspired meme coin prioritizes decentralization above all else. Interestingly, it shot to fame after Binance co-founder He Yi released a blog post, praising decentralized meme coins. Indeed, the world’s largest crypto exchange has been listing decentralized meme coins with low fully-diluted valuations. Unsurprisingly, FLOCK has been drawing Binance rumours as well. Flockerz has given a twist to the concept of DAO governance. All FLOCK holders will be members of the Flocktopia DAO, vote on all key decisions regarding the project and earn attractive monetary perks for it. Aside from the vote-to-earn rewards, FLOCK holders are also eligible for presale staking rewards, with many already earning an APY of over 400%. Smart money investors and crypto whale wallets have been buying Flockerz from the very start of its presale, which has raised over $6 million in a few short weeks - so may sell out soon.

However, the current trends suggest that the liquidity within the markets is slowly contracting, which could be a bullish signal for cryptos like XRP. Presently, the XRP price has been facing massive upward pressure over the past few days while the bulls are managing to keep up the trend. Therefore, the upcoming couple of days are expected to be crucial for the XRP price rally that has reached crucial levels. The BTC pric e is trading above $101K, which helped the XRP price to rise above $2.5, which remained for a while. The bears jumped in no time, causing over 4% dump in a few hours, which may suggest the start of a fresh rejection. Meanwhile, the volumes have been squeezed, which suggests a fresh influx of volume is about to enter the platform, pushing the XRP price rally beyond the consolidation. The daily chart of XRP suggests the price to be stuck within a descending parallel channel and is about to validate a rejection from the resistance. The technicals have also not been in favour of the bulls at the momentum, which indicates a plunge below $2 could be imminent in the coming days. Meanwhile, the weekly chart reflects the token to be in danger as the bullish strength appears to have waned to a large extent. The weekly OBV has displayed a bearish divergence while the Ichimoku cloud is about to flip from bullish to bearish. This could be a massive bearish signal, but a massive drop follows each time the OBV levels undergo a huge expansion. However, the price has experienced enough bullish support as the buying pressure remains above the average range, suggesting the bulls remain vigilant, indicating a quick rebound could be fast approaching. Having both the bullish and bearish prospects alive, the upcoming weekend may have a major impact on the XRP price rally. If the price manages to sustain above $2, then the trade may reclaim the lost levels and quickly rise above $3; otherwise, a restest to $1.9 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 13:45:15

The latest boost comes from Arkham Exchange, which announced on December 13 that it has officially listed XRP for both spot and perpetual trading pairs. The listing has not only drawn significant attention from market participants but also underscored the growing institutional interest in XRP. Following the announcement, Arkham Exchange declared, “XRP TRADING IS NOW LIVE,” signaling its strong support for the token. This move coincides with XRP’s recent robust performance, which saw its price climb approximately 6% to $2.46, alongside a notable trading volume increase of 10%, reaching $10.29 billion. Market watchers are particularly impressed with XRP’s ability to hit a 24-hour high of $2.52 and achieve a staggering 250% monthly gain. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals a 13% surge in XRP Futures Open Interest, highlighting heightened trader enthusiasm. The ongoing rally reflects broader market sentiment favoring Ripple’s token, especially as it continues to demonstrate resilience amid legal and regulatory challenges. Legal and Regulatory Developments Shape Ripple’s Future Ripple remains in the spotlight as the January 15, 2025, deadline for the principal brief in its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approaches. While the SEC’s outgoing Chair Gary Gensler may pose further challenges before his departure, market participants remain cautiously optimistic. In a parallel development, plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Ripple Labs have filed appeals with the Ninth Circuit Court, challenging earlier district court rulings in Ripple’s favor. Despite these legal headwinds, the crypto community appears unfazed, with XRP continuing to rally on the back of positive market news. What’s Next for XRP? Adding to the bullish sentiment is the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. This milestone has sparked speculation about a potential XRP ETF approval in the United States , which could further cement the token’s standing in global markets. As market analysts project a potential rally to $3 by this weekend, investors are closely watching XRP’s next moves. Ripple’s ongoing legal battles, coupled with strategic developments like the Arkham Exchange listing and the introduction of RLUSD , are reshaping its narrative.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, has joined forces with Elon Musk to challenge the AI company’s shift, raising concerns about its impact on Silicon Valley’s innovation landscape. This legal fight is also sparked by deep ethical questions, especially after the tragic death of a whistleblower. Meta and Musk’s Opposition to OpenAI Meta, together with Elon Musk, is pushing back against OpenAI’s recent transition to a for-profit organization. In a formal letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Meta warned that OpenAI’s restructuring could misuse nonprofit resources for private financial gain. According to Meta, this move betrays OpenAI’s original nonprofit goals. Zuckerberg, despite his past rivalry with Musk, has now become a key ally in this legal battle. Both are concerned that OpenAI’s shift could encourage other startups to take advantage of nonprofit models for profit. Meta’s letter has called for an investigation into OpenAI’s actions, particularly focusing on the misuse of tax-free donations. The Ethical Dilemma in AI Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has long been critical of the company’s decision to switch to a profit-driven approach . Musk believes this contradicts OpenAI’s founding mission to serve the public good. His concerns go beyond just this issue—he has also filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, accusing them of anti-competitive behavior. With Zuckerberg now backing Musk’s cause, the opposition has gained significant momentum. The shift to a for-profit model is raising big questions about whether profit should come before ethics in the AI industry. Meta and Musk argue that OpenAI’s new approach could set a dangerous precedent for other companies in Silicon Valley. Tragic Death of Whistleblower The debate over OpenAI’s ethics has grown even more intense after the tragic death of Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI researcher. Balaji, who had raised concerns about copyright issues in OpenAI’s systems, was found dead in his apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, but his passing has intensified the spotlight on the ethical challenges faced by AI researchers. As the situation unfolds, critics continue to argue that OpenAI’s move toward a for-profit structure contradicts its original goals.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 13:48:24

The re-elected President is already on the move, and picking his association seems crypto-friendly, which is nothing less than an achievement for the crypto investors. Here, the biggest achievement in the crypto industry is the SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, which is already in progress. Interestingly, the demand for the SEC & CFTC merge has reappeared in hopes of bringing the best to the industry. This could eventually affect the XRP and XLM price due to the former’s ill relationship with the Security and Exchange Commission. John E. Deaton Urges For SEC & CFTC Merge The SEC & CFTC merger talks have been going on for years, but around three months ago, John Rose, the US congressman, introduced a bill for this merger. And now, after three months, a famous crypto spokesperson, John E. Deaton, has asked for the same, explaining the need for improved regulation, free from confusion and interference of these entities with each other. Outstanding job by @PerianneDC on @MorningsMaria with @MariaBartiromo discussing how @elonmusk and @VivekGRamaswamy ’s @DOGE may want to push for merging the @CFTC & @SECGov . There’s a strong case to be made for merging the two agencies. Merging the SEC & CFTC would eliminate… https://t.co/dLdSSVXyxs — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 13, 2024 It could bring better guidelines and position the US on the same level as many nations with only one financial regulator. Eventually, he called it the ‘Gray Zone of Crypto,’ which creates complexities between the SEC and CFTC. Interestingly, many industry leaders, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have supported this idea. Even Donald Trump is planning to leave the crypto market’s oversight to the CFTC , which already overlooks the US derivatives market and commodities like gold and others. How Will XRP and XLM Price React? Like many crypto enthusiasts, John has been critical of Gary Gensler, let alone SEC, as analysts believe their involvement has hindered the cryptocurrency’s growth. The earlier CoinGape report on the Ripple SEC Case revealed that the CFTC has filed 120 legal lawsuits against the crypto service providers, including Ripple, Binance, Kraken, and more. The biggest impact was on the XRP price, which crashed and consolidated for three years. XLM followed almost the same price trajectory, influenced by the SEC’s brutalities on Ripple. More importantly, the US crypto users have suffered a lot, as they were prohibited from many crypto sales and tokens. After three years of battles, hope rose for the Ripple token as the price recovered from consolidation and hit a six-year high at $2.84 at the beginning of the month. At the same time, the XLM price hit new highs. Further analysts believe that Gary Gensler’s resignation and RLUSD stablecoin launch might push the XRP price to new heights of success. XRP Price to Hit $15 & XLM Price to $5 With Donald Trump’s victory alone, the Ripple token price rejuvenated, reaching this six-year high milestone, currently trading at $2.43, with a market capitalization of $138.81B. Additionally, many other factors are in this token’s favor where the XRP price could fuel up to $15-20, like with Gary Gensler’s resignation , and now this SEC & CFTC merge. It will be a major milestone, as SEC is behind XRP’s struggles. At the same time, the XLM price could hit $5 as it follows the XRP’s price trajectory, despite being its competitors, but the same co-founders maintain this rhythm. Currently, the XLM price is at $0.4296, with the ATH sitting 53% higher for the last seven years. If the Ripple token boomed, the impact could boost the Stellar token to $5. What’s In There For You With SEC & CFTC Merge? The SEC & CFTC merge is just a suggestion for now and has many technical constraints to make that possible, including budgeting, workforce, and much more. However, despite that, if this happened, the XRP and XLM prices could witness a rally. Additionally, this could become a major step toward crypto regulations. Moreover, the guidelines would smoothen up service providers’ functioning without major legal trouble, costing money and energy.

His incoming presidency has reignited fears of trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and currency volatility. Policymakers across the continent are in damage-control mode, slashing interest rates and signaling further cuts to shield their fragile economies. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) shocked markets with a half-point cut, bringing rates to 0.5%. This level hasn’t been seen since September 2022, back when Switzerland ended its eight-year experiment with negative rates. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) followed up with its own quarter-point reduction, dropping its key rate to a 1.5-year low. Christine Lagarde, ECB President, laid out the game plan: “The direction of travel currently is very clear.” The cuts are expected to continue into 2025, with insiders hinting at similar actions in January and March. Currency chaos and Swiss fears The Swiss franc, often seen as a safe haven during global crises, has become a source of anxiety for the SNB. Antoine Martin, the bank’s vice president, bluntly stated that external risks pose the biggest threat to Switzerland’s economy. The SNB is prepared to do whatever it takes to stabilize the franc, including more rate cuts, intervening in currency markets, or even bringing back negative rates. Martin Schlegel, SNB President, warned traders not to test the central bank’s resolve. “Developments abroad represent the main risk,” he said, pointing to Trump’s return as a potential trigger for currency speculation. Switzerland relies on open and stable global markets, and any disruption from Trump’s trade policies could hit its economy hard. ECB braces for economic fallout The ECB, already facing weak economic growth and sluggish inflation, is now staring down an even bigger problem: Trump’s trade policies. The central bank cut its deposit rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 3%. That was the third consecutive rate cut, totaling 100 basis points since June. Lagarde made it clear that the ECB is moving away from restrictive monetary policies. The bank’s latest projections paint a bleak picture. Eurozone growth for 2025 is now expected to hit just 1.1%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3%. Inflation is stuck at 2.3%, with the risk of falling further below the bank’s 2% target. Economists at ABN Amro described Trump’s tariffs as a “disinflationary shock,” predicting even looser monetary policies to offset the fallout. Investors are betting that ECB rates could drop to as low as 1.75% by late 2025. But some think even that might not be enough. Global domino effect Europe isn’t alone in trying to Trump-proof its economy. Canada’s central bank preemptively cut rates by 50 basis points this week, citing fears of higher tariffs from its southern neighbor. Brazil, facing its own fiscal turmoil and Trump’s warnings to BRICS countries not to challenge the U.S. dollar, took a different approach, raising rates by 100 basis points to steady its currency. The ECB, however, has unique challenges. While growth in the eurozone unexpectedly ticked up in the third quarter, recent data shows cracks forming, particularly in the services sector. Manufacturing has already been weak for months. Fabio Panetta of Italy and Francois Villeroy de Galhau of France have hinted at more aggressive rate cuts to spur growth, while Germany’s Joachim Nagel warns against going too far. Investors and policymakers alike are watching Washington closely, knowing that January 20, the day Trump takes office, could bring sweeping changes to the global financial system. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to follow suit with a rate cut next week after U.S. inflation data came in as expected.

They are created with the support of blockchain networks. These networks provide the underlying infrastructure and security for NFTs. Currently, Ethereum, Solana and Polygon are the dominant forces in the NFT marketplace. Bitcoin Ordinals, in simple terms, is Bitcoin’s attempt to enter the NFT space. Earlier, certain factors made it impossible to create NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, such as its basic architecture and lack of smart contracts. However, the network recently resolved the issue with the support of Ordinals Inscription and other layer 2 solutions. As a result, Bitcoin is poised to compete strongly in this sector. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin Ordinals could reach a market size of $4.5 million by 2025. Highlights Bitcoin Ordinals are unique digital assets secured on the Bitcoin blockchain.Ordinals assign unique serial numbers to individual satoshis.The key features of Ordinals include on-chain storage and direct inscription.Mining Bitcoin Ordinals involves seven simple steps. Bitcoin NFT trading is simple, but requires Taproot-compatible wallets.Ordinal Punk and Twelve Fold are two popular Bitcoin NFT projects. 1. Bitcoin Ordinals Explained Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs or Ordinal NFTs, are essentially Non-Fungible Tokens. What sets them apart is that they are built and secured on Bitcoin, the world’s largest, most reputable, blockchain network. Bitcoin, which initially could not support NFTs, gained this capability through two recent updates: Segregate Witness (SegWit) in 2017 and Taproot in 2021. SegWit: is a Bitcoin upgrade that separated transaction data from the witness data, improving storage efficiency and allowing for more transactions in each block. Taproot: is a Bitcoin update that enhanced security and privacy by making all transactions look the same, introduced script flexibility, and increased block size limits for better scalability. 1.1. Define Bitcoin NFT In short, Bitcoin NFTs are unique digital assets created by associating information with individual satoshis (small units of Bitcoin) through a process called ‘inscribing.’ This innovation allows for the creation of rare and verifiable digital collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain. 1.2. How Do Bitcoin Ordinals Function Bitcoin Ordinals function by assigning unique serial numbers to individual satoshis. This numbering, called ‘inscription,’ enables each satoshi to carry extra data, making them distinct. Ordinals use a two-fold numbering system: one based on the order of satoshi mining and the other on transaction inputs and outputs. Unlike traditional NFTs, which rely on smart contracts and may host assets externally, ordinals are directly inscribed onto satoshis and live entirely on the secure and immutable Bitcoin blockchain. 1.2.1. Ordinal Theory: A Short Explanation Ordinal Theory proposes a way to identify and track individual satoshis through their entire existence, from creation to each transaction they are involved in. It becomes possible with the Taproot upgrade in 2021. 1.2.2. Ordinal Inscription: What’s It Really Ordinal Inscription is the process of attaching unique information to individual satoshis within the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the Taproot upgrade, these inscriptions are secure and efficient, living directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. A Shocking Truth! What’s That? Bitcoin NFTs, the unique digital treasures built right on the Bitcoin blockchain, are set to explore in value. A recent Galaxy Research report predicts that by the year 2025, these special NFTs could be worth a whopping $4.5 billion! 1.3. Use of Bitcoin Ordinals A few use cases of Bitcoin Ordinals include: Digital Collectibles Bitcoin Ordinals enable the creation of unique digital collectibles, much like rare trading cards, enhancing the value and provenance of virtual assets within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Art and Media Preservation Artists and creators can immortalise their digital artworks and music on Bitcoin Ordinals, ensuring their authenticity and providing a means for royalties and fan engagement. Ticketing and Event Access Bitcoin Ordinals offer a secure and transparent alternative to traditional tickets, simplifying access to events, shows and virtual experiences while reducing reliance on intermediaries. Metaverse Ownership Bitcoin Ordinals can represent ownership of virtual lands and properties in the Metaverse, facilitating development and trading within the virtual real estate market. Identify Verification Bitcoin Ordinals can serve as secure identity tokens, granting users control over their personal data’s security and privacy, and simplifying authentication processes across applications and services. 1.4. Unique Features of Bitcoin Ordinals What makes Bitcoin Ordinals special is its unique features. The top five features that sets the Ordinals apart are given below. On-Chain Storage Bitcoin ordinals store actual data on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, unlike NFTs that often reference external files. Direct Inscription Bitcoin Ordinals inscribe data directly on the blockchain, while NFTs tokensise data by creating new tokens on various blockchains. No Smart Contracts Bitcoin Ordinals lack smart contract capabilities, making them challenging to trade without specialised platforms like OTC markets. User Adoption Despite the absence of smart contracts, Bitcoin Ordinals have gained popularity due to their unique features. Concurrency Potential Bitcoin Ordinals allow multiple inscriptions on a satoshi, potentially leading to complex multi-vector NFTs, unlike standard NFTs tied to specific assets. 1.5. Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Traditional NFTs: Five Key Differences The below given table is a simple comparison between Bitcoin Ordinals and Traditional NFTs. To do the comparison, seven important aspects is used: On-chain storage, data inscription, smart contracts, trading accessibility, user adoption, concurrency potential and blockchain network.

Unlike regular money governments issue (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies run on blockchain—a decentralized ledger that a network of computers (nodes) maintains to ensure transparency and stop double-spending. Why Does Knowing the Difference Between Tokens and Coins Matter to Blockchain Developers? For blockchain developers, knowing the difference between tokens and coins has a significant impact on how they design blockchain projects. Understanding the details helps them pick the right type of digital asset for a specific use case making sure it works well, stays secure, and people want to use it. Section 1: Basics of Cryptocurrency What is a Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that follows cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the new units. Components: Blockchain: Blockchain is a distributed database that records all the transactions across the network. Consensus Mechanism: Consensus mechanisms are the set of rules that are followed by all the nodes on the state of the blockchain. Section 2: Coins Definition of Coins Coin is a type of cryptocurrency that operates on its own blockchain. Examples are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Features of Coins Native Blockchain: Native blockchain is an independent local blockchain of the coins. Examples of Use Cases: Digital currency (Bitcoin) and smart contract execution (Ethereum) How Coins Are Created Steps Involved : Design and Conceptualization : Outline the coin’s purpose and features. This involves describing its intended application total supply, and how it will be distributed. Blockchain Selection : Decide whether to create a new blockchain or use an existing one. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum run on their own blockchains, while some projects might split off from an existing blockchain. Development : Build the coin’s protocol, which includes the consensus mechanism (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake), and set up nodes. Testing : Check the coin’s functionality and security through a series of trials on a test network. Deployment : Release the coin on the blockchain allowing it to be used for transactions. Promotion and Adoption : Put into action plans to boost user uptake, like marketing drives and team-ups. Technical Requirements : Knowledge of blockchain technology Proficiency in coding and known languages like C++ and Python. Section 3: Tokens Definition of Tokens A token stands as a digital asset built on a pre-existing blockchain framework. In contrast to coins that get their very own blockchains, tokens ride on the established rails of a blockchain that’s already up and running. You’ve got stuff like “ERC-20” tokens hanging out on Ethereum and “BEP-20” tokens calling Binance Smart Chain home. Features of Tokens Built on Existing Blockchains: Tokens are built on top of existing blockchain platforms utilising their security and ad technology. Examples of Use Cases: Utility Tokens: Provide access to a service or a product that is within the blockchain domain. Security Tokens: These are the representation of ownership such as shares in a company etc, and these tokens are subjected to security regulations. How Tokens are Created Steps Involved : Define the Token : Figure out the goal, features, and tech specs of your token. Decide if you’re making a utility token, security token, or some other kind. Choose a Blockchain Platform : Choose a blockchain maybe Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, that lets you make tokens. Base your choice on stuff like how much you’ll pay per transaction how fast it is, and how big the community is. Develop the Smart Contract : Get into coding the smart contract that’ll control your token. You need to use languages for smart contracts, like Solidity, for programming how your token will work. Testing : Make sure to run the smart contract on a testnet to double-check its security and proper operation. Gotta catch and squash all those pesky bugs or security issues. Deployment : Time to launch the smart contract on the mainnet so everyone can start using the token. Now it’s ready for all sorts of transactions and app integrations. Distribution : Get creative with ways to hand out and keep track of the token. You might go with ICOs free token drops, or different plans to get tokens into the hands of the people. Technical Requirements : Familiarity with the various blockchains and their smart contract languages Hands-on experience with development environments Section 4: Key Differences Between Tokens and Coins Let’s have a look at the differences between Tokens and Coins: Section 5: When to Use Tokens vs. Coins Choosing the Right Option While creating a Token or coin there are several factors that need to be considered: Case Studies Tokens: Basic Attention Token (BAT): In the Brave browser’s world, BAT rewards folks for checking out ads. This ERC-20 token took advantage of Ethereum’s setup making it faster and cheaper to get off the ground. Chainlink (LINK): LINK’s another ERC-20 token, but it’s all about giving a little something to the data peeps (oracles) in the Chainlink oracle network that’s spread out all over. Coins: Bitcoin (BTC): The ancestor of them all Bitcoin, hit the scene as the original cryptocurrency for sending cash from A to B, no middleman. It’s got its very own blockchain and people use it to keep their wealth or buy stuff. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum goes beyond a mere digital currency; it serves as a foundation for independent apps ( DApps ) and has ETH as its built-in currency, fueling transfers and smart contracts on its blockchain network. Section 6: Practical Considerations Development Tools and Platforms Tools for Creating Coins: Blockchain Platforms: You can use stuff like Hyperledger Fabric and Tendermint if you want to build cool new blockchains for your coins. Geth & Parity: These are like playgrounds if you’re looking to craft coins that’ll run on Ethereum. Coding Languages: If you’re into blockchain crafting, you’ll be using code like C++, Python, and Go. Platforms for Creating Tokens: Ethereum: It’s the go-to spot for making tokens, packed with lots of stuff for developers and a big community. Binance Smart Chain: This one’s got cheaper costs for moving stuff around and does it quicker so lots of folks pick it for their tokens. Polkadot: Polkadot stands out for allowing users to make advanced tokens that work across different chains due to its traits for linking and expanding. Solana: Solana shines as a blockchain that can handle loads of activity while keeping costs down. It’s great for building tokens that need to handle tons of transactions. Challenges and Considerations Security: Making sure hackers can’t mess with your coin or token is super important. With tokens, one bad smart contract, like those with reentrancy glitches, might cost you heaps. For coins, you gotta be sure that the system confirming all the blockchain transactions is solid. Compliance: The rules for what’s okay with tokens shift depending on where you are for the ones that are like stocks. You need to get the scoop on these laws and follow ’em to stay out of hot water. Scalability: When your thing starts to blow up, you need your blockchain or whatever’s holding your token to deal with way more transactions without crashing and burning. Community Support: Talking about tokens here, but having a bunch of people and devs rooting for you on the platform you picked can make or break what you’re doing Conclusion Before we conclude let’s summarize all that we have seen in this article. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use blockchain technology. Coins run on their own blockchains, while tokens build on existing ones. Knowing how tokens differ from coins helps in creating the right digital asset for specific needs. The digital asset scene keeps changing, with new tech and rules shaping what’s next. Dive deeper and begin your own blockchain projects. Use what you know about tokens and coins to create new ideas. Happy Coding!!

Have you ever wondered how crypto analysts make crypto predictions accurately? What enables them to do the market trend analysis is their skill and knowledge to understand and interpret crypto chart patterns. 1. Crypto Chart Patterns: What You Need to Know Imagine being able to spot patterns that reveal whether the price is about to skyrocket or take a nosedive. That’s exactly what crypto chart patterns empower you to do! They provide a visual representation of market behavior helping you make informed decisions and seize opportunities for profit. Bullish patterns will send your spirits soaring as they signal an upcoming price surge, encouraging you to join the buying frenzy. On the flip side, bearish patterns will raise your eyebrows, cautioning you of an impending price drop and prompting you to take protective measures. These patterns come in various shapes and sizes, each with its own unique story to tell. From the graceful curves of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern to the formidable triple peaks of a ‘head and shoulders’ pattern, each one holds valuable insights into market dynamics. 1.1 Trading Crypto with Chart Patterns The first step is to familiarise yourself with the various types of chart patterns. Precisely, each chart pattern has its own distinct characteristics and implications, offering valuable insights into market trends. By understanding these patterns, you will be equipped to identify potential entry and exit points, helping you make informed decisions. 2. Trending Crypto Chart Patterns: Exploring the Popular Ones There are numerous chart patterns. Each pattern has its own unique characteristics, functionalities, and advantages. It’s difficult to categorize them. But, when you examine chart patterns closely, you see three primary types: triangles, rectangles, and poles. Additionally, each main type has various subcategories. Here we will discuss some of the most relevant chart patterns – the ones which are popular and are unique for their characteristics. 2.1 Mastering Triangle Crypto Chart Patterns Triangle Crypto Chart Patterns are very popular and widely used. Ascending Triangles, Descending Triangles, Symmetrical Triangle,s and Wedges are the prime ones. 2.1.1. Ascending Triangle Suppose Bitcoin has been on an upward trend for several months. During this time, its price forms a series of higher highs and higher lows. At a certain price level, there is significant resistance that the crypto attempts to surpass. This resistance acts as a psychological barrier, causing consolidation. Eventually, when the price breaks above the resistance level, it confirms the ascending triangle pattern, suggesting a potential continuation of the bullish trend. 2.1.2. Descending Triangle Consider Bitcoin experiencing a prolonged downtrend, with the price gradually forming lower highs and lower lows. At a specific price level, a strong support level halts further decline, The price bounces off this support multiple times, creating a descending triangle pattern. This formation suggests that the bearish trend is expected to continue, providing a potential sell signal for traders. 2.1.3. Symmetrical Triangle Picture Ethereum ’s price moving in a sideways manner, with alternating higher lows and lower highs. These price swings create a symmetrical triangle formation, where the upper and lower trendlines converge. As the triangle narrows, it indicates a decreasing range of price volatility. Traders closely monitor this pattern as a breakout in either direction, accompanied by significant volume, could signify a potential trend reversal. 2.1.4. Wedges Wedges are special triangle patterns that can further be classified into rising wedges and falling wedges. They provide valuable insights into potential price reversals. 2.2. Exploring Rectangle Crypto Chart Patterns Rectangle Crypto Chart Patterns are unique and have many special features. Bullish Rectangle, Bearish Rectangle, Double Top and Double Bottom are the main patterns that come under this category. 2.2.1. Bullish Rectangle Picture a cryptocurrency experiencing a downtrend, with the price consolidating within a range bounded by a strong support level and a resistance level. This consolidation forms a Bullish Rectangle pattern, indicating diminishing selling pressure and a potential upward breakout. Traders eagerly await the price to breach the resistance level, providing a confirmation for a buy signal. 2.2.2. Bearish Rectangle In contrast, suppose the same crypto has been in an uptrend, but the price starts consolidating within a range, bounded by a strong support level and a resistance level. This consolidation creates a Bearish Rectangle pattern, suggesting waning buying momentum and a potential downward breakout. Traders keenly observe the support level, waiting for a confirmation break to initiate a sell signal. 2.2.3. Double Top Let’s say Bitcoin experiences a significant price surge, reaching a new high and subsequently pulling back. After a brief recovery, the price attempts to surpass the previous high but fails, forming the second peak. This Double Top pattern suggests a bearish reversal, and astute traders may consider it as a sell signal, anticipating a downward price movement. 2.2.4. Double Bottom In contrast, consider a scenario where Bitcoin’s price declines and reaches a particular level, bounces back up, and then retraces to the same level once again. This forms the Double Bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal. Savvy traders may perceive this as a buy signal, expecting an uptrend following a successful break above the upper horizontal line. 2.3. Learning Pole Crypto Chart Patterns Pole crypto chart patterns are really special for their accuracy. In terms of popularity, some of them are the highly preferred ones. Bullish Flag, Bearish Flag, Bullish Pennant and Bearish Pennant are the popular ones. 2.3.1. Bullish Flag Let’s imagine a cryptocurrency experiencing a strong price surge, known as the pole, followed by a period of consolidation with a series of lower highs. This consolidation resembles a flag, hence the name ‘Bullish Flag’. Traders recognise this pattern as a potential buying opportunity, expecting the price to break out above the consolidation phase and continue the upward trend. 2.3.2. Bearish Flag The Bearish Flag is the mirror image of the Bullish Flag. Suppose the same crypto encounters a significant downward price movement, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation phase characterised by higher highs. This consideration resembles a flag but in a bearish context. Traders interpret this pattern as a sell signal, anticipating a downward breakout from the consolidation phase, leading to a continuation of the bearish trend. 2.3.3. Bullish Pennant A Bullish Pennant is a pattern similar to a Bullish Flag but with a triangular consolidation structure. Imagine a cryptocurrency experiencing a rapid upward price movement, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation period where the price forms a triangular pattern with higher lows and lower highs. Traders interpret this pattern as a bullish sign, anticipating the price to break out of the consolidation phase and continue its upward trajectory. 2.3.4. Bearish Pennant The Bearish Pennant is the inverse of the Bullish Pennant. Let’s assume the same cryptocurrency encounters a steep price decline, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation phase where the price gradually decreases. This consolidation phase resembles a pennant but in a bearish context. Traders intercept this pattern as a sell signal, expecting a downward breakout from the consolidation phase, indicating a continuation of the bearish trend. 2.4. Other Trending Chart Trading Patterns There are some unique patterns that don’t fit inside any of the general types. The prominent among them are Head and Shoulders Pattern, Inverted Head and Shoulders Pattern, and Cup and Handle Pattern. 2.4.1. Head and Shoulders Crypto Chart Patterns Imagine you are analysing the price chart of a cryptocurrency. You notice a peak (the head) followed by two smaller peaks on either side (the shoulders). This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal. If the head and shoulders pattern forms after an uptrend, it indicates a bearish reversal. Conversely, if it forms after a downtrend, it signals a bullish reversal. 2.4.2. Invested Head and Shoulders Let’s flip things around and explore the inverted head and shoulders pattern! Suppose you are analysing a cryptocurrency’s price chart and notice a trough (the head) followed by two smaller troughs (the shoulders) on either side. This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal. If the inverted head and shoulders pattern forms after a downtrend, it indicates a bullish reversal. 2.4.3. Cup and Handle Imagine you’re analysing the price chart of a cryptocurrency, and you observe a rounded bottom formation, resembling a cup. Following the cup formation, there’s a small downward movement called the handle. This pattern typically indicates a bullish reversal. Traders often look for a breakout above the handle’s resistance level as a conformation of the pattern, signalling a potential upward trend. 2.5. Special Chart Patterns to Detect Market Manipulation In certain circumstances, we cannot blindly rely on popular chart patterns, as the crypto market is highly susceptible to manipulation. There are charts that are exclusively designed to detect market manipulation. 2.5.1. The Bart Simpson Pattern Suppose you’re analyzing the Bitcoin chart on a smaller timeframe, and you notice something peculiar. You observe sudden movements, a bump in one direction, followed by consolidation, and then another abrupt bump in the opposite direction, returning close to the base price. This intriguing phenomenon has earned the name ‘Bart Simpson’ pattern, owing to its resemblance to the head shape of the iconic Simpsons character. This pattern often emerges during volatile trading periods. The motive behind these sudden pumps and dumps is likely the liquidation of crypto margin traders, both short and long, through market manipulation. 3. Success Rate of Crypto Chart Patterns One of the factors that determine how much importance you should give to the interpretation derived from a specific chart pattern is the success rate. Well, what is it? The success rate of crypto chart patterns relies on a combination of factors, including the trader’s skill, market conditions, and supporting indicators. Precisely, by continuously honing their chart pattern analysis skills, staying updated on market dynamics, and leveraging complementary indicators, traders can enhance their accuracy in interpreting and capitalizing on chart patterns. Endnote In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency trading, chart patterns serve as invaluable tools, guiding us through the complexities of the market. By understanding and recognizing these patterns, we unlock a wealth of insights that can fuel our trading strategies.

Crypto scams can have devastating consequences for victims. Not only can they lose their money, but they can also lose their trust in the crypto community. This is why it’s so important to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect yourself. 1. What are Crypto Scams? Crypto scams are fraudulent schemes designed to steal digital money or deceive individuals into parting with it. Some scammers promise rapid growth of your investments, but more often than not, they take your money and vanish. Many fake websites mimic legitimate platforms, tricking users into making purchases that result in financial losses. Scammers often impersonate well-known figures, such as tech experts, to trap unsuspecting victims. To stay safe, it’s crucial to research thoroughly before investing or storing your digital assets. If something appears suspicious, it probably is, so exercise caution! 1.1. Real-World Examples Ponzi Scam: Bitconnect is a notorious example where investors were lured with promises of high returns through a lending program, but it ultimately proved to be a Ponzi scheme, resulting in significant losses. Mt. Gox Exit Scam: The Mt. Gox exchange claimed to have been hacked and lost Bitcoin, but it was later revealed that the exchange’s owner was the real perpetrator of the theft. Fake ICOs: Scammers use fake Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to promise unrealistic outcomes, raising funds from investors and disappearing with the money. OneCoin Scam: Marketed as a Bitcoin rival, OneCoin was later exposed as a Ponzi scheme masterminded by its founder, Ruja Ignatova, and her team. Fake Giveaways: Scammers promote fake giveaways on social media, enticing victims to send funds but delivering nothing in return. It’s essential to educate yourself about such scams to avoid falling victim to them. 2. Types of Scams Phishing Scams: Phishing scams involve counterfeit websites or emails that closely resemble authentic crypto services. Investors are deceived into sharing their private keys or login information, which scammers use to steal their funds. Ponzi Schemes: In Ponzi schemes, scammers promise substantial returns on investments and use funds from new investors to pay off the old ones. Eventually, when the scheme collapses, investors lose their money. Fake ICOs: Scammers exploit the fundraising method employed by startups. They create fake ICOs, collect funds from everyone, and vanish without delivering on their promises. Pump and Dump: Scammers artificially inflate cryptocurrency prices by spreading false information or purchasing large quantities. After the price rises, they sell their holdings, causing the price to crash and others to lose money. Fake Wallets and Exchanges: Scammers create counterfeit wallets or exchanges. Users deposit their money, only for it to be stolen later. Social Media Scams: Scammers promote fraudulent messages through social media apps, convincing people to send crypto through social media accounts. They impersonate others or use emotional tactics to lure in funds. Giveaways: Scammers impersonate well-known figures on social media, promising to double or triple any currency sent to them. Victims send money and never receive anything in return. 3. Identifying the scams: A step-by-step guide Research the project thoroughly before investing.

37634743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110040,1734185130,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ledger Hardware Wallet Faces Security Concerns After $2.5M Theft Report,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ledger-hardware-wallet-security-concerns/,"On December 13, 2024, an anonymous user, @anchor_drops , reported on X (formerly Twitter) a significant theft of 10 BTC (approximately $1 million) and $1.5 million in NFTs from their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet . This incident has sparked concerns within the cryptocurrency community regarding potential vulnerabilities in Ledger’s security system , though no official statement has been issued by the company yet. What Happened? The affected user claimed that their Ledger Nano S wallet, known for its high-security features, was compromised. According to the post: Total Loss : $2.5 million, including 10 BTC and a portfolio of valuable NFTs. Device Used : Ledger Nano S, a widely trusted hardware wallet. The incident raises critical questions about the security of Ledger devices, which are specifically designed to safeguard cryptocurrency and digital assets. Community Speculations While details about the breach are unclear, several theories have emerged regarding the possible causes: 1. Potential Exploitation of Ledger Vulnerabilities Speculation suggests a previously unknown flaw in the Ledger Nano S system may have been exploited. This could involve: Physical Tampering : If the device was accessed and manipulated by a third party. Software Exploit : A vulnerability in Ledger’s firmware or associated software. 2. User Error or Phishing Attack Many security breaches result from human error. Possible scenarios include: Phishing : The user may have unknowingly shared their private keys or recovery phrases via a fraudulent website or email. Improper Storage : Storing recovery phrases or passwords insecurely, making them accessible to attackers. 3. Third-Party Compromise If the theft was facilitated by malware or spyware on the user’s connected device (e.g., a PC or smartphone), the attacker could have intercepted credentials or transactions. Why This Incident Matters Ledger hardware wallets are trusted by millions worldwide as a secure solution for storing cryptocurrencies. This theft challenges the perception of hardware wallets as near-impenetrable and raises broader concerns about: 1. User Confidence in Hardware Wallets The Ledger Nano S is marketed as one of the most secure wallets available. Incidents like this undermine trust in the brand and the broader hardware wallet market. 2. Increasing Sophistication of Crypto Attacks Theft involving hardware wallets indicates that cybercriminals are employing more advanced techniques to bypass even robust security measures. 3. Need for Transparent Communication The lack of an immediate official statement from Ledger has left the community seeking clarity and assurance about the wallet’s security. What Should Ledger Users Do Now? If you own a Ledger wallet, here are some immediate steps to enhance your security: 1. Verify Your Ledger Device Ensure your device is genuine by checking the packaging seal and authenticity using Ledger’s verification tools. Never purchase hardware wallets from unofficial sellers. 2. Update Firmware Regularly Always install the latest firmware updates, as these often include important security patches. 3. Protect Recovery Phrases Store your recovery phrases offline in a secure location. Never share them online or with anyone claiming to represent Ledger. 4. Monitor Account Activity Regularly check your wallet balances and transaction history. Use blockchain explorers to verify recent activity if suspicious changes occur. 5. Enable Additional Security Measures Consider using passphrases or multi-signature wallets for added protection. Ledger’s History with Security Concerns This isn’t the first time Ledger has faced security-related controversies: 1. 2020 Data Breach Ledger suffered a major data breach exposing the personal information of over 270,000 customers, including email addresses and phone numbers. While no private keys or wallet access was compromised, phishing attacks on affected users surged. 2. Phishing Campaigns In the wake of the breach, customers were targeted with fake Ledger update emails, luring them to fraudulent websites that captured recovery phrases. These incidents highlight the need for heightened vigilance, even when using top-tier security devices. FAQs About Ledger Security How secure are Ledger wallets generally? Ledger wallets are among the most secure in the market, utilizing secure elements and offline storage to protect private keys. However, no system is completely immune to breaches or user errors. What should I do if I suspect my Ledger wallet is compromised? Immediately transfer your funds to a new wallet using a fresh recovery phrase and device. Avoid reusing compromised credentials. Does Ledger plan to address this theft? As of now, Ledger has not issued an official statement. Users are encouraged to monitor Ledger’s official channels for updates. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The reported theft of $2.5 million from a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet serves as a stark reminder that no solution is entirely foolproof. While hardware wallets remain one of the safest methods for storing digital assets, users must complement these tools with diligent security practices. Ledger’s response to this incident will likely shape the future of its reputation and the trust of its users. For now, the incident underscores the critical need for ongoing vigilance and education in safeguarding digital wealth.

37634822,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110048,1734185191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Miners Adopt MicroStrategy-Like Bitcoin Strategy: JPMorgan Report,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-miners-btc-strategy/,"JPMorgan has highlighted a transformative shift in the crypto mining industry, revealing that miners are increasingly adopting a MicroStrategy-like approach to Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation. Instead of selling reserves, miners are raising funds through debt and equity to retain their BTC holdings, a trend accelerated by profitability challenges following Bitcoin’s April halving and surging hashrates. Miners, such as MARA Holdings , which now holds 35,000 BTC and ranks as the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, exemplify this strategic pivot. With the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a record $10 billion raised in equity in 2024 , miners’ roles as BTC proxies are evolving rapidly. What is the MicroStrategy BTC Strategy? MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, is renowned for its bold approach to Bitcoin acquisition. The company: Issues Debt and Equity : Funds BTC purchases without liquidating reserves. Treats BTC as a Treasury Asset : Positions Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Holds Instead of Sells : Avoids selling Bitcoin even during market volatility. This strategy has made MicroStrategy the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 150,000 BTC in reserves. Why Are Miners Adopting This Strategy? 1. Profitability Pressures Post-Halving Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, significantly cutting miners’ revenue while operational costs, such as energy expenses, remained high. 2. Rising Hashrates As competition intensifies, miners are investing heavily in infrastructure, driving up network hashrates. This further squeezes profit margins, prompting miners to hold Bitcoin reserves for future appreciation instead of immediate cash flow. 3. Influence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which provide direct BTC exposure to investors, has reduced miners’ traditional role as BTC proxies. Consequently, miners are seeking alternative strategies to maintain their relevance and maximize profitability. MARA Holdings: A Case Study in BTC Retention MARA Holdings , a prominent crypto mining firm, exemplifies this new strategy: BTC Holdings : MARA holds 35,000 BTC, worth billions at current market prices. Second-Largest Public Holder : Trails only MicroStrategy in Bitcoin reserves among publicly traded companies. Funding Approach : Raises capital through debt and equity, avoiding the sale of mined Bitcoin. This approach positions MARA as both a mining operation and a Bitcoin investment vehicle, benefiting from BTC’s long-term price appreciation. The Rise of BTC-Focused Fundraising Record Equity Raising in 2024 Crypto miners have raised a record $10 billion in equity this year, surpassing 2021’s previous high. This capital is being used to: Expand mining capacity. Purchase additional Bitcoin. Maintain operational liquidity without liquidating reserves. Shift Away from Selling BTC Miners increasingly view their Bitcoin holdings as strategic assets rather than immediate revenue sources, aligning their operations with long-term investment philosophies. Impact on the Bitcoin Ecosystem 1. Reduced Sell Pressure By holding Bitcoin instead of selling, miners are contributing to reduced sell pressure, potentially stabilizing and supporting BTC prices. 2. Strengthened Institutional Interest The adoption of sophisticated funding strategies by miners mirrors institutional practices, further legitimizing the Bitcoin market. 3. Diversification of BTC Proxies With the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs, miners are adapting their roles by becoming both producers and strategic holders of Bitcoin, offering investors diversified exposure to the asset class. Challenges for Miners While the shift to a BTC-holding strategy offers long-term benefits, it is not without risks: 1. Market Volatility Retaining Bitcoin reserves exposes miners to the risk of price declines, which could impact their financial stability. 2. Capital Market Reliance Relying on debt and equity to fund operations may increase financial vulnerabilities, particularly if capital markets tighten. 3. Operational Costs High energy and infrastructure costs continue to challenge miners, necessitating efficient operations to sustain profitability. Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. New BTC Strategies Aspect Traditional Mining Strategy MicroStrategy-Inspired Approach Revenue Model Sell mined BTC for operational cash Hold BTC as a treasury asset Funding Primarily through BTC sales Raised via debt and equity Market Impact Adds sell pressure to BTC market Reduces sell pressure, supporting prices Exposure Dependent on mining revenue Dual exposure: mining + BTC appreciation Expert Insights on the Trend JPMorgan’s report underscores the strategic evolution within the crypto mining industry. Analysts note: “By adopting a MicroStrategy-like BTC strategy, miners are positioning themselves as key players in Bitcoin’s long-term success. This shift not only aligns with institutional practices but also stabilizes the Bitcoin ecosystem by reducing sell-side pressure.” Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Miners The adoption of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy by crypto miners marks a significant shift in the industry’s approach to profitability and asset management. By raising capital through debt and equity while retaining Bitcoin reserves, miners are aligning themselves with institutional practices, reducing market sell pressure, and preparing for long-term gains. As Bitcoin’s ecosystem evolves, this trend could redefine the roles of miners, spot ETFs, and institutional players in shaping the cryptocurrency market’s future.

37634823,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110045,1734185233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Early Bitcoin Investor Sentenced to Two Years for Tax Fraud,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-investor-sentenced-for-tax-fraud/,"Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Texas-based early Bitcoin (BTC) investor, has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for tax fraud. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Ahlgren deliberately underreported over $3.7 million in Bitcoin capital gains from 2017 to 2019, leading to a tax loss of more than $1 million for the U.S. government. In addition to the prison sentence, Ahlgren has been ordered to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government. The case highlights the IRS and DOJ’s heightened focus on tax compliance within the cryptocurrency industry. Details of the Case Underreporting Bitcoin Gains Ahlgren inflated Bitcoin’s cost basis on his 2017 tax return to reduce his taxable income. He also failed to report additional Bitcoin sales totaling $650,000 , further concealing his capital gains. Use of Mixers and Wallet Transfers The DOJ revealed that Ahlgren employed sophisticated methods to evade detection, including: Cryptocurrency Mixers : Services that obscure the origins of funds by mixing transactions. Multiple Wallet Transfers : Movement of funds across various wallets to make tracking difficult. These tactics were aimed at concealing the true extent of his Bitcoin holdings and gains. Impact on U.S. Government The IRS estimates that Ahlgren’s actions caused over $1 million in tax losses . Tax compliance is critical to maintaining government revenue, and cases like these highlight the challenges authorities face in ensuring fair contributions from cryptocurrency investors. Legal Repercussions The sentence imposed on Ahlgren includes: Prison Time : Two years for willful tax evasion. Restitution Payment : $1.1 million to the U.S. government to compensate for lost tax revenue. DOJ Statement In its announcement, the DOJ emphasized its commitment to pursuing tax evasion cases involving cryptocurrencies. “Cryptocurrency transactions are not exempt from tax laws. This case serves as a warning that attempts to hide digital asset gains will be met with serious consequences.” IRS and Cryptocurrency Compliance The IRS has been increasing its scrutiny of cryptocurrency transactions, particularly as the crypto market grows. 1. Expanded Reporting Requirements The IRS now requires taxpayers to report all cryptocurrency transactions, including: Sales or exchanges of digital assets. Receipt of cryptocurrency as payment or through mining. 2. Enforcement Actions High-profile cases like Ahlgren’s demonstrate the IRS’s commitment to enforcing compliance and prosecuting those who attempt to evade taxes. 3. Focus on Mixers and Wallet Privacy The use of mixers and private wallets is a red flag for regulators, as these tools are often associated with attempts to hide illicit activities or evade taxes. Lessons for Cryptocurrency Investors 1. Report All Gains Cryptocurrency gains, whether from trading, mining, or other activities, are subject to tax laws. Underreporting or failing to report these gains can result in severe penalties. 2. Maintain Accurate Records Investors should keep detailed records of their transactions, including: Purchase dates and prices (cost basis). Sale dates and proceeds. Transaction fees. 3. Avoid Illegal Tactics Using mixers or other methods to obscure transactions can raise suspicion and lead to legal consequences. The Importance of Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized and often anonymous ecosystem, but governments are actively working to ensure that these transactions are subject to the same tax regulations as traditional financial activities. 1. Enhanced Monitoring Tools Agencies like the IRS and DOJ are leveraging advanced blockchain analysis tools to track cryptocurrency transactions. 2. Increased Collaboration The U.S. government is partnering with international regulators and private firms to identify and prosecute tax evasion involving digital assets. Comparative Perspective: Tax Compliance in Crypto Compliance Aspect Traditional Assets Cryptocurrencies Tax Reporting Well-established regulations Increasingly strict enforcement Transaction Tracking Bank and brokerage records Blockchain analysis tools Evasion Techniques Offshore accounts Mixers, private wallets Penalties for Noncompliance Severe Equally severe for crypto cases Conclusion: A Warning to Crypto Investors The sentencing of Frank Richard Ahlgren III serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in failing to comply with tax laws. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, so does the scrutiny from regulatory and enforcement agencies. For cryptocurrency investors, the key takeaway is clear: transparency and compliance are essential. Attempting to obscure transactions or underreport gains not only undermines the integrity of the financial system but also exposes individuals to severe legal and financial penalties.

37634852,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110042,1734185310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Could Surpass $160K by 2025, Says Matrixport",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-160k-prediction-2025/,"Matrixport , a leading crypto financial services platform, has made an ambitious forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $160,000 by 2025. This optimistic projection is underpinned by a combination of factors, including sustained demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable macroeconomic conditions, and an expanding global liquidity pool. Matrixport’s analysis also highlights the normalization of funding rates and improved market stability, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase may be shorter than in previous cycles. Key Drivers Behind the $160K Prediction Matrixport’s bullish outlook for Bitcoin is supported by several critical factors: 1. Demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs The approval and rising popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought significant institutional interest into the market. ETFs offer: Ease of Access : Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding it. Increased Liquidity : Spot ETFs boost Bitcoin’s trading volume, stabilizing its price. 2. Favorable Macroeconomic Conditions Matrixport points to improving global economic conditions that support Bitcoin’s growth: Decreasing Interest Rates : Lower rates often drive capital into alternative investments like Bitcoin. Weakened Fiat Currencies : Inflation and monetary policies are encouraging investors to seek hedges, with Bitcoin seen as a “digital gold.” 3. Expanding Global Liquidity As liquidity in global markets increases, risk-on assets like Bitcoin tend to benefit. The availability of capital drives higher demand for assets with growth potential, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s Current Market Momentum Matrixport believes Bitcoin’s market dynamics are setting the stage for significant upward movement: 1. Shortened Consolidation Phase The Fear and Greed Index and other market indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s current period of price consolidation could be shorter compared to previous cycles, paving the way for quicker gains. 2. Normalization of Funding Rates Funding rates, a key measure in futures markets, have stabilized. This indicates healthier market conditions and reduced speculative pressure. 3. Strengthening Market Stability Improved stability in Bitcoin’s price movements is encouraging both retail and institutional participation, building momentum for long-term growth. How $160K Fits into Bitcoin’s Historical Trends Bitcoin’s potential to hit $160,000 aligns with its historical four-year cycle driven by halving events , where the mining reward is halved approximately every four years. Post-Halving Bull Runs Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price surges following halving events, due to reduced supply entering the market. The next halving in 2024 is expected to further limit supply, contributing to price appreciation. Previous Milestones 2017 : Bitcoin peaked at ~$20,000. 2021 : Bitcoin hit ~$69,000. 2025 (Projection) : A potential surge to $160,000, consistent with its exponential growth pattern. Institutional Adoption: A Key Catalyst The growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors is a pivotal factor in Matrixport’s prediction. Recent developments include: ETFs : Increasing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs by regulators and investors. Corporate Holdings : Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square continue to hold substantial Bitcoin reserves. Broader Integration : Payment giants like PayPal and Visa are integrating Bitcoin into their platforms. Challenges to Reaching $160K While the projection is optimistic, several challenges could impact Bitcoin’s ability to achieve this milestone: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry remains a significant hurdle, especially in key markets like the U.S. and EU. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could deter some institutional investors. 3. Competition from Altcoins As alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) gain traction, they could divert investor attention away from Bitcoin. Comparative Market Outlook Metric Current (2024) Projected (2025) Bitcoin Price ~$35,000 $160,000+ Market Capitalization ~$680 billion ~$3 trillion Global Liquidity Impact Moderate High Institutional Involvement Growing Strong Industry Reactions Matrixport’s $160,000 prediction has sparked interest across the crypto community. Market analysts have weighed in, with many supporting the notion that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are stronger than ever. “The combination of spot ETFs, macroeconomic shifts, and institutional interest creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin to reach new heights,” said a leading crypto strategist. Conclusion: A Bullish Future for Bitcoin Matrixport’s forecast of Bitcoin surpassing $160,000 by 2025 reflects the cryptocurrency’s strengthening fundamentals and growing institutional acceptance. While challenges like regulatory scrutiny remain, the combination of increasing demand, favorable macroeconomic trends, and a maturing market positions Bitcoin for continued success.
