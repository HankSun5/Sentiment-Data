It predicts Bitcoin will reach as high as $180K, and other major digital assets will reach record highs by the end of 2025. The firm projected in a December 13 blog post that the cryptocurrency bull market will experience a “medium-term peak” in the first quarter of 2025 before a period of consolidation and eventual recovery leads to new all-time highs. VanEck Predicts Bitcoin at $180K and Ethereum Above $6K in the Next Market Cycle According to a blog post published on December 13 by Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, at the anticipated market peak, VanEck expects Bitcoin (BTC) to reach approximately $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $6,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could see valuations exceeding $500 and $10, respectively. However, the firm forecasts a summer correction, with Bitcoin facing a 30% retracement and altcoins potentially declining by up to 60%. Despite these setbacks, VanEck expects a recovery by the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and achieving new highs before the end of the year. NEW: Spot #Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck is predicting in 2025: – $180,000 bitcoin price – Banks will be allowed to custody bitcoin – US will adopt Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Bitcoin ETFs will support in-kind creations & redemptions THIS WOULD BE MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/l6JyjFaaRc — Nikolaus Hoffman (@NikolausHoff) December 13, 2024 The firm has identified several key indicators to monitor for signs of speculative market peaks. For example, high funding rates on Bitcoin perpetual futures above 10% for three months could indicate speculative excess. Similarly, many Bitcoin holders with unrealized profits exceeding a 70% profit-to-cost ratio suggest market euphoria. An overvalued market cap relative to realized value, measured by MVRV scores above 5, often signals overheated conditions. Additionally, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance below 40% could indicate late-cycle speculative shifts into riskier altcoins. Increased speculation from non-crypto-savvy individuals is also a warning sign of mania near a market top. The blog post also reflects on previous predictions made by Sigel, including a projection that Bitcoin could climb to $2.9 million per coin by 2050 and Ethereum reach $22,000 per token by 2030 . Trump’s Pro-Crypto Administration: A Boost for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? The market outlook for Bitcoin reflects growing bullish sentiment among experts. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has predicted BTC will surpass $1 million by 2030 , citing increased participation from major investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Similarly, Henry Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Capital Management, believes President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration will drive institutional adoption. In a November 6 X post , he highlighted opportunities for asset managers and family offices to enter the U.S. crypto market. What is the impact of Trump’s win on the #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency markets? 3 things to watch: – change of US regulatory stance – further entry of institutional investors – wave of M&A in the space pic.twitter.com/9rJAJNO6h9 — Henri Arslanian (@HenriArslanian) November 6, 2024 Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Crypto research firm 10x Research suggests BTC could reach $100,000 by January 2025 , noting historical patterns where a six-month high typically leads to a 40% median gain over three months. Independent analyst Mags also predicts Bitcoin could hit $250,000 within a year , referencing its 360% post-election rally in 2020 and potential similar growth in 2024. MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy continues to yield massive returns. Since 2020, the firm has invested $23.5 billion to amass over 400,000 BTC, equivalent to 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. As of December 7, its holdings are valued at $40 billion, with an unrealized profit of $16.5 billion—a 70% return on capital.

In December 2024, it’s not just about the next viral meme—it’s about serious growth, explosive potential, and making those significant returns. If you’re looking to ride the hype and secure your spot in the future of meme coins, then you need to pay attention to the best meme coins for significant returns. From BTFD Coin raking in millions in presale sales to Goatseus Maximus battling a slight dip, and Degen steadily moving up—there are some coins you’ll want to keep on your radar. Let’s start with BTFD Coin —rapidly becoming a powerhouse in the meme coin world. The presale has already raised over $3.7 million, with 53 billion tokens sold and counting. The community is buzzing, and the BTFD Coin presale is already showing signs of massive returns. If you’re looking to snag a piece of this before it rockets even further, you better act fast. BTFD Coin: From Presale Success to 2025 Moonshot We can’t talk about the best meme coins for significant returns without giving BTFD Coin a serious spotlight. From the “Buy The Dip” mentality to staking rewards that could offer you an APY of 90%, there’s no shortage of reasons why this coin is making waves. The presale for BTFD Coin is already in full swing, with over $3.7 million raised and 53 billion tokens sold. That’s a lot of momentum to start with. With the presale price at $0.00013, this coin is set to see substantial growth as the price increases over time. The community is massive, and with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, BTFD Coin is taking off faster than we can keep up. But let’s talk numbers: if you were to invest $2,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013 per token, you’d be buying 15.3 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price were to reach $0.0006 by 2025 (a reasonable prediction based on current momentum), your $2,000 investment could turn into $9,180. That’s a 359% return on your investment—now, that’s the kind of growth you want in your portfolio. BTFD Coin has everything you could want for significant returns—staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn game , and a community-focused movement that will push it into the crypto stratosphere. Goatseus Maximus: Facing the Dip, But Long-Term Potential Remains Next up is Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that had all the hype earlier this year but has recently faced some volatility. The coin has seen a 24-hour -0.95% decline, but don’t be fooled by this temporary setback—it’s still one of the best meme coins for significant returns over the long term. At its peak, Goatseus Maximus was hitting highs, with prices that reflected its strong community and meme-driven popularity. But right now, it’s undergoing a bit of a retrace. The latest price sits around $0.7382, and despite the short-term dip, Goatseus Maximus still boasts a robust ecosystem with massive community engagement and ongoing development. This dip could present a perfect buying opportunity if you’re a believer in meme coins with long-term growth potential. As for predictions, Goatseus Maximus could very well rebound in 2025, potentially reaching prices around $0.73558 to $1.466409. For investors looking to buy and hold for significant returns, Goatseus Maximus is still one to consider, despite its current downtrend. Degen: A Steady Climb for the Bold Investor And then there’s Degen, the meme coin that refuses to quit. While Goatseus Maximus might be experiencing a brief hiccup, and BTFD Coin is on its way to the moon, Degen has been moving steadily upward, gaining traction among investors who believe in its quiet, consistent growth. Degen might not have the same viral hype as the others, but it’s proving to be one of the best meme coins for significant returns due to its consistent growth trajectory and strong community backing. The current price of Degen is sitting at $0.015359, but its solid fundamentals—paired with increasing interest from influencers and crypto communities—means it could experience strong growth moving into 2025. Looking ahead to 2025, Degen has the potential to hit between $0.027856 and $0.077508.It’s the steady Eddie of the group, but don’t sleep on its potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the BTFD Coin Presale—The Time to Act is Now! If you’re serious about grabbing the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is the one that’s impossible to ignore. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term growth, BTFD Coin has the community, the rewards, and the Play-to-Earn integration to make it a serious contender. So, why wait? Invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of the presale price before it skyrockets. At the current price, the potential for growth is massive. Don’t miss out on BTFD Coin—grab your tokens today and be part of the meme coin revolution!

French Hill plans to introduce clear regulations in the first 100 days of the new term, making it a key focus for Congress. His leadership could change U.S. crypto policy, creating a stable environment for the digital asset industry, a move long-awaited by crypto stakeholders. Hills Calls for a Shift Toward Crypto Regulation in the U.S. French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, was recently voted to chair the House Financial Services Committee. This comes after leading the panel’s subcommittee on digital assets. This committee is pivotal in crafting the nation’s crypto regulations, and Hill’s election marks a turning point for the industry. Hill has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly its chairman, Gary Gensler. Hill believes Gensler’s heavy enforcement approach to crypto regulation stifles innovation. In September, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer criticized Gensler’s SEC leadership, calling his tenure the most destructive and lawless. Hill argues that the U.S. needs a clearer market structure for digital assets, limiting the potential of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Many crypto leaders share this view, calling for necessary changes. The crypto community has praised Hill’s leadership, with groups like the DeFi Education Fund and Blockchain Association supporting his efforts to create clear regulations. They appreciate his focus on innovation and protecting the rights of developers and DeFi users. Hill is seen as a strong advocate for sensible crypto policies. Digital Assets: A Priority in the First 100 Days Hill’s vision for 2025 aligns closely with Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader. Scalise plans to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets within the first 100 days of President-elect Donald Trump’s term. The focus will include stablecoins and other key aspects of the crypto landscape, creating much-needed certainty for the industry. Scalise intends to establish a framework that will allow digital assets to grow with clear rules in place. The new bill will provide businesses and innovators with the confidence to build. A Potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In addition to regulatory work, discussions around a strategic Bitcoin reserve have gained momentum, both federally and at the state level. Hill will be tasked with navigating these discussions in his new role, including proposals from Senator Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Giovanni Capriglione. Lummis has proposed a bill directing the U.S. Treasury to purchase one million Bitcoins over five years. Capriglione has filed a state bill to create a Bitcoin reserve through donations, holding the assets for up to five years. When asked about the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, Hill acknowledged its appeal but was cautious in his assessment.

The analyst urges the XRP community to monitor this fractal closely, highlighting the need to monitor price movements in the coming weeks. XRP Price Eyes $16 As Analyst Spots Bullish Fractal An XRP supporter on X (formerly Twitter), known as ‘LUDXRP,’ has released a detailed chart analysis, predicting that the XRP price could climb to an ambitious price target of $16.15. The analyst mentioned the presence of a historic fractal on the XRP chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything The fractal pattern, indicated by the blue circle in the chart, highlights a significant upward movement in the XRP price. Following the movements of the chart, if XRP can replicate this fractal, it could trigger a significant price rally toward $16.15. Multiple green horizontal lines have also been shown in the chart, spotlighting different resistance and support zones that could trigger a reaction in the XRP price. With XRP trading at $2.42, the horizontal trend lines above its current price are seen as crucial resistance levels. The analyst highlighted intermediate price levels like $2.8, $4.1, $7.6, and $12.7 as crucial resistance levels, which XRP must surpass before reaching the ambitious target of $16.15. Additionally, the chart identifies $2 as a potential support level, warning that if the price drops below this mark, it could lead to a possible price dip to $1. With the possibility of breaking above $16, the XRP supporter has urged community members to monitor the fractal on the price chart closely. He emphasized the importance of XRP maintaining an upward trend within the blue circle, which could trigger his projected price increase toward $16. XRP To See “Face Melting” Rally This Christmas A crypto analyst identified as the ‘Charting Guy’ on X has expressed optimism about XRP’s future price outlook. According to the analyst, XRP could experience a ” face-melting “ rally to new highs by Christmas and in late January. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green The analyst has stated that if XRP continues to follow past bullish trends seen in 2017, the market will likely consolidate for another two weeks until Christmas. He disclosed that this bullish projection was primarily based on XRP’s fractal rather than relying on Fibonacci levels. In response to a comment from a crypto community member, the Charting guy agreed that by December 30, XRP would experience a series of strong green weeks, potentially driven either by the Christmas hype or the bullish sentiment surrounding the RLUSD stablecoin. The analyst also agreed that January 20, the inauguration day of Donald Trump as the United States (US) President, could mark the XRP price top, which the market would likely consider a “sell the news event.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-13 22:30:52

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana faces competition as Lightchain AI, with AI-powered blockchain tech, offers a bold vision for decentralized creativity. Table of Contents Solana’s current position in the blockchain space What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Why experts see disruption potential The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities In the world of blockchain technology, Solana (SOL) has carved out a significant niche for itself. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low costs, and growing ecosystem, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for developers and investors. However, as technology evolves and new players emerge, questions arise about whether Solana’s dominance can be challenged. Enter Lightchain AI , a next-generation blockchain platform that combines unique artificial intelligence (AI) integration with creative scalability solutions. Boasting its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI presents a bold vision of the future—one where blockchain and AI work in tandem to power decentralized creativity. Can Lightchain AI challenge Solana’s supremacy? Experts believe the possibility is real, and here’s why. You might also like: Shiba Inu highlights and Lightchain AI’s blockchain solutions for December 2024 Solana’s current position in the blockchain space Solana’s rapid rise to prominence in the blockchain world can be attributed to several key factors: Speed and Scalability: Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant leap over Ethereum’s 15 TPS and other competing blockchains. Low Fees: Solana’s transaction fees are fractions of a penny, making it attractive for developers and users looking for cost-effective solutions. Developer Ecosystem: Solana’s active community has built an array of decentralized applications (dApps) spanning DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional Interest: High-profile backers like FTX and venture capital firms have provided financial and strategic support. Despite these strengths, Solana has faced its fair share of challenges: Network Downtime: Solana’s network has experienced multiple outages, raising concerns about its reliability and centralization. High Hardware Requirements: Running a Solana node requires powerful and expensive hardware, limiting true decentralization. Lack of Innovation in AI Integration: While Solana excels in transaction processing, its offerings in AI and advanced computational capabilities are limited. These pain points create an opportunity for a challenger like Lightchain AI to step in and disrupt Solana’s dominance. What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Lightchain AI is not just another blockchain—it’s a platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to address many of the challenges faced by traditional blockchains like Solana. Its core innovations include: 1. Proof of Intelligence: A smarter consensus mechanism While Solana uses a hybrid Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI): AI-Powered Validation: Nodes contribute by solving meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and optimization, rather than simply staking tokens or verifying blocks. Energy Efficiency: Unlike energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) systems, PoI aligns computational power with productive AI advancements. Decentralized AI Development: By decentralizing AI workloads, Lightchain AI ensures that its consensus mechanism contributes directly to solving real-world problems. This transformative approach positions Lightchain AI as a blockchain network with a purpose beyond simple transaction validation. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine: Redefining computation Lightchain AI’s AIVM sets it apart from other blockchain platforms by enabling the execution of AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. Key features include: Real-Time AI Execution: Unlike Solana , which focuses primarily on transaction processing, AIVM powers decentralized applications (dApps) that require advanced AI capabilities like predictive analytics and machine learning. Global Developer Collaboration: AIVM encourages developers worldwide to contribute AI models, creating a collaborative and evolving ecosystem. Interoperability: The AIVM integrates with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it easy for developers to adopt and deploy existing tools. 3. Scalability and speed While Solana’s high TPS is impressive, Lightchain AI employs advanced sharding and Layer 2 solutions to achieve comparable scalability without compromising decentralization: Parallel Processing: Lightchain’s architecture allows multiple nodes to process AI tasks and transactions simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks. Real-Time Applications: From supply chain tracking to high-frequency financial trading, Lightchain AI’s scalability supports applications that demand speed and precision. 4. Decentralized governance Unlike Solana, which has faced criticism for centralization, Lightchain AI prioritizes a community-driven governance model: Token Holder Influence: Through voting rights tied to its native LCAI token, the Lightchain community can propose and vote on changes to the protocol. Quadratic Voting: This system ensures smaller stakeholders have a proportional voice, fostering fairness and inclusivity. These are the key features that make Lightchain AI a potential challenger to Solana’s current dominance in the blockchain space. Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Feature Solana Lightchain AI Consensus Mechanism PoH + PoS PoI Transaction Speed (TPS) Up to 65,000 Comparable (via sharding) Energy Efficiency Moderate High (AI-aligned tasks) AI Integration Limited Advanced (via AIVM) Decentralization Partial Full (community-driven governance) Network Downtime Several outages reported Built for reliability Why experts see disruption potential 1. Bridging blockchain and AI “Lightchain AI stands out because it’s not just a blockchain—it’s an AI platform,” says Dr. Amelia Wang, an AI researcher. “By merging these two technologies, Lightchain enables use cases that traditional blockchains like Solana simply cannot address.” Potential applications include: Decentralized AI Model Training: Nodes collaborate to train global AI models without compromising data privacy. AI-Powered DeFi Protocols: Platforms that use machine learning for risk assessment and portfolio optimization. Data Marketplaces: Decentralized platforms where users can buy and sell AI-ready datasets. 2. Solana’s limitations leave room for competition While Solana excels in speed, it has struggled with reliability and decentralization. Matthew Ellis, a blockchain analyst, notes: “Solana’s network outages have shaken investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism offers a more sustainable and reliable alternative while adding value through AI computations.” 3. AI’s booming market The AI market is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2030, creating enormous opportunities for platforms like Lightchain AI. As more industries adopt AI-powered solutions, a blockchain that can integrate seamlessly with AI will be well-positioned for long-term success. The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities Challenges for Lightchain AI Adoption: Gaining traction in an already competitive market dominated by Solana, Ethereum , and others. Education: Convincing developers and enterprises of the value of integrating AI with blockchain. Scalability Tests: Proving its architecture can handle large-scale adoption without bottlenecks. Opportunities Early Adoption: Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale offers an entry point for investors looking to get in before the project gains mainstream attention. Industry Partnerships: Collaborating with AI and blockchain leaders to create real-world applications. Decentralized Innovation: Harnessing the power of its developer and token holder community to drive continuous evolution. Jump in before the rocket launches Solana who? The blockchain world is buzzing, and Lightchain AI is here to shake things up. With AI smarts, lightning-fast speeds, and a loyal crew of believers, this isn’t just another altcoin — this could be the next big thing. Experts are whispering about a potential 10x explosion by 2025, and the presale is your ticket to the ground floor of something epic.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP slows down but 5 altcoins, including Rexas Finance (RXS), could turn $300 into $6,000 by 2025. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Tron Floki Inu Dogecoin Polygon Conclusion Since November, XRP has been one of the strongest bull run performers, rising from $0.63 to $2.92. XRP’s momentum reversed when it failed to test $3, dropping to $2.52 levels. While XRP’s ascent has hit a snag, Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon might bring huge gains, potentially upgrading $300 portfolios to $6000l. Rexas Finance Investors looking to build a profitable portfolio from a low budget within the shortest time interval could consider Rexas Finance , one of the most inventive crypto projects. It seeks to digitise a variety of tangible things such as properties, commodities, and arts, thus enabling the retail investor to enter into otherwise untouchable investments. Considering the worldwide commodities, real estate, and financial assets market to be $121.2 trillion, $379.7 trillion, and $486 trillion, respectively, RWA tokenization is the future of money. Rexas Finance will open up investment options to a wider audience by allowing fractional ownership and digital trade of these precious assets, removing geographical and financial limitations. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem will include the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, making asset-backed token creation, management, and trading easy. The platform will also support Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that maximizes investor income with minimal effort. Moreover, it will offer a decentralized Launchpad for startups to raise funds and increase their reach. These features make Rexas Finance a key player in the DeFi movement. Rexas Finance’s presale has been a success so far, with the token price rising over 316% in three months. The project has raised $25.3 million and sold 334 million RXS tokens as investors flock to its current presale stage despite the price appreciation of $0.125. Rexas Finance opted for public presales over VC funding, a crucial step to creating a community-driven platform with decentralized ownership. A recent Certik audit improved Rexas Finance’s security and transparency. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, two major cryptocurrency tracking websites, have listed RXS, enhancing visibility and investor interest. Before RXS is listed on the proposed top crypto exchanges, investors have a limited time to buy it at its current presale price. Rexas Finance is also offering a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 entrants each receiving $50,000 in RXS tokens. Experts see a huge potential in the Rexas Finance project, with many projecting a massive surge to $10 immediately after its anticipated mega listings.

TRX is at $0.37, up 70% in 24 hours and 140% in 30 days. Tron founder Justin Sun continues to promote the project on social media. High-profile decentralized finance (DeFi) ventures like Sun’s investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) have boosted the Tron ecosystem’s reputation and attracted institutional investors. TRX’s complete DeFi applications are helping it grow as more people join the network. Floki Inu Floki Inu remains a top meme coin for its community-driven strategy and unique branding. FLOKI rose over 650% in 2024 and is expected to continue rising in 2025. Crypto expert Master Kenobi forecasts FLOKI will rise 700% to $0.0023 by March 2025. This prediction follows its impressive chart patterns, which suggest bullish momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin recently reached a yearly top of $0.4634, proving its market viability. A strong optimistic trend over the last month produced a 200% increase. Though its popularity and strong community support have kept it among the top cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is most renowned for its meme roots. After rising, DOGE still lags 37% below its all-time high of $0.73. Due to considerable accumulation by whales, recently launched DOGE ETP, and upcoming political shift in the US, Dogecoin might soon soar above $1. Polygon Polygon is recognized as an Ethereum Layer-2 scalability solution. The POL coin, which rose 18% to $0.64 in the previous week, is becoming a key player in Ethereum dApp scalability. Polygon’s long-term projections are good despite recent setbacks. The platform makes perfect use of Ethereum’s features, making it a necessary component of the Ethereum ecology. As the altcoin season nears, Polygon’s price will rise as Ethereum benefits from the anticipated clear regulatory climate following Gary Gensler’s recent resignation. Experts predict it might surge to $5 in the coming months. Conclusion Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon are predicted to rise dramatically in 2025. These solutions provide distinct promise and development potential for those looking to grow their portfolios from $300 to $6,000 by early 2025. Rexas Finance is a transformative project with a solid foundation. Its presale success, growing ecosystem, and upcoming exchange listings make it a great candidate for huge gains. At $0.125, RXS current price is a bargain for investors willing to jump in on the presale. To learn more about Rexas Finance, visit their websi t e , giveaway , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Here’s Why a “Santa Rally” Is Likely,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-set-to-pump-to-5k-before-years-end-heres-why-a-santa-rally-is-likely/,"As the Ethereum (ETH) price consolidates just above $3,900, traders are eyeing the possibility of a surge into the year’s end, a phenomenon referred to as a “Santa Rally”. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is looking good right now, sitting above all of its major moving averages and still in a clear uptrend. However, resistance in the form of the early 2024 highs just above $4,000 continues to cap the Ethereum price action. However, Christmas could be about to come early for Ethereum investors. While Polymarket betting odds only currently place a 14% chance that the Ethereum price will hit new all-time highs at $5,000, this may represent the market under-pricing the likelihood of a strong breakout. Here’s why. Ethereum Price to Pump to $5,000 Soon? Here’s Why That’s Likely Reason 1 – Vibes To say that vibes are good in the crypto market right now would be an understatement ahead of the arrival of an almost unimaginably pro-crypto incoming US administration in March. Trump promised this week to do great things for the crypto industry, his picks for Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair are ardently pro-crypto, and his family were spotted loading up their ETH, AAVE and LINK positions just days ago. U.S. President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial bought • 2,631 $ETH ($10M) • 3,357 $AAVE ($1M) • 41,335 $LINK ($1M) UNREAL pic.twitter.com/KubybniuBb — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 12, 2024 Its not hyperbole to say we are not he cusp of a new golden age for crypto markets as policy in the US swings decisively in a positive direction. That is a strong reason why buy pressure is likely to remain elevated into the year’s end, boding well for the Ethereum price. Reason 2 – Market Leadership and ETF Inflows The prospect of the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve in the USA suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) will be a massive winner amid the upcoming administration. However, altcoins like Ethereum which have been weighed so heavily by regulatory uncertainty in recent years may enjoy an even greater snapback. And Ethereum is in a great position to be one of the strongest-performing altcoins . It remains far and away the most dominant blockchain in DeFi, with a 56% market share of TVL per DeFi Llama , even if Solana has overtaken it in terms of speculative trading activities (thanks to its lower fees). For investors new to crypto looking to expand beyond BTC, Ethereum will likely stand out as the obvious next option. That is even more the case given Ethereum is the only other major crypto to have spot ETFs in the US. According to data presented by The Block , Ethereum ETF inflows have been ramping up since Trump’s election victory. And there is no reason for this to slow down into the year’s end, meaning upside risks to the Ethereum price in the coming weeks. Reason 3 – On-chain Activity Heating Up Another reason to be bullish on the Ethereum price into the year’s end is because the activity on its blockchain is really starting to heat up. Per Glassnode’s Ethereum core on-chain dashboard , metrics such as number of active addresses, number of transactions, and total transfer volume are all trending higher and challenging yearly highs. That strengthens the adoption narrative and can help to support prices. But it also contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as a deflationary asset – a portion of the ETH gas fees get burnt, so the more fees are generated, the more ETH is burnt. How Much Higher Can Ethereum Go? With Ethereum now close to its record highs, investors would be forgiven for fearing that the best part of the rally might now be over. But that would be a mistake – Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum price has historically moved in cycles, breaking into phases of aggressive price discovery, followed by large and prolonged drawdowns. Luckily for the bulls, a new phase of price discovery is likely just around the corner. Bitcoin entered its new phase of price discovery last month, as it historically always have within eight months of the BTC halving. Ethereum, meanwhile, has historically lagged Bitcoin by up to two months. That could mean an aggressive breakout to fresh record levels is coming in January. Various on-chain metrics also support the thesis that the top isn’t yet in – Ethereum’s “realized cap” (i.e. the market cap at the average price when each last coin moved) just hit new record highs at just under $248 billion. And the ratio of the ETH market cap to its realized cap, last around 1.5 per Glassnode , remains well below levels that have marked prior market peaks (above 3). Meanwhile, while high, the profitability of the Ethereum market also remains below levels that have marked prior Ethereum price peaks. Per Glassnode , NUPL was last just over 0.5, but prior market peaks have seen NUPL rise above 0.75. Regarding the question “how much higher can Ethereum go?”, no one knows for sure. But the answer is certainly a lot. The past cycle saw the Ethereum price rally over 4x beyond its prior record highs. A repeat of these gains is very possible, setting up the possibility of a near $20,000 Ethereum price. The post Ethereum Price Set to Pump to $5K Before Year’s End?

The report, gathered through open-source code activity, compiled notable industry developments in 2024 so far. The 2024 report includes data from StablePulse.org, NFTpulse.org and CodeSlaw.app. Electric Capital’s report confirmed perceptions about the significant growth the crypto industry has witnessed across multiple sectors and on a global scale this year. The continued adoption and adaptation of the industry has had a great impact on the world and shown the industry’s capacity to innovate. One of these notable trends in this year’s report is the Asian developer momentum. The population of programmers from that part of the world has increased, taking over North America’s dominance. Asia now ranks first, while North America is third in line after Europe. Back in 2015, 81% of crypto developers were in North America and Europe. Now, that stat has dropped to 55%. India and Ethereum were the biggest winners this year Despite Asia taking the lead over other continents, the US remains the country with the highest concentration of developers, with 19%. However, the country is down from 38% in 2015. India, on the other hand, has seen the most growth and is now the country with the second-highest developer share. The South Asian nation has come a long way from its 10th position in 2015. The country also onboarded the most new crypto developers in 2024, contributing 17% of new talent. Top five countries for crypto developers. Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Established developers with 2+ years of experience grew by 27% and now account for 70% of code commits. 39,148 new developers explored crypto this year, according to the Electric Capital report. Developers in the crypto space are also extremely diverse, with 1 in 3 developers working across multiple ecosystems. In 2015, less than 10% of developers had a similar level of diversity. Crypto developers have grown 39% per year since Ethereum’s launch in 2015, and it remains the leading ecosystem by developer share globally, boosted by the growth in Layer 2 adoption. EVM compatible chains continue to dominate, accounting for 74% of multi-chain developers. This year, Solana emerged as the favorite ecosystem of new developers, with over 57% of minting wallets. It grew by 83% YoY. NFTs and DeFi made strong recoveries, but ETFs and stablecoins led the way The data collected by Electric Capital indicates that different parts of the world gravitate toward different crypto use cases and ecosystems.

Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Stablecoin transactions are consistently active, rising by 2-3% during Asian, European, and African work hours. NFT trading peaks during American work hours, while minting peaks during Asian work hours. According to Electric Capital’s report, Base and Solana lead in low-fee use cases for NFTs, making them ideal for high-volume minting and trading. Base owns 97% of NFT minting volume, while Solana owns 64% of NFT mint transactions. NFT minting volume reached an all-time high of $1.5B this year. Minting wallets grew to 67M in 2024, with most of the activity on Solana (57%), Polygon (24%), and Base (13%). The all-time high volume for unique minting wallets was 23M. Minting transactions grew from 153M in 2023 to 568M in 2024, with the most activity on Solana (64%) and Base (26%). This year, NFT mints went beyond arts. The top NFT collections included finance, rewards, identity, gaming and more. NFT deployments tripled YoY, with Base and Zora leading in minting activity by 87%. DeFi also had a big year. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi grew 89% this year, with Ethereum taking the lead with 53%. Ethereum had 7x more TVL than Solana, its strongest competitor, with $16B. Restaking emerged in 2023 and grew to $30.6B this year. It has now become the largest sector in DeFi. EigenLayer spearheaded the growth in restaking as it saw its developer count grow more than twofold in 2024. 53% of EigenLayer developers are established and 39% of them are committed devs. Electric Capital’s report also shows stablecoins closing the year at an all-time high of $196B in circulation and $81B in daily transaction volume. Tether’s USDT is the runaway leader in stablecoin dominance, accounting for 72% of fiat-pegged tokens in circulation this year. Circle USDC’s 20% is its closest competition. Ethereum and TRON hosted the most issued stablecoins, with 59% and 35%, respectively. Arguably the catalysts for one of the best crypto years on record, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs had record-breaking launches. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $50B+ net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs achieved $13B in assets under management (AUM) since July.

Is it the technology, the community, or the potential returns for early investors? While the market evolves, three projects have captured the spotlight: Filecoin, EOS, and the innovative newcomer Qubetics ($TICS). These projects bring unique opportunities and updates, but Qubetics has generated a different buzz than any of them, particularly with its groundbreaking Web3 infrastructure and Top Crypto Presale to buy. Recent updates highlight exciting predictions for Filecoin and the potential of EOS. However, Qubetics takes centre stage with its ambitious plans, cutting-edge decentralised VPN service, and highly rewarding presale. This article will delve into the latest developments for all three projects, focusing on Qubetics and why it’s the most compelling opportunity for savvy investors. How Qubetics dVPN Is Changing the Game for Online Privacy Qubetics is making waves with its Web3 ecosystem, and a key highlight is its decentralised VPN (dVPN) . Unlike traditional VPNs that often log user data or are prone to censorship, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to ensure true privacy and security. Creating a peer-to-peer network eliminates centralised control, offering unrestricted and anonymous internet access. What makes this unique? First, the decentralised architecture ensures no single entity can control or compromise your data. This model provides unmatched transparency and censorship resistance. Additionally, users providing bandwidth are incentivised with $TICS tokens, transforming the service into a self-sustaining marketplace. Advanced features like multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption further enhance privacy and security. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session , connecting directly with its community to answer questions and share updates. This initiative underscores the project’s commitment to transparency and user engagement. With its dVPN, Qubetics isn’t just improving privacy—it’s setting a new standard for secure, decentralised internet access. Could this be the Top Crypto Presale to buy for those seeking long-term growth? Filecoin: Powering Decentralised Storage Solutions Filecoin continues to lead in decentralised storage, offering a secure and efficient alternative to traditional cloud providers. By enabling users to rent out unused hard drive space, Filecoin rewards participants with FIL tokens. This system, built on proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime mechanisms, ensures data reliability and long-term storage. Looking ahead, market analysts predict a steady price climb for Filecoin. By 2024, FIL is expected to average $17.28, with projections of $35.70 by 2027 and $58.80 by 2030. These forecasts highlight Filecoin’s potential as a long-term investment in the decentralised Web3 infrastructure. EOS: A High-Potential Altcoin for 2024 EOS offers a versatile blockchain platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. As Bitcoin sets the stage for another “Altseason,” EOS could see significant growth in 2024. Current projections suggest EOS might reach $1.165 by the end of the year, driven by increased developer adoption and market momentum. However, the token’s performance hinges on key factors such as adoption rates, competition from other blockchain platforms, and regulatory developments. Despite these uncertainties, EOS remains a promising contender for investors seeking exposure to altcoins in 2024. Qubetics Presale Is Exploding: The Top Crypto Presale to Buy Now Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS tokens at a low rate of $0.031. Each week, the token price rises by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike during the final phase. With over $5.9 million raised, 318 million tokens sold, and 9,000+ holders, Qubetics is rapidly gaining momentum. The numbers are compelling. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. For investors entering now, the potential ROI is staggering. A $10 target would mean a return of over 32,028%, while $15 could yield an ROI of approximately 48,092%. With the presale ending soon, this phase presents a golden opportunity to maximise gains. Qubetics has already demonstrated its appeal through its cutting-edge technology and growing community. The excitement surrounding the presale only strengthens its position as the top crypto presale to buy for 2024 . Will you seize this chance before the next phase kicks in? Conclusion: Why Qubetics Leads the Pack The cryptocurrency market offers countless opportunities, but few are as compelling as Qubetics. While Filecoin continues to innovate in decentralised storage and EOS positions itself for growth in the coming year, Qubetics stands out with its ambitious plans and exceptional ROI potential. Its decentralised VPN service and rapidly advancing presale make it the Top Crypto Presale to buy, offering a rare blend of technology and opportunity. As analysts predict meteoric growth for $TICS, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics revolution and secure your place in what could be the next major success story in the blockchain world.

The surge also follows a series of announcements, including new market listings and milestone achievements for the company. CZ’s Influence On December 11, Travala reported that its annual revenues had reached $100 million, up from $59.6 million in 2023. This achievement was made possible by the growing demand for flight and hotel bookings paid using crypto. It also coincided with the firm’s disclosure of a new strategy: It intends to hold a portion of its treasury reserve in AVA and Bitcoin in the manner popularized by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy . However, Zhao’s December 12 post on X highlighting his firm’s early investment in Travala, dating back to the pre-COVID era, tipped the scales, getting the market excited and fueling investor curiosity. Hailed as one of the “OG of Crypto” by some X users, Zhao’s influence within the blockchain and crypto sector is well-documented . By drawing attention to Binance’s early involvement, he not only reinforced Travala’s credibility but also signaled its potential for long-term growth – at least that’s how the market took it based on the price’s performance. According to the social metrics platform LunarCrush, CZ’s post, viewed more than 1.3 million times, caused a marked rise in AVA-related social activity. As a result, it experienced an explosive 350% price rally, jumping from $0.75 to a peak of $3.38 in just one day. Performance and Outlook At the time of this writing, the token was still almost 310% higher than its level from 24 hours ago. Its current price also represents a 286.6% improvement over seven days and an even more impressive 541% jump over 30 days. Additionally, it registered a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $890 million per data from CoinGecko, a 28,436% increase across the period, highlighting the catalytic nature of CZ’s post. With a circulating supply of 56.3 million units, each costing over $3.00, AVA now boasts a nearly $172 million valuation, placing it at #445 on the list of cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps. The token has massively outperformed the broader crypto market, which is down 2.20% in the last seven days, and similar Ethereum ecosystem assets, which are up 12.7% on average.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 23:53:00

This period of choppy price action has kept traders on edge, as Dogecoin’s price appears poised for a decisive move. Despite the temporary pause in upward momentum, market sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors anticipating another breakout. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s potential for a massive price surge. According to Hardy, it’s only a matter of time before DOGE breaks into new all-time highs. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is building a strong foundation, and continued consolidation at current levels is a bullish signal. If Dogecoin maintains support above $0.40, the stage could be set for a significant rally in the coming weeks. However, much will depend on broader market conditions and the ability of DOGE to sustain buying pressure. All eyes are on its ability to overcome resistance and resume its bullish trend. With whale activity and trading volumes showing signs of growth, Dogecoin could soon retest its highs, ushering in a new chapter of price discovery. Dogecoin Consolidates At Current Levels Dogecoin is consolidating below its yearly high of $0.484 after an impressive rally, and it appears this phase of sideways movement may persist for some time. While the price action has calmed, investor sentiment remains notably optimistic, with many viewing this consolidation as a stepping stone toward even higher price levels. Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, offering a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Hardy, DOGE’s current price action is a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend. He emphasized that the asset is building a solid base, which increases the likelihood of a significant breakout. Hardy’s projection suggests that Dogecoin is poised to surpass its yearly high and is also on track to achieve a new all-time high (ATH). In his analysis, Hardy highlighted key support levels around $0.40 and $0.36, indicating these areas as crucial for maintaining the bullish structure. He also mapped out a potential price trajectory, predicting that Dogecoin will consolidate at current levels for several weeks before resuming its upward momentum. His optimistic target for DOGE is $2, which he believes could be reached if the broader market remains favorable and buying pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength While consolidation may test the patience of traders, Hardy’s analysis aligns with the broader view that Dogecoin is preparing for another major leg up. A new ATH could be just around the corner as long as it holds key support levels and sentiment remains positive. DOGE Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.40 after a 24% retrace from its local highs. Despite this pullback, the price has exceeded this key demand level, signaling resilience among bulls. Market participants are closely watching the $0.40 zone, representing a critical point for determining the next move in DOGE’s price action. If DOGE can reclaim the $0.43 level in the coming days, it would likely set the stage for a retest of its yearly high at $0.484. A breakout above this resistance could reignite bullish momentum and pave the way for further upside, potentially attracting renewed interest from traders and investors. However, maintaining support and gaining traction is essential for this scenario to unfold. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details On the flip side, losing the $0.40 level could signal that bearish sentiment is gaining market control. In this case, DOGE might face a deeper correction, with the next critical support levels likely emerging near $0.36. Such a move would challenge the bullish outlook and delay DOGE’s efforts to reach new highs.

From humble beginnings as internet jokes, these coins have grown into investment powerhouses, delivering chef’s kiss gains to lucky holders. Financial freedom? It’s never looked this approachable—or this much fun. Leading the pack is none other than BTFD Coin, the rallying cry of every trader who knows how to “buy the dip.” The coin’s presale has bulldozed through the market, with a jaw-dropping $3.7 million raised, over 53 billion coins sold, and more than 5,000 holders locking horns for their share of the action. Don’t wait too long to grab yours, though—the bulls aren’t slowing down! 1. BTFD Coin: Where the Bulls Play to Win BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement. Inspired by the legendary trading mantra, “Buy the Dip,” this meme coin embraces chaos and turns it into opportunity. Built on Ethereum for rock-solid security, it offers insane features like staking rewards with an average APY of 90% and a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s already got gamers sharpening their horns. The ongoing presale is the real star of the show. In just weeks, BTFD Coin has raised $3.7 million, proving that the bulls are stampeding to get in. At its current presale price of $0.00013, it’s still early enough to lock in life-changing gains before the herd catches on. Let’s say you decide to invest $300 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price of $0.00013, that gives you 2,307,692 coins. If BTFD Coin soars to $0.0006 as predicted, your investment could balloon to $1,384—over a 361% return.

Think of Neiro as the spiritual successor to Dogecoin, carrying forward the meme magic while adding a heartwarming twist. Here’s the kicker: Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu, the iconic dog behind the Doge meme. It’s like Doge’s little sister is stepping into the spotlight, and she’s not here to play small. Launched on Ethereum at the precise moment of the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, Neiro caught the attention of none other than Vitalik Buterin. Yes, the Vitalik Buterin. Days later, he publicly confirmed a $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund inspired by Neiro. But the journey doesn’t stop at celebrity nods. Neiro’s origin story is as heartfelt as they come. Originally abandoned by her owner and placed in a shelter, Neiro’s tale mirrors the coin’s trajectory. After being rugged by its initial developer, the community banded together to breathe new life into the project. Now, Neiro is 100% community-owned and driven, embodying a true decentralised ethos. And in a poetic twist, Neiro has already made donations to the very shelter that once housed her real-life namesake. More charitable initiatives are in the pipeline, proving that this coin doesn’t just make wallets happy—it warms hearts too.

According to a Bloomberg article , the round now values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. OSS Capital, Duke Capital Partners, and PagsGroup also participated in the series A round. Liquid AI previously raised about $46.6 million in seed funding in 2023. Liquid AI wants to develop more efficient models The development comes as consumer generative AI, which captured global attention following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success has spurred developments across the world. The tech is now at the center of the fast-growing AI sector, which has seen investors pour billions of dollars into generative AI startups. For Liquid, the startup’s new models are known as Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) which the company says can deliver performance comparable or superior to traditional large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI, Google Cloud, and AWS. The LFMs are lightweight, general-purpose AI models requiring less data and compute power. The models strangely uses mathematical approaches discovered by studying a worm’s brain, as per Crunchbase. According to SiliconAngle , Liquid’s models are based on the concept of “liquid neural networks.” This classification is different from generative pre-trained transformer-based models or GPTs that support popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Google LLC’s Gemini. “At Liquid, our mission is to build the most capable and efficient AI systems at every scale.” Liquid CEO Ramin Hasani. “Since our inception, we have demonstrated the scalability of our technology by releasing text-based models, unveiling multimodal LFMs, and collaborating with key partners to showcase real-world impact,” added Hasani. AMD partnership will allow Liquid AI to optimize its LFMs According to SiliconAngle, the AI startup offers three model sizes, that is LFM-1B, a dense 1.3 billion parameter model for on-device such as mobile phones, LFM-3B, a 3.1 billion parameter model optimized for edge developments, and the LFM-40B Mixture of Experts, designed to tackle complex tasks. Liquid AI said LFMs have a reduced memory footprint compared to GPT architecture, which is more substantial for lengthy inputs, for instance when processing extremely long documents or video. The LFM-3.1B model, according to Liquid AI used significantly less memory than other small models when deployed than models such as Google LLC’s Gemma 2 2B-it or Meta’s Llama3.2 3B. Now, with this funding, Liquid AI has joined a strategic partnership with AMD bolstering its ability to optimize its foundation models with the chipmaker’s graphic, central, and neural processing units. The funding will also help the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup to develop tailored LFMs for industries like consumer electronics, biotechnology, telecoms, financial services, and e-commerce. Liquid AI was founded in 2023.

Table of Contents XYZ ready to deliver a 99,900% knockout XRP Cardano Conclusion Amid a surging crypto market, industry analysts are spotlighting significant momentum in select altcoins. Ripple’s XRP is demonstrating robust stability, maintaining support above key price levels.

XYZ ready to deliver a 99,900% knockout Donald Trump’s stunning election triumph has sent shockwaves through the crypto world, triggering the “bull run of the century.” While the old guard of major coins limps along with meager double-digit gains, meme coins are strapping on their gloves and entering the ring as the real heavyweights of this financial frenzy. Forget PNUT’s 4,500% spike or FRED’s 6,000% leap, those stories are yesterday’s news, mere flashes in the pan. They crumbled under the weight of FOMO-fueled sell-offs, leaving would-be millionaires clutching at thin air. But a new titan has entered the arena, poised to obliterate profit records with a 99,900% surge. Dubbed the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZ is tailor-made for crypto fanatics who live for the thrill of competition and the sweet scent of victory. This is not a run-of-the-mill meme coin; this is a juggernaut backed by a no-nonsense sports mentality and a fearless swagger that screams winner takes all. As Trump rallies his forces, the crypto battlefield is transforming into a no-mercy zone where only the strong survive. XYZ is the alpha predator, embodying the unapologetic boldness of men like Joe Rogan and Dana White — guys who don’t flinch at the prospect of a high-stakes showdown. XYZ isn’t just flexing potential — it’s already delivering knockout returns before hitting the big leagues.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

OpenZK announced Dave Sandor would be joining as co-founder to spearhead advancements in ZK-Rollup scaling solutions on X. Sandor has worked as an executive director at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to focus more on product structure, integrating institutional finance into potential decentralized finance. At OpenZK Network, Sandor will lead the development of next-generation Layer 2 solutions, focusing on improving the ecosystem’s reward mechanism and user experience. “Dave’s unique expertise positions us to advance the L2 landscape, delivering performance, security, rewards and a superb user experience for our entire ecosystem — from developers to traders to institutional partners.” OpenZK’s X post OpenZK has become the first native to support Ethereum ( ETH ) staking, re-staking, or liquidity, as well as stablecoin staking L2 scaling solution. Real-world assets, stablecoins , and staking are services that cater to these fast-growing segments in the DeFi.

ZK-Rollups current challenges ZK-Rollups are important for solving the issues blockchain has been struggling with for quite a while, such as scalability, cost, and privacy. They do this using an off-chain bundle of transactions that are validated using zero-knowledge proofs submitted to the main chain.

Despite these benefits, they also come along with several disadvantages. Some of them include complex development, computation-intensive proofs, difficulty in integrating dApps, and data availability issues for off-chain transactions, as seen previously in ZKsync . Sandor’s new position as co-founder of OpenZK can address ZK-Rollup’s present challenges and lay the ground for mass adoption and future growth of ZK-Rollups as a whole.

The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor,"" van Straten added. ""Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect.""

Holihan closed the account, but says new charges from the state of Pennsylvania poured in anyway, fully draining his life savings. “It was four different Giant supermarkets in Pennsylvania, where [scammers] took out a little over seven grand in under an hour… They still deny my claim, and it’s been over a year later, and I still haven’t seen my money.” Holihan says he can prove he was in New York when the charges were made, but Chase says each purchase was fully authorized and verified. “This customer’s claim was denied because the charges were authorized with their PIN and verified via phone call.” Holihan says he’s simply looking for the bank to stand by him and do the right thing. “It’s not even a thousandth of a percent. It’s nothing to them.

Table of Contents CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions FET nears key resistance Conclusion CYBRO, a new AI token valued at $0.06 is attracting keen interest from crypto millionaires. With some speculating a potential 20,000% surge, this digital asset is stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency world. CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain platform, is fast-tracking its plans to list on major exchanges following an impressive presale performance. The project secured $7 million in funding and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, cementing its position as a leader in DeFi. During the presale, CYBRO’s token price skyrocketed by 450%, rising from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, is scheduled for December 14th, with a listing price of $0.06. CYBRO attained several other milestones during its presale, including: CYBRO app launch: Introducing over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to cater to diverse investment strategies. Blast Index rollout: A one-click investment solution that streamlines DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Platform expansion: Establishing the foundation for a seamless, user-focused DeFi ecosystem. CYBRO is on a mission to democratize DeFi. Its roadmap through 2025 outlines plans for advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-driven tools. CYBRO’s listing coincides with a surge in interest in AI-enabled financial platforms. With its strong presale momentum and a launch price of $0.06, CYBRO is poised to attract attention from both retail and institutional investors. As the platform gears up for its market debut, its approach and rapid growth trajectory position it as a key player to watch. Interested investors can still be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum. You might also like: How this low-cap AI coin could outperform 2024’s top cryptos NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions NEAR Protocol’s price has climbed over 28% in the past month, currently ranging between $6.75 and $7.95. It sits slightly above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, both around $6.95. The Relative Strength Index is above 70, signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD indicates positive momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $8.32, with support at $5.67. If the upward trend continues, NEAR could reach the second resistance at $10.14, marking a significant increase from current prices. However, the high RSI suggests a potential pullback. Traders are watching for a break above resistance or a dip below support to determine the next move. FET nears key resistance FET has been trading between $1.78 and $2.17, showing a 26.98% increase over six months. The price is approaching the nearest resistance at $2.48. The Relative Strength Index is at 66.70, indicating momentum toward overbought levels. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close at $1.85 and $1.83, suggesting consolidation. The MACD level of 0.04 signals mild bullish momentum. If FET breaks above $2.48, it could target the second resistance at $2.97, offering substantial gains. However, if it fails to surpass this level, the price may pull back toward the support at $1.49. Conclusion Amid the ongoing bull run, established tokens like NEAR and FET may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO seeks to provide exceptional opportunities to amplify earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO will deliver a superior user experience featuring effortless deposits and withdrawals. Its strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality sets it apart, drawing significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Stellar (XLM) continues its mission of bridging global financial systems with seamless cross-border payments, while Render (RNDR) is redefining cloud computing with decentralized rendering solutions. Both are making headlines for their innovative approaches to real-world problems. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , a presale phenomenon with over 318 million tokens sold and $5.9M raised. With its cutting-edge non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is solving problems traditional cryptos have struggled with—making everyday payments easy and accessible for everyone. With a projected ROI of 900%, $TICS might just be one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Making Crypto Everyday-Ready Let’s face it—crypto adoption has been clunky. Between complicated wallets, volatile prices, and confusing payment systems, most people find it overwhelming. That’s where Qubetics steps in. Imagine paying for dinner with crypto and having it auto-converted to fiat without lifting a finger . That’s the kind of future Qubetics is building. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet works across iOS, Android, and desktops. Plus, it integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it as simple as tapping your phone. The standout feature? A smart contract conversion mechanism that turns digital assets into fiat currency instantly at the point of sale. This protects users from crypto’s wild price swings while ensuring smooth transactions. Let’s say you’re a freelancer based in Austin, Texas, working with clients in Tokyo and Berlin. With Qubetics, you can accept payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum, and they’re auto-converted into USD in your account—no delays, no stress. Businesses love it too. Imagine an online retailer accepting crypto payments from customers worldwide, with every transaction auto-converted to their local currency. At $0.0311 per token in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is heating up. Weekly price hikes of 10% make this phase especially attractive. With over 9,000 holders and a post-presale price projected at $0.25, early investors could see a 900% ROI. For anyone looking to invest in innovation and practicality, $TICS is leading the pack as one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Financial Gaps Stellar has always been about inclusion. Its mission is to connect global financial systems, making cross-border payments fast, cheap, and accessible. In a world where international transfers can take days and rack up fees, Stellar delivers near-instant transactions for pennies. XLM’s recent updates are bolstering its utility. The network has been expanding partnerships with financial institutions and payment providers, bringing its technology to real-world applications. Its integration with stablecoins like USDC further enhances its appeal, making it easier for businesses and individuals to transact across borders without dealing with volatility. For investors, Stellar is a solid pick. It combines a clear use case with consistent network upgrades, making it a reliable option for long-term growth. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned pro, XLM offers a compelling mix of utility and potential returns. Stellar’s vision of a connected world makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. If you’re looking for a project with real-world impact, XLM deserves a spot in your portfolio.

Two coins currently garnering attention are NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) and Altura ($ALU). While both have their unique strengths, Altura emerges as the clear winner for investors seeking high-growth potential in an AI-driven era. Here’s why. Understanding NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) NEAR Protocol is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed to make decentralized applications (dApps) easy to build and use. Its focus on scalability, simplicity, and user-friendly tools has made it a popular choice for developers.Key Features:- Sharding Technology: NEAR uses a unique sharding approach called ""Nightshade"" to achieve scalability.- Developer-Friendly Tools: With support for languages like Rust and JavaScript, NEAR simplifies the dApp development process.- Eco-Friendly: NEAR operates with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, reducing its carbon footprint.Growth Potential:Despite its technological advancements, NEAR’s market capitalization limits its upside potential. With a current valuation in the multi-billion-dollar range, the coin might offer a 2-3x return in the best-case scenario. This is respectable but falls short compared to smaller-cap gems like Altura. Why Altura ($ALU) is the Superior Investment Altura is revolutionizing the gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors by providing a blockchain-based smart NFT platform. Its lower market cap and growing adoption position it as a coin with unparalleled potential for explosive growth.Key Features:1. Smart NFTs: Altura’s smart NFTs are dynamic, meaning their properties can change based on in-game events or external data, offering unprecedented utility in gaming and beyond.2. AI-Driven Innovations: Altura is integrating AI into its platform to personalize gaming experiences and automate NFT functionalities, making it highly relevant in today’s AI-driven market.3. Developer Ecosystem: Altura empowers game developers with tools to integrate blockchain technology seamlessly, bridging the gap between traditional gaming and Web3.Growth Potential:Altura’s current market cap is significantly smaller than NEAR’s, making it a prime candidate for exponential growth. Realistically, $ALU could achieve an 8-20x return, especially as AI and gaming sectors gain momentum. Market Cap Comparison: Why It Matters Market cap is a crucial factor when evaluating investment potential. Here’s how NEAR and Altura stack up:- NEAR Protocol: With a market cap in the billions, NEAR’s upside is limited by the law of large numbers. Even a 3x increase would place it among the top blockchain platforms, requiring substantial market adoption.- Altura: Altura’s smaller market cap means it has more room to grow. An 8-20x increase would still keep it within a reasonable valuation compared to other projects in the gaming and AI sectors. The AI-Driven Future: Why Altura is Better Positioned Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of industries worldwide, including blockchain. Altura’s proactive integration of AI gives it a competitive edge:- Personalized Experiences: AI-driven customization for gaming ensures users remain engaged.- Scalability: AI algorithms optimize performance, ensuring smooth operations as the platform scales.- Dynamic Growth: The fusion of AI and blockchain opens doors to innovative applications, giving Altura a head start in an untapped market.In contrast, NEAR, while technologically robust, lacks a strong AI narrative, which may limit its appeal as AI adoption grows Conclusion: The Case for Altura ($ALU) NEAR Protocol is a solid investment for conservative growth, but for investors looking for exponential returns, Altura stands out as the superior choice. Its focus on smart NFTs, gaming, and AI-driven innovation aligns perfectly with current market trends. With the potential for 8-20x growth compared to NEAR’s 2-3x, Altura represents a much better risk-to-reward ratio.For those ready to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation, $ALU offers a golden opportunity.

Thanks to Bitcoin’s momentum, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are seeing significant growth. But Cutoshi (CUTO) is promising in this bull run too. Solana Sees More Upward Potential Solana (SOL) is standing to gain from the coming meme coin market boom. Currently, SOL is trading at $211, with a month-to-date rise of 2% SOL seems to be losing momentum. However, with an all-time high upward of $260 this month, SOL could definitely see some gains again. The latest bull run for Solana started after the US elections, as the crypto market started to boom. Notably, investors expect the Trump administration to make some moves for crypto. At the same time, Elon Musk, who won a seat in the new administration, is a known Dogecoin advocate. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and Musk’s meme coin support have the potential to further catalyze the market. In this context, Solana, a DeFi giant and the biggest meme coin platform, stands to gain significantly. For this reason, analysts see SOL at roughly $240 in a month. Fueled by regulatory changes and a potential meme coin surge, Solana is in a strong position to grow further. Avalanche Is Melting Skepticism After a year of decline, Avalanche (AVAX) is finally recovering some of its losses. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $44 , with a modest year-to-date increase of 22%. Still, the token has recently gained momentum. Despite a year of underperformance, traders are turning back to Avalanche, seeing the potential of its technology. The token is specifically designed for dApps and features custom blockchain for specialized use cases, as such, it is attractive to institutional players. For that reason, Ava Labs already secured partnerships with major players such as Amazon and Visa. Still, the road for Avalanche is not easy. The project will have to counter trader skepticism over major token unlocks, which tend to depress the price. Despite this, analysts predict a price target of $56 in a month and $63 in three months for Avax. Solana And Avax Holders Look To Viral Cutoshi With Avax and Solana seeing mixed performance, their traders are diversifying. One of the tokens that recently caught their attention is the viral memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO). Just weeks after the start of its presale, Cutoshi raised over $1 million, gaining viral status on X. Currently, Cutoshi managed to raise over $1.36 million in presale investments. This success shows that traders are interested in its blend of memes and DeFi utility. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. It hopes to use the viral nature of meme coins to bring more people into DeFi, explaining the values of self-custody and decentralization. Its multichain DEX will offer a safer alternative to centralized exchanges while also benefiting users with low fees. At the same time, the project’s learning platform is all about onboarding people that are new to DeFi. With more people entering the crypto market, projects like Cutoshi are key to educating these new users on the benefits of DeFi. They offer a potential for decentralized technology to challenge the dominant centralized exchanges.

For the crypto travel agency, which lately revealed having reached $100 million in annual revenue, this increase marks a turning point. From $0.80 to $30.1, the price of AVA has exploded, courtesy of growing interest in the use of digital currency in the travel industry. Related Reading: Expert Eyes $35 XRP Price, Says Holders To Become ‘Filthy Rich’ Binance Early Investment Binance had already invested in Travala before the pandemic, as disclosed in Zhao’s tweet on December 12. Both investor confidence and Travala’s position as a frontrunner in the space of crypto bookings were bolstered by this statement. At the time of writing, AVA was trading at approximately $2.51, showcasing its remarkable recovery since hitting an all-time low earlier this year. Travala Strategic Initiatives Travala has come up with a new way to handle bank reserves, which includes both AVA and Bitcoin (BTC). This change was made purposefully to strengthen its market position and urge more people to use cryptocurrencies to book travel. According to Juan Otero, CEO and co-founder of Travala, the plan shows their commitment to better customer experiences while keeping their finances strong. We invested in this crypto travel platform pre-COVID, pre-crypto winter, and held on. BUILD! https://t.co/q40IZ4xfM3 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 12, 2024 Travala is changing the way people book travel as it accepts more than 100 cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. The platform allows users to reserve hotels, flights, and activities in 230 countries, offering a wide option for visitors looking to use digital currencies. AVA And Cryptocurrency In Travel The rise in AVA’s price points to a more general trend towards digital currency integration in the travel sector than just temporary change. Platforms like Travala are likely to get rather popular as traditional travel companies become convinced of blockchain technology’s possibilities. The disclosure of their treasury reserves is expected to attract more investors looking for innovative ideas in the crypto field. Related Reading: Solana Welcomes Ethereum Prodigy – Is A Price Surge On The Horizon? Analysts, meantime, envision a great future for AVA. Forecasts indicate that should present trends continue, the altcoin might see significant increase in 2024 and beyond. Through continuous innovations and cooperative efforts with reputable travel agencies, Travala is starting to take front stage in the evolving sector of cryptocurrency travel. The significant increase in Travala’s AVA token after CZ’s endorsement exemplifies the influence of social media and prominent individuals on market dynamics. As Travala persists in innovating and broadening its services, it might potentially usher in a new epoch of travel driven by digital currency.

Here's Why Investors Are Buying These Altcoins Instead,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/will-xrp-reach-3-heres-why-investors-are-buying-these-altcoins-instead,"There is much speculation that Ripple will soon reach the $3 level after its recent rapid appreciation. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks primed for a pump as one of its holders is about to reach the White House, and the promising Rollblock ($RBLK) presale rolls out sports betting as analysts predict incredible 50x returns! Ripple ($XRP) ETF Approval In The Works? Ripple has fallen 1% to $2.44. Many Ripple investors were wiped out by the recent leveraged flush to $2.35, as open interest in the Ripple market reached unsustainable levels. Despite this, Ripple holders found themselves up an astonishing 340% in a month, as this token that many crypto analysts had written off as a “dinosaur” coin rocketed its way up the rankings to become the third-largest crypto asset. Speculation is rife that Ripple will be next in line to receive its own dedicated spot ETF fund as more S-1 applications reached the desk of the SEC recently. This would be incredibly bullish for the Ripple ecosystem, as would the rollout of the imminent RLUSD dollar-backed stablecoin launch on Ripple. Recently, Ripple whales were detected adding over $4.7 billion to their holdings. This could be enough to launch Ripple to $3 in the near term. Avalanche ($AVAX) Counts Future VP As A Fan Avalanche has recovered 9% from 10% loss in the last 24 hours to find support at $52.15. Despite this short-term “buy the dip” opportunity, Avalanche holders are still riding high after adding over 74% to the value of their holdings in just one month. Avalanche recently rolled out the Avalanche9000 upgrade, improving the usability and scaling potential of the Avalanche chain. It was recently revealed that Donald Trump’s choice of vice president, J.D. Vance, is a fan of Avalanche and has been holding the Avalanche token for some time now. This is likely to result in favorable consideration for Avalanche products going forward, ensuring a bright future for U.S.-based Avalanche holders. Rollblock ($RBLK) Delivering On DeFi Gaming Vision Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is well on the way to achieving its goal of bringing decentralized finance to the Las Vegas gaming experience. $RBLK recently reached $0.041 as investors keep on piling in. This DeFi GambleFi upstart delivers on a truly outstanding gaming platform with its promise to bring trust and transparency back to the $450 billion online gambling sector where it belongs. Rollblock offers over 7,000 classic games, from old favorites such as roulette and Monopoly to many brand-new launches such as Candyland.

This surge follows a consistent price rally, with Dogecoin achieving a remarkable 350% increase in value over recent years. The heightened demand for the crypto has raised speculation about its potential to reach the $1 mark. Dogecoin Whales Buy 160M DOGE as Price Eyes $1 Milestone According to a recent post by Ali Martinez , DOGE whales have acquired 160 million DOGE within 24 hours, boosting market sentiment. This influx of large-scale purchases coincides with Dogecoin price maintaining its upward trajectory, reinforcing optimism for further gains. The accumulation by DOGE whales comes at a critical juncture as the cryptocurrency broke through the $0.46 resistance level. Analysts view this development as a key indicator of bullish momentum, with potential price targets set at $0.50 and the previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376. If this trend continues, the Dogecoin price could advance toward the highly anticipated $1 threshold. Source: Ali Martinez MACD and RSI Indicators Highlight Bullish Momentum Technical indicators further support the bullish outlook for Dogecoin price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows signs of recovery, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line, indicating a potential bullish momentum. Additionally, the histogram displays reducing bearish strength, hinting at a possible upward move. Dogecoin’s consolidation around $0.408 suggests buyers are gaining control. Source: TradingView In addition, the RSI for Dogecoin on the 4-hour chart stands at 47.91, showing a neutral trend. The indicator is slightly below the 50 midline, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures. This consolidation phase reflects indecision in the market, with the potential for either a bullish breakout or continued sideways movement Price Pattern Suggests Potential For an 85% Rally Recent technical analysis reveals that Dogecoin price is forming a double-bottom pattern , a bullish signal often indicating a sustained upward trend. This pattern emerges when an asset’s price tests a support level twice before rebounding, creating a “W” shape on the chart. For DOGE, this pattern has solidified around the $0.37 support zone, followed by a surge past $0.46. Such formations signify decreasing selling pressure and increasing buying activity, pointing toward further gains. If the momentum continues, Dogecoin price could see an 85% rally, pushing it past its previous ATH. At press time, DOGE price was $0.4089, up 0.77% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $60.18 billion. Its 24-hour trading volume stands at $3.79 billion, down 30.05%.

It supports decentralized applications and offers an alternative to platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions by using a unique architecture to quickly process thousands of transactions. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running programs, and rewarding network participants. The SOL coin supports a range of projects on Solana, and its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on factors like market trends and adoption by developers and users. Avalanche Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and rapid transactions, capable of processing 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable subnets and employs a hybrid consensus mechanism, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. Avalanche consists of three interoperable chains that facilitate various operations, including transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, is crucial for settling transaction costs, network security, and operating subnets. With its strong utility, AVAX holds significant potential.

Bloodbath on Monday and Tuesday brought market chaos, and as we approach the final weekend before the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, all eyes are on the macro stage. Earlier this week, the European Central Bank cut rates, and the U.S. is widely expected to follow with a 0.25% reduction. According to the CME Group, the likelihood of this cut is a staggering 93.4%. source : https://www.cmegroup.com/ For crypto, rate cuts should be bullish—but, as always, ""should"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. In this weekend review, we’ll focus on three different projects:= $ HBAR (ranked 18, mcap: $11.85B), a blockchain favorite of institutions, as it seems &navigating critical support levels atm. $ PEPE (ranked 21, mcap: $10.34B): the leading large-cap memecoin defying market turbulence. $ TITS (ranked 3036, mcap: $128 million): the degen’s ultimate thrill ride, now at a pivotal chart juncture. Let’s dive into the charts and see where the opportunities lie. HBAR: Testing Its Limits—Critical Levels and Next Moves Hedera’s (HBAR) performance this year has been nothing short of impressive, with a 600% rally from its lows to a yearly high of $0.392. However, after hitting an overheated RSI of 88 (weekly) and 93 (4-hour), a 40% correction has brought HBAR to a defining moment. Key Levels and Scenarios Support at $0.228 (Golden Pocket) Why It Matters: This Fibonacci retracement zone (61.8%-65%) aligns with historical volume support, offering a high-probability bounce area in bullish trends. Strategy: Enter long only if confirmed by rising volume and a bullish close above this level. Set stop-loss below $0.206. Resistance at $0.33 Why It Matters: Former double bottom breakout target, now flipped into a major resistance zone. Strategy: Look for volume-backed breakout above $0.33 to target $0.40+. Use a trailing stop to secure gains. Structural Safety at $0.185 Why It Matters: This is the last support for HBAR’s broader bullish trend. Strategy: Consider long-term accumulation if prices return here. Moving Averages in Focus (4H Chart) 50 MA ($0.307): Immediate resistance for short-term momentum. 100 MA ($0.267): Now a flipped resistance after the recent breakdown. 200 MA ($0.187): Long-term structural support (also Fib 0.786); losing this could indicate a broader trend shift. Conclusion HBAR is at a crossroads. $0.228 remains the must-hold support long-term, while $0.33 is the next breakout level to watch. Follow volume, respect levels, and let the chart guide your moves. PEPE: The Strongest Frog in the Pond The memecoin juggernaut PEPE is on a roll, recently hitting an all-time high of $0.00000284. Unlike $DOGE , which is struggling to overcome $0.50 resistance (well, even 42c atm), PEPE has shown resilience, cementing its place as the current leader in the memecoin sector. Key Levels and Scenarios Support Zones $0.0000215 (50 MA): Holding this dynamic support keeps the short-term bullish structure intact. $0.0000157–$0.0000177 (Golden Pocket): Strongest structural support, reinforced by a 4-hour Fair Value Gap (FVG). Resistance Zones $0.00000284 (ATH): Breaking this level opens the door to the bullish pennant target of $0.00000410. What PEPE Needs Volume Surge: A breakout above $0.00000284 must come with a volume spike to confirm momentum. DOGE Revival: DOGE breaking $0.50 could trigger a broader memecoin rally, lifting PEPE higher. Conclusion PEPE has the momentum, but it needs DOGE to join the party. Watch for a breakout above $0.00000284 with volume confirmation—this could push PEPE to uncharted waters. $TITS: From Drama to Potential Comeback Few memecoins live up to the drama of $TITS, which tumbled from its rising wedge only to form a bullish falling wedge. This setup has the potential to flip the narrative entirely, with a breakout signaling a rally to 32 cents or beyond (currently around 12.5c). The Fundamentals (Yes, There Are Some) Fully Circulating Supply: 999.93M tokens, eliminating fears of sudden unlocks. Community Power: Entirely driven by hype and memes, $TITS relies on its ability to keep buzz alive. Why It’s an utmost Gamble: Rug Pull Risks: Without fundamentals, the project lives and dies by momentum. Thin Volume: With just $2.37M daily trading volume, whales can easily cause chaos. Actionable Play Watch for a falling wedge breakout. If confirmed, 15 cents is the immediate target. Failure, however, could send prices back to 2 cents in no time. Conclusion $TITS is pure speculation, but the wedge breakout could deliver outsized gains for degenswilling to take the risk. Final Thoughts The crypto market is teetering on the edge of opportunity and risk as macroeconomic pressures loom. A Fed rate cut might be bullish for digital assets, but markets are rarely that simple. Liquidity remains fragile, institutional interest is cautious, and retail enthusiasm, while improving, is nowhere near 2021’s peak. For HBAR, the key is whether the Golden Pocket holds at $0.228. This level represents a crucial line in the sand for its bullish structure. For PEPE, it’s a battle of momentum versus macro. Can it maintain strength while DOGE, its sector heavyweight, continues to flounder? And for $TITS, it’s a high-stakes gamble that’s as much about timing as it is about conviction. This weekend, play with discipline: Watch the volume: Momentum needs fuel, and low participation spells traps. Respect your stops: The market doesn’t care about your hopes or your account size. Stay realistic: A rally in one coin doesn’t mean the entire market will follow. The golden rule remains: plan your trade and trade your plan. FOMO is the quickest route to tears, while patience is a trader’s best weapon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37612933,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52066,1734141605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Crypto Predictions: Dogecoin Price To Reach $10, Shiba Inu Price At $1, And ETFSwap (ETFS) Price At $22",https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-predictions-dogecoin-price-to-reach-10-shiba-inu/,"A top crypto analyst has made bold predictions confirming significant price movements for particular cryptocurrencies. According to the top crypto analyst, the Dogecoin price is projected to surge to $10, and the Shiba Inu price to $1. While this top crypto analyst predicts these bold targets for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, he also predicts a $22 target for the trending Ethereum-based project ETFSwap (ETFS), which was recently listed on Uniswap . Why You Should Invest In ETFSwap (ETFS) First According to the top crypto analyst, ETFSwap (ETFS) is predicted to surge to $22 and possibly outperform the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price, even with their impressive prospects. The top crypto analysts attribute this anticipated surge of ETFSwap (ETFS) to its recent listing on Uniswap and its groundbreaking platform, which has ties to the trillion-dollar ETF market. For context, the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform is an innovative platform designed to enable the trade of tokenized ETFs backed by actual ETF securities on-chain. As the first decentralized ETF platform, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides investors with unique advantages like 24/7 accessibility and quick conversions of ETFs, Bonds, and Futures into cryptocurrencies. With no direct competition in this market segment, ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to lead the growth of tokenized real-world assets by 2025. The platform’s launch on Uniswap coincides with what could be a significant bull run, as the platform is further expected to flourish through robust partnerships with MiCa-compliant banks that engage in trading both securities and cryptocurrencies. In addition to its ETF offerings, ETFSwap (ETFS) will provide extensive trading services for cryptocurrencies, enabling users to leverage market-making expertise and profit margins up to 10x to maximize profits. Interestingly, the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has successfully completed the KYC audit using SolidProof . The ETFS token has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , so users can now track the live price. This is a unique opportunity to buy the ETFS token while it is still affordable on Uniswap before it surges to the $22 mark. Moreover, when investors buy the ETFS token, they get the opportunity to earn an 87% APY from its staking pool. They are also entitled to AI-powered trading tools like the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which analyze several market data points and recommend the best ETFs. With these interesting features and so many incentives, ETFSwap is bound to enjoy massive traction that will potentially send its price to $22 before the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Dogecoin Price Future Outlook The Dogecoin price has been consolidating after a significant surge in November. The Dogecoin price surged by over 160% in the past month, only just recently slowing down. Although currently experiencing a downturn, some analysts anticipate a significant rally for the Dogecoin price. Some analysts are projecting that it could surge by 2,272% to reach $10 in 2025 if historical trends hold. Renowned analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin’s historical performance could serve as a guide for its future trajectory. According to his analysis, if Dogecoin follows its historical trajectory, the Dogecoin price can break past the $10 mark. Can The Shiba Inu Price Touch $1? The Shiba Inu price is currently trading at approximately $0.000025, generating significant buzz within the crypto community. The excitement stems from Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution that has contributed to a remarkable 40% increase in the Shiba Inu price over the past month. Analysts think the Shiba Inu price will keep going up, predicting a target of $0.000041 to $0.000049 by 2025. Even though these numbers show that things are getting better, reaching a $1 price is virtually impossible. According to analysts, it would require a market cap of around $589 trillion – many times larger than the global economy and Bitcoin’s current market cap. Conclusion While the Shiba Inu price and Dogecoin price are predicted to hit $1 and $10, respectively, achieving these targets may be unrealistic. Reaching such prices would require their market caps to scale into the trillions, far exceeding the current market and economic conditions. ETFSwap (ETFS) , however, presents a genuine opportunity. Its innovative ETF platform and recent Uniswap listing have positioned it for significant growth. With major exchange listings expected soon, top crypto analysts predict the ETFS token could soar to $22. So, join the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform now when the token is at an attractive price.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 02:02:05

Expert Insights",https://coinpedia.org/news/xlm-price-prediction-could-stellar-hit-2-expert-insights/,"The post XLM Price Prediction, Could Stellar Hit $2? Expert Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XLM, Stellar’s native token, is poised for notable upside momentum, as predicted by a crypto expert in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). On December 13, 2024, the expert boldly predicted that XLM could reach $2, representing nearly a 350% increase in value. Expert Predicts XLM to Surge 350% to $2 However, experts believe the recent sharp price decline is just a temporary setback on the path toward XLM reaching $2. Current Price Momentum The past few days haven’t been favorable for XLM, as it hasn’t experienced any significant price changes. However, today the token saw an impressive price surge of over 5% in the past 24 hours. With this, the XLM price has now risen to the $0.437 level. Despite the price increase, its trading volume dropped by 13% during the same period, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Data also shows that over the past 7 days, the asset is still down by 13%. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level In addition to this prediction and recent price performance, CoinPedia’s technical analysis suggests that XLM is demonstrating bullish price action on its daily timeframe. According to the XLM daily chart, it appears that the asset is forming a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and is currently consolidating near the breakout level. Source: Trading View Based on price action, if XLM breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.47 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially rise by 32% to reach the $0.63 level. Furthermore, based on the pattern, XLM could potentially surge by 537% to reach the $3.04 level in the future. On the positive side, XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has sufficient room to rise in the coming days. $118 Million of XLM Outflow from Exchanges This bullish technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, XLM’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of XLM in recent days. Over the past 10 trading days, exchanges have witnessed a substantial $117.80 million worth of XLM outflow. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency landscape, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which signals bullish sentiment for the asset.

If you weren’t among the lucky few riding the Brett wave, here’s your shot at redemption. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the best meme coin presale of the year, raising over $3.7 million in record time and captivating the crypto world. With its presale currently in its 12th stage and a stellar combination of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and community-driven initiatives, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight. Boasting an irresistible entry price of $0.00013, the coin is poised to list at $0.0006 after the presale. Early buyers are snapping up over 53 billion coins, with more than 5,000 Bulls already on board. And it’s no surprise—BTFD doesn’t just ride the meme coin frenzy; it’s creating a revolution. Brett (BRETT): A Tale of FOMO and Fortunes Launched in early 2024, Brett (BRETT) skyrocketed to fame as one of the most promising meme coins of the year. With an all-time high of $0.2342, Brett transformed countless early adopters into overnight millionaires. However, its price of $0.1749 today tells a story of missed chances for those who hesitated. What made Brett so popular? Its seamless integration into the Base Chain ecosystem, unique branding, and early listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase propelled it to stardom. Yet, like many meme coins, Brett wasn’t without its hiccups. Concerns over insider supply and market corrections made headlines, reminding us how volatile and rewarding this sector can be. But here’s the kicker—history is repeating itself, and this time, it’s wearing BTFD Coin’s bull horns. If you missed out on Brett’s meteoric rise, you don’t have to be on the sidelines anymore.

Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, that $1,000 could become a whopping $4,615—a 361% return on investment. And it’s not just about returns. BTFD Coin offers unparalleled accessibility: 1 Ethereum buys 30,113,000 BTFD coins 1 Solana buys 1,739,846 BTFD coins 1 Bitcoin buys 769,053,846 BTFD coins Staking and Play-to-Earn Excitement The P2E game’s beta is now live, featuring the iconic Bulls Squad.

That’s just icing on the cake. Referral Programme: Double the Fun, Double the Gains BTFD Coin’s referral programme is a game-changer, rewarding not just buyers but community builders. Here’s how it works: Connect your wallet on the presale page to receive a unique referral code. Share your code, and anyone using it to buy over $50 gets 10% extra BTFD coins. The top 20 referrers earn 10% of all purchases made through their code—paid directly in BTFD tokens . With over 5,000 holders already on board, this programme is an excellent way to amplify your earnings while promoting the coin.

The AI-driven model has forecasted that SHIB could climb approximately 21.9% to $0.000035 by Christmas Day. This projection has stirred excitement among SHIB enthusiasts, especially as the token currently trades at $0.00002869, marking a slight 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT’s Christmas Price Prediction for SHIB When asked about SHIB’s potential during the festive period, ChatGPT shared its bullish outlook: “Given current market dynamics, SHIB has the potential to climb to $0.000035 by December 25. This estimate reflects a 21.9% increase from its current price, buoyed by ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.” This optimistic projection aligns with the holiday spirit, as the Shiba Inu team rolls out strategic initiatives to bolster the token’s utility and user engagement. Holiday Cheer from the Shiba Inu Team One of the primary factors underpinning ChatGPT’s prediction is the Shiba Inu development team’s latest collaboration with K9 Finance . Together, they have announced a reward initiative aimed at increasing participation in Shibarium’s liquid staking feature. This program, timed strategically for the holiday season, seeks to incentivize first-time users, thereby driving more engagement and transaction volume within the ecosystem. The initiative underscores the team’s commitment to expanding the Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain, a crucial element of Shiba Inu’s roadmap. By offering financial rewards for staking, the team aims to attract retail and institutional participants, further strengthening SHIB’s position as a multi-functional asset rather than just a meme coin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Factors Supporting SHIB’s Rise Growing Ecosystem: Shibarium continues to gain traction as developers integrate more decentralized applications (dApps) and enhance its functionality. The staking reward initiative could accelerate this adoption, creating a positive feedback loop for SHIB’s utility and value. Holiday Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies often see heightened trading activity during the holiday season, as retail investors look to capitalize on end-of-year market trends. This seasonal bullishness could provide additional momentum for SHIB. Broader Market Recovery: With Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing positive price movements, the overall crypto market sentiment appears to be shifting towards optimism. Altcoins like SHIB typically benefit from such trends, as investors diversify into smaller-cap assets with high growth potential. ChatGPT’s 21.9% SHIB rally prediction is not just wishful thinking but backed by tangible developments and market sentiment. The Shiba Inu team’s focus on innovation and the holiday-themed incentive program, positions SHIB for a potential breakout.

The analyst has grounded his bullish projection on Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands (BB), highlighting that these indicators are expanding while BTC displays a similar price action observed in 2023. BTC Price Targets $120,000 ATH On December 12, Severino shared a chart demonstrating a technical analysis of Bitcoin using the Bollinger Bands and a historical correlation of late 2023 price behavior. The analyst predicted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could reach a $120,000 all-time high by next week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green Severino disclosed that Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands are expanding, while its current price action reflects a similar bullish trend observed in 2023. Looking at the analyst’s 2024 price chart, Bitcoin’s upper and lower Bollinger Bands are represented by a respective red and green trend line. Typically, an expanding Bollinger Band indicates increasing price volatility. Bitcoin could start a bullish trend if it breaks above the upper band or enter a bearish phase if it drops below the lower band. Bitcoin has also tested the lower Bollinger Band at $92,560 and is now steadily approaching the upper band at $102,323. Additionally, the analyst has placed Bitcoin’s Bollinger Band basis at $97,442. Severino observed that the Bitcoin price chart on the right shows a historical instance in late 2023 when BTC broke above the upper Bollinger band and followed with a substantial price rally as it walked the bands higher. This historical trend is currently being replicated in Bitcoin’s 2024 price setup, indicating a potential for a significant upward price movement if similar conditions seen in 2023 are met. If Bitcoin’s price closes above the upper Bollinger Band with a buy signal, it could spark a rally toward $120,000. Currently trading at $100,219, Bitcoin would need to increase by 20% to reach the analyst’s projected target by next week. Analyst Confirms Bitcoin Bollinger Band Bullish Signal Also commenting on Bitcoin’s recent price action, Trader Tardigrade, an analyst on X, revealed that BTC’s Bollinger Bands and Bollinger Band Width (BBW) are signaling the potential for a strong uptrend continuation. Sharing a price chart, the analyst noted that Bitcoin previously dipped to the middle of the band but quickly recovered, underscoring the supportive nature of the mid-band. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything Trader Tardigrade has revealed that Bitcoin’s BBW has hit a lower contraction, while its recent price movements resemble those of early November, just before its price skyrocketed from $70,000 to $100,000. If Bitcoin’s price maintains its current bullish trend, the analyst predicts a surge that could drive the cryptocurrency to a new all-time high at $136,000. This substantial price increase would represent a massive 36% rally from Bitcoin’s current price.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 03:25:00

At one end of the spectrum is Bonk, a meme-inspired coin that thrives on community engagement and viral momentum. On the other side stands Lightchain AI ($LCAI) , a revolutionary token that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to address real-world challenges. Don’t miss out on the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this groundbreaking project. In this article, we’ll compare Bonk and Lightchain AI, examining their core features, unique value propositions, and potential in the constantly evolving crypto market. Discover how meme coins measure up against innovation-driven tokens in today’s competitive landscape. Bonk: A Meme Coin with Community Appeal Bonk burst onto the scene as a dog-themed cryptocurrency designed to capture the attention of meme enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk leans heavily on its community for growth and adoption. Key Features of Bonk: Community-Driven Growth: Bonk’s strength lies in its loyal community, which drives engagement through social media campaigns, memes, and word-of-mouth. Low Entry Barrier: Like many meme coins, Bonk’s low price and minimal technical requirements make it accessible to novice investors. Entertainment and Virality: Bonk’s lighthearted branding and focus on fun have helped it carve a niche in the meme coin space. Challenges: Lack of Utility: Bonk’s value is largely speculative, with little real-world application to sustain long-term growth. High Volatility: Meme coins like Bonk are subject to rapid price fluctuations driven by social sentiment rather than intrinsic value. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence In stark contrast to Bonk, Lightchain AI is a tech-driven token that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver real-world solutions. Its focus on innovation and utility sets it apart in a market often crowded with speculative projects. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s unique consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization. This creates a system where network security directly contributes to advancements in AI. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM serves as a dedicated computational layer for executing AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. From predictive analytics to real-time decision-making, AIVM expands the scope of decentralized applications (dApps). Real-World Applications: Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance by integrating blockchain transparency with AI’s computational power. Eco-Friendly Design: By prioritizing meaningful computations, Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism reduces energy consumption compared to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Decentralized Governance: $LCAI token holders actively shape the ecosystem’s future, ensuring transparency and community-driven innovation. Comparing Bonk and Lightchain AI 1. Utility: Bonk: Bonk’s primary utility lies in its role as a meme coin. Its appeal is more about entertainment and community engagement than solving real-world problems. Lightchain AI: $LCAI stands out for its tangible utility, addressing real-world challenges through AI-driven solutions and decentralized technology. 2. Technology: Bonk: Bonk operates on a basic blockchain infrastructure with no unique technological innovations. Lightchain AI: Lightchain AI’s PoI and AIVM represent cutting-edge advancements in blockchain and AI integration, positioning it as a leader in decentralized intelligence. 3. Market Potential: Bonk: While Bonk’s virality can lead to short-term gains, its long-term sustainability is questionable without a clear use case. Lightchain AI: With applications in high-demand industries and a focus on sustainability, Lightchain AI has significant growth potential and long-term viability. 4. Investor Appeal: Bonk: Bonk appeals to risk-tolerant investors looking for quick, speculative gains. Lightchain AI: $LCAI attracts investors seeking innovation, utility, and long-term value. Real-World Applications: Bonk vs. Lightchain AI Bonk’s Applications: Community Engagement: Bonk’s primary application is fostering a sense of community and entertainment through memes and social campaigns. Lightchain AI’s Applications: Healthcare: AI-driven diagnostics and predictive modeling transform patient care, making processes more efficient and accurate. Supply Chain: Blockchain transparency combined with AI-powered insights ensures efficient inventory management and logistics. Finance: Smarter risk assessment, fraud detection, and DeFi applications are enabled by $LCAI’s technology. Risks and Challenges Bonk: Volatility: Like other meme coins, Bonk’s value is highly volatile and susceptible to market sentiment. Sustainability: Without a clear use case, Bonk’s long-term viability remains uncertain. Lightchain AI: Market Awareness: Educating industries and investors about $LCAI’s value proposition is critical for adoption. Competition: As blockchain and AI integration gains traction, Lightchain AI must stay ahead through continuous innovation. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out While meme coins like Bonk have their place in the crypto world, Lightchain AI’s focus on solving real-world problems gives it a distinct advantage. Its unique features—such as PoI, AIVM, and real-world applications—make it a compelling choice for investors and enterprises alike. Final Thoughts Bonk and Lightchain AI represent two vastly different approaches to cryptocurrency. Bonk thrives on community engagement and meme culture, offering short-term excitement and speculative opportunities. In contrast, Lightchain AI focuses on innovation, utility, and long-term value, addressing real-world challenges with cutting-edge technology. For investors seeking sustainable growth and meaningful contributions to the blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI emerges as the clear choice. While Bonk’s appeal lies in its entertainment value, $LCAI offers a vision of blockchain’s future—one that combines transparency, scalability, and the transformative power of artificial intelligence.

33767162,[object Object],1734147055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Gains More Buying Power With Bullish Crossover On MACD, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-crossover-macd/,"Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has provided an update on Dogecoin’s current price action. The analyst revealed that the meme coin has signaled a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) and suggested where the DOGE price is headed next. Dogecoin Flashes Bullish Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade revealed that Dogecoin’s MACD has signaled a bullish crossover and that the price structure is showing multiple higher lows along a recent rebound. The analyst noted that these indicate that DOGE has gained more buying power and may have completed the pullback. Based on his analysis, the Dogecoin price looks well-primed to witness a bullish reversal, having consolidated for almost a month since the first phase of its bull run. Trader Tardigrade’s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally to around $0.5 on the next leg of its bull run . The crypto analyst had recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could hit double digits in this market cycle, as it looked to be replicating the two sub-cycles from the 2017 bull run. The first sub-cycle looks to have been the parabolic rally that Dogecoin recorded between October and early November. The crypto analyst suggested that DOGE could reach as high as $30 when the second sub-cycle occurs. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Master Kenobi suggested that the next leg up for the Dogecoin price could begin around December 30. He stated that the foremost meme coin would likely experience red weeks between now and then. Master Kenobi suggested that these price declines were necessary. Meanwhile, he predicted that Dogecoin could either hit a new all-time high (ATH) by December 30 or next month as Donald Trump takes office. DOGE’s Fate Is In Bitcoin’s Hands In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that Dogecoin is not in control of itself and that its fate lies purely in Bitcoin’s hands. As such, he believes that overly focusing on DOGE’s price action might be a waste of time. However, the analyst provided some insights into DOGE’s current price action. He stated that Dogecoin is currently trading between the macro golden pocket and the macro .5 Fibonacci level. Kevin further revealed that these are two major areas of support and resistance, and a break of either will cause a “cascading effect of aggressive movement.” Meanwhile, the crypto analyst is confident that the DOGE bull run is still ongoing. He stated that nothing shows the cycle is over. Therefore, he expects the Dogecoin price to rally higher sooner or later. In the meantime, he advised market participants to do nothing else but wait for the DOGE bull run to continue. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Crypto News|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-14 03:30:55

This perspective, initially shared by market analyst Digital G, comes amid turbulent market conditions that have significantly impacted the cryptocurrency space. Market Challenges The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a sharp downturn, wiping out over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions across nearly 584,000 traders. XRP was among the hardest-hit assets, particularly on Coinbase, where it suffered one of the steepest selloffs. The altcoin’s value declined by 14.87% on Monday, closing near the $2 price level. Despite these setbacks, the asset has demonstrated resilience, maintaining investor interest and optimism. This resilience is a key factor behind the confidence in the token’s long-term potential. Digital G, a former regulated fund manager in the U.K., recently highlighted XRP’s potential as an unparalleled opportunity for investors seeking to build generational wealth. He identified the token alongside Stellar (XLM) and XDC Network (XDC) as cryptocurrencies with significant potential for future growth. Linda P. Jones, a Wall Street analyst and author, has strongly supported XRP and XLM’s wealth-building potential. Jones, known for her expertise in wealth management, emphasized this view in her book, 3 Steps to Quantum Wealth . According to Jones, these digital assets offer life-changing returns on investments and could transform the financial landscape. I agree with this statement so much, I wrote a book about them and the life changing wealth building opportunity. #xrp #xlm #xdc https://t.co/yuULOtvc2B — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 9, 2024 Addressing Real-World Financial Challenges The appeal of XRP, XLM, and XDC lies in their ability to address critical challenges in the global financial system. These cryptocurrencies focus on improving cross-border payments and enabling efficient, low-cost, and scalable financial transactions. Partnerships with banks, governments, and financial institutions further strengthen their ecosystems, highlighting their real-world applicability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While these tokens faced underwhelming performance in previous years, recent developments and market activity have reignited interest. XRP, for instance, has seen a remarkable 303% increase since November. Similarly, XLM has surged by 448%, and XDC has recorded a 175% rise during the same period. Expert Price Predictions The impressive performance of these assets has led to optimistic forecasts from market analysts. EGRAG, a well-known analyst, recently compared the token’s price movement to Tesla’s 2018 growth pattern, suggesting a potential 50% decline before a significant rally of over 3,500%, potentially driving its price beyond $40. Other projections include a bullish outlook for XLM, with analyst, Charting Guy, identifying a pattern that could lead to a price target of $5. Meanwhile, Javon Marks has set a breakout target of $0.1814 for XDC based on its technical charting structure. The digital asset’s resilience and potential, alongside similar assets like XLM and XDC, continue to attract attention from financial experts and investors alike. As these tokens grow to solve real-world financial challenges, they are positioned to deliver significant long-term value. These developments make XRP, in particular, a great investment option for those seeking transformative wealth-building opportunities.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/10-trillion-shib-in-24-hours-heres-what-happened/,"Recent data reveals that over 10 trillion Shiba Inu tokens were transacted within 24 hours, primarily driven by whale activity. While the figure appears substantial, it falls short of historical transaction volumes during SHIB’s peak growth phases. This raises questions about the current state of the asset’s market momentum and its prospects for recovery or growth. Comparing Current Volumes to Historical Peaks In previous bullish cycles, Shiba Inu saw transaction volumes significantly surpassing 18 trillion tokens, particularly during rapid price increases. Such heightened activity often indicated strong interest from large holders and a robust market trend. By contrast, transaction volumes during bearish periods tended to dip below 10 trillion tokens, reflecting reduced enthusiasm and lower market engagement. The current figure of 10 trillion tokens places the asset above bearish thresholds but still far from the volume levels that typically signal a strong bullish trend. This subdued activity indicates that the market is neither experiencing significant accumulation nor facing aggressive selling pressure. Price and Support Analysis Chart data shows SHIB hovering near a key support level, with its recent rebound from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) providing a sign of attempted recovery. However, the current transaction volumes do not align with the levels of market participation needed to sustain a prolonged uptrend. This disparity between price action and trading activity suggests limited momentum, leaving the asset in a state of consolidation. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity According to analytics from IntoTheBlock , high transaction volumes are often a precursor to notable market movements, reflecting heightened activity from major stakeholders. However, the present volume does not display the clear patterns of accumulation or distribution that typically precede significant price swings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This moderate activity indicates that the token may be at a critical juncture. A sharp increase in transaction volumes, particularly from whales, would be required to generate the momentum necessary for a bullish breakout. Until such a catalyst emerges, the token will remain in a consolidation phase. Although 10 trillion SHIB tokens were exchanged in a single day, this figure lacks the significance to signal a decisive market shift. The transaction volumes remain well below historical peaks, reflecting a lack of strong bullish sentiment. For SHIB to regain its former upward trajectory, renewed interest, and significantly higher trading volumes will be essential. Until then, market participants may need to exercise patience as the asset waits for a more definitive catalyst to drive its next major move.

37616938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52113,1734149729,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin vs. Gold: Which One Is the Better Choice in 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-vs-gold-which-one-is-the-better-choice-in-2025/,"In this decade, Bitcoin outperformed gold-the prior reigning champion of safe-haven investments. Where gold was conventionally used to hedge against economic downturns, Bitcoin has had such an incredible run that it attracted both retail and institutional investors into its fold. At the same time, some critics labeled Bitcoin a speculative bubble. Still, the constant growth and ever-growing utility told a different story. Perform secure and fast transactions of BTC to USDT via the well-known cryptocurrency exchange platform, Exolix. Why Bitcoin is Better than Gold 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity While it creates a deflationary asset with its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin provides some degree of predictability in supply and a store of value. In contrast to gold, which can be mined, or fiat currencies, which are printed and affected by inflation, the supply of Bitcoin is hardcoded. Thus, scarcity in itself fosters demand; investors popularly regard it as “digital gold” for the modern age. 2. Institutional Adoption and Credibility Large companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets to illustrate digital currency’s role as a store of value. Further, giants in payments like Visa and PayPal have onboarded Bitcoin into their systems, making it more mainstream at large. Unlike other bubbles, Bitcoin developed some legitimacy as a financial asset because it was being taken up in more and more industries. Increased institutional interest has led to stronger market infrastructure that provides greater long-term stability for reduced volatility. 3. Hedge Against Inflation With governments printing trillions of dollars to curb economic crises, fears of inflation have rocketed. Bitcoin emerged as a hedge, but with a difference from gold: it is digital and borderless, thus even more versatile in a borderless economy. Investors seeking protection from the devaluation of fiat currencies have sought shelter in Bitcoin as a safe alternative increasingly. 4. Global Accessibility and Liquidity By design, Bitcoin is decentralized, and thus it can be accessed and sent essentially anywhere in the world without any of the constraints of physicality. Unlike gold, which is expensive to store and transfer, Bitcoin has unparalleled efficiency in terms of liquidity. Its borderless nature facilitates instant transactions. That makes it a plausible option for storing and sending wealth. So Why Is Bitcoin Not a Bubble? 1. Expanding Infrastructure Unlike other traditional bubbles, the value of Bitcoin is underpinned by an ever-growing ecosystem. Blockchain technology allows for secure, decentralized transactions; and platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken make access to buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin very easy. This growing infrastructure helps Bitcoin fulfill both roles of store of value and medium of exchange and thus secures its viability in the long term. 2. Real-World Use Cases But Bitcoin is much more than a speculative asset, with actual use cases in the real world. From cross-border payments to remittances, Bitcoin has become a lifeline for countries like Venezuela and Argentina facing hyperinflation or economic instability. In that aspect, the capability to shelter one’s wealth and transact is a distinguishing feature from other classic speculative bubbles. 3. Market Maturity In the last few years, the Bitcoin market has matured with increased institutional involvement and the development of financial instruments such as Bitcoin futures and ETFs. This has contributed to decreased volatility and a more diverse investor base. Unlike early speculative periods driven by retail hype, today’s market is supported by structured financial products and a mature investor base. 4. Regulatory Progress The governments of the day are working to develop regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies. Although varied by region, regulation, of a sort, means growing acceptance and a path to legitimacy for Bitcoin. Clearer rules also reduce fraud risk and encourage institutional participation, further stabilizing the market. Bitcoin’s in a Changing Financial Industry The utility of Bitcoin extends beyond being a speculative asset. It has proven to be a strong tool for financial inclusion, opening up global markets to underserved citizens of the world. Its decentralized nature rhymes with the growing demand for financial systems free from traditional gatekeepers. Therefore, for those who want to double their Bitcoin or move towards more stable currencies such as USDT, tools like BTC to USDT at Exolix offer secure, as well as efficient, means toward your goals. Bitcoin as a Transformative Asset Bitcoin’s rise to outperform gold underlines its transformation into a leading financial asset. With its capped supply, institutional support, hedging against inflation, and global accessibility, Bitcoin is anything but a speculative bubble. It represents a paradigm shift in how value is stored and transferred in a digital age. As the infrastructure for Bitcoin expands and adoption continues to grow, it is positioned to be a cornerstone in the financial landscape for years to come. For secure and seamless Bitcoin transactions, turn to trusted platforms like Exolix for BTC to USDT swaps and other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Whether you are an experienced trader or a newcomer to the space, identifying the best coins to buy and hold for the short term requires careful research and analysis. In this article, we will examine four standout options that present potential for quick gains: Qubetics ($TICS) , Arweave, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA), and Ondo. Each of these projects offers unique features and promising growth trajectories, positioning them as key contenders in the current market. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Leading the Web3 Revolution Qubetics has positioned itself as a transformative force in the blockchain world. With its 12th-stage presale already amassing over $5.9 million and more than 318 million tokens sold, Qubetics is rewriting the rules of crypto adoption. At just $0.0311 per token, the current price offers a golden opportunity for investors aiming for substantial short-term returns. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a stunning 703.21% ROI, with long-term prospects soaring even higher. What makes Qubetics a standout is its innovative multichain wallet . Picture this: a tech startup in New York is juggling assets across multiple blockchains. With Qubetics, they can seamlessly manage everything from one interface, saving time and reducing operational headaches. For individuals, the wallet offers unparalleled ease of use—whether you’re trading on the go or securing your assets with advanced encryption. Let’s crunch the numbers. A $8,500 investment at $0.0311 gets you 273,922 tokens. If $TICS hits $0.25, your investment skyrockets to $68,480. That’s the kind of short-term gain that’s hard to ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? With its visionary approach, robust ROI predictions, and practical tools like the multichain wallet, Qubetics is undeniably one of the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 2. Arweave: The Perpetual Storage Pioneer Arweave stands out in the blockchain space with its unique focus on decentralised permanent storage. At a time when data security and immutability are critical, Arweave’s “permaweb” technology offers a revolutionary solution. This project is particularly attractive for content creators, businesses, and institutions seeking to store data forever without recurring fees. Currently trading under $10, Arweave’s AR token has been tipped by analysts to rally to $25 in the coming months, driven by increased adoption and strategic partnerships. Its seamless integration with blockchains like Solana further boosts its credibility and utility. Why did this coin make it to this list?

It offers opportunities for both conservative and risk-loving investors, making it an accessible gateway into DeFi. Ondo’s products include fixed-income instruments, which appeal to those seeking stability in the often volatile crypto market.

Bitcoin Open Interest & Leverage Ratio Have Shot Up As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has registered a sharp increase alongside the asset’s return above the $100,000 level. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Above $100,000 As Monthly Inflows Hit $80 Billion Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past month: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a sharp positive change recently, which implies a large number of positions have popped up on the market. In the chart, Maartunn has highlighted the previous instances of the indicator observing a large percentage increase. It would appear that the price generally saw a cooldown when this pattern formed during the past month. As for the reason behind this trend, the answer is that more positions usually imply the presence of a higher amount of leverage in the sector. A chaotic event known as a squeeze can become more likely to occur in these circumstances. During a squeeze, a large number of positions are liquidated at once and provide fuel to the price move that caused them. The elongated price move then unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. A squeeze can be more probable to affect the side of the market that has the more leveraged positions. The previous increases in the Open Interest came alongside uptrends, so the new positions were likely long ones. This may be why the market ended up seeing a long squeeze to wipe out these excess positions. It’s possible that the latest Open Interest increase could also lead to a similar outcome for Bitcoin, since these fresh positions have also come alongside a rally. It all depends, however, on whether these positions are overleveraged or not. Unfortunately for the cryptocurrency, this requirement also seems to be fulfilled, as data for the Estimated Leverage Ratio shared by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post suggests. The Estimated Leverage Ratio tells us, as its name implies, the average amount of leverage that the users on the derivatives market are opting for. Given that this metric has also spiked alongside the Open Interest increase, the new positions that have appeared could be carrying significant leverage.

The cryptocurrency has recently experienced remarkable growth, setting the stage for a bullish outlook. In November 2024, the token surged by 283%, its most significant monthly increase in seven years. The positive momentum has continued into December, with a 26.4% gain recorded in the first 12 days. Drawing comparisons to XRP’s performance in 2017, EGRAG suggests the current market behavior could lead to milestones at $6 and $27. $6 and $27 XRP Price Targets Explained EGRAG’s predictions are based on Fibonacci retracement levels and historical price patterns. He highlighted parallels between XRP’s 2017 cycle and its ongoing rally. In March 2017, it gained 150% from a critical support level, which the analyst named the Purple Foundation. This initial move was followed by an extraordinary 1,330% rally two months later in May 2017. EGRAG believes the cryptocurrency is poised to replicate a similar trajectory. His analysis points to an immediate target zone between $4.3 and $6.4, corresponding to Fibonacci retracement levels of 1.414 and 1.618. He anticipates this could be achieved by the end of December 2024. Looking ahead to January 2025, EGRAG predicts a larger surge, potentially mirroring the 1,330% rally observed in 2017. This would place the asset in a secondary gold region, which spans prices between $13.7 and $27.3, aligning with another significant retracement zone. Addressing XRP Market Cap Concerns Skepticism surrounding these ambitious price targets often revolves around XRP’s market cap and liquidity requirements. EGRAG addressed these concerns by comparing the cryptocurrency market’s total valuation in 2017 and 2024. In May 2017, the total cryptocurrency market cap (TMC) was $60 billion. By December 2024, this figure had grown to $3.7 trillion, representing a 61-fold increase. Applying this multiplier to XRP’s 2017 market cap of $15 billion would result in a potential valuation of $900 billion for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP to achieve this, it would need to command a market share of 9% to 18%, depending on whether the TMC grows to $5 trillion or $10 trillion. According to EGRAG, such dominance is feasible given the asset’s established use cases, particularly in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously projected the TMC could reach $5 trillion in the near future. Currently, the token is priced at $2.34, with a market cap of $133 billion and a dominance of 3.59%. If it regains its 2017 peak dominance of 31%, its market cap could exceed $1 trillion. These projections underscore the potential for significant growth, provided the token maintains its current momentum and market relevance. EGRAG’s analysis draws attention to XRP’s strong performance and potential to achieve substantial gains in the coming months. By leveraging historical patterns and technical indicators, the analyst has outlined a roadmap for the token to reach $6 and potentially $27. While challenges remain, the token’s role in global payments and the expanding cryptocurrency market make these targets worth monitoring.

The market is still in the midst of a larger upward trend, potentially forming a third wave in an Elliott Wave structure. However, an internal correction seems to be occurring, which is not fully visible on the broader time frame. XRP is currently positioned between the all-time high and the 2021 breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.47 and is up by more than five percent in the last 24 hours. A key level to watch is the $2.48–$2.49 range. A break above this level could signal a move higher. A sustained breakout above the price channel would suggest that XRP may target $2.76 or even higher. Key Support and Resistance Levels From a technical perspective, XRP’s key support levels are between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as prices hold above this range, there could be further upside. On the resistance side, the $3.23–$3.30 range, which includes the all-time high, is important. Longer-term, there is potential for XRP to reach $5–$10, but this could occur during either the third or fifth wave of the larger cycle. The overall trend remains upward, and close attention is being paid to any signs of additional upward momentum. Risk Factors to Consider The main risk areas lie between $1.50 and $1.79. There’s a chance XRP could stay above the 2021 high, avoiding a deep pullback. Instead, the price might experience a sideways correction. If the price moves higher, support levels will shift upward along with the price. Looking at the Shorter Time Frame On the smaller time frame, XRP is attempting to break out of its current price channel, though the breakout has not yet been confirmed.

With time running out on the congressional calendar, the delay could lead to big changes at the SEC. What caused this holdup, and what happens if her term ends? The Vote That Didn’t Happen The committee was supposed to vote on December 11, 2024, to decide whether Crenshaw would get another term. But at the last minute, Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee’s chair, called off the meeting. No real explanation was given. When Brown tried to reschedule for later that day, Republicans blocked the effort. Now, there’s not much time left. If Congress doesn’t act soon, Crenshaw’s term will expire, leaving the SEC with just three commissioners. All of them would be Republicans. This could change how the SEC approaches major issues, especially in cryptocurrency regulation. Crypto Isn’t a Fan One reason Crenshaw’s renomination is getting pushback is her stance on crypto. Many in the i ndustry are unhappy with her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs and what they see as her tough approach to regulation. The CEO of famous crypto exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, has urged senators to block her renomination calling her a “ failure of an SEC Commissioner ”. Source : X.com This isn’t just about Crenshaw, though. It’s part of a bigger battle between the SEC and the crypto world. Crypto leaders want less oversight, and with Crenshaw gone, they might get it. Politics Are in the Mix This delay isn’t just about policy or crypto, though. Politics are playing a big role. Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s top Republican, accused Democrats of rushing Biden’s nominees before President-elect Trump takes office. He called it a “last-minute effort” to stop Trump from shaping the SEC. Donald Trump could appoint someone else if Crenshaw’s renomination does not move forward. Names of other candidates for this position are already being floated. One name being in the highlights is Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner. He is well known for crypto friendly views. Such a shift would likely lead to a more business-friendly SEC, especially when it comes to crypto. What Happens Next? The committee needs to reschedule the vote, but with the congressional session wrapping up soon, time isn’t on Crenshaw’s side. With the expiration of her term, the SEC’s balance of power will shift immediately. That means a new commissioner could step in as early as January 2025. All this fuzz is not just about Crenshaw or her being the commission of SEC. It’s more about the future of the SEC and how it handles emerging industries like crypto. The stakes are very high as the decisions made will pave the path for many years to come.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 04:49:00

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

The price recently hit a new ATH at $0.4245 and this breakout comes after the price passed key resistance levels. VLO’s price had recently traded above the $0.1722 resistance on December 6th but pulled back. On December 10th, the market printed a higher low and has now broken out once again. Velodrome is part of the Optimism network, aimed at making transactions faster and more efficient. The recent surge in Velodrome’s price came after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, listed its token with a seed tag. This listing exposes Velodrome to millions of Binance users. Even more exciting, its fork, Aerodrome, just secured over $20 million from Coinbase Ventures, straight from the open market. With big money backing it, VELO is rapidly gaining attention. What’s Next For VELO? Analyst Louie said that Velodrome is performing well, but with its price entering new territory, it’s unclear when or where it will peak. The analyst spotted a similar price pattern in PEPE before its big breakout, which helped identify the current movement. In PEPE’s case, the price hit resistance at the 2.618 Fibonacci level, marking its all-time high after just two weeks of breakout. If Velodrome follows a similar pattern, the 2.618 level could be a short-to-mid-term target. In the past, cryptocurrencies often saw a price spike when major exchanges list them, but these gains are usually short-lived as the excitement fades. However, with the start of the altcoin season approaching, Velodrome, like Aerodrome, is positioned to benefit from the market’s growing interest in altcoins. Velodrome is a coin with real-world utility, and as more investors look toward altcoins, it could see significant gains.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 05:07:27

The crypto community has been anticipating this approval for weeks and was the final step delaying the stablecoin’s launch. In a post on X, Van Code described it as “one of the biggest things that has happened in crypto,” noting that RLUSD is the first token classified as a regulated financial instrument, or “bank-grade.” This sets it apart from other stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Implicit Recognition of XRPL and Ethereum The NYDFS approval of RLUSD carries broader implications for the ecosystems supporting it. Van Code highlighted that this approval indirectly validates the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchains, which host RLUSD, as suitable platforms for financial-grade operations. While these blockchains are not officially certified as banking grade, the approval signifies their capability to meet rigorous regulatory standards, as they meet the technical and security requirements necessary to host a regulated financial instrument. Key operational features of XRPL and Ethereum, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency, align with the stringent standards of financial regulators. Furthermore, NYDFS oversight ensures that the platforms can support compliance needs, including real-time audits and reserve tracking. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why RLUSD Is Bank-Grade, but Blockchains Are Not While the NYDFS approval highlights the viability of XRPL and Ethereum for hosting regulated assets, it does not formally certify the blockchains themselves as banking grade. Van Code explained that the approval applies specifically to RLUSD under U.S. banking laws, rather than the broader suitability of the underlying blockchains for core banking functions. Van Code noted that for a blockchain to be classified as banking grade, it would require explicit recognition by major banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve or the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Additionally, it would need to demonstrate widespread adoption for critical banking services like lending or central clearing. A Significant Moment for the XRP Ledger While RLUSD is revolutionary for many reasons, Van Code emphasized that the NYDFS approval of RLUSD is a milestone that signals the growing maturity of blockchain technology. In another post , he explained that this could be significant for the XRPL, as Ripple launched RLUSD on the Ethereum network to funnel people into the XRPL ecosystem. Launching on the Ethereum network allows exchanges that don’t support XRPL tokens to list RLUSD at launch, while the XRPL provides a cheaper and faster alternative to draw investors toward it.

The company, led by Michael Saylor, is set to join the prestigious Nasdaq-100 index, which includes big names like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. This has created excitement among investors and could push Bitcoin to new ATH soon. Why MicroStrategy’s Inclusion Matters MicroStrategy’s entry into the Nasdaq-100 is a big deal. The index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, and MicroStrategy’s rapid growth this year secured its place. With a market value of $92 billion as of November, the company is expected to hold a 0.47% weighting in the index. This move means funds tracking the Nasdaq-100, such as the $300 billion Invesco QQQ ETF, will indirectly hold Bitcoin through MicroStrategy’s investments. The company currently owns around 423,650 Bitcoin , worth over $42 billion, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. Bitcoin’s Rising Popularity Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time, fueled by hopes of regulatory changes under President-elect Donald Trump. MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin purchases , even at high prices, show the company’s confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Analysts say MicroStrategy remains comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95,000 to $100,000 range. Speculation On MicroStrategy’s Sustainability While this is a significant milestone, some experts believe MicroStrategy’s stay in the Nasdaq-100 could be temporary. Since most of its value comes from Bitcoin rather than its core business, it might eventually be classified as a financial company. Founder Michael Saylor has also hinted at transforming MicroStrategy into a “Bitcoin bank,” which could change its status further. For now, though, this inclusion is seen as a major milestone, further intertwining the world of cryptocurrencies with mainstream financial markets. As ETFs like SPY and QQQ align themselves with this shift, millions of investors may gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin, adding momentum to its broader adoption.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-14 05:44:08

The exchange operator said on Friday, after a meteoric surge in the shares of the Bitcoin buyer. According to Nasdaq, the change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23. Being added to the index usually drives up the stock’s price, as exchange-traded funds aiming to mirror the index’s performance purchase shares of the newly included company. According to a statement released by Nasdaq on December 13, MicroStrategy is one of three companies to join the index, alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON). However, Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer, and vaccine maker Moderna were removed. MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq-100 as Bitcoin bet drives $94B surge MSTR now ranks among Nasdaq’s top 100 stocks by market cap. The aggressive investor in the world’s largest crypto asset has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion. MicroStrategy, a software company, began buying and holding Bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the most significant corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have stated that MicroStrategy’s choice to acquire BTC to safeguard the value of its reserve assets has increased the attractiveness of its stock, which generally tracks the cryptocurrency’s performance. Bernstein analysts predict that the market will likely focus on MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the S&P 500 in 2025 after its addition to the Nasdaq-100. The brokerage also believes the company’s outlook will continue improving next year as it anticipates “greater visibility and recognition beyond new ETF inflows.” Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks as the election of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump boosted the crypto sector’s optimism about reduced regulatory obstacles. Earlier this month, the digital asset soared above $100,000 for the first time. Bernstein analysts noted that management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and is comfortable buying the asset in the $95K-$100K range. The crypto industry reacts as MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq inclusion sparks optimism MicroStrategy held roughly 423,650 Bitcoins acquired for about $25.6 billion, based on the average purchase price as of Dec. 8. Based on Bitcoin’s previous close, the investment is worth around $42.4 billion. Crypto analyst Will Clemente shared his thoughts in a December 13 post on X, saying: Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure. — Will (@WClementeIII) December 14, 2024 Jeff Park , head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, commented that the trade of the decade is just getting started and advised to buckle up.

This surge in interest saw crypto products surpass $35 billion in net inflows since January, underscoring Bitcoin’s growing appeal and dominance in the financial world. Riot Platforms has made a strategic move to expand its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 5,117 BTC for $510 million. This purchase was funded through the company’s recent $525 million convertible bond issuance, which carried a 0.75% interest rate and matures in 2030. After deducting expenses, Riot secured $511.5 million in net proceeds, strategically deploying these funds to purchase Bitcoin at an average price of $99,669 per coin, including fees. With the net proceeds from Riot’s recent $525 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 5,117 BTC at an average price of $99,669 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses.

This positions Riot as a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, reinforcing its commitment to scaling operations and capitalizing on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Institutions are driving Bitcoin adoption to new heights! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how this trend could impact future prices. Market Optimism Drives Bitcoin Surge Bitcoin’s recent rally, crossing the $100,000 milestone , reflects heightened market optimism. Key drivers include macroeconomic factors such as the potential for a 25 basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has a 96% probability according to CME Group data. Plus, the possibility of favorable crypto policies under a new Trump administration has further boosted sentiment. Analysts Eye a Bullish Period Ahead The broader market outlook for Bitcoin remains highly optimistic. Analysts predict a potential price target of $160,000 by 2025, driven by increasing adoption, institutional interest, and Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Riot’s well-timed acquisition aligns with these projections, placing the company in a strong position to benefit from future price increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Mining Giants Follow MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, but at What Cost? , Riot’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation highlights its confidence in the asset’s long-term value and its role in the present market scenario.

In this context, a CryptoQuant analysis highlights a key BTC metric that can serve as a valuable tool for crafting an exit strategy. Have Profits In Bitcoin? Keep An Eye On This Indicator In a Quicktake blog post published today, CryptoQuant contributor Onchain Edge shared insights into timing the sale of BTC during the current bull market. The analyst emphasized the importance of the Bitcoin supply in loss metric, noting its potential to signal when to start exiting the market to preserve profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report For those unfamiliar with Bitcoin, the supply in loss measures the percentage of BTC held at a loss based on its last moved price. A low percentage of supply in loss typically indicates peak market euphoria and serves as a warning to secure profits before a bear market correction begins. According to the CryptoQuant analysis, when BTC supply in loss drops below 4%, it signals a good time for investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their BTC holdings and wait for the next bear market lows. Currently, the BTC supply in loss sits at 8.14%. DCA is an investment strategy where investors allocate a fixed amount of money to an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This method helps reduce the impact of market volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time. The analyst adds: Why? Below 4% means a lot of people are in a profit this is the peak bullrun phase. Trust me you don’t want to be bagholding because you thought we will never see a bear market again. Be fearful when others are greedy. Analysts Confident Of Further Upside In BTC Price While tracking the BTC supply in loss metric can help investors safeguard their profits, recent forecasts from crypto analysts suggest there might still be room for further upside before this indicator becomes crucial. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC forms a classic cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. The premier cryptocurrency looks poised to break out of the bullish formation, with targets as high as $275,000. Similarly, Donald Trump’s victory has brought fresh optimism in the crypto industry. In the recently concluded Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, noted that BTC investors can “expect more than $100,000” during the ongoing market cycle. Other forecasts remain equally bullish. Tom Dunleavy, Chief Investment Officer at MV Global, projects BTC to reach $250,000, while Ethereum (ETH) might climb to $12,000 during this market cycle. BTC trades at $100,983 at press time, up a modest 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

This altcoin could potentially yield returns of up to 25,000%. Explore how this under-the-radar digital asset could become a game-changer in the crypto landscape. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win .

Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point . Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop !

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it gained popularity due to its community and social media influence, notably from figures like Elon Musk. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, it remains a subject of interest due to these factors. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run gains momentum, tokens like DOGE show limited short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN is poised for significant growth. Designed for those embodying success and luxury, DOGEN expects 700% presale growth and potential thousand-fold returns. Following BONK, WIF, and Popcat, it builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 06:11:45
