It predicts Bitcoin will reach as high as $180K, and other major digital assets will reach record highs by the end of 2025. The firm projected in a December 13 blog post that the cryptocurrency bull market will experience a “medium-term peak” in the first quarter of 2025 before a period of consolidation and eventual recovery leads to new all-time highs. VanEck Predicts Bitcoin at $180K and Ethereum Above $6K in the Next Market Cycle According to a blog post published on December 13 by Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, at the anticipated market peak, VanEck expects Bitcoin (BTC) to reach approximately $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $6,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could see valuations exceeding $500 and $10, respectively. However, the firm forecasts a summer correction, with Bitcoin facing a 30% retracement and altcoins potentially declining by up to 60%. Despite these setbacks, VanEck expects a recovery by the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and achieving new highs before the end of the year. NEW: Spot #Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck is predicting in 2025: – $180,000 bitcoin price – Banks will be allowed to custody bitcoin – US will adopt Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Bitcoin ETFs will support in-kind creations & redemptions THIS WOULD BE MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/l6JyjFaaRc — Nikolaus Hoffman (@NikolausHoff) December 13, 2024 The firm has identified several key indicators to monitor for signs of speculative market peaks. For example, high funding rates on Bitcoin perpetual futures above 10% for three months could indicate speculative excess. Similarly, many Bitcoin holders with unrealized profits exceeding a 70% profit-to-cost ratio suggest market euphoria. An overvalued market cap relative to realized value, measured by MVRV scores above 5, often signals overheated conditions. Additionally, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance below 40% could indicate late-cycle speculative shifts into riskier altcoins. Increased speculation from non-crypto-savvy individuals is also a warning sign of mania near a market top. The blog post also reflects on previous predictions made by Sigel, including a projection that Bitcoin could climb to $2.9 million per coin by 2050 and Ethereum reach $22,000 per token by 2030 . Trump’s Pro-Crypto Administration: A Boost for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? The market outlook for Bitcoin reflects growing bullish sentiment among experts. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has predicted BTC will surpass $1 million by 2030 , citing increased participation from major investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Similarly, Henry Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Capital Management, believes President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration will drive institutional adoption. In a November 6 X post , he highlighted opportunities for asset managers and family offices to enter the U.S. crypto market. What is the impact of Trump’s win on the #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency markets? 3 things to watch: – change of US regulatory stance – further entry of institutional investors – wave of M&A in the space pic.twitter.com/9rJAJNO6h9 — Henri Arslanian (@HenriArslanian) November 6, 2024 Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Crypto research firm 10x Research suggests BTC could reach $100,000 by January 2025 , noting historical patterns where a six-month high typically leads to a 40% median gain over three months. Independent analyst Mags also predicts Bitcoin could hit $250,000 within a year , referencing its 360% post-election rally in 2020 and potential similar growth in 2024. MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy continues to yield massive returns. Since 2020, the firm has invested $23.5 billion to amass over 400,000 BTC, equivalent to 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. As of December 7, its holdings are valued at $40 billion, with an unrealized profit of $16.5 billion—a 70% return on capital.

In December 2024, it’s not just about the next viral meme—it’s about serious growth, explosive potential, and making those significant returns. If you’re looking to ride the hype and secure your spot in the future of meme coins, then you need to pay attention to the best meme coins for significant returns. From BTFD Coin raking in millions in presale sales to Goatseus Maximus battling a slight dip, and Degen steadily moving up—there are some coins you’ll want to keep on your radar. Let’s start with BTFD Coin —rapidly becoming a powerhouse in the meme coin world. The presale has already raised over $3.7 million, with 53 billion tokens sold and counting. The community is buzzing, and the BTFD Coin presale is already showing signs of massive returns. If you’re looking to snag a piece of this before it rockets even further, you better act fast. BTFD Coin: From Presale Success to 2025 Moonshot We can’t talk about the best meme coins for significant returns without giving BTFD Coin a serious spotlight. From the “Buy The Dip” mentality to staking rewards that could offer you an APY of 90%, there’s no shortage of reasons why this coin is making waves. The presale for BTFD Coin is already in full swing, with over $3.7 million raised and 53 billion tokens sold. That’s a lot of momentum to start with. With the presale price at $0.00013, this coin is set to see substantial growth as the price increases over time. The community is massive, and with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, BTFD Coin is taking off faster than we can keep up. But let’s talk numbers: if you were to invest $2,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013 per token, you’d be buying 15.3 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price were to reach $0.0006 by 2025 (a reasonable prediction based on current momentum), your $2,000 investment could turn into $9,180. That’s a 359% return on your investment—now, that’s the kind of growth you want in your portfolio. BTFD Coin has everything you could want for significant returns—staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn game , and a community-focused movement that will push it into the crypto stratosphere. Goatseus Maximus: Facing the Dip, But Long-Term Potential Remains Next up is Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that had all the hype earlier this year but has recently faced some volatility. The coin has seen a 24-hour -0.95% decline, but don’t be fooled by this temporary setback—it’s still one of the best meme coins for significant returns over the long term. At its peak, Goatseus Maximus was hitting highs, with prices that reflected its strong community and meme-driven popularity. But right now, it’s undergoing a bit of a retrace. The latest price sits around $0.7382, and despite the short-term dip, Goatseus Maximus still boasts a robust ecosystem with massive community engagement and ongoing development. This dip could present a perfect buying opportunity if you’re a believer in meme coins with long-term growth potential. As for predictions, Goatseus Maximus could very well rebound in 2025, potentially reaching prices around $0.73558 to $1.466409. For investors looking to buy and hold for significant returns, Goatseus Maximus is still one to consider, despite its current downtrend. Degen: A Steady Climb for the Bold Investor And then there’s Degen, the meme coin that refuses to quit. While Goatseus Maximus might be experiencing a brief hiccup, and BTFD Coin is on its way to the moon, Degen has been moving steadily upward, gaining traction among investors who believe in its quiet, consistent growth. Degen might not have the same viral hype as the others, but it’s proving to be one of the best meme coins for significant returns due to its consistent growth trajectory and strong community backing. The current price of Degen is sitting at $0.015359, but its solid fundamentals—paired with increasing interest from influencers and crypto communities—means it could experience strong growth moving into 2025. Looking ahead to 2025, Degen has the potential to hit between $0.027856 and $0.077508.It’s the steady Eddie of the group, but don’t sleep on its potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the BTFD Coin Presale—The Time to Act is Now! If you’re serious about grabbing the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is the one that’s impossible to ignore. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term growth, BTFD Coin has the community, the rewards, and the Play-to-Earn integration to make it a serious contender. So, why wait? Invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of the presale price before it skyrockets. At the current price, the potential for growth is massive. Don’t miss out on BTFD Coin—grab your tokens today and be part of the meme coin revolution!

French Hill plans to introduce clear regulations in the first 100 days of the new term, making it a key focus for Congress. His leadership could change U.S. crypto policy, creating a stable environment for the digital asset industry, a move long-awaited by crypto stakeholders. Hills Calls for a Shift Toward Crypto Regulation in the U.S. French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, was recently voted to chair the House Financial Services Committee. This comes after leading the panel’s subcommittee on digital assets. This committee is pivotal in crafting the nation’s crypto regulations, and Hill’s election marks a turning point for the industry. Hill has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly its chairman, Gary Gensler. Hill believes Gensler’s heavy enforcement approach to crypto regulation stifles innovation. In September, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer criticized Gensler’s SEC leadership, calling his tenure the most destructive and lawless. Hill argues that the U.S. needs a clearer market structure for digital assets, limiting the potential of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Many crypto leaders share this view, calling for necessary changes. The crypto community has praised Hill’s leadership, with groups like the DeFi Education Fund and Blockchain Association supporting his efforts to create clear regulations. They appreciate his focus on innovation and protecting the rights of developers and DeFi users. Hill is seen as a strong advocate for sensible crypto policies. Digital Assets: A Priority in the First 100 Days Hill’s vision for 2025 aligns closely with Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader. Scalise plans to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets within the first 100 days of President-elect Donald Trump’s term. The focus will include stablecoins and other key aspects of the crypto landscape, creating much-needed certainty for the industry. Scalise intends to establish a framework that will allow digital assets to grow with clear rules in place. The new bill will provide businesses and innovators with the confidence to build. A Potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In addition to regulatory work, discussions around a strategic Bitcoin reserve have gained momentum, both federally and at the state level. Hill will be tasked with navigating these discussions in his new role, including proposals from Senator Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Giovanni Capriglione. Lummis has proposed a bill directing the U.S. Treasury to purchase one million Bitcoins over five years. Capriglione has filed a state bill to create a Bitcoin reserve through donations, holding the assets for up to five years. When asked about the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, Hill acknowledged its appeal but was cautious in his assessment.

The analyst urges the XRP community to monitor this fractal closely, highlighting the need to monitor price movements in the coming weeks. XRP Price Eyes $16 As Analyst Spots Bullish Fractal An XRP supporter on X (formerly Twitter), known as ‘LUDXRP,’ has released a detailed chart analysis, predicting that the XRP price could climb to an ambitious price target of $16.15. The analyst mentioned the presence of a historic fractal on the XRP chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything The fractal pattern, indicated by the blue circle in the chart, highlights a significant upward movement in the XRP price. Following the movements of the chart, if XRP can replicate this fractal, it could trigger a significant price rally toward $16.15. Multiple green horizontal lines have also been shown in the chart, spotlighting different resistance and support zones that could trigger a reaction in the XRP price. With XRP trading at $2.42, the horizontal trend lines above its current price are seen as crucial resistance levels. The analyst highlighted intermediate price levels like $2.8, $4.1, $7.6, and $12.7 as crucial resistance levels, which XRP must surpass before reaching the ambitious target of $16.15. Additionally, the chart identifies $2 as a potential support level, warning that if the price drops below this mark, it could lead to a possible price dip to $1. With the possibility of breaking above $16, the XRP supporter has urged community members to monitor the fractal on the price chart closely. He emphasized the importance of XRP maintaining an upward trend within the blue circle, which could trigger his projected price increase toward $16. XRP To See “Face Melting” Rally This Christmas A crypto analyst identified as the ‘Charting Guy’ on X has expressed optimism about XRP’s future price outlook. According to the analyst, XRP could experience a ” face-melting “ rally to new highs by Christmas and in late January. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green The analyst has stated that if XRP continues to follow past bullish trends seen in 2017, the market will likely consolidate for another two weeks until Christmas. He disclosed that this bullish projection was primarily based on XRP’s fractal rather than relying on Fibonacci levels. In response to a comment from a crypto community member, the Charting guy agreed that by December 30, XRP would experience a series of strong green weeks, potentially driven either by the Christmas hype or the bullish sentiment surrounding the RLUSD stablecoin. The analyst also agreed that January 20, the inauguration day of Donald Trump as the United States (US) President, could mark the XRP price top, which the market would likely consider a “sell the news event.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-13 22:30:52

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana faces competition as Lightchain AI, with AI-powered blockchain tech, offers a bold vision for decentralized creativity. Table of Contents Solana’s current position in the blockchain space What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Why experts see disruption potential The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities In the world of blockchain technology, Solana (SOL) has carved out a significant niche for itself. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low costs, and growing ecosystem, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for developers and investors. However, as technology evolves and new players emerge, questions arise about whether Solana’s dominance can be challenged. Enter Lightchain AI , a next-generation blockchain platform that combines unique artificial intelligence (AI) integration with creative scalability solutions. Boasting its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI presents a bold vision of the future—one where blockchain and AI work in tandem to power decentralized creativity. Can Lightchain AI challenge Solana’s supremacy? Experts believe the possibility is real, and here’s why. You might also like: Shiba Inu highlights and Lightchain AI’s blockchain solutions for December 2024 Solana’s current position in the blockchain space Solana’s rapid rise to prominence in the blockchain world can be attributed to several key factors: Speed and Scalability: Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant leap over Ethereum’s 15 TPS and other competing blockchains. Low Fees: Solana’s transaction fees are fractions of a penny, making it attractive for developers and users looking for cost-effective solutions. Developer Ecosystem: Solana’s active community has built an array of decentralized applications (dApps) spanning DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional Interest: High-profile backers like FTX and venture capital firms have provided financial and strategic support. Despite these strengths, Solana has faced its fair share of challenges: Network Downtime: Solana’s network has experienced multiple outages, raising concerns about its reliability and centralization. High Hardware Requirements: Running a Solana node requires powerful and expensive hardware, limiting true decentralization. Lack of Innovation in AI Integration: While Solana excels in transaction processing, its offerings in AI and advanced computational capabilities are limited. These pain points create an opportunity for a challenger like Lightchain AI to step in and disrupt Solana’s dominance. What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Lightchain AI is not just another blockchain—it’s a platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to address many of the challenges faced by traditional blockchains like Solana. Its core innovations include: 1. Proof of Intelligence: A smarter consensus mechanism While Solana uses a hybrid Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI): AI-Powered Validation: Nodes contribute by solving meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and optimization, rather than simply staking tokens or verifying blocks. Energy Efficiency: Unlike energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) systems, PoI aligns computational power with productive AI advancements. Decentralized AI Development: By decentralizing AI workloads, Lightchain AI ensures that its consensus mechanism contributes directly to solving real-world problems. This transformative approach positions Lightchain AI as a blockchain network with a purpose beyond simple transaction validation. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine: Redefining computation Lightchain AI’s AIVM sets it apart from other blockchain platforms by enabling the execution of AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. Key features include: Real-Time AI Execution: Unlike Solana , which focuses primarily on transaction processing, AIVM powers decentralized applications (dApps) that require advanced AI capabilities like predictive analytics and machine learning. Global Developer Collaboration: AIVM encourages developers worldwide to contribute AI models, creating a collaborative and evolving ecosystem. Interoperability: The AIVM integrates with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it easy for developers to adopt and deploy existing tools. 3. Scalability and speed While Solana’s high TPS is impressive, Lightchain AI employs advanced sharding and Layer 2 solutions to achieve comparable scalability without compromising decentralization: Parallel Processing: Lightchain’s architecture allows multiple nodes to process AI tasks and transactions simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks. Real-Time Applications: From supply chain tracking to high-frequency financial trading, Lightchain AI’s scalability supports applications that demand speed and precision. 4. Decentralized governance Unlike Solana, which has faced criticism for centralization, Lightchain AI prioritizes a community-driven governance model: Token Holder Influence: Through voting rights tied to its native LCAI token, the Lightchain community can propose and vote on changes to the protocol. Quadratic Voting: This system ensures smaller stakeholders have a proportional voice, fostering fairness and inclusivity. These are the key features that make Lightchain AI a potential challenger to Solana’s current dominance in the blockchain space. Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Feature Solana Lightchain AI Consensus Mechanism PoH + PoS PoI Transaction Speed (TPS) Up to 65,000 Comparable (via sharding) Energy Efficiency Moderate High (AI-aligned tasks) AI Integration Limited Advanced (via AIVM) Decentralization Partial Full (community-driven governance) Network Downtime Several outages reported Built for reliability Why experts see disruption potential 1. Bridging blockchain and AI “Lightchain AI stands out because it’s not just a blockchain—it’s an AI platform,” says Dr. Amelia Wang, an AI researcher. “By merging these two technologies, Lightchain enables use cases that traditional blockchains like Solana simply cannot address.” Potential applications include: Decentralized AI Model Training: Nodes collaborate to train global AI models without compromising data privacy. AI-Powered DeFi Protocols: Platforms that use machine learning for risk assessment and portfolio optimization. Data Marketplaces: Decentralized platforms where users can buy and sell AI-ready datasets. 2. Solana’s limitations leave room for competition While Solana excels in speed, it has struggled with reliability and decentralization. Matthew Ellis, a blockchain analyst, notes: “Solana’s network outages have shaken investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism offers a more sustainable and reliable alternative while adding value through AI computations.” 3. AI’s booming market The AI market is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2030, creating enormous opportunities for platforms like Lightchain AI. As more industries adopt AI-powered solutions, a blockchain that can integrate seamlessly with AI will be well-positioned for long-term success. The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities Challenges for Lightchain AI Adoption: Gaining traction in an already competitive market dominated by Solana, Ethereum , and others. Education: Convincing developers and enterprises of the value of integrating AI with blockchain. Scalability Tests: Proving its architecture can handle large-scale adoption without bottlenecks. Opportunities Early Adoption: Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale offers an entry point for investors looking to get in before the project gains mainstream attention. Industry Partnerships: Collaborating with AI and blockchain leaders to create real-world applications. Decentralized Innovation: Harnessing the power of its developer and token holder community to drive continuous evolution. Jump in before the rocket launches Solana who? The blockchain world is buzzing, and Lightchain AI is here to shake things up. With AI smarts, lightning-fast speeds, and a loyal crew of believers, this isn’t just another altcoin — this could be the next big thing. Experts are whispering about a potential 10x explosion by 2025, and the presale is your ticket to the ground floor of something epic.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP slows down but 5 altcoins, including Rexas Finance (RXS), could turn $300 into $6,000 by 2025. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Tron Floki Inu Dogecoin Polygon Conclusion Since November, XRP has been one of the strongest bull run performers, rising from $0.63 to $2.92. XRP’s momentum reversed when it failed to test $3, dropping to $2.52 levels. While XRP’s ascent has hit a snag, Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon might bring huge gains, potentially upgrading $300 portfolios to $6000l. Rexas Finance Investors looking to build a profitable portfolio from a low budget within the shortest time interval could consider Rexas Finance , one of the most inventive crypto projects. It seeks to digitise a variety of tangible things such as properties, commodities, and arts, thus enabling the retail investor to enter into otherwise untouchable investments. Considering the worldwide commodities, real estate, and financial assets market to be $121.2 trillion, $379.7 trillion, and $486 trillion, respectively, RWA tokenization is the future of money. Rexas Finance will open up investment options to a wider audience by allowing fractional ownership and digital trade of these precious assets, removing geographical and financial limitations. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem will include the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, making asset-backed token creation, management, and trading easy. The platform will also support Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that maximizes investor income with minimal effort. Moreover, it will offer a decentralized Launchpad for startups to raise funds and increase their reach. These features make Rexas Finance a key player in the DeFi movement. Rexas Finance’s presale has been a success so far, with the token price rising over 316% in three months. The project has raised $25.3 million and sold 334 million RXS tokens as investors flock to its current presale stage despite the price appreciation of $0.125. Rexas Finance opted for public presales over VC funding, a crucial step to creating a community-driven platform with decentralized ownership. A recent Certik audit improved Rexas Finance’s security and transparency. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, two major cryptocurrency tracking websites, have listed RXS, enhancing visibility and investor interest. Before RXS is listed on the proposed top crypto exchanges, investors have a limited time to buy it at its current presale price. Rexas Finance is also offering a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 entrants each receiving $50,000 in RXS tokens. Experts see a huge potential in the Rexas Finance project, with many projecting a massive surge to $10 immediately after its anticipated mega listings. You might also like: Tron competitor to turn $250 to $25k in 80 days, TRX could rise to $5 in the same timeline Tron Tron rose from $19 billion to $36.7 billion in 24 hours, one of this cycle’s biggest market cap rises. TRX is at $0.37, up 70% in 24 hours and 140% in 30 days. Tron founder Justin Sun continues to promote the project on social media. High-profile decentralized finance (DeFi) ventures like Sun’s investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) have boosted the Tron ecosystem’s reputation and attracted institutional investors. TRX’s complete DeFi applications are helping it grow as more people join the network. Floki Inu Floki Inu remains a top meme coin for its community-driven strategy and unique branding. FLOKI rose over 650% in 2024 and is expected to continue rising in 2025. Crypto expert Master Kenobi forecasts FLOKI will rise 700% to $0.0023 by March 2025. This prediction follows its impressive chart patterns, which suggest bullish momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin recently reached a yearly top of $0.4634, proving its market viability. A strong optimistic trend over the last month produced a 200% increase. Though its popularity and strong community support have kept it among the top cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is most renowned for its meme roots. After rising, DOGE still lags 37% below its all-time high of $0.73. Due to considerable accumulation by whales, recently launched DOGE ETP, and upcoming political shift in the US, Dogecoin might soon soar above $1. Polygon Polygon is recognized as an Ethereum Layer-2 scalability solution. The POL coin, which rose 18% to $0.64 in the previous week, is becoming a key player in Ethereum dApp scalability. Polygon’s long-term projections are good despite recent setbacks. The platform makes perfect use of Ethereum’s features, making it a necessary component of the Ethereum ecology. As the altcoin season nears, Polygon’s price will rise as Ethereum benefits from the anticipated clear regulatory climate following Gary Gensler’s recent resignation. Experts predict it might surge to $5 in the coming months. Conclusion Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon are predicted to rise dramatically in 2025. These solutions provide distinct promise and development potential for those looking to grow their portfolios from $300 to $6,000 by early 2025. Rexas Finance is a transformative project with a solid foundation. Its presale success, growing ecosystem, and upcoming exchange listings make it a great candidate for huge gains. At $0.125, RXS current price is a bargain for investors willing to jump in on the presale. To learn more about Rexas Finance, visit their websi t e , giveaway , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Here’s Why a “Santa Rally” Is Likely,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-set-to-pump-to-5k-before-years-end-heres-why-a-santa-rally-is-likely/,"As the Ethereum (ETH) price consolidates just above $3,900, traders are eyeing the possibility of a surge into the year’s end, a phenomenon referred to as a “Santa Rally”. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is looking good right now, sitting above all of its major moving averages and still in a clear uptrend. However, resistance in the form of the early 2024 highs just above $4,000 continues to cap the Ethereum price action. However, Christmas could be about to come early for Ethereum investors. While Polymarket betting odds only currently place a 14% chance that the Ethereum price will hit new all-time highs at $5,000, this may represent the market under-pricing the likelihood of a strong breakout. Here’s why. Ethereum Price to Pump to $5,000 Soon? Here’s Why That’s Likely Reason 1 – Vibes To say that vibes are good in the crypto market right now would be an understatement ahead of the arrival of an almost unimaginably pro-crypto incoming US administration in March. Trump promised this week to do great things for the crypto industry, his picks for Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair are ardently pro-crypto, and his family were spotted loading up their ETH, AAVE and LINK positions just days ago. U.S. President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial bought • 2,631 $ETH ($10M) • 3,357 $AAVE ($1M) • 41,335 $LINK ($1M) UNREAL pic.twitter.com/KubybniuBb — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 12, 2024 Its not hyperbole to say we are not he cusp of a new golden age for crypto markets as policy in the US swings decisively in a positive direction. That is a strong reason why buy pressure is likely to remain elevated into the year’s end, boding well for the Ethereum price. Reason 2 – Market Leadership and ETF Inflows The prospect of the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve in the USA suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) will be a massive winner amid the upcoming administration. However, altcoins like Ethereum which have been weighed so heavily by regulatory uncertainty in recent years may enjoy an even greater snapback. And Ethereum is in a great position to be one of the strongest-performing altcoins . It remains far and away the most dominant blockchain in DeFi, with a 56% market share of TVL per DeFi Llama , even if Solana has overtaken it in terms of speculative trading activities (thanks to its lower fees). For investors new to crypto looking to expand beyond BTC, Ethereum will likely stand out as the obvious next option. That is even more the case given Ethereum is the only other major crypto to have spot ETFs in the US. According to data presented by The Block , Ethereum ETF inflows have been ramping up since Trump’s election victory. And there is no reason for this to slow down into the year’s end, meaning upside risks to the Ethereum price in the coming weeks. Reason 3 – On-chain Activity Heating Up Another reason to be bullish on the Ethereum price into the year’s end is because the activity on its blockchain is really starting to heat up. Per Glassnode’s Ethereum core on-chain dashboard , metrics such as number of active addresses, number of transactions, and total transfer volume are all trending higher and challenging yearly highs. That strengthens the adoption narrative and can help to support prices. But it also contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as a deflationary asset – a portion of the ETH gas fees get burnt, so the more fees are generated, the more ETH is burnt. How Much Higher Can Ethereum Go? With Ethereum now close to its record highs, investors would be forgiven for fearing that the best part of the rally might now be over. But that would be a mistake – Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum price has historically moved in cycles, breaking into phases of aggressive price discovery, followed by large and prolonged drawdowns. Luckily for the bulls, a new phase of price discovery is likely just around the corner. Bitcoin entered its new phase of price discovery last month, as it historically always have within eight months of the BTC halving. Ethereum, meanwhile, has historically lagged Bitcoin by up to two months. That could mean an aggressive breakout to fresh record levels is coming in January. Various on-chain metrics also support the thesis that the top isn’t yet in – Ethereum’s “realized cap” (i.e. the market cap at the average price when each last coin moved) just hit new record highs at just under $248 billion. And the ratio of the ETH market cap to its realized cap, last around 1.5 per Glassnode , remains well below levels that have marked prior market peaks (above 3). Meanwhile, while high, the profitability of the Ethereum market also remains below levels that have marked prior Ethereum price peaks. Per Glassnode , NUPL was last just over 0.5, but prior market peaks have seen NUPL rise above 0.75. Regarding the question “how much higher can Ethereum go?”, no one knows for sure. But the answer is certainly a lot. The past cycle saw the Ethereum price rally over 4x beyond its prior record highs. A repeat of these gains is very possible, setting up the possibility of a near $20,000 Ethereum price. The post Ethereum Price Set to Pump to $5K Before Year’s End?

The report, gathered through open-source code activity, compiled notable industry developments in 2024 so far. The 2024 report includes data from StablePulse.org, NFTpulse.org and CodeSlaw.app. Electric Capital’s report confirmed perceptions about the significant growth the crypto industry has witnessed across multiple sectors and on a global scale this year. The continued adoption and adaptation of the industry has had a great impact on the world and shown the industry’s capacity to innovate. One of these notable trends in this year’s report is the Asian developer momentum. The population of programmers from that part of the world has increased, taking over North America’s dominance. Asia now ranks first, while North America is third in line after Europe. Back in 2015, 81% of crypto developers were in North America and Europe. Now, that stat has dropped to 55%. India and Ethereum were the biggest winners this year Despite Asia taking the lead over other continents, the US remains the country with the highest concentration of developers, with 19%. However, the country is down from 38% in 2015. India, on the other hand, has seen the most growth and is now the country with the second-highest developer share. The South Asian nation has come a long way from its 10th position in 2015. The country also onboarded the most new crypto developers in 2024, contributing 17% of new talent. Top five countries for crypto developers. Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Established developers with 2+ years of experience grew by 27% and now account for 70% of code commits. 39,148 new developers explored crypto this year, according to the Electric Capital report. Developers in the crypto space are also extremely diverse, with 1 in 3 developers working across multiple ecosystems. In 2015, less than 10% of developers had a similar level of diversity. Crypto developers have grown 39% per year since Ethereum’s launch in 2015, and it remains the leading ecosystem by developer share globally, boosted by the growth in Layer 2 adoption. EVM compatible chains continue to dominate, accounting for 74% of multi-chain developers. This year, Solana emerged as the favorite ecosystem of new developers, with over 57% of minting wallets. It grew by 83% YoY.

Source: Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 Stablecoin transactions are consistently active, rising by 2-3% during Asian, European, and African work hours. NFT trading peaks during American work hours, while minting peaks during Asian work hours. According to Electric Capital’s report, Base and Solana lead in low-fee use cases for NFTs, making them ideal for high-volume minting and trading. Base owns 97% of NFT minting volume, while Solana owns 64% of NFT mint transactions. NFT minting volume reached an all-time high of $1.5B this year. Minting wallets grew to 67M in 2024, with most of the activity on Solana (57%), Polygon (24%), and Base (13%). The all-time high volume for unique minting wallets was 23M. Minting transactions grew from 153M in 2023 to 568M in 2024, with the most activity on Solana (64%) and Base (26%). This year, NFT mints went beyond arts. The top NFT collections included finance, rewards, identity, gaming and more. NFT deployments tripled YoY, with Base and Zora leading in minting activity by 87%. DeFi also had a big year. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi grew 89% this year, with Ethereum taking the lead with 53%. Ethereum had 7x more TVL than Solana, its strongest competitor, with $16B. Restaking emerged in 2023 and grew to $30.6B this year. It has now become the largest sector in DeFi. EigenLayer spearheaded the growth in restaking as it saw its developer count grow more than twofold in 2024. 53% of EigenLayer developers are established and 39% of them are committed devs. Electric Capital’s report also shows stablecoins closing the year at an all-time high of $196B in circulation and $81B in daily transaction volume. Tether’s USDT is the runaway leader in stablecoin dominance, accounting for 72% of fiat-pegged tokens in circulation this year. Circle USDC’s 20% is its closest competition. Ethereum and TRON hosted the most issued stablecoins, with 59% and 35%, respectively. Arguably the catalysts for one of the best crypto years on record, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs had record-breaking launches. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $50B+ net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs achieved $13B in assets under management (AUM) since July.

Is it the technology, the community, or the potential returns for early investors? While the market evolves, three projects have captured the spotlight: Filecoin, EOS, and the innovative newcomer Qubetics ($TICS). These projects bring unique opportunities and updates, but Qubetics has generated a different buzz than any of them, particularly with its groundbreaking Web3 infrastructure and Top Crypto Presale to buy. Recent updates highlight exciting predictions for Filecoin and the potential of EOS. However, Qubetics takes centre stage with its ambitious plans, cutting-edge decentralised VPN service, and highly rewarding presale. This article will delve into the latest developments for all three projects, focusing on Qubetics and why it’s the most compelling opportunity for savvy investors. How Qubetics dVPN Is Changing the Game for Online Privacy Qubetics is making waves with its Web3 ecosystem, and a key highlight is its decentralised VPN (dVPN) . Unlike traditional VPNs that often log user data or are prone to censorship, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to ensure true privacy and security. Creating a peer-to-peer network eliminates centralised control, offering unrestricted and anonymous internet access. What makes this unique? First, the decentralised architecture ensures no single entity can control or compromise your data. This model provides unmatched transparency and censorship resistance. Additionally, users providing bandwidth are incentivised with $TICS tokens, transforming the service into a self-sustaining marketplace. Advanced features like multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption further enhance privacy and security. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session , connecting directly with its community to answer questions and share updates. This initiative underscores the project’s commitment to transparency and user engagement. With its dVPN, Qubetics isn’t just improving privacy—it’s setting a new standard for secure, decentralised internet access. Could this be the Top Crypto Presale to buy for those seeking long-term growth? Filecoin: Powering Decentralised Storage Solutions Filecoin continues to lead in decentralised storage, offering a secure and efficient alternative to traditional cloud providers. By enabling users to rent out unused hard drive space, Filecoin rewards participants with FIL tokens. This system, built on proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime mechanisms, ensures data reliability and long-term storage. Looking ahead, market analysts predict a steady price climb for Filecoin. By 2024, FIL is expected to average $17.28, with projections of $35.70 by 2027 and $58.80 by 2030. These forecasts highlight Filecoin’s potential as a long-term investment in the decentralised Web3 infrastructure. EOS: A High-Potential Altcoin for 2024 EOS offers a versatile blockchain platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. As Bitcoin sets the stage for another “Altseason,” EOS could see significant growth in 2024. Current projections suggest EOS might reach $1.165 by the end of the year, driven by increased developer adoption and market momentum. However, the token’s performance hinges on key factors such as adoption rates, competition from other blockchain platforms, and regulatory developments. Despite these uncertainties, EOS remains a promising contender for investors seeking exposure to altcoins in 2024. Qubetics Presale Is Exploding: The Top Crypto Presale to Buy Now Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS tokens at a low rate of $0.031. Each week, the token price rises by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike during the final phase. With over $5.9 million raised, 318 million tokens sold, and 9,000+ holders, Qubetics is rapidly gaining momentum. The numbers are compelling. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. For investors entering now, the potential ROI is staggering. A $10 target would mean a return of over 32,028%, while $15 could yield an ROI of approximately 48,092%. With the presale ending soon, this phase presents a golden opportunity to maximise gains. Qubetics has already demonstrated its appeal through its cutting-edge technology and growing community. The excitement surrounding the presale only strengthens its position as the top crypto presale to buy for 2024 . Will you seize this chance before the next phase kicks in? Conclusion: Why Qubetics Leads the Pack The cryptocurrency market offers countless opportunities, but few are as compelling as Qubetics. While Filecoin continues to innovate in decentralised storage and EOS positions itself for growth in the coming year, Qubetics stands out with its ambitious plans and exceptional ROI potential. Its decentralised VPN service and rapidly advancing presale make it the Top Crypto Presale to buy, offering a rare blend of technology and opportunity. As analysts predict meteoric growth for $TICS, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics revolution and secure your place in what could be the next major success story in the blockchain world.

The surge also follows a series of announcements, including new market listings and milestone achievements for the company. CZ’s Influence On December 11, Travala reported that its annual revenues had reached $100 million, up from $59.6 million in 2023. This achievement was made possible by the growing demand for flight and hotel bookings paid using crypto. It also coincided with the firm’s disclosure of a new strategy: It intends to hold a portion of its treasury reserve in AVA and Bitcoin in the manner popularized by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy . However, Zhao’s December 12 post on X highlighting his firm’s early investment in Travala, dating back to the pre-COVID era, tipped the scales, getting the market excited and fueling investor curiosity. Hailed as one of the “OG of Crypto” by some X users, Zhao’s influence within the blockchain and crypto sector is well-documented . By drawing attention to Binance’s early involvement, he not only reinforced Travala’s credibility but also signaled its potential for long-term growth – at least that’s how the market took it based on the price’s performance. According to the social metrics platform LunarCrush, CZ’s post, viewed more than 1.3 million times, caused a marked rise in AVA-related social activity. As a result, it experienced an explosive 350% price rally, jumping from $0.75 to a peak of $3.38 in just one day. Performance and Outlook At the time of this writing, the token was still almost 310% higher than its level from 24 hours ago. Its current price also represents a 286.6% improvement over seven days and an even more impressive 541% jump over 30 days. Additionally, it registered a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $890 million per data from CoinGecko, a 28,436% increase across the period, highlighting the catalytic nature of CZ’s post. With a circulating supply of 56.3 million units, each costing over $3.00, AVA now boasts a nearly $172 million valuation, placing it at #445 on the list of cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps. The token has massively outperformed the broader crypto market, which is down 2.20% in the last seven days, and similar Ethereum ecosystem assets, which are up 12.7% on average.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-13 23:53:00

This period of choppy price action has kept traders on edge, as Dogecoin’s price appears poised for a decisive move. Despite the temporary pause in upward momentum, market sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors anticipating another breakout. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s potential for a massive price surge. According to Hardy, it’s only a matter of time before DOGE breaks into new all-time highs. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is building a strong foundation, and continued consolidation at current levels is a bullish signal. If Dogecoin maintains support above $0.40, the stage could be set for a significant rally in the coming weeks. However, much will depend on broader market conditions and the ability of DOGE to sustain buying pressure. All eyes are on its ability to overcome resistance and resume its bullish trend. With whale activity and trading volumes showing signs of growth, Dogecoin could soon retest its highs, ushering in a new chapter of price discovery. Dogecoin Consolidates At Current Levels Dogecoin is consolidating below its yearly high of $0.484 after an impressive rally, and it appears this phase of sideways movement may persist for some time. While the price action has calmed, investor sentiment remains notably optimistic, with many viewing this consolidation as a stepping stone toward even higher price levels. Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, offering a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Hardy, DOGE’s current price action is a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend. He emphasized that the asset is building a solid base, which increases the likelihood of a significant breakout. Hardy’s projection suggests that Dogecoin is poised to surpass its yearly high and is also on track to achieve a new all-time high (ATH). In his analysis, Hardy highlighted key support levels around $0.40 and $0.36, indicating these areas as crucial for maintaining the bullish structure. He also mapped out a potential price trajectory, predicting that Dogecoin will consolidate at current levels for several weeks before resuming its upward momentum. His optimistic target for DOGE is $2, which he believes could be reached if the broader market remains favorable and buying pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength While consolidation may test the patience of traders, Hardy’s analysis aligns with the broader view that Dogecoin is preparing for another major leg up. A new ATH could be just around the corner as long as it holds key support levels and sentiment remains positive. DOGE Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.40 after a 24% retrace from its local highs. Despite this pullback, the price has exceeded this key demand level, signaling resilience among bulls. Market participants are closely watching the $0.40 zone, representing a critical point for determining the next move in DOGE’s price action. If DOGE can reclaim the $0.43 level in the coming days, it would likely set the stage for a retest of its yearly high at $0.484. A breakout above this resistance could reignite bullish momentum and pave the way for further upside, potentially attracting renewed interest from traders and investors. However, maintaining support and gaining traction is essential for this scenario to unfold. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details On the flip side, losing the $0.40 level could signal that bearish sentiment is gaining market control. In this case, DOGE might face a deeper correction, with the next critical support levels likely emerging near $0.36. Such a move would challenge the bullish outlook and delay DOGE’s efforts to reach new highs.

From humble beginnings as internet jokes, these coins have grown into investment powerhouses, delivering chef’s kiss gains to lucky holders. Financial freedom? It’s never looked this approachable—or this much fun. Leading the pack is none other than BTFD Coin, the rallying cry of every trader who knows how to “buy the dip.” The coin’s presale has bulldozed through the market, with a jaw-dropping $3.7 million raised, over 53 billion coins sold, and more than 5,000 holders locking horns for their share of the action.

Days later, he publicly confirmed a $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund inspired by Neiro. But the journey doesn’t stop at celebrity nods. Neiro’s origin story is as heartfelt as they come.

After being rugged by its initial developer, the community banded together to breathe new life into the project. Now, Neiro is 100% community-owned and driven, embodying a true decentralised ethos.

According to a Bloomberg article , the round now values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. OSS Capital, Duke Capital Partners, and PagsGroup also participated in the series A round. Liquid AI previously raised about $46.6 million in seed funding in 2023. Liquid AI wants to develop more efficient models The development comes as consumer generative AI, which captured global attention following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success has spurred developments across the world. The tech is now at the center of the fast-growing AI sector, which has seen investors pour billions of dollars into generative AI startups. For Liquid, the startup’s new models are known as Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) which the company says can deliver performance comparable or superior to traditional large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI, Google Cloud, and AWS. The LFMs are lightweight, general-purpose AI models requiring less data and compute power. The models strangely uses mathematical approaches discovered by studying a worm’s brain, as per Crunchbase. According to SiliconAngle , Liquid’s models are based on the concept of “liquid neural networks.” This classification is different from generative pre-trained transformer-based models or GPTs that support popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Google LLC’s Gemini. “At Liquid, our mission is to build the most capable and efficient AI systems at every scale.” Liquid CEO Ramin Hasani. “Since our inception, we have demonstrated the scalability of our technology by releasing text-based models, unveiling multimodal LFMs, and collaborating with key partners to showcase real-world impact,” added Hasani. AMD partnership will allow Liquid AI to optimize its LFMs According to SiliconAngle, the AI startup offers three model sizes, that is LFM-1B, a dense 1.3 billion parameter model for on-device such as mobile phones, LFM-3B, a 3.1 billion parameter model optimized for edge developments, and the LFM-40B Mixture of Experts, designed to tackle complex tasks. Liquid AI said LFMs have a reduced memory footprint compared to GPT architecture, which is more substantial for lengthy inputs, for instance when processing extremely long documents or video. The LFM-3.1B model, according to Liquid AI used significantly less memory than other small models when deployed than models such as Google LLC’s Gemma 2 2B-it or Meta’s Llama3.2 3B. Now, with this funding, Liquid AI has joined a strategic partnership with AMD bolstering its ability to optimize its foundation models with the chipmaker’s graphic, central, and neural processing units. The funding will also help the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup to develop tailored LFMs for industries like consumer electronics, biotechnology, telecoms, financial services, and e-commerce.

How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 00:58:00

ZK-Rollups current challenges ZK-Rollups are important for solving the issues blockchain has been struggling with for quite a while, such as scalability, cost, and privacy. They do this using an off-chain bundle of transactions that are validated using zero-knowledge proofs submitted to the main chain.

Despite these benefits, they also come along with several disadvantages. Some of them include complex development, computation-intensive proofs, difficulty in integrating dApps, and data availability issues for off-chain transactions, as seen previously in ZKsync . Sandor’s new position as co-founder of OpenZK can address ZK-Rollup’s present challenges and lay the ground for mass adoption and future growth of ZK-Rollups as a whole.
