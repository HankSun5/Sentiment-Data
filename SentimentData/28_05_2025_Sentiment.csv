A significant step has been taken towards potentially bringing a SUI ETF to mainstream investors. Asset management firm 21Shares has officially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a spot SUI ETF on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This move is generating considerable buzz within the Cryptocurrency ETF space and for the SUI community. What Exactly Did 21Shares File for a Spot SUI ETF? On May 23, 21Shares submitted a 19b-4 rule change filing to the SEC. This filing is a crucial step required by exchanges (in this case, Nasdaq ) when proposing a rule change that would allow a new type of product, like a spot crypto ETF, to be listed and traded. This follows their initial S-1 registration statement filing on May 1, which outlines the proposed structure and details of the fund itself. Think of the S-1 as the blueprint for the ETF, and the 19b-4 as the formal request to the exchange ( Nasdaq ) and the regulator (SEC) to allow trading of that blueprint’s product. The proposed SUI ETF would hold actual SUI tokens, relying on reputable custodians like Bitgo and Coinbase Custody to securely store the underlying assets. This structure is what defines it as a ‘spot’ ETF, directly tracking the price of SUI by holding the asset itself. Why is a Spot ETF Such a Big Deal for SUI and Crypto? The concept of a Spot ETF for cryptocurrencies has been a major topic of discussion and anticipation. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset. For SUI, this means the fund would own SUI tokens. Here’s why this is significant: Increased Accessibility: A Spot ETF makes it much easier for traditional investors, including institutions and retail investors with brokerage accounts, to gain exposure to SUI without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, set up wallets, or worry about private keys. Regulatory Clarity: SEC approval of a SUI ETF would lend a degree of regulatory legitimacy to SUI as an asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential for Greater Liquidity: As more capital flows in through an ETF structure, it could potentially increase liquidity and market efficiency for SUI. Mainstream Adoption: Listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq places SUI alongside traditional financial assets, integrating it further into the mainstream financial system. This move by 21Shares is part of a broader trend where asset managers are pushing for regulated investment products for various cryptocurrencies, following the successful launches of spot Bitcoin and potentially spot Ethereum ETFs. What Are the Challenges and Next Steps for the SUI ETF Filing? While the filing is a positive development, it’s not a guarantee of approval. The path to launching a Cryptocurrency ETF in the U.S., especially a Spot ETF for an altcoin like SUI, involves navigating the SEC’s rigorous review process. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC examines factors like market manipulation concerns, investor protection, and the readiness of the underlying market. Precedent: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, approval for other altcoins is less certain and depends on the SEC’s evolving stance and assessment of each specific asset’s market. Timing: The SEC has specific timelines for reviewing 19b-4 filings, which can involve comment periods and potential delays. The next steps involve the SEC reviewing the filing, potentially soliciting public comments, and ultimately deciding whether to approve or deny the rule change. The crypto community and potential investors will be closely watching for updates from the SEC regarding this SUI ETF proposal from 21Shares . How Does This Filing Fit into the Broader Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape? The filing for a SUI ETF by 21Shares highlights the growing interest from traditional finance in offering regulated investment products for a wider range of digital assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. It signifies a maturation of the crypto market and increasing demand from investors for familiar, regulated avenues to access these assets. This development, alongside filings for other single-asset crypto ETFs and thematic crypto funds, paints a picture of a financial ecosystem slowly but surely integrating digital assets. The success or challenges faced by this specific SUI ETF filing could potentially set precedents or provide insights for future altcoin ETF applications. What Does This Mean for SUI Holders and Enthusiasts? For those already invested in SUI or following the project, the filing of a Spot ETF is generally seen as a bullish signal. It indicates growing institutional interest and the potential for significant new capital inflows if approved. While the immediate price impact is speculative, the long-term implications of increased accessibility and legitimacy could be substantial. It’s important for investors to stay informed about the filing process and understand that SEC approval is not guaranteed. However, the fact that firms like 21Shares are actively pursuing these products underscores the perceived potential and demand for SUI within the broader financial market. In conclusion, 21Shares ‘ filing for a Spot SUI ETF on Nasdaq is a pivotal moment for the SUI ecosystem and the broader Cryptocurrency ETF market. While challenges remain, the filing represents a significant step towards potentially bringing SUI into the portfolios of a wider range of investors through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. The coming months will be critical as the SEC reviews this proposal.

A significant transaction recently caught the eye of market watchers, specifically a substantial ETH transfer . We’re talking about 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $265 million, making its way from the Arbitrum network directly to the Binance exchange. This kind of activity, often highlighted by services like Whale Alert, raises immediate questions about market dynamics and potential future actions. What Happened with this Significant ETH Transfer ? The core event is straightforward: a single, massive transfer of 100,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens occurred. This isn’t your everyday transaction; it represents a considerable portion of value moving across networks. The source was identified as a wallet on the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution, and the destination was a wallet associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Whale Alert, a service that tracks large crypto transactions, was the first to publicly report this movement, bringing it to the attention of traders and analysts worldwide. To put the scale into perspective: Amount: 100,000 ETH Approximate Value: $265 million (at the time of the report) Origin: Arbitrum Network Destination: Binance Exchange Reported By: Whale Alert This kind of movement is often associated with a ‘ crypto whale ‘ – an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their actions can sometimes have a noticeable impact on market sentiment and liquidity. Why Move Funds From Arbitrum to Binance ? Exploring the Reasons Moving such a large sum of ETH from a Layer 2 network like Arbitrum to a centralized exchange like Binance isn’t done without reason. Arbitrum is popular for its lower transaction fees and faster speeds compared to the Ethereum mainnet, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or simply holding assets efficiently. Moving funds OFF a Layer 2 and ONTO a CEX suggests a shift in intended activity. Here are some common motivations behind such a large ETH transfer : Preparing to Sell: The most common assumption is that the owner intends to sell some or all of the ETH on the exchange. Centralized exchanges like Binance offer high liquidity, making it possible to execute large sell orders without drastically impacting the price (though a $265M order would still require careful execution). Arbitrage Opportunities: The whale might be moving funds to capitalize on price differences between Binance and other exchanges or platforms. Staking or Earning: While staking is possible on Layer 2, Binance offers various staking, lending, or yield-generating products that the whale might want to utilize. Increased Security (Perceived): Some large holders prefer the perceived security and insurance offered by major centralized exchanges for storing significant assets, especially if they are less active in DeFi. Consolidation: The whale might be consolidating funds from various sources (including Arbitrum) into one place, likely on an exchange, to manage their portfolio more easily or prepare for a large transaction. Funding Other Activities: The funds might be moved to Binance to be converted into other cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, or to fund operations elsewhere. Without direct knowledge of the wallet owner’s identity or strategy, these remain potential explanations. However, the move from a L2 focused on decentralized activity back to a centralized hub like Binance is a key detail. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale ? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their large holdings mean their trading activities can potentially influence market prices due to the sheer volume involved. While the identity behind this specific ETH transfer remains anonymous (as is common in crypto), tracking whale movements is a popular strategy among traders trying to anticipate market shifts. Key characteristics of whale activity: Large Transaction Sizes: Easily moving millions or billions of dollars worth of crypto. Potential Market Impact: Their buy or sell orders can absorb or add significant liquidity. Strategic Movements: Whales often move funds between wallets, exchanges, or networks as part of a larger strategy (e.g., accumulating, distributing, preparing for news events). Anonymity (Often): While transactions are public on the blockchain, linking them to a specific real-world identity is difficult unless the address is publicly associated with an exchange or known entity. This particular whale, moving 100,000 ETH from Arbitrum to Binance , is certainly flexing considerable financial muscle. Understanding their potential motives is crucial for interpreting the event’s significance. What Does This Large ETH Transfer Mean for the Market? A large ETH transfer , especially one of this magnitude ($265M) moving onto a major exchange like Binance , immediately triggers speculation about potential market impact. Here’s a breakdown of what it could signify and the challenges it presents for market interpretation: Potential Implications: Increased Selling Pressure: The most common concern is that the whale intends to sell, which could add selling pressure to the market, potentially leading to a price drop if executed quickly or as a large market order. Liquidity Shift: Moving funds to Binance increases the exchange’s ETH liquidity, which can be beneficial for large trades but also facilitates large sell-offs. Market Sentiment Indicator: Some traders view large transfers to exchanges as a bearish signal, assuming intent to sell. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as bullish (holding or moving to cold storage/DeFi). Preparation for Volatility: Whales sometimes position their assets on exchanges when anticipating significant market volatility, making it easier to react quickly. Challenges in Interpretation: Unknown Intent: As discussed, the whale might not sell immediately or at all. They could be preparing for other strategies. Execution Strategy: Even if they plan to sell, they might do so gradually through over-the-counter (OTC) deals or limit orders spread over time, minimizing market impact. Multiple Factors: The crypto market is influenced by countless factors – macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, technological updates, overall market sentiment – not just single whale movements. Actionable Insights for Readers: While a single whale move isn’t a definitive market predictor, it’s a data point to consider. Keep an eye on the market’s reaction in the short term. Understand that while this large ETH transfer is significant, it’s just one piece of the complex market puzzle. Don’t make trading decisions based solely on this event, but use it as part of your broader market analysis. Summary: Watching the Waves Made by the Crypto Whale The transfer of 100,000 ETH from Arbitrum to Binance is undoubtedly a notable event, highlighting the movements of a major crypto whale . This large ETH transfer , valued at $265 million, sparks crucial questions about the whale’s intentions, with potential reasons ranging from preparing to sell to leveraging exchange services. While such movements can sometimes precede significant price action, interpreting their exact impact is challenging due to the anonymity and varied potential strategies of the whale. Market participants should view this event as an important data point reported by Whale Alert, but remember that the crypto market’s direction is shaped by a confluence of factors. Staying informed about these large transfers, particularly onto major exchanges like Binance , is part of being a vigilant market observer.

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company behind Truth Social, is reportedly making a massive move into the cryptocurrency space. This isn’t just a small pilot program; the company has announced plans to raise a significant amount of capital specifically to build a substantial Bitcoin Treasury . Trump Media’s Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Plan Takes Shape According to recent reports, Trump Media has entered into agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors. The goal? To raise a staggering $2.5 billion. This capital infusion is structured in two parts: $1.5 billion will come from common stock offerings, and an additional $1 billion will be raised through convertible notes. This significant fundraising effort underscores the company’s serious intent. The primary stated purpose for deploying these funds is to establish a corporate Bitcoin Treasury . This means the company intends to convert a portion of the raised capital into Bitcoin, holding it on its balance sheet as a reserve asset. If executed as planned, this would position Trump Media as one of the largest public companies globally by the sheer size of its potential BTC Holdings . Key details emerging about this planned offering include: Total Raise Amount: $2.5 billion Funding Structure: $1.5B via common stock, $1B via convertible notes Number of Investors: Around 50 institutional investors Primary Use of Funds: Establishing a Bitcoin Treasury Expected Closing Date: By May 29 Custody Providers: Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital This strategic decision highlights a growing trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and low-yielding instruments. Why Corporate Bitcoin? Understanding the Treasury Trend The concept of a Corporate Bitcoin treasury gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns. Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy, arguing that holding Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against currency devaluation and serves as a superior store of value compared to cash reserves. Several factors motivate companies to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies through inflation. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time, potentially boosting shareholder value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset can help diversify financial risk. Signaling Innovation: Holding Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and embrace of new technologies. While the primary drivers often relate to macroeconomic concerns and potential financial upside, the decision also involves embracing a relatively new and volatile asset class. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Who Else is Entering the Space? Trump Media’s move is part of a broader wave of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve seen increasing interest and investment from hedge funds, asset managers, and even other public corporations. Some notable public companies that have allocated significant capital to BTC Holdings include: Company Primary Business Reported BTC Holdings (Approx.) Notes MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Pioneer in the corporate treasury strategy, continues to accumulate. Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Purchased early, sold a portion, currently holds a significant amount. Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services & Mobile Payments ~8,030 BTC fintech company, strong advocate for Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~18,000 BTC Bitcoin miner holding a substantial portion of mined coins. Note: These figures are approximate and subject to change based on company disclosures and market activity. The involvement of approximately 50 institutional investors in Trump Media’s fundraising round further underscores the growing appetite among traditional financial players for exposure to the digital asset space, even if indirectly through a public company’s balance sheet. Estimating Trump Media’s Potential BTC Holdings If Trump Media were to allocate a substantial portion of the $2.5 billion raise towards purchasing Bitcoin, its potential BTC Holdings could be significant. For context, MicroStrategy’s current holdings are valued in the billions of dollars. A $2.5 billion allocation, depending on the prevailing Bitcoin price at the time of purchase, could place Trump Media among the top corporate holders globally. For example, if Bitcoin were trading around $60,000 per coin, a $1 billion allocation could potentially acquire over 16,000 BTC. A $2 billion allocation could acquire over 33,000 BTC. These numbers would immediately position Trump Media’s treasury alongside or even exceeding some of the existing large corporate holders, excluding dedicated Bitcoin mining or investment firms. The exact amount allocated to Bitcoin will depend on the company’s treasury management strategy and other potential uses for the raised capital. However, the stated intent to establish a “Bitcoin treasury” suggests a meaningful allocation is planned. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury While the potential upsides of holding Bitcoin are attractive, establishing a Bitcoin Treasury also comes with unique challenges and risks that companies must carefully consider. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The primary allure is the potential for Bitcoin’s value to increase significantly over time, boosting the company’s balance sheet value. Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against inflation and currency debasement, particularly relevant in the current global economic climate. Enhanced Profile: Can attract investors interested in technology and digital assets, potentially broadening the company’s shareholder base. Significant Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which can introduce significant volatility to the company’s balance sheet and earnings reports. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance and legal risks. Security and Custody: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Relying on reputable custodians like Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital is crucial. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, potentially impacting how holdings are reported and taxed. Public and Shareholder Scrutiny: The decision to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin may face criticism from some shareholders or the public. Companies adopting this strategy must implement robust risk management frameworks and ensure transparent communication with their investors. What’s Next for Trump Media and Corporate Crypto? The expected closing of the $2.5 billion offering by May 29 is a key date to watch. Following the successful raise, the focus will shift to how and when Trump Media begins accumulating Bitcoin for its treasury. The market reaction to this news, both for TMKG shares and the Bitcoin price itself, will also be closely monitored. This move by a high-profile, publicly traded company could potentially encourage other corporations, perhaps those previously hesitant, to explore adding digital assets to their balance sheets. It further validates the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance, driven by growing Institutional Bitcoin interest. The role of the chosen custodians, Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital, is also noteworthy. These platforms provide the secure infrastructure necessary for managing large-scale BTC Holdings , a critical component for any corporate treasury strategy involving digital assets. Ultimately, Trump Media’s plan to establish a large Bitcoin Treasury through this significant fundraising effort marks a notable development in the intersection of traditional finance, public companies, and the evolving world of cryptocurrency. It’s a story that will continue to unfold, offering insights into the future of corporate finance and the increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.

An earlier attempt failed on a bipartisan basis after Senate Democrats, led by long-time crypto sceptic Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as several Republicans including Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Kentucky’s Rand Paul, voted against cloture. Lummis, whose staff (along with that of the bill’s co-sponsor, Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York)) has played a key role in the behind-the-scenes negotiations to get the GENIUS Act passed, said that she thinks the Senate has reached a final deal. If the bill passes, both Lummis and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), the bill's sponsor, claimed that it would be the first piece of legislation passed out of the Senate Banking Committee in eight years. “It’s taken a tremendous amount of work,” Hagerty said, speaking on a separate panel discussion on Tuesday. Hagerty added that long-time crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the bill’s main opponent, made a concerted effort to drag out the proceedings in the hopes of stalling the legislation’s progress. Hagerty said that the bill, once passed, would be the most bipartisan piece of legislation to pass through the Senate Banking Committee in over a decade. While the bill’s supporters see that as a win, they’re also frustrated with the difficulty in getting legislation in general passed through the committee. “We don’t have the muscle memory anymore to legislate. That’s our job,” Lummis said. “It really is very frustrating, very exhausting, and you have to keep your creativity, your sense of humor and your patience about you.” Lummis added that she was “very hopeful” the Senate could work behind-the-scenes with the House on a market structure bill, noting that the House has the advantage of “muscle memory” (following its passage of FIT21 last year) over the Senate when it comes to the next hurdle of crypto legislation.",Policy|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-27 23:18:10

Strive, a name increasingly associated with strategic investments, has just closed a substantial Strive PIPE round , pulling in a remarkable $750 million. This isn’t just another funding announcement; it signals an aggressive move into specific, often overlooked, corners of the market, particularly those involving Bitcoin claims and broader crypto acquisition strategies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s a noteworthy development for anyone following the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. Unpacking the $750M Strive PIPE Round So, what exactly happened? Strive successfully completed a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) round. This is a way for a publicly traded company (or one planning to go public soon) to raise capital by selling stock directly to a select group of accredited investors, often at a discount to the current market price. In this case, Strive raised an initial $750 million by selling shares at $1.35 each. But wait, there’s more. The deal includes an option to increase the total funding by another $750 million upon the exercise of warrants. This means the potential total capital infusion could reach a staggering $1.5 billion, providing Strive with significant firepower for its stated objectives. Why use a PIPE? For companies, it can be a faster way to raise large sums of capital compared to traditional public offerings. For investors, it offers a chance to buy shares at a potentially favorable price, especially if they believe in the company’s long-term strategy. This particular Strive PIPE round is one of the larger ones seen recently, especially within the context of digital asset-related ventures, highlighting the growing institutional appetite for exposure to this sector, albeit through structured deals. Where is This Massive Digital Asset Investment Headed? According to reports, the primary purpose of this significant capital raise is to fuel Strive’s acquisition strategy. This isn’t a simple buy-and-hold Bitcoin play. Strive is targeting a diverse range of assets, indicating a complex, multi-pronged approach: Biotech Firms: This might seem surprising in a crypto context, but it suggests Strive is building a diversified portfolio, potentially leveraging insights or capital from one sector to support another. It highlights that Strive’s ambitions extend beyond just digital assets. Distressed Bitcoin Claims: This is where things get particularly interesting for the crypto community. Strive is specifically looking to acquire claims related to situations where Bitcoin or other digital assets are tied up, often due to exchange failures, hacks, or legal disputes. Discounted Structured Bitcoin Credit Instruments: This refers to complex financial products where Bitcoin is involved, often as collateral or part of a lending/borrowing arrangement, that are currently trading below their intrinsic value. This strategy suggests Strive is looking for value in non-traditional places, leveraging potential discounts available in complex or distressed situations rather than just buying liquid assets on the open market. Focusing on Distressed Bitcoin Claims: The Mt. Gox Angle The mention of Mt Gox claims is particularly noteworthy. Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, which famously collapsed in 2014 after a massive hack. Years later, rehabilitation efforts are still ongoing to return a portion of the lost Bitcoin to creditors. These claims have been traded privately for years, often at significant discounts to the market value of the underlying Bitcoin, due to the uncertainty and long timeline involved in the recovery process. Strive’s interest in Bitcoin claims like those from Mt. Gox signals a belief that the potential upside from resolving these claims outweighs the risks and complexities. Buying distressed claims requires specialized legal and financial expertise to navigate the recovery process and potentially profit from the difference between the purchase price and the eventual payout. This isn’t limited to Mt. Gox. There are other instances of exchanges or platforms where customer assets have been frozen or lost, creating opportunities to acquire these distressed claims at a discount. Strive appears to be positioning itself as a major player in this niche, aiming to capitalize on the eventual release of these locked-up digital assets. The Broader Impact of This Crypto Acquisition Strategy What does Strive’s aggressive crypto acquisition plan mean for the wider market? Firstly, it validates the idea that there is significant value locked up in distressed digital asset situations. A $750M-$1.5B war chest dedicated partly to acquiring these assets could accelerate the process of getting some of this capital back into circulation, potentially impacting market liquidity and sentiment. Secondly, it highlights the increasing sophistication of institutional players entering the digital asset space. Strive isn’t just buying Bitcoin; they are engaging in complex financial engineering and distressed asset recovery, strategies common in traditional finance but relatively new on a large scale in crypto. Thirdly, the focus on discounted structured credit instruments involving Bitcoin shows a growing interest in the more complex layers of the digital asset ecosystem beyond just spot trading. This suggests maturation in the market, with players seeking opportunities in derivatives, lending, and structured products. Potential Benefits and Opportunities Strive’s strategy could unlock several benefits: For Strive: Potential for significant returns by acquiring assets below market value and successfully navigating recovery processes. Diversification across biotech and digital assets. For Claim Holders: Provides liquidity options for those holding distressed Bitcoin claims who prefer cash now over waiting years for an uncertain payout. For the Market: Could help clear up legacy issues like Mt. Gox, potentially returning significant amounts of Bitcoin to circulation. Signals strong institutional confidence in the long-term value of digital assets, even those tied up in complex situations. Challenges and Risks Ahead However, this strategy is not without its hurdles: Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and recovering value from distressed assets is complex and requires specialized expertise and legal work. Market Volatility: The value of the underlying Bitcoin or other digital assets can fluctuate wildly, impacting the profitability of claims and credit instruments.

Worldpay, a giant in the payment processing world, is stepping firmly into the realm of digital currencies by enabling USDC payouts for its clients in the United States and Europe. This move isn’t just news; it’s a clear signal that major financial players see the value and necessity of integrating crypto solutions into mainstream finance, particularly for businesses operating across borders. Worldpay’s Major Step into Crypto Payments Worldpay, known for processing trillions of dollars in transactions annually ($2.5 trillion last year alone, to be precise), is a critical piece of infrastructure for businesses worldwide. Their decision to support payouts in USDC, a leading regulated stablecoin, marks a pivotal moment. It signifies a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets within established financial systems. For years, cross-border payments have been plagued by delays, high fees, and complex processes. Worldpay’s embrace of crypto payments via USDC aims to tackle these very pain points head-on, offering a potentially faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative for global businesses. What is Worldpay Offering? USDC Payouts Explained At its core, Worldpay is enabling businesses to send funds directly to recipients using USDC . Instead of relying solely on traditional banking rails that can involve multiple intermediaries and take days to settle, businesses can now leverage the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology. This service is specifically designed for companies that have significant global disbursement needs – think platforms paying international freelancers, marketplaces settling with overseas sellers, or corporations sending funds to remote employees or partners. The integration is being facilitated with support from specialized crypto infrastructure providers BVNK and Fireblocks, ensuring robust and secure handling of digital assets within Worldpay’s existing framework. Here’s a simple breakdown of what this means: For Businesses: They can initiate payouts through their Worldpay interface. Behind the Scenes: Worldpay, supported by partners like BVNK and Fireblocks, handles the conversion and transfer of funds into USDC on the blockchain. For Recipients: They receive USDC directly, often in minutes rather than days, provided they have a compatible digital wallet address. Why Stablecoin for Global Disbursements? The choice of stablecoin , specifically USDC, is crucial here. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency (in USDC’s case, the US dollar). This stability is paramount for payments and disbursements. Businesses need predictability; they need to know that the value of the funds they send today will be the same when the recipient receives them. Volatility is the enemy of payroll and supplier payments. By using a stablecoin , Worldpay mitigates this risk, making digital currency payouts a viable and attractive option for standard business operations where value preservation is key. Benefits of using a stablecoin like USDC for payouts include: Value Stability: Reduces exchange rate risk compared to volatile crypto assets. Speed: Transactions can settle much faster than traditional methods, often within minutes. Cost-Effectiveness: Can potentially offer lower transaction fees, especially for cross-border transfers. 24/7 Availability: Blockchain networks operate around the clock, unlike traditional banking hours. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (though recipient identity is not always public, the transaction itself is traceable). The Role of BVNK and Fireblocks in This Digital Currency Move Worldpay isn’t building this infrastructure entirely from scratch. They are leveraging the expertise of specialized firms in the digital asset space. BVNK likely provides the crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, handling aspects like crypto-to-fiat conversions and regulatory compliance in the digital asset realm. Fireblocks is a leading provider of secure digital asset custody and transfer technology, ensuring that the movement and storage of the digital currency (USDC) are protected against hacks and operational risks. This collaboration highlights a common trend: large traditional finance companies partnering with established crypto infrastructure providers to safely and efficiently enter the digital asset market. Benefits for Businesses Using Worldpay USDC Payouts So, why should a business consider switching to USDC payouts via Worldpay ? The advantages are compelling, particularly for those with a global footprint: 1. Faster Settlement Times: Waiting days for international wires can impact cash flow and operational efficiency. USDC transactions can settle in minutes, drastically speeding up payment cycles. 2. Reduced Costs: Traditional cross-border payments often involve multiple correspondent banks, each adding fees. Blockchain transactions can cut out intermediaries, potentially lowering costs significantly, especially for frequent or smaller transfers. 3. 24/7 Global Reach: The traditional financial system operates on business hours and weekends. Blockchain is always on, enabling businesses to send payouts anytime, anywhere, instantly reaching recipients across different time zones. 4. Access to New Markets/Recipients: For individuals or businesses in regions with limited access to traditional banking but growing crypto adoption, receiving USDC might be easier and more accessible than receiving a bank transfer. 5. Enhanced Transparency: While not absolute anonymity, the blockchain provides a clear, immutable record of transactions, which can simplify reconciliation and auditing processes. Navigating Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are significant, businesses considering USDC payouts should also be aware of potential challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is still evolving globally. Businesses need to ensure they and their recipients comply with local laws regarding digital asset holdings and transactions. Recipient Onboarding: Recipients need to have a compatible digital wallet and understand how to receive and potentially convert USDC. Worldpay and its partners will likely provide tools or guidance, but recipient education is key. Integration Complexity: While Worldpay aims to make it seamless, integrating new payment methods into existing accounting and treasury systems requires planning. USDC Specifics: While stable, USDC’s stability relies on its reserves. Businesses should understand how USDC is backed and regulated (Circle is a regulated entity, and USDC is subject to audits). Tax Implications: Handling and transacting in digital currencies have tax implications that businesses need to understand and manage according to relevant jurisdictions. Real-World Applications and Examples Who stands to benefit most from this new service? Consider these scenarios: Freelance Platforms: Paying remote workers across the globe quickly and affordably. E-commerce Marketplaces: Settling payments with international sellers or suppliers. Gaming Platforms: Distributing rewards or earnings to players worldwide. Payroll for Remote Teams: Sending salaries or stipends to employees in different countries. Remittance Services: Offering faster and potentially cheaper ways for individuals to receive money from abroad (though Worldpay’s focus is B2B/B2B2C). These examples illustrate the practical, tangible benefits of leveraging a stablecoin like USDC for routine business disbursements. It moves crypto beyond speculation and into a tool for operational efficiency. The Broader Impact on Finance Worldpay’s move is more than just a new feature; it’s a bellwether for the future of global finance. When a player of Worldpay’s size and influence integrates digital currencies, it signals a maturing market and encourages further institutional adoption. It validates the potential of stablecoins as a reliable medium of exchange for mainstream financial activities. This could pave the way for other large payment processors and financial institutions to explore similar integrations, accelerating the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It also puts pressure on traditional payment networks to innovate and improve their speed and cost-efficiency. Conclusion: A New Era for Global Payments Worldpay’s introduction of USDC payouts in the U.S. and Europe is a significant development for businesses with global payment needs. By leveraging the stability of USDC and the underlying blockchain technology, supported by experts like BVNK and Fireblocks, Worldpay is offering a compelling alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. While challenges related to regulation and adoption remain, the benefits of speed, cost-efficiency, and 24/7 availability are clear. This move solidifies the role of stablecoins like USDC as practical tools for global commerce and signals a promising future where digital currency is seamlessly integrated into the world’s financial infrastructure, potentially revolutionizing how businesses send and receive money across borders.

While our primary focus is on the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, understanding movements in traditional markets, particularly the stock market open , is crucial. This is because there’s often a significant crypto market impact tied to shifts in broader investor confidence and capital flows. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters to you. Decoding the Positive US Stock Markets Open The trading day commenced with a notable uptick across major indices, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. This higher open didn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s typically influenced by a confluence of factors, ranging from economic data releases and corporate earnings reports to geopolitical developments and overall market psychology. When US stock markets start the day strong, it can suggest increased risk appetite, which sometimes spills over into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Breaking Down the Numbers: S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow The positive momentum is clearly reflected in the performance of the key benchmarks shortly after the open: S&P 500: Gained 0.88% NASDAQ Composite: Saw a significant rise of 1.37% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Increased by 0.59% These numbers indicate broad-based strength, with technology and growth stocks, heavily represented in the NASDAQ, showing particular vigor. The S&P 500 , often seen as a barometer for the broader market, also posted solid gains. This collective upward movement paints a picture of optimism pervading the traditional financial sector. The Crypto Market Impact: Understanding the Correlation Now, let’s connect the dots. The relationship between traditional markets and crypto is complex and evolving. At times, Bitcoin and altcoins have acted as uncorrelated assets, moving independently. However, in recent years, particularly with increased institutional involvement, we’ve seen periods of strong correlation. A positive stock market open , especially one driven by factors like easing inflation fears or strong economic outlooks, can foster a risk-on environment. In such an environment, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies. This potential crypto market impact is why monitoring traditional indices is valuable for crypto enthusiasts. What This Investor Sentiment Shift Could Mean A higher open across major indices like the S&P 500 often reflects improving investor sentiment . When confidence is high, market participants are more willing to invest, leading to increased buying pressure. This positive mood can be contagious, potentially influencing sentiment in adjacent markets like crypto. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers (regulatory news, technological developments, specific project updates), positive macroeconomic tailwinds and robust investor sentiment in traditional finance can provide a supportive backdrop. Benefits of Positive Stock Market Sentiment for Crypto: Potential for increased capital inflow into crypto. Improved overall market confidence. Reduced panic selling driven by macroeconomic fears. Challenges and Nuances: Correlation isn’t guaranteed; crypto can decouple. Specific crypto news can outweigh traditional market influence. Volatility remains inherent in the crypto space regardless of stock market performance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive US stock markets open and the potential for a positive crypto market impact , what should crypto investors consider? Observe Correlation: Pay attention to whether crypto assets are tracking traditional markets or showing independent movement. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising stock market often signals higher risk appetite. Consider if this aligns with your own investment strategy. Stay Informed: While stock market news is relevant, remember that crypto markets have their own ecosystem of news and developments that are equally, if not more, important. Diversify Wisely: A strong traditional market doesn’t eliminate crypto volatility. Maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. The current stock market open provides a snapshot of the broader financial mood. While it’s a positive sign, it’s just one piece of the puzzle when navigating the crypto landscape. Summary In conclusion, US stock markets saw a strong open today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ, and Dow all posting gains. This positive start reflects improved investor sentiment in traditional finance. While the connection isn’t always direct, a robust stock market open can potentially have a positive crypto market impact by fostering a risk-on environment. Crypto investors should monitor these trends as part of a broader strategy, keeping in mind the unique drivers and inherent volatility of the digital asset space.

According to on-chain researcher Carmelo Alemán, TRX could “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if BTC continues its bull run through the rest of the year. A Catalyst for Altcoin Growth Bitcoin, down 0.5% in 24 hours to trade at $109,500 at this writing, remains the gravitational force in crypto markets. As Alemán noted in a May 27 quick take on CryptoQuant, tokens with a high association to BTC, usually measured using the Pearson coefficient, tend to amplify gains during bull cycles. “A strong correlation with Bitcoin means that tokens sharing this dynamic could experience significantly assured growth,” the analyst wrote. They highlighted cryptocurrencies like TRX, Sui (SUI), Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) for their historical synchronicity with BTC’s movements. According to them, while Bitcoin’s $2.17 trillion market cap limits its upside, TRX’s $26 billion valuation offers more explosive potential. “Bitcoin is unlikely to grow more than 2x from its current price,” argued the researcher. “Highly correlated tokens could triple, quadruple, or more, simply because their smaller market caps make such expansions more feasible.” The king cryptocurrency’s current rally has created fertile ground for connected altcoins. Although it has cooled slightly from its May 22 all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, it has risen 16.4% over the past month. Still, its seven-day performance shows a more modest 3.7% uptick. Nonetheless, the broader trajectory remains bullish, with BTC up 60% across the last 12 months, riding on the back of institutional demand and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. Against this backdrop, TRX has edged out its more established counterpart across multiple timeframes. Since yesterday, the token has risen 1.9%, while over the last 30 days it has gained more than 10.4%. However, across the year, TRX has really shone, with its 146.4% improvement more than doubling BTC’s gains in the same period. The upward trend has brought the altcoin to $0.2768, just 35% below its ATH of $0.4313, reached in December last year. TRX’s Resilience and Risk Metrics Signal Strength It’s not the BTC tie-in alone that’s driving bullish sentiment. Tron has seen rapid network growth and increased adoption across Asia. Additionally, in a historic shift, the supply of Tether (USDT) on the network surpassed that on Ethereum, signaling rising utility and trust. CryptoQuant’s recent drawdown heatmaps and risk metrics back this up, showing that TRX maintains one of the most resilient positions in the market, even as other altcoins stumble. The token’s 180-day Sharpe Ratio stands between 0.1 and 0.15, while its Normalized Risk Metric hovers near 0.5, indicating a strong risk-return profile. Mid this month, data from the on-chain analytics platform also revealed that all TRX holders, from one-week traders to long-term investors, were in profit . This rare alignment often triggers a positive feedback loop, as lucrative users tend to evangelize the asset, attracting new entrants.

According to crypto data from Coingecko, BNB price gained over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $687 on Tuesday, during the late North American trading session, As a result, BNB regained a market cap of over $100 billion, with a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1 billion. The notable surge in crypto FOMO significantly helped BNB price to regain bullish sentiment amid the highly anticipated altseason. BNB Rises on Favorable Fundamentals The rise and adoption of the BNB chain by mainstream users has heavily bolstered the success of its decentralized financial products. For instance, the PancakeSwap (CAKE ) has continued to record historical daily volume following the notable mainstream adoption of the ecosystem’s tokens and memecoins. According to market data from Defillama, the BSC network had a total value locked of about $6.5 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $10.1 billion. Most importantly, the BSC chain recorded a daily average active users of about 2 million. Short Term Targets BNB price has gradually followed Bitcoin (BTC) price action in the past two months. In the past three weeks, BNB price has consolidated in a symmetrical ascending triangular pattern, with a crucial resistance level around $687. As a result, it is safe to assume that the BNB bulls have been gaining more ground over the sellers in the past. With Bitcoin price on the cusp of a major rally, catalyzed by heightened demand from institutional investors , BNB price is well positioned to rally beyond $687. Moreover, the four-hour MACD line remains above the zero line amid the growing bullish histograms. As the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) works on piercing the 70 percent level, BNB price is aiming at rallying above $790 soon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 23:49:04

A recent, alarming development in Paris highlights this dark side, where police have made significant arrests in connection with violent crypto-related kidnapping attempts. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the growing threat of crypto crime Paris and the urgent need for enhanced security measures among crypto holders. Understanding the Rise of Crypto Crime Paris Why are individuals with cryptocurrency holdings becoming targets for violent crime? The answer lies in the perceived wealth associated with digital assets and the pseudonymous nature of transactions, which some criminals mistakenly believe makes tracking impossible. While blockchain technology offers transparency, accessing someone’s digital wallet, especially under duress, presents a direct path to potential riches for criminals. The crypto crime Paris cases are not isolated incidents but reflect a disturbing global trend where digital wealth is translating into real-world physical threats. Criminals are becoming more sophisticated, moving beyond online scams to physical violence. This escalation underscores a critical challenge for the crypto community: how to enjoy the benefits of digital assets without becoming a target. Details of the Shocking Crypto Kidnapping Cases The recent arrests in Paris are linked to at least two particularly brutal cases of crypto kidnapping . According to reports, these weren’t random acts but targeted attacks on individuals believed to hold substantial cryptocurrency. One victim was the father of a well-known poker player, while the other target was the daughter of a crypto exchange CEO. These choices suggest criminals are researching and identifying individuals associated with the crypto industry or those known for significant digital asset holdings. The violence involved in these attempts is particularly chilling. Victims were reportedly assaulted, with one suffering a horrific injury, losing a finger. Such brutality highlights the extreme lengths these criminals are willing to go to extort digital assets. The successful police operation leading to the Paris crypto arrests is a crucial step in disrupting such rings, but the incidents themselves serve as a grim warning to others. Paris Crypto Arrests: Police Action and Warnings French authorities have taken decisive action, leading to the Paris crypto arrests of 12 suspects. It’s concerning to note that this group reportedly included minors, indicating the potential for recruitment of younger individuals into these dangerous criminal activities. The police investigation into these crypto kidnapping plots underscores the increasing focus of law enforcement on crimes involving digital assets, particularly when they spill over into violent physical acts. Following these arrests, authorities have issued strong warnings to the public, especially to those holding cryptocurrency. A key piece of advice is to avoid publicly flaunting wealth or advertising significant crypto holdings. In the digital age, even seemingly innocuous online posts or mentions in social circles can attract unwanted attention from individuals looking for potential targets. Law enforcement is urging crypto holders to exercise extreme caution in both their online and offline interactions. Prioritizing Cryptocurrency Security and Crypto Safety The Paris incidents make it clearer than ever that robust cryptocurrency security is paramount. Protecting your digital assets goes beyond just technical measures; it also involves personal safety and discretion. Here are some essential crypto safety tips and security measures that every crypto holder should consider: Maintain a Low Profile: Avoid discussing your crypto investments or holdings publicly, including on social media. The less visible your connection to significant digital wealth, the lower your risk of becoming a target for crypto crime Paris or elsewhere. Enhance Wallet Security: Relying solely on exchange accounts can be risky. Explore using hardware wallets for cold storage of significant holdings. For active funds, consider wallets that offer advanced security features. Implement Multi-Signature (Multisig) Wallets: Multisig requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This means that even if one key is compromised or obtained under duress, the attacker cannot move funds without the other keys. This is a powerful defense against coercion. Utilize Time Locks: Some wallets and smart contracts allow for time locks, which prevent funds from being moved until a certain amount of time has passed. This can provide a window for intervention if a transfer is initiated under duress. Use Strong, Unique Passwords and 2FA: Basic security hygiene is still critical. Use complex, unique passwords for all crypto-related accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. Be Wary of Phishing and Scams: While the Paris cases involved physical violence, online threats remain prevalent. Be vigilant against phishing emails, fake websites, and social engineering attempts designed to steal your keys or seed phrases. Review Permissions for DApps: When interacting with decentralized applications (DApps), be cautious about the permissions you grant to your wallet. These measures, particularly multisig and time locks, add layers of protection specifically relevant in scenarios involving physical threats or unauthorized access attempts, making it significantly harder for criminals to quickly drain wallets even if they gain physical access or coerce a victim. The Broader Implications for Crypto Safety The violent crypto kidnapping cases in Paris are a grim indicator of how real-world crime is adapting to the digital asset landscape. As the value and adoption of cryptocurrencies grow, so too does the potential risk for those who hold them. It’s no longer just about protecting against hackers or online scams; physical safety and discretion are becoming increasingly important aspects of overall crypto safety . Law enforcement agencies worldwide are playing catch-up, developing specialized units and expertise to tackle crypto crime . However, the first line of defense remains the individual crypto holder. By being informed about the risks, adopting stringent cryptocurrency security practices, and maintaining a degree of privacy regarding one’s holdings, individuals can significantly reduce their vulnerability. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant, Stay Secure The arrests in Paris over violent crypto kidnapping attempts are a stark and disturbing reminder that the risks in the crypto world extend beyond volatile markets and online fraud. Physical safety is now a significant concern for those with visible or perceived crypto wealth. The successful Paris crypto arrests are a positive step, but the underlying threat of violent crypto crime Paris and globally persists. It is imperative for all crypto holders to re-evaluate their cryptocurrency security posture. Adopt advanced wallet security features like multisig and time locks, be acutely aware of your digital footprint, and exercise caution in your interactions. Your crypto safety depends not just on technical safeguards but also on smart, discreet personal behavior.

This allows customers to scan and spend crypto on-site, a key milestone in its plan to make BTC everyday money. The initiative reflects Block’s belief that Bitcoin can become the internet’s native currency , giving small businesses more payment options and control. Square starts live Bitcoin payments at a live event Square launched its new real-time Bitcoin payment system that was set up inside BTC Inc.’s pop-up merchandise truck during the Bitcoin 2025 conference at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The system is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than regular on-chain payments because it uses the Lightning Network, a special technology that processes transactions off the main blockchain. Users don’t need to understand how crypto works to make a payment as they’ll scan a QR code at checkout and let Square handle the real-time conversion rates, payment confirmation, and converting bitcoin into US dollars. Block’s Bitcoin product team lead, Miles Suter, joined in 2017 and is now helping connect Bitcoin across multiple Block products. This includes Spiral, Cash App, Bitkey, and Square, after years of experience building crypto tools. The Las Vegas event was a live test to see how real-time BTC payments could work in retail. Block plans to make the feature globally available by 2026 with regulatory approval from the target areas. Block builds full toolkit to help small businesses use Bitcoin Block wants to make Bitcoin the native currency of the internet and is building a complete set of tools to help small and medium-sized businesses accept, manage, and benefit from using Bitcoin in everyday operations. The company has doubled down on Bitcoin as its core bet on the future of money, while other fintech firms invest in stablecoins and tokenized dollars. Over 1,000 sellers have adopted the company’s Bitcoin Conversion tool, automatically changing a portion of their daily sales into BTC. The company claims that the merchants’ Bitcoin holdings grew by around 70% over the past year. Block’s new real-time Bitcoin checkout feature also allows merchants to receive payment in BTC and instantly convert it to US dollars without any price volatility or risk. Block is also building its “Bitcoin for Business” toolkit to help small businesses accept payments in BTC through a standard transaction or a quick QR code scan and instantly convert between US dollars and Bitcoin. Sellers who want to hold their Bitcoin can withdraw it to Block’s secure self-custody wallet, Bitkey, without using third-party exchange platforms. Block’s Bitcoin ecosystem connects Cash App for trading, Bitkey for wallet and custody, Spiral for open-source development, and Proto for mining infrastructure to build a full-stack Bitcoin platform that works for both consumers and merchants. Bitcoin prices are at an all-time high, while many companies still treat it as a store of value. Block believes they can increase Bitcoin adoption rates by showing real utility. Block also hopes to level the playing field and push Bitcoin into the mainstream economy, one sale at a time, by giving small businesses the same tools that big companies use.

The 2025 investment question everyone’s asking,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/28/is-ruvi-the-next-doge-the-2025-investment-question-everyones-asking/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has carved out a unique place in the crypto world. Originally started as a joke, the meme-based cryptocurrency rose to prominence thanks to its community-driven nature and endorsements from high-profile personalities like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s success is a testament to the power of community engagement and the ability of unconventional ideas to challenge market norms. But as we look ahead to 2025, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be the next big thing that redefines crypto success stories. Dogecoin’s legacy Dogecoin began as a playful take on cryptocurrency, capturing the internet’s adoration with its Shiba Inu mascot. Despite its lighthearted origins, it became a serious contender, achieving astounding growth and a committed user base. However, critics have pointed out the coin’s lack of utility, which could limit its potential in the long term. Ruvi AI’s game-changing vision While Dogecoin leaned heavily on humor and community, Ruvi AI brings a fundamentally different approach to the table. Built as a decentralized AI superapp, Ruvi combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to provide secure, scalable, and innovative solutions. It’s a project rooted in strong technical fundamentals, making it more than just a token; it’s a platform aiming to solve real-world problems. Ruvi’s community-driven ecosystem ensures its users are not just participants but active contributors to its growth and development. This blend of utility and shared ownership has positioned Ruvi AI as a project with significant long-term potential, drawing comparisons to Dogecoin’s early days in terms of community enthusiasm but offering far more in terms of practical application and growth opportunities. A fast-growing success story Ruvi AI’s presale performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. During Phase 1, tokens sold out in just over two weeks, rewarding early supporters with a 50% gain. Currently priced at $0.015, Ruvi’s next presale phase will see a 33% price increment, and analysts predict the token could reach $1 in the near future. These numbers reflect a strong investor belief in Ruvi AI’s potential. Ruvi’s recent collaboration with WEEX Exchange further amplifies its reach and market accessibility, ensuring adequate liquidity and global availability of its token. Tailored investment opportunities Ruvi AI offers a variety of investment tiers for participants looking to maximize returns: VIP Tier 1 ($510 investment with 20% bonus): Total Tokens: 40,800 (34,000 base + 6,800 bonus). Value at $0.07: $2,856. Value at $1: $40,800. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07: $15,680. Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $0.07: $89,600. Value at $1: $1,280,000. Community leaderboard incentives Ruvi AI actively rewards its most loyal and engaged community members through its leaderboard rewards program: Top 10 Contributors: 500,000 bonus tokens, valued at $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 Contributors: 250,000 bonus tokens, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 Contributors: 100,000 bonus tokens, equating to $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. Ruvi AI vs Dogecoin Where Dogecoin thrives on simplicity and viral culture, Ruvi AI offers real-world utility and scalability, setting it apart in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Its innovative decentralized AI platform stands to revolutionize industries and solve pressing challenges in data security, machine learning, and decentralized finance. Simply put, Ruvi AI has the technical edge that Dogecoin lacks, combined with a community enthusiasm reminiscent of Dogecoin’s rise. Join the revolution Could Ruvi AI be the next Dogecoin? While their paths may differ, the potential impact of Ruvi AI on the cryptocurrency space is undeniable. Its blend of innovation, community focus, and robust investment incentives make it one of 2025’s most exciting projects. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big crypto success story.

The top performing cryptos now reflect more than momentum. They bring tools, systems, and networks designed to last. One example is Unstaked, a project gaining traction with its approach to on-chain engagement. Alongside it, Solana, Render, and Hedera are also showing signs of technical strength and increasing traction. Here’s how Unstaked fits into the wider group of top performing cryptos, and how others compare. 1. Unstaked ($UNSD): Building AI Tools Before Launch Unstaked has not launched yet, but its presale growth shows rising interest. Now in stage 15, the price sits at $0.009831, and more than $7.5 million has been raised. The confirmed launch price is $0.1819, setting expectations for future value. Still, it’s not only the pricing that is drawing attention. The project plans to allow users to launch AI agents designed to handle online marketing and engagement. These agents are not yet operational but will become available after launch. The idea is to use these agents across apps like X, Telegram, Discord, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Each tier is matched to a different user need, offering flexible use as the platform grows. The starting plan gives one AI agent and up to 50 monthly posts. The next level, called the Creator Plan, gives access to three agents and links to five platforms. The highest plan includes ten agents, no platform limit, 5,000 monthly posts, and tools for tracking performance. Together, these tools create a setup that works for individuals, content creators, and full marketing teams. As people look for the top performing cryptos with more than hype, Unstaked makes a strong case for utility at scale. 2. Solana (SOL): Network Stability Supports Price Climb Solana continues to show why it remains a major player among high-speed blockchains. After recovering from earlier volatility, the network has maintained strong price levels and developer interest. Its fast transaction speeds, reaching more than 65,000 TPS, support a growing ecosystem of dApps. As network stability improves, Solana is seeing renewed activity in both DeFi and NFTs. The recent upward price move has caught attention, especially from those watching top performing cryptos. Institutional capital has also begun entering the ecosystem through new staking tools and growth incentives. If this trend continues and uptime remains reliable, Solana may hold its position among top-performing names over the coming weeks. 3. Render (RNDR): Meeting Demand for Decentralized Compute Render has made progress in the GPU and AI computing space, offering decentralized solutions for rendering tasks and machine learning. As demand for processing power rises, RNDR has attracted users from digital design, gaming, and AI development industries. This connection to real-world use cases is helping drive its market value. The project recently shared updates on upcoming integrations and extended utility, helping lift the RNDR price. It continues to appear on lists of top performing cryptos because of its position in a growing field that connects both creative content and AI. Render gives access to distributed computing at a time when centralized GPU services face scaling issues and cost barriers. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Networks Gain Momentum Hedera Hashgraph stands apart by targeting enterprise applications. Its council includes major companies like Google and IBM, and its design supports energy-efficient, high-throughput operations. The proof-of-stake model behind Hedera helps balance performance and sustainability. HBAR has recently posted notable gains, drawing attention from those tracking top performing cryptos. Its network has seen more activity around tokenized assets and stablecoins, adding to its appeal. While Hedera may not move on short-term hype, its steady ecosystem growth and enterprise focus make it a strong candidate for long-term strategies. Final Take: Utility and Structure May Shape What’s Next Solana, Render, and Hedera each bring different strengths to the market. Their use cases and network development offer steady momentum. Unstaked adds another layer by introducing tools that help projects grow independently. Its AI agent system, while not yet live, is designed for automation and scalability across digital platforms. With several pricing tiers and a utility model built into its framework, Unstaked combines infrastructure with function. The presale is still underway, and the difference between its current and confirmed launch price offers a notable upside. For those scanning the market for top performing cryptos , the real question might be which project offers both short-term movement and long-term systems users can depend on. Unstaked is working toward both.

45178685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759359,1748390423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45178685.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-120000-could-be-next/,"A new Bitcoin price analysis confirms that the flagship cryptocurrency is still in a bullish trend after its recent bounce off a key re-accumulation zone. With key structural support levels intact and a bullish AB=CD pattern unfolding, analysts are now eyeing a potential surge above $120,000, marking a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price Targets $122,000 After AB=CD Completion According to a technical analysis report by TradingView crypto analyst Weslad, Bitcoin is accurately following a well-defined bullish trajectory, potentially paving the way for a surge to $122,000. With BTC now priced at $109,747 at the time of writing, reaching this ATH target would represent an 11.17% increase from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens This optimistic forecast comes on the heels of an accurate AB=CD pattern on the BTC chart—-a harmonic structure that previously hinted at significant upside potential. Notably, the Bitcoin price has since retraced into a key re-accumulation zone between $104,000 and $107,000 — a move the analyst described as a healthy correction rather than a reversal. Weslad has disclosed that the present re-accumulation zone is a price range where buyers are believed to be stepping in again. As long as Bitcoin stays within or above this zone, the analyst asserts that its market will remain bullish. Currently, Bitcoin is trading well-above the crucial psychological support of $100,000, reinforcing its bullish position. The broader market structure also remains intact within an Ascending Channel, supported by higher timeframe demand zones. According to Weslad’s analysis, if Bitcoin can firmly hold its price within the $104,000 – $107,000 range, the cryptocurrency could see a significant increase to the 2.618 Fibonacci Extension level near $122,000. Adding to this bullish case, a breakout above the $112,000 resistance is also needed to confirm the next leg of this move, marking a potentially stronger and larger upside momentum. BTC Set For Major Pullback Before Breakout As the Bitcoin price approaches the local resistance around $111,000, Weslad warns that the market may face a temporary hurdle before the continuation of the projected uptrend. The TradingView analyst notes that if price action is rejected at this resistance level, traders should anticipate a potential re-test of the $107,000 – $108,000 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Indicator Says It’s Not Over Yet As Parabola Signals Fail This area has served as a reliable barrier during the recent consolidation phase and is expected to hold firm in the event of a minor correction. Most recently, Weslad affirmed that this anticipated corrective move has already concluded, signaling that the market is now poised for the “real growth phase.” With the base demand zone around $86,000 – $91,000 and strong support around $96,000 – $99,000, Bitcoin’s overall structure remains bullish unless a decisive breakdown below $100,000 occurs. Until then, all eyes remain on the $112,000 breakout level, which could trigger a potential surge toward the projected $122,000 target.

Right now, smart buyers are skipping the hype and focusing on undervalued projects with solid use cases and strong long-term growth. That’s where Web3 ai stands out. It’s designed to serve both solo traders and institutional teams with powerful analytics and practical tools. For anyone looking to get ahead before the market picks up speed, here’s the list of top bullish crypto projects that could turn the fortunes. 1. Web3 ai: $5.7M Raised, 1,747% ROI Potential, Real AI Tools in Action Web3 ai is quickly gaining ground with a platform built for all types of market participants. It delivers an adaptive AI ecosystem designed for both individual traders and institutional teams. Post-launch, users can access AI-generated signals, live price alerts, and clear portfolio updates daily. Meanwhile, institutions can plug into robust APIs for automated strategies, risk tracking, and detailed performance analysis. Now in Stage 6 of its presale, Web3 ai ($WAI) is priced at $0.000383 and has raised over $6 million so far. With a listing price expected at $0.005242, the projected ROI stands at 1747%. This isn’t a project waiting for traction, it’s already building smart tools that respond to shifting market trends. For those scanning the bullish crypto to buy now, Web3 ai stands out as an early-stage opportunity with real-world utility and long-term upside. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Still Leading with Smart Contract Strength Ethereum stays strong as one of the most reliable platforms in crypto. It supports the biggest tools in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. This gives it a huge edge, especially after switching to proof-of-stake, which cuts energy use and improves speed. With more developers and businesses using Ethereum, its network keeps growing. Layer 2 tools like Arbitrum and Optimism also help scale up its power. Even with new coins launching, Ethereum remains a top option for those looking for steady growth. It’s still one of the best picks for anyone exploring the most bullish crypto in the market. Its deep network use and strong base make it a go-to name for both new and experienced holders. 3. SUI: Fast and Ready for Future dApps SUI is building momentum as a high-speed Layer 1 chain. Created by former Meta developers, it focuses on speed, low latency, and solid performance, perfect for apps in gaming and finance. Its design allows multiple transactions at once without slowdown, which is a major plus for developers who want real-time use without delays. Its smooth tools and strong network support are also attracting teams that want a reliable space to build. As more builders look for efficient blockchains, SUI’s rise makes sense. With solid features and room to grow, SUI ranks as a bullish crypto that can be watched closely among today’s best options. 4. XRP: Quiet Climb Through Real Financial Utility XRP is making a steady comeback, backed by its use in real banking systems and clearer legal ground. Ripple’s push for cross-border payments has made XRP more than just a coin; it’s now part of a larger system that moves money fast and cheaply across countries. Now that there’s better clarity on XRP’s legal side, more people are paying attention again. Its core strength is in fast transactions with low costs, exactly what institutions need. As real-world use continues to grow, XRP is becoming a bullish crypto to hold, especially for those focused on blockchain’s role in global finance. Last Note Getting in before the crowd often leads to the highest returns. Web3 ai proves that with a current presale price of just $0.000383 in Stage 6 and over $6 million raised. Aiming for a listing price of $0.005242, the project shows strong growth potential. The projected 1747% ROI isn’t just hype; it’s backed by solid planning and working tools. At the same time, Ethereum offers smart contract power, SUI delivers speed, and XRP offers real banking use. All of them show traits of bullish crypto projects worth watching. But for early movers looking for value and utility, Web3 ai leads the pack among the top cryptos to buy right now. The market is shifting, and coins with true function are winning. From solid networks to tools with real impact, each project here stands out for its use, not just its price action.

Hyperliquid is closing in on a $4.5 breakout, driven by steady demand for its decentralized trading model and consistent support levels. Pepe is also attracting interest, with technical indicators suggesting a possible 20 percent rally. Its chart structure and buyer activity reflect renewed optimism among short-term traders. But beyond the quick gains, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering a different kind of strength. With nearly 200,000 wallet holders, over $272 million raised, and a 2,520 percent ROI since launch, it is building long-term traction that goes deeper than price trends. Hyperliquid Eyes Breakout as $4.5 Resistance Comes into Focus Hyperliquid (HYPE) is showing strong technical positioning as it hovers near the $4.5 resistance level. Recent price action has remained solid above $3.80, with steady trading volume supporting continued momentum. Short-term moving averages are trending upward, and buyers have consistently defended support zones, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Interest in Hyperliquid’s decentralized perpetual exchange platform is growing, which adds utility to the token’s current valuation. If HYPE breaks above $4.5 with confirmation, it may open the way to higher targets in the short term. Continued volume strength and user growth will be key indicators to watch. PEPE Builds Strength as Technical Signals Support 20% Upside Pepe (PEPE) is flashing bullish signals, with its price holding steady around $0.00001436 and a reliable support base at $0.0000135. The convergence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages below the current price suggests a phase of consolidation that often leads to upward movement. The Relative Strength Index currently sits at 62, signaling more room for growth before reaching overbought conditions. If PEPE holds above support and buying pressure increases, the next key target lies at $0.000015. A strong push beyond that could extend gains toward the $0.000018 to $0.000020 range. BlockDAG Approaches 200K Holders as Presale Surge Gains Real Momentum BlockDAG is rapidly approaching a major milestone with nearly 200,000 unique holders now participating in its 2025 presale. This surge is more than just a number. It represents widespread grassroots momentum and a growing level of confidence in the project’s long-term value. Unlike many early-stage tokens that lose traction, BlockDAG continues to expand its base with strong appeal among developers, crypto newcomers, and experienced market participants. The project’s presale has already raised more than $272 million and sold over 21.3 billion BDAG coins. Since batch 1, this has translated into a remarkable 2,520 percent return. Currently in batch 28 at a standard rate of $0.0262, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time price freeze at just $0.0020 until June 13. This window gives late adopters a rare opportunity to access the token at early-stage levels. What makes this growth especially significant is that it stems from real development progress. BlockDAG supports EVM-based smart contracts and already has a live testnet running, proving that the technology is being built and tested in real time. These fundamentals strengthen its credibility beyond typical presale hype. As BlockDAG edges closer to 200,000 holders, its presale momentum continues to build. With transparent milestones, scalable tech, and strategic pricing, the project is shaping up to be one of the most impactful launches of 2025. Closing Remarks Short-term moves in tokens like Hyperliquid and Pepe often bring temporary attention, especially when technical patterns align. But BlockDAG’s steady approach toward 200,000 holders signals something more durable. This is not just a reaction to charts but a reflection of growing community strength and belief in long-term outcomes. With over $272 million raised and a presale that continues to expand, BlockDAG is showing signs of real traction. It is not chasing momentum. It is creating it. For those looking beyond immediate gains, BlockDAG presents a broader vision grounded in scale, utility, and consistent progress.

According to the analyst, HYPE is “still cheap” when you take into account the platform’s growth trajectory in the decentralized exchange space. “Why do you still get paid on buying HYPE at $39: – Lots of normies unable to buy, these people cannot figure out how to get on-chain – Spot not listed in any tier-one exchange – Claiming token is expensive here is not pricing in any growth, while Hyperliquid’s been growing open interest double-digit percentage week-over-week – $770,000,000 at present revenues of buybacks (market buys) – Exchanges are the most profitable businesses in the entire crypto world, you get exposure to the fastest-growing one – No unlocks from private market investors, no vesting bags and no sweetheart deals – Most importantly, builder codes, if you’re a developer building a product that wants to interact with perp trading, there is only one venue to build on and that’s Hyperliquid. Still cheap, my take profit levels at $40 billion circulating. Not fully diluted valuation. $100 also psychological level to be aware of.” HYPE has a market cap of $12.402 billion, indicating a 222% upside potential if the layer-1 platform hits Flood’s profit-taking level. At time of writing, HYPE is worth $37.07.

Two major players, Avalanche and Filecoin , have officially connected their networks through a groundbreaking cross-chain data bridge. This development isn’t just a technical integration; it represents a significant step forward for the entire Web3 ecosystem, particularly concerning how decentralized applications handle and store data. What Exactly is This Avalanche-Filecoin Cross-Chain Bridge? At its core, the announcement from Ava Labs, the team behind the high-performance Avalanche blockchain, and the Filecoin Foundation, supporting the decentralized storage network, details the creation of a link between Avalanche’s C-Chain (its smart contract compatible chain) and the Filecoin network. Think of it as building a secure, digital highway between two previously separate digital cities. This specific bridge allows smart contracts operating on Avalanche to interact directly with the Filecoin network. What does this mean in practice? It means applications built on Avalanche can now leverage Filecoin’s vast, decentralized storage capabilities for storing data. Traditionally, storing large amounts of data directly on a blockchain like Avalanche can be expensive and inefficient. Blockchains are optimized for transaction processing and maintaining a secure, immutable ledger of state changes, not for housing terabytes of files or media. This is where Filecoin comes in, offering a network designed specifically for decentralized data storage. Why is a Cross-Chain Bridge Between Avalanche and Filecoin Important? The significance of this cross-chain bridge lies in solving a fundamental challenge in Web3 development: efficient and cost-effective data management. As decentralized applications (dApps) become more complex, they generate and require access to increasing amounts of data – user profiles, game assets, historical transaction logs, multimedia content, and more. Attempting to store all this data on a transactional blockchain is impractical. It drives up costs, slows down network performance, and isn’t the right tool for the job. Centralized storage solutions, while cheaper, reintroduce single points of failure and contradict the core principles of decentralization. This bridge provides a decentralized alternative. By allowing Avalanche smart contracts to send data to and retrieve data from Filecoin, developers get the best of both worlds: Avalanche’s Speed and Scalability: For executing smart contracts and handling high-throughput transactions. Filecoin’s Decentralized Storage: For storing large, static, or less frequently accessed data reliably and affordably. The connection ensures that while the bulk of the data resides off-chain on Filecoin, the critical link, the ‘pointer’ or identifier for that data, can be securely stored and verified on the Avalanche blockchain. This maintains the integrity and decentralized nature of the application. Unlocking the Power of Decentralized Storage for Avalanche Filecoin is a leading network in the decentralized storage space. Unlike cloud storage providers like AWS or Google Cloud, Filecoin operates on a peer-to-peer network where storage providers earn rewards for storing data reliably and proving they are doing so over time. This creates a robust, censorship-resistant, and potentially more cost-effective way to store digital information. Bringing Filecoin’s capabilities directly to the Avalanche ecosystem via this bridge unlocks several possibilities: Cost Efficiency: Storing large files on Filecoin is significantly cheaper than storing them directly on the Avalanche C-Chain. This reduces operational costs for dApps. Enhanced Data Persistence: Data stored on Filecoin is replicated across multiple independent storage providers, making it more resilient to outages or censorship than data stored on a single centralized server. Scalability: Filecoin is designed to scale horizontally, accommodating massive amounts of data as the network grows. Avalanche dApps can now tap into this scalable infrastructure. Decentralization: Aligning data storage with the decentralized nature of the Avalanche blockchain strengthens the overall decentralization of applications built on it. This integration makes building data-intensive dApps on Avalanche more viable and more truly decentralized. How Does This Integration Benefit Web3 Data Storage? The broader impact of this bridge extends to the entire landscape of Web3 data storage . As Web3 evolves, the need for robust, decentralized, and efficient ways to manage data becomes paramount. NFTs require metadata storage, decentralized social networks need content storage, gaming platforms need asset storage, and so on. This Avalanche-Filecoin bridge serves as a prime example of how different blockchain networks and decentralized protocols can specialize and then connect to create a more powerful and functional ecosystem. Avalanche focuses on high-speed, low-cost transaction processing and smart contract execution, while Filecoin focuses on verifiable, decentralized data storage. By bridging these capabilities, developers building on Avalanche now have a direct, standardized way to implement a common Web3 pattern: using a fast, transactional chain for logic and state, and a decentralized storage network for associated data. This pattern is crucial for enabling the next generation of dApps that move beyond simple token transfers and DeFi to more complex applications requiring significant data handling. Practical Examples: What Can Developers Build? With the Avalanche-Filecoin bridge in place, developers on Avalanche can now build dApps with enhanced data capabilities. Here are a few examples: NFT Platforms: Store high-resolution images, videos, or complex metadata associated with NFTs on Filecoin, while keeping the token ownership and core attributes verifiable on Avalanche. This is a common challenge for NFT projects. Decentralized Social Media: Store user-generated content like posts, images, and videos on Filecoin, with links and content hashes stored on Avalanche for integrity and censorship resistance. Gaming: Store game assets, maps, character data, or historical game replays on Filecoin, linking them to in-game items or player profiles managed by smart contracts on Avalanche. Supply Chain and Logistics: Store detailed documents, images, or sensor data related to goods on Filecoin, while using Avalanche to track ownership, provenance, and key events in the supply chain. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Store proposals, meeting minutes, large datasets for analysis, or archival information on Filecoin, accessible and verifiable by DAO members via smart contracts on Avalanche. These examples highlight how offloading data storage to Filecoin via the bridge makes these types of dApps more feasible and performant on the Avalanche network. Considering the Challenges of Cross-Chain Interoperability While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent complexities and potential challenges associated with any cross-chain bridge : Security Risks: Bridges can be potential targets for exploits. Ensuring the security of the bridge infrastructure itself is paramount. Both Ava Labs and Filecoin Foundation will need to prioritize robust security measures and audits. Complexity for Developers: While the bridge simplifies the connection, developers still need to understand how to interact with both the Avalanche smart contract environment and the Filecoin APIs or libraries to manage data storage requests and retrievals. Data Retrieval Speed: Accessing data stored on a decentralized network like Filecoin might have different latency characteristics compared to accessing data directly on a blockchain or from a centralized server. Developers need to design their dApps accordingly. Maintaining Decentralization: The bridge mechanism itself must be designed in a way that doesn’t introduce new points of centralization. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the long-term success and adoption of this integration. Comparing Data Storage Options in Web3 To better understand the value proposition, let’s briefly compare different approaches to data storage in Web3: Storage Method Pros Cons Best For On-Chain Storage (e.g., directly on Avalanche) Highest decentralization, maximum security/immutability, directly linked to smart contract state. Extremely expensive for large data, limited capacity, low performance for retrieval. Critical, small pieces of data directly tied to contract logic (e.g., ownership pointers, simple flags). Centralized Storage (e.g., AWS S3) Cheap, fast, easy to use, high capacity. Single point of failure, censorship risk, not decentralized, goes against Web3 ethos. Not recommended for core dApp data requiring decentralization or censorship resistance. Decentralized Storage (e.g., Filecoin via Bridge) Decentralized, censorship-resistant, potentially cost-effective for large data, scalable, verifiable links on-chain. Can be more complex to implement than centralized, retrieval speed varies, bridge security is critical. Large files, multimedia, historical data, backups, any data needing decentralization but not requiring constant, instant on-chain verification of the full content. The Avalanche-Filecoin bridge enables developers to effectively utilize the ‘Decentralized Storage’ option, which is often the sweet spot for many modern dApps. Actionable Insights for the Web3 Ecosystem What should developers, users, and investors take away from this integration? Here are some actionable insights: Developers on Avalanche: Explore the documentation and tools provided by Ava Labs and Filecoin Foundation to integrate decentralized storage into your dApps. This can significantly improve the cost structure and capabilities of your applications, especially those handling significant data. Filecoin Storage Providers: Increased demand for Filecoin storage from the Avalanche ecosystem could lead to more opportunities and revenue for storage providers. Users of Avalanche dApps: Expect to see more complex and data-rich applications emerge on Avalanche as developers leverage this new capability. Data associated with dApps may become more resilient and decentralized. Web3 Enthusiasts and Investors: This integration highlights the growing trend of cross-chain interoperability and the importance of specialized decentralized protocols working together. Pay attention to similar bridges and collaborations in the space. The combination of fast execution layers and robust data layers is powerful for Web3 data storage . This is a concrete example of how the Web3 space is maturing, with different networks building bridges to leverage each other’s strengths. The Future of Interoperability and Decentralized Data The connection between Avalanche and Filecoin is part of a larger movement towards a more interconnected and specialized Web3 ecosystem. No single blockchain can be the best at everything. High-performance chains excel at transaction speed, while networks like Filecoin excel at data storage, and others focus on specific use cases like privacy or identity. Cross-chain bridges are essential infrastructure enabling these specialized networks to communicate and cooperate. This particular bridge between Avalanche and Filecoin is a significant step for both ecosystems and for the overall vision of a decentralized internet where data is stored and managed in a way that aligns with core Web3 principles. Expect to see more such integrations in the future as the demand for scalable, cost-effective, and decentralized data solutions continues to grow across all layers of the Web3 stack. Conclusion: A Powerful Connection for Web3 The new cross-chain bridge linking Avalanche and Filecoin is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a strategic move that significantly enhances the capabilities of decentralized applications on Avalanche. By providing a seamless way to access Filecoin’s decentralized storage network, this integration addresses a critical need for efficient and cost-effective data management in Web3. Developers now have powerful tools to build more complex, data-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the Avalanche network and contributing to the broader vision of robust, decentralized Web3 data storage . This collaboration marks a positive step forward for interoperability and the continued evolution of the decentralized web.

The widely popular MetaMask wallet , primarily known for its deep integration with the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains, has reportedly added support for the Solana (SOL) network. This development, highlighted by Unfolded on X, marks a significant step towards greater interoperability in the blockchain space. For years, MetaMask has been the go-to Web3 wallet for millions of users navigating decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and other compatible networks. Solana, on the other hand, operates on a different technical architecture (not EVM-compatible) and has traditionally required dedicated wallets like Phantom, Solflare, or Exodus. The reported MetaMask Solana integration means users may no longer need to switch between different wallet applications or browser extensions to manage assets or interact with dApps across these two major ecosystems. This could streamline the user experience significantly and open up new possibilities for users and developers alike. Understanding the MetaMask Solana Integration It’s important to clarify the nature of this integration. Based on available information and how MetaMask typically extends its functionality to non-EVM chains, this support is facilitated through MetaMask Snaps. MetaMask Snaps are a system that allows third-party developers to build features that extend the core functionality of the MetaMask wallet. Think of Snaps as plugins for your wallet. Instead of MetaMask building native support for every single blockchain (which would be a massive undertaking), they provide a framework for the community to build these connections. In this case, a Snap specifically designed for Solana allows MetaMask to understand and interact with the Solana blockchain. This approach offers flexibility and allows MetaMask to rapidly expand its supported networks without compromising its core codebase. However, it also means users need to install a specific Solana Snap (like the one developed by the Solflare team, which has been a key player in bringing Solana to MetaMask) to enable this functionality. Why This Matters for Your Crypto Wallet Experience The addition of Solana support to MetaMask has several potential benefits, impacting how users interact with the broader decentralized landscape. Consolidated Asset Management: Users who hold assets on both Ethereum/EVM chains and Solana can now potentially view and manage them within a single interface – their familiar MetaMask wallet . Easier Access to Solana dApps: Interacting with decentralized applications on the Solana network becomes much more accessible for existing MetaMask users. They can connect their MetaMask wallet (with the Solana Snap installed) directly to Solana dApps for activities like trading, lending, borrowing, or exploring NFTs. Reduced Friction for New Users: For someone new to Solana but already using MetaMask, the barrier to entry is lowered. They don’t need to set up and learn a completely new wallet system from scratch. Enhanced Interoperability: This integration is a significant step towards a more interconnected Web3 world, where the boundaries between different blockchains become less rigid. This move positions MetaMask even more strongly as a universal Web3 wallet , capable of serving users across multiple distinct blockchain ecosystems. Benefits for Solana Wallet Users and the Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem also stands to gain considerably from this development. Increased Exposure: Millions of active MetaMask users are now potentially just a few clicks away from exploring Solana. This vastly expands the potential user base for Solana dApps and services. Inflow of Capital and Users: Easier access can lead to more users bridging assets to Solana, participating in its DeFi protocols, and engaging with its NFT market. Validation: Being integrated into the most popular crypto wallet lends further credibility and visibility to the Solana network. Developer Opportunities: Solana developers can now potentially target a wider audience, including users who primarily reside in the EVM ecosystem. This isn’t just about MetaMask adding a chain; it’s about bridging two of the largest non-EVM blockchain communities, fostering growth and interaction between them. Navigating Your Solana Wallet Experience in MetaMask While the integration is exciting, users should be aware of how it works in practice. Since it relies on Snaps, the experience might differ slightly from using a native Solana wallet. Here’s a general idea of what to expect: Installation: You will need to find and install a trusted Solana Snap from within the MetaMask interface or via the MetaMask Snaps directory. Projects like Solflare have been at the forefront of developing these Snaps. Account Management: The Snap will allow MetaMask to generate and manage Solana addresses associated with your MetaMask seed phrase or private keys. You’ll be able to see your SOL balance and SPL tokens. Transaction Signing: When you interact with a Solana dApp, the transaction request will be routed through the installed Solana Snap within MetaMask for your review and approval. Potential Differences: The user interface for Solana-specific actions within MetaMask (via the Snap) might look and feel slightly different compared to interacting with EVM chains. Features specific to certain native Solana wallets might not be immediately available or could be implemented differently via the Snap. It’s crucial to ensure you are installing a legitimate Snap from a reputable source to maintain the security of your assets. Considerations and Actionable Insights As with any new integration, there are points to consider: Security: Only install Snaps from verified and trusted developers. Snaps have access to your MetaMask environment, so verifying their legitimacy is paramount. Functionality: While the core functionality of managing assets and interacting with dApps should work, some advanced features found in dedicated Solana wallets might not be fully supported initially via the Snap. User Experience: The experience might evolve as the Snaps technology matures and developers refine their implementations. Transaction Fees: Remember that even when using MetaMask, you are still interacting with the Solana network, which requires SOL for transaction fees (gas). Actionable Steps: If you’re interested, explore the MetaMask Snaps directory to find a Solana Snap. Research the developer of the Snap to ensure they are reputable (e.g., Solflare is a well-known Solana wallet provider). Start with a small amount of SOL to test the functionality before transferring significant assets. Always double-check transaction details before confirming them in MetaMask. This integration is powerful, but responsible usage is key. The Future of Your Web3 Wallet The MetaMask Solana integration is more than just adding another chain; it represents a shift in the paradigm of crypto wallet design. As Web3 matures, the need for wallets that can seamlessly interact across multiple, distinct blockchain ecosystems becomes increasingly important. MetaMask’s move via Snaps demonstrates a scalable way to achieve this interoperability. While dedicated wallets for specific chains will likely remain popular for power users, the ability to manage assets and access dApps from different networks within a single, familiar interface like MetaMask significantly lowers the barrier for the average user and promotes a more connected decentralized world. Conclusion: A Unified Crypto Wallet Experience? The news of MetaMask enabling Solana support via Snaps is genuinely exciting. It brings together two massive blockchain communities and offers users the potential for a more streamlined and unified Web3 wallet experience. While it’s crucial to use trusted Snaps and understand the technical nuances, this development is a clear indicator of the industry’s movement towards greater interoperability and user convenience. It solidifies MetaMask’s position as a leading crypto wallet and opens up the vibrant Solana ecosystem to a broader audience.

At the ongoing Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Sun expressed his admiration for President Donald Trump’s outspoken dedication to digital assets and blockchain. Sun said during a panel discussion that the game has certainly changed for digital assets in the US thanks to the influence of President Donald Trump. The conference, which is held in Las Vegas, has drawn major players in the crypto industry to the city, including lawmakers, entrepreneurs, and developers. Sun’s remarks were noteworthy in that he linked recent Bitcoin price spikes to policies backed by Trump and to expressions of public support. While speaking on a panel, Justin Sun claimed that Bitcoin would have never reached an all-new high of $100,000 without Trump. Bitcoin reached $100,000 in December 2024, a month after Trump’s election victory. The rally has continued, and the coin was trading recently above $109,000. Sun also mentioned being at a high-profile “crypto dinner” hosted by Trump a couple of days ago. He is the top holder of the TRUMP meme coin. In addition to his shares, Sun has also pumped $75 million into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an entity allegedly very close to Trump’s digital asset plans. Trump buys Bitcoin as US creates satellites to store BTC in space In March 2025, President Trump passed an executive order for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , a move solely intended to hedge Bitcoin as part of the US treasury. The reserve is financed directly by Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil investigations — not taxpayer funds. The hope is to treat Bitcoin like gold, a strategic store of value that the government holds long-term. Trump’s directive also established a new US Digital Asset Stockpile to oversee other cryptocurrencies. An executive order was also to review the government’s digital asset holdings. And though Senator Cynthia Lummis reported that the government owns something like 200,000 BTC, the entire report has yet to be released after a security review by the White House. The crypto-friendly wave on Capitol Hill keeps rolling. According to long-time Bitcoin advocate Senator Cynthia Lummis, the US Senate will consider the BITCOIN Act next week. The bill is intended to codify the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and permit the federal government to purchase as many as 1 million BTC over five years. The bill encourages broader acceptance of Bitcoin throughout federal infrastructure and payment systems. This aligns with Trump’s general crypto stance: to relax crypto laws, court blockchain investment, and protect minors’ rights. Lummis said it wasn’t just about Bitcoin and advancing America’s financial independence. The Senate is also considering a Stablecoin Bill , a legislation that would be the country’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Some analysts say such common-sense leadership has the potential to bring long-awaited legal clarity and financial confidence to US crypto markets through the BITCOIN Act and the Stablecoin Bill. The US Senate seems to be getting close to passing its landmark stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act — a battle its champion Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said has been incredibly hard-fought. “It has been extremely difficult,” Lummis said during a fireside chat with Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “I had no idea how hard this was going to be.” Trump drives US Bitcoin strategy forward With Trump’s support and Congress already legislating, the US is quickly becoming the No. 1 place in the world for cryptocurrency innovation. Classic Chinese crypto players like Justin Sun are toasting the move — and doubling down on US crypto investments. The market likes what it sees. Bitcoin is in the $109,000 range today, and Ethereum is rising. Big exchanges and mining operations are moving on American turf, citing stable policy and rising institutional interest. One thing is apparent as the world looks on: under President Trump, Bitcoin will no longer be just a form of digital money — it will be the national strategy.

As the Bitcoin market experienced fluctuations, one notable figure faced significant financial setbacks, drawing attention from the crypto community. Who is James Wynn and What Happened to His Bitcoin Trading Position? James Wynn is recognized in the crypto space as a significant trader, often referred to as a “whale” due to the large size of his positions. Whales can significantly influence market dynamics, and their trading activity is closely watched by other participants. Recently, Wynn’s movements on the Hyperliquid platform became a focal point after he reportedly adjusted a substantial Bitcoin trading position. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, James Wynn reduced his highly leveraged 40x Bitcoin long position. This action occurred as the price of BTC dropped below the $108,300 mark. Reducing a leveraged position, especially a long one during a price decline, typically involves closing part of the position at a loss to mitigate further downside risk or avoid liquidation. The Impact on Hyperliquid: A Closer Look The trade in question took place on Hyperliquid , a decentralized perpetual exchange known for offering high leverage options to traders. Platforms like Hyperliquid enable users to trade derivatives contracts that track the price of underlying assets like Bitcoin, allowing them to speculate on price movements without owning the actual asset. The appeal of Hyperliquid lies in its high leverage, which can amplify potential profits but equally magnify losses. James Wynn’s large position on Hyperliquid highlights the significant capital deployed by major traders on such platforms. While these platforms offer accessibility and high leverage, they also concentrate risk, making large trades and their outcomes particularly noteworthy for market observers. Understanding the Risks of 40x Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading is a powerful tool that allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. Leverage is expressed as a ratio, such as 40:1 or simply 40x. In James Wynn’s case, 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital used as margin, he was controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of why 40x leverage is considered extremely high-risk: Amplified Gains and Losses: A small percentage move in the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is multiplied by the leverage factor. If Bitcoin moves up by just 1%, a 40x leveraged long position gains 40%. Conversely, if Bitcoin moves down by just 1%, the position loses 40%. Liquidation Risk: With 40x leverage, a price drop of only about 2.5% against the position’s direction can potentially wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to automatic liquidation by the platform to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. Sensitivity to Volatility: Highly leveraged positions are extremely sensitive to even minor market fluctuations. In a volatile market like crypto, maintaining such a position requires constant monitoring and significant risk management. James Wynn’s decision to reduce his position as Bitcoin fell below $108,300 was likely a strategic move to avoid a complete liquidation, albeit at a substantial cost. How Crypto Whale Activity Impacts the Market The actions of a Crypto whale like James Wynn can have ripple effects. While a single whale’s trade might not single-handedly crash the market, their large positions and movements are closely watched indicators. Points to consider about whale activity: Market Sentiment: When a known whale takes a large position or, as in this case, significantly reduces one at a loss, it can influence market sentiment. Other traders might interpret this as a signal about the whale’s outlook on the market direction. Liquidity: Large trades, whether opening, closing, or reducing, require significant liquidity on the exchange. On decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, these large orders can sometimes impact the order book and potentially influence short-term price action, though the platform is designed to handle large volumes. Transparency (on-chain): Thanks to on-chain analytics tools like Lookonchain, the movements of large wallets and known trading entities can be tracked, providing insights into potential market trends or risks. The Cost of High Stakes: $14.3M in Daily Losses The immediate consequence of James Wynn’s position reduction was a significant loss. According to Lookonchain, trimming his 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position resulted in an additional loss of approximately $4.75 million. This specific loss was incurred on the portion of the position that was closed. However, the total losses attributed to James Wynn from position reductions on that particular day were even higher, reaching approximately $14.3 million. This indicates that the reduction reported by Lookonchain might have been one of several adjustments made to his leveraged positions throughout the day as the market moved against him. These figures serve as a stark reminder of the potential financial downside in high-leverage trading. A $14.3 million loss in a single day is a substantial amount, even for a well-capitalized trader or entity. Actionable Insights for Traders While most retail traders do not operate with the capital or leverage levels of a Crypto whale like James Wynn, there are valuable lessons to be learned from this event: Understand Leverage: Before using leverage, fully grasp how it works and the risks involved. Higher leverage drastically increases liquidation risk. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use risk management tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Do not over-leverage. Market Volatility: Recognize that the crypto market is highly volatile. Prices can move sharply and quickly, making highly leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Whale Watching, Not Copying: While observing whale activity can be informative, blindly copying their trades is risky. Whales operate with different capital, strategies, and risk tolerance than retail traders. Choose Platforms Wisely: Understand the mechanics and risks associated with specific platforms like Hyperliquid, especially concerning their liquidation mechanisms and fees. James Wynn’s significant loss is a powerful example of the double-edged sword of high leverage. It highlights that even experienced traders with substantial capital are not immune to the risks inherent in volatile markets and aggressive trading strategies. Summary: A Cautionary Tale from the High-Leverage Arena The news of James Wynn facing a staggering $14.3 million in daily losses from reducing his 40x leveraged Bitcoin trading positions on Hyperliquid serves as a potent reminder of the potential pitfalls in the high-stakes world of crypto. This event underscores the extreme risks associated with high Leveraged trading , where even a slight unfavorable price movement can lead to massive losses or liquidation. As the market continues its volatile dance, the activities of a Crypto whale like Wynn offer valuable insights, not just into potential market shifts but, more importantly, into the critical need for robust risk management and a thorough understanding of the tools and platforms used. For both large and small traders, the principle remains the same: understand the risks before diving into the deep end of leveraged trading.

The major cryptocurrency exchange announced via their official X account that they plan to halt trading for four specific altcoins. This kind of event, a Coinbase trading suspension , is significant for the crypto market and requires immediate attention from affected users. What is This Coinbase Trading Suspension All About? On [Insert Date of Announcement – e.g., June 19th], Coinbase made a public announcement stating its intention to suspend trading for Helium Mobile (MOBILE), Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse (SYN). The specific date and time for this action are set for June 26 at 2 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) . This isn’t just a temporary pause; a suspension often precedes or is a form of delisting, meaning these assets will no longer be tradable on the Coinbase platform after the deadline. For traders and investors, a crypto trading suspension on a platform as large as Coinbase can have several immediate and long-term effects. It typically signals reduced liquidity for the affected assets on that specific exchange and can often lead to price volatility as holders react to the news. Understanding the implications is crucial for managing your digital assets effectively. Which Tokens Are Affected by the Crypto Trading Suspension? The announcement specifically names four tokens. Let’s take a quick look at each one: Helium Mobile (MOBILE): Part of the Helium network, focusing on decentralized wireless networks. Render (RNDR): A distributed GPU rendering network. It’s a prominent project in the decentralized rendering space. Ribbon Finance (RBN): A protocol focused on decentralized options and structured products. Synapse (SYN): A cross-chain bridge and decentralized exchange protocol. If you hold any of these specific assets – MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN – on your Coinbase account, this announcement directly affects you. It’s not just about trading; you need to consider what happens to your holdings after the suspension deadline. Understanding Coinbase Delisting Crypto Policies Why do exchanges like Coinbase decide to suspend or delist assets? While Coinbase’s specific reasons for these four tokens weren’t detailed in the initial announcement, delisting decisions are typically based on a variety of factors. These can include: The project no longer meeting listing standards (e.g., related to trading volume, liquidity). Regulatory concerns surrounding the asset. Changes in the project’s fundamentals or network performance. Security issues. Lack of community engagement or development activity. For users, understanding that exchanges periodically review their listed assets is part of navigating the crypto landscape. While a Coinbase delisting crypto asset isn’t uncommon in the broader market, it always warrants attention due to Coinbase’s significant user base and market influence. Crucial Actions for MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN Holders If you hold any of the affected tokens on Coinbase, you have a limited time to take action before the trading suspension on June 26 at 2 p.m. ET. Ignoring this deadline could leave your assets inaccessible for trading on the platform. Here are your primary options and the actionable insights you need: Token Action Required Before June 26, 2 p.m. ET Helium Mobile (MOBILE) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Render (RNDR) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Ribbon Finance (RBN) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Synapse (SYN) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Option 1: Sell Your Holdings. You can choose to sell your MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, or SYN tokens on Coinbase before the deadline. This converts your holdings into another cryptocurrency or fiat currency available on the platform. Option 2: Withdraw Your Holdings. Alternatively, you can withdraw your tokens from your Coinbase account to an external wallet or another exchange that supports trading of these assets. Make sure the destination wallet or exchange is compatible with the specific token’s network. What Happens After the Deadline? After June 26 at 2 p.m. ET, you will likely lose the ability to trade these tokens on Coinbase. While withdrawal might still be possible for a period, it’s best practice to handle this well before the suspension date to avoid any potential issues or delays. Staying Informed with Crypto Exchange News This event highlights the importance of staying updated with crypto exchange news . Announcements like trading suspensions or delistings are critical pieces of information that can directly impact your investment strategy and the accessibility of your funds. Follow official exchange channels, reputable news sources, and set up alerts for assets you hold. Being proactive is key in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Don’t wait until the last minute if you hold any of the affected MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN tokens on Coinbase. Plan your action now to ensure you retain control over your assets. Conclusion: Act Before the Deadline Coinbase’s upcoming trading suspension for MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, and SYN is a critical event for holders of these specific tokens. The deadline of June 26 at 2 p.m. ET is fast approaching. Whether you decide to sell your holdings or withdraw them to another platform or wallet, taking timely action is paramount to avoid potential complications.

However, one rising star is catching the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi-focused altcoin under $1 that analysts believe could outperform legacy tokens in the year ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a total of $9.3 million from over 11,500 purchasers of its tokens. The official presale structure has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, which is a 16.67% increase. Already having achieved a 200% profit from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). With utility, innovation, and hype aligning, these four cryptocurrencies could define the next era of blockchain growth. Crypto Giants Set to Lead 2025 Rally: DOGE, ADA, and ETH Price Outlook Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture investor interest with its strong community support and increasing real-world use cases, currently trading around $0.22. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) is priced close to $0.75 and is moving forward as parts of its DeFi ecosystem grow which could result in a move toward $1 in value. Ethereum’s (ETH) price stands at just above $2,500 due to strong interest, as its updated structure promises to make transactions perform much faster and at greater profit, translating into significant price increases. Although the established altcoins guide the market, newcomers like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are catching the eye for their ability to disrupt it. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is introducing a USD-pegged stablecoin, secured via the Ethereum network and running on it. Because its extra collateral protects prices, it is able to avoid the collapse problems algorithmic tokens encounter. For security, the Edge relies on open-source smart contracts confirmed safe and complete by Certik, making it trusted by a wide range of users and large organizations. Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and the rapidly rising Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are poised to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. MUTM’s impressive presale success, raising $9.3 million from over 11,500 investors, and current Phase 5 pricing at $0.03, with an anticipated 16.67% increase to $0.035 next phase, sets the stage for at least 100% ROI at its official $0.06 launch price. Backed by a unique buy-and-distribute model and a fully collateralized stablecoin audited by Certik, MUTM combines innovation, security, and community trust. Early investors have a prime opportunity to capitalize on this breakout altcoin alongside established giants. Take action now and secure your position in Mutuum Finance, don’t miss out on the potential gains in 2025.

It jumped past $111,900 on May 22, then fell to about $106,683 by May 25. Now, it’s trading around $109,060—a 0.74% dip over 24 hours but still up 3.30% on the week.

Some traders shrugged. One comment pointed out that Bitcoin had already climbed 8% this week and asked what new data drove another bold call. Others flagged a “greedy” market and said solid charts or on-chain numbers matter more than catchy price targets. $120K Bitcoin by end of week. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) May 27, 2025 Scarcity And Kiyosaki’s Bold Claim Based on reports from “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki, the real move in Bitcoin hasn’t even started.

Price swings averaged about 5.24% in that period. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 74, flagged as “Greed.” High readings like this often mean the market has already run ahead of itself. One watcher pointed to upcoming weekly and monthly candle closings as better gauges of what comes next, since raw sentiment scores can flip fast.

At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is already making big moves, spiking on massive trades and growing technical support. These shifts highlight how community engagement is influencing performance. A clear example is BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its 25% referral reward structure is turning everyday buyers into promoters. With an easy system, instant BDAG rewards, and low entry costs, BlockDAG is scaling fast. The project has already raised over $272 million. Chainlink: Resistance Test at $21.99 Holds Traders’ Focus Chainlink (LINK) price movement is pressing against a strong resistance trendline. Trading around $15.39, the coin is testing patience, with many pointing to $21.99 as the next target if it breaks past the downtrend from December 2024. A breakout here could change LINK’s short-term direction and trigger further gains. However, volume levels remain mixed and momentum appears shaky. The $21.99 mark remains the key number for now, with many traders waiting for a confirmed move above. Hyperliquid: Whale Moves and Technicals Push Toward $43.17 Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped over 11% in just one day, touching $39.93. The surge followed public trading wins, including James Wynn’s $25 million BTC play. Market watchers also spotted $28 million in whale buys near $35. Technicals suggest more upside. HYPE is testing the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $43.17. RSI is at a hot 85.72, and MACD is also flashing bullish, meaning the move could continue if momentum sticks. BlockDAG: $272M Raised as Referrals Ignite Viral Growth BlockDAG’s referral system is built for simplicity and speed. When someone refers a friend, they receive 25% of their purchase value in BDAG. The person joining also earns an extra 5%, making it rewarding on both ends. With an entry point as low as $15, the system encourages fast sharing and onboarding. Already, more than 170,000 holders have joined the BDAG ecosystem, reflecting just how quickly this model is scaling. The numbers behind BlockDAG back the hype. It has raised over $272 million and sold more than 21.3 billion coins so far. The price, which began at $0.001, has jumped to $0.0262, showing a 2,520% gain from batch one. Until June 13, BDAG is available for a limited time at a frozen price of $0.0020, offering a possible 2,400% upside before it reaches its official launch price of $0.05. What’s building excitement is the confirmed GO LIVE reveal set for June 13. BlockDAG will announce listings on 20 centralized exchanges, a move that could boost visibility and drive larger participation. With a solid referral program, accessible pricing, and upcoming major milestones, BlockDAG appears well-positioned among the top crypto players to watch in 2025. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) remains in limbo as it presses against major resistance. Hyperliquid (HYPE), meanwhile, is proving that volume and excitement can shift charts quickly. But the standout right now is BlockDAG. Its $272 million raise and viral referral system are changing how new projects grow.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just taken a significant step regarding a proposed XRP ETF , moving it into a deeper stage of scrutiny. This action by the SEC review process is closely watched by investors and the wider crypto community, signaling potential future avenues for mainstream adoption of XRP. What Does the Latest SEC Review Mean for the WisdomTree XRP ETF? The recent announcement confirms that the SEC has concluded the initial public comment period for the proposed WisdomTree XRP spot ETF. This phase allows the public, market participants, and interested parties to submit their views and concerns regarding the application. The SEC considers these comments as part of its decision-making process. With the comment period now closed, the application has officially moved into the ‘further review’ stage. This is a standard, yet critical, part of the regulatory journey for any potential financial product like a spot ETF . It means the SEC staff will now delve deeper into the specifics of the proposal, analyzing its structure, potential market impact, and compliance with existing securities laws. For those following cryptocurrency investment trends, this represents tangible progress. Key Milestones in the WisdomTree XRP ETF Journey: Application Accepted: The formal process began when the application was officially accepted by the SEC on February 19, 2025. This acceptance marked the start of the regulatory clock. Public Comment Period Ends: This recent step signifies the end of collecting external feedback. Initiation of Further Review: The application is now under active, detailed examination by SEC staff. Decision Deadline: A final decision on approval or rejection is anticipated by the end of October 2025. This falls within the SEC’s standard 240-day review window for such applications, though extensions are sometimes possible. Why is a Spot ETF Important for Cryptocurrency Investment Like XRP? A spot ETF , or Exchange Traded Fund, holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, XRP. This differs from futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts related to the asset. For investors, a spot ETF offers several potential advantages: Accessibility: It allows investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, and dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for mainstream and institutional investors. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. Regulation & Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investors a layer of protection and oversight that might not be present when buying XRP directly on some less-regulated platforms. Simplified Taxation: Managing tax implications can be simpler with ETF shares compared to tracking individual crypto transactions. For XRP specifically, the approval of a spot ETF by a reputable firm like WisdomTree could be transformative. It would signal a significant step towards regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance, potentially attracting substantial new capital into the XRP ecosystem. The outcome of this SEC review is therefore of immense interest to anyone involved in cryptocurrency investment . Understanding the SEC Review Process and Timeline The SEC follows a multi-stage process when reviewing proposed ETFs, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies. The 240-day window mentioned in the update is the maximum time the SEC typically takes after an application is published in the Federal Register. Here’s a simplified look at the typical path: Initial Filing: The issuer (like WisdomTree) submits a proposal (Form 19b-4). Publication & Comment Period: The proposal is published, opening a public comment window (usually 21-45 days). Initial Review & Potential Delay: The SEC has an initial period (typically 45 days) to approve, disapprove, or delay the decision. Delays are common for complex applications. Further Review & Additional Delays: The SEC can extend the review period multiple times, up to the maximum 240 days from the Federal Register publication. This ‘further review’ stage is where the WisdomTree application currently sits following the close of comments. Final Decision: Within the 240-day limit (or earlier), the SEC must issue a final order approving or disapproving the rule change that would allow the ETF to list and trade. The fact that the WisdomTree application has progressed past the comment phase and is now under detailed SEC review keeps it firmly on this timeline towards a potential decision by October 2025. This structured process provides a degree of predictability, albeit with the ever-present possibility of regulatory hurdles. Why WisdomTree is Pursuing an XRP ETF WisdomTree is a well-established asset management firm with a history of innovation in the ETF space. They have already launched cryptocurrency-related products in other jurisdictions and have shown a keen interest in bringing digital asset exposure to their clients through regulated vehicles in the U.S. Their pursuit of an XRP ETF indicates their belief in the potential demand for XRP exposure among investors and their confidence that a compliant product can be structured. WisdomTree’s reputation adds weight to the application and highlights the growing institutional interest in offering diverse cryptocurrency investment options beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to an XRP Spot ETF While the progression to the ‘further review’ stage is positive, significant challenges remain for the WisdomTree XRP ETF . The most prominent challenge is XRP’s unique regulatory history in the U.S., specifically the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple (the company associated with XRP) alleging that XRP is an unregistered security. Although there have been significant legal developments in that case, including court rulings clarifying aspects of XRP’s status, the overall regulatory cloud has not fully dissipated. The SEC’s final decision will heavily weigh whether they believe a spot ETF for XRP can be structured in a way that protects investors and is resistant to market manipulation, especially given the historical regulatory questions surrounding the asset. The outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple could also indirectly influence the SEC’s stance. However, the opportunity is substantial. An approved XRP ETF could unlock significant institutional and retail capital, providing a regulated gateway to cryptocurrency investment in XRP. It could enhance liquidity and potentially impact XRP’s price positively, similar to the effect seen with Bitcoin and, more recently, Ethereum spot ETFs (pending their own final approvals). Potential Impacts of an Approved XRP ETF: Increased institutional participation in XRP. Improved liquidity and price discovery on regulated markets. Enhanced legitimacy for XRP as an investable asset class. Wider adoption of XRP among traditional investors. The SEC review is the key hurdle that determines if these opportunities can be realized. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Watchers For those interested in XRP or broader cryptocurrency investment , the progression of the WisdomTree XRP ETF application is a development worth tracking closely. Here are some insights: Stay Informed: Follow official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources for updates on the review process and the upcoming decision deadline in October 2025. Understand the Risks: An ETF application moving to further review does not guarantee approval. Regulatory approval is never certain, especially in the evolving crypto space. Evaluate the Asset Itself: While an ETF provides easy access, it’s crucial to understand the underlying asset, XRP, its use cases, technology, and regulatory landscape independently of the ETF wrapper. Consider Your Strategy: Think about how an XRP ETF, if approved, might fit into your overall investment strategy. It could offer a new way to gain exposure compared to direct ownership. The outcome of this specific SEC review for the WisdomTree XRP ETF could set a precedent for future single-asset crypto ETF applications beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it a landmark decision for the entire cryptocurrency investment landscape. Conclusion: Waiting on the SEC’s Final Word The U.S. SEC’s decision to move the WisdomTree XRP ETF application into the further review stage is a procedural but meaningful step forward. It confirms the application is under active consideration and remains on track for a potential decision by the end of October 2025. While challenges related to XRP’s regulatory status persist, the progression of this spot ETF application highlights the growing institutional interest in bringing diverse cryptocurrency investment products to market. The crypto community and traditional finance world alike will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the SEC review . An approval could unlock significant capital and mainstream adoption for XRP, while a rejection would underscore the ongoing regulatory hurdles facing certain digital assets in the U.S. Until the final decision arrives, the journey of the WisdomTree XRP ETF continues to be a key narrative in the evolving story of crypto regulation and investment.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Don Jr. said he wasn’t an early adopter of bitcoin or crypto, only finding his way to blockchain technology after realizing the “fragile” nature of the traditional financial system. “We were real estate guys, we were hard assets, we built buildings — [bitcoin] was a bit nebulous,” he said during a fireside chat with Rumble CEO and founder Chris Pavlovski. “But once we got into that political sector…we were getting de-banked, we were getting de-insured, we were getting de-everything. It was brutal.” Don Jr. said he and Eric “definitely” had a hand in helping their father, who called bitcoin a scam in 2021, understand the potential of crypto and blockchain technology. “We were the ones who were getting subpoenaed in nonsense lawsuits, we were the ones who are dealing with getting de-banked … we’re the guys who probably saw that first-hand,” he said of him and his brother. “We probably, maybe got there a little bit before him. Once we started explaining the potential, he’s a quick study … he got there pretty quickly.” Once Trump embraced crypto on the campaign trail, Don Jr. said he got a laugh out of other candidates, including Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon. “I would pay money, a lot of money, maybe my entire crypto wallet, to have Kamala Harris explain blockchain technology,” Don Jr. said. “That would be the greatest word salad in the history of Kamala Harris word salad.” Don Jr. added that his father “cares about doing what’s right for America,” saying the democratization of finance “is a fundamental tenant after, like, world peace, of what he wants to accomplish in this administration.” The Trump family’s crypto ventures, including the TRUMP memecoin and World Liberty Financial, have been heavily criticized in both the industry and the government for being opaque and allegedly presenting conflicts of interest. However, since Trump took office, there has been a renewed push for new regulations and the passage of crypto legislation, as well as the apparent end to the so-called regulation-by-enforcement practiced by regulators during former President Joe Biden’s administration. With stablecoin legislation seemingly around the corner, potentially followed by a comprehensive market structure bill and strategic bitcoin reserve legislation, Don Jr. said the improved regulatory clarity for the industry will be a boon for bitcoin. “I think you have the perfect storm for this thing just going to the moon, as they say,” he said.",Policy|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-28 01:08:06

This acquisition comes as the company prepares for a notable merger, positioning itself firmly within the evolving landscape where traditional industries intersect with the world of cryptocurrency. What’s Behind KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Strategy? KindlyMD, primarily known for its work in the healthcare and data sectors, has signaled a clear strategic shift by adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. This isn’t a sudden decision, but rather a planned initiative. The company had previously announced its intention to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund, indicating a long-term view on the cryptocurrency as part of its financial architecture. Why would a healthcare and data company venture into the volatile world of Bitcoin? Several factors likely play a role: Store of Value: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, KindlyMD may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, seeking a non-sovereign store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify the company’s treasury assets beyond traditional cash and equivalents. Alignment with Future Plans: As we’ll discuss, this move is intrinsically linked to KindlyMD’s upcoming merger, suggesting Bitcoin will play a central role in the combined entity’s operations or strategy. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing technological and financial world. This strategic pivot underscores a growing confidence among diverse companies regarding Bitcoin’s role not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Traction KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend. Over the past few years, Corporate Bitcoin Adoption has moved from a fringe idea to a notable financial strategy for businesses across various sectors. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) were early pioneers, holding substantial amounts of BTC on their balance sheets. The motivations often cited by these companies include: Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against potential inflation driven by quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins) and decentralized nature drawing comparisons to gold. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Attracting Talent and Investors: Aligning with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies can appeal to a certain demographic of employees and investors. While the trend faces challenges like price volatility and regulatory uncertainty, the increasing number of companies, now including a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder like KindlyMD, exploring or adopting this strategy suggests it’s becoming a more mainstream consideration for treasury management. Understanding the KindlyMD Nakamoto Merger The timing of KindlyMD’s Bitcoin purchase is particularly interesting when viewed alongside its planned merger with Nakamoto. Nakamoto is described as a Bitcoin investment firm. This planned union suggests a powerful synergy: KindlyMD’s expertise in healthcare and data combined with Nakamoto’s specialization in Bitcoin and potentially other digital asset investments. The Nakamoto Merger is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of this year. While specific details about the post-merger entity’s structure and strategic focus are anticipated, the pre-merger Bitcoin acquisition by KindlyMD strongly implies that digital assets, and specifically Bitcoin, will be a core component of the combined company’s strategy. This could involve: Managing a larger, combined Bitcoin treasury. Developing services or products that leverage both healthcare data and blockchain/Bitcoin technology. Offering Bitcoin-related investment or treasury management services to other companies. The merger represents a fascinating convergence of a traditional data-rich industry (healthcare) with the cutting-edge world of digital asset investment, potentially paving the way for new business models and applications. Details of the Recent BTC Purchase According to reports, KindlyMD’s recent acquisition involved the purchase of 21 Bitcoin. The average price paid per Bitcoin was reported to be $109,027. This BTC Purchase price is notably above Bitcoin’s historical trading range, reflecting the specific market conditions at the time of the acquisition. It’s important to understand what this means: Specific Timing: The purchase occurred at a point where Bitcoin’s price was trading significantly higher than its average over its lifetime. This could be influenced by market sentiment, institutional demand, or other factors specific to the purchase date. Average Price: The figure $109,027 represents the average cost across the 21 BTC acquired. This implies the purchase might have occurred over a short period, potentially in chunks, as KindlyMD executed its strategy. Size of Purchase: While 21 BTC might seem like a specific number, its value is substantial at that average price point (over $2.2 million). This indicates a serious commitment to their announced Bitcoin reserve strategy. This purchase solidifies KindlyMD’s balance sheet commitment to Bitcoin ahead of the anticipated merger, signaling confidence in the asset’s future value and its role within the combined company’s strategy. Implications for Healthcare Company Bitcoin Holders and Beyond The fact that a Healthcare Company Bitcoin is now on the list of corporate holders adds another layer to the narrative of mainstream adoption. While the primary business of KindlyMD is healthcare and data, this financial decision could have broader implications: Setting a Precedent: Could this encourage other companies in the healthcare or data-heavy sectors to explore similar treasury strategies? Integration Potential: The merger with Nakamoto hints at potential integrations of Bitcoin or blockchain technology within healthcare data management, security, or patient incentives, although details remain to be seen. Increased Institutional Interest: Every new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to the overall narrative of institutional acceptance, potentially attracting further investment and stability to the market. For readers interested in this trend, it highlights the importance of watching company financial reports and announcements for insights into how diverse industries are beginning to interact with digital assets. It also underscores the need to understand the risks associated with holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Summary: A Strategic Move for KindlyMD KindlyMD’s purchase of 21 Bitcoin at an average price of $109,027 is a significant development, reinforcing the trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . This move is strategically timed ahead of its planned Nakamoto Merger in Q3 2024. By establishing a KindlyMD Bitcoin reserve fund and executing this specific BTC Purchase , the company signals its commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy, potentially setting a precedent for other firms, including those classified as a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder. The merger with a Bitcoin investment firm like Nakamoto further solidifies this direction, promising an interesting future at the intersection of healthcare data and digital finance.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, a strong online presence is often built on robust web platforms. This makes the latest news from WordPress particularly relevant: a dedicated WordPress AI team has been formed to steer the integration of AI into the world’s most popular content management system. The Formation of the WordPress AI Team WordPress, the engine powering over 40% of the web, announced on Tuesday, June 4th, 2024, the official formation of a specialized team focused on artificial intelligence. This move signals a strategic commitment to embedding AI capabilities thoughtfully and effectively within the platform and its vast ecosystem. The newly established team brings together experienced individuals from key players in the web and AI space. Notable members include: James LePage: Leader of AI at Automattic, the parent company behind WordPress.com and a major contributor to the open-source WordPress project. Felix Arntz and Pascal Birchler: Both bringing expertise from Google, a company at the forefront of AI research and development. Jeff Paul: Director of Open Source at 10up, a prominent web design and development firm deeply involved in the WordPress community. This composition of the WordPress AI team , drawing talent from Automattic, Google, and a leading agency, highlights a multi-faceted approach to AI integration, combining platform insights, cutting-edge AI knowledge, and practical development experience. The Landscape: Abundant AI Plugins WordPress Already Exist Even before the formal team was announced, the open-source nature of WordPress meant that developers were already experimenting heavily with AI. The platform’s extensive plugin directory is a testament to this innovation. Currently, there are over 660 different AI plugins WordPress developers have created and published. These plugins cover a wide range of functionalities, demonstrating the community’s eagerness to leverage AI for various web development tasks. Some of the most popular types of AI-powered plugins include: AI-Powered Template Builders: Tools that use AI to assist in designing website layouts and structures, potentially simplifying the initial setup process. AI SEO Optimization Tools: Plugins that analyze content and provide suggestions for improving search engine rankings, keyword usage, and meta descriptions. Chatbots: AI-driven conversational interfaces that can be added to websites to interact with visitors, answer questions, and provide support. Content Generation Assistants: Tools that help users write blog posts, product descriptions, or other website copy using AI. Image Generation and Editing: Plugins that integrate AI services to create or modify images for website use. The existence of this large number of AI plugins WordPress highlights the clear demand and potential for AI within the ecosystem, but also the need for guidance and standards. Guiding the Future of WordPress AI Development The creation of a formalized team signals that WordPress wants to take a more active, organized role in shaping how AI is integrated. Rather than letting AI development proceed in a fragmented manner solely through individual plugin efforts, WordPress aims to provide direction and ensure consistency. Mary Hubbard, WordPress Executive Director, emphasized this point in a blog post, stating, “A unified team stewards AI development thoughtfully, avoids fragmentation, and ensures alignment with the long-term goals of WordPress.” This proactive approach to WordPress AI development is crucial for maintaining the platform’s stability, security, and user experience as AI capabilities become more deeply embedded. The team will likely focus on identifying core AI functionalities that could benefit the platform itself, setting standards for how AI should be implemented in plugins, and potentially developing official AI-powered features or APIs for developers to build upon. Practical Examples of WordPress AI Tools in Action Looking at the existing landscape of WordPress AI tools provides a glimpse into the practical applications users are already benefiting from. For instance, an AI SEO plugin can analyze your blog post in real-time and suggest improvements to make it more search-engine friendly, saving time and effort compared to manual optimization. Similarly, an AI template builder might allow a user to describe the type of website they want, and the AI could generate initial design concepts or even complete page layouts, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for creating a professional-looking site. These examples show how WordPress AI tools are moving beyond simple tasks to potentially transform workflows for content creators, marketers, and small business owners using the platform. What This Means for AI in Web Development WordPress’s decision to form a dedicated AI team is a significant indicator of the growing importance of AI in web development as a whole. As the most widely used CMS, WordPress’s approach to AI integration will likely influence standards and expectations across the industry. The trend points towards a future where AI is not just an optional add-on but a fundamental part of the web development process, assisting with design, content creation, optimization, and user interaction. This could lead to more efficient workflows, more personalized user experiences, and potentially new types of websites and web applications that weren’t feasible before. The focus on stewarding this development also suggests a recognition of the challenges involved, such as ensuring AI is used ethically, maintaining data privacy, and managing the complexity that AI can introduce. WordPress taking a lead role in navigating these issues is vital for the responsible growth of AI in web development . Actionable Insights for Users and Developers For users of WordPress, the formation of the WordPress AI team is good news. It suggests that future AI features and plugins might be more reliable, better integrated, and aligned with the platform’s overall direction. When exploring AI plugins, look for those that show active development and clear benefits, and keep an eye on official announcements from the WordPress team regarding recommended practices or tools. For developers, this is an opportunity to engage with the core WordPress project on AI initiatives. Understanding the direction the new team is taking will be crucial for building future-proof and well-integrated AI plugins WordPress users will trust. Contributing to the open-source efforts related to AI development within WordPress can also provide valuable experience and visibility. Conclusion: A Powerful Step Forward The formation of the WordPress AI team marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the broader web development landscape. By bringing together expertise and dedicating resources to guide AI integration, WordPress is positioning itself to harness the transformative potential of AI in a structured and deliberate manner. This move promises to deliver more powerful, intuitive, and efficient tools for the millions who rely on WordPress to build and manage their online presence, paving the way for a new era in web creation powered by artificial intelligence.

Famous for a cautious, calculated style honed over decades in traditional finance, Mandell’s new position reflects a deeper contrast in how old-school investors look at digital assets. Mandell shared a screenshot on X showing his large position of 35,000 BITB shares, bought at an average price of $59.98. At press time, BITB had ticked up to $60.02, netting him a small but notable gain of $1,491.80. His post on X read, “I’ve made some bad choices when deciding how to invest in Bitcoin, but today I’m a Bitwiser.” Mandell and other Wall Street vets invest in Bitcoin Mandell’s move into Bitcoin is no small sign. He has managed billions of dollars at several leading hedge funds , including Caxton Associates, where he was Director and Head of Fixed Income Trading. Mandell, who boasts more than two decades of experience in navigating the turbulence of the markets, isn’t one to chase trends or make public investment declarations lightly. His public support for a financial instrument tied to Bitcoin is also a striking reversal. Not long ago, many in his circles considered crypto assets too dangerous or unregulated for serious portfolios. That reality seems to be changing — driven partly by more familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Mandell’s involvement indicates the increasing acceptance of BTC as a legitimate store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risk. It’s a subtle but strong vote favoring Bitcoin’s role in the financial mainstream. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, created to ideally cater to those who want exposure to crypto markets without dealing with digital wallets and private keys, has quickly become a favorite product. Unlike traditional investments in crypto, ETFs such as BITB trade on well-known stock exchanges, and their transactions are governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This regulatory clarity appeals to cautious investors. Since launching earlier this year, BITB has been one of the most traded Bitcoin ETFs, with over $4B in assets under management at the end of May. Bitwise ETF attracts investors as demand surges Beyond offering regulated crypto exposure, Bitwise has pledged some ETF proceeds to support open-source Bitcoin development . It has also bolstered the company’s credibility among the crypto-native crowd and drew in ESG-conscious institutional investors. Mandell’s entry into the ETF may sound like another portfolio update. But for many observers, it’s far bigger than that — validating BTC as an asset class worthy of consideration in institutional portfolios. Crypto and legacy finance are converging at warp speed. As regulatory uncertainty declines and Bitcoin becomes more accessible with financial instruments like ETFs, it’s no longer just a digital punchline passed around in tech-savvy circles. Instead, it’s becoming a core part of global investment strategies. Now, retail investors have another clear example of a respected Wall Street figure who is entering the crypto space disciplined and transparently. For many, Mandell’s move signals that Bitcoin has secured its place—not just as a speculative gamble but as a legitimate part of long-term asset allocation.

Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-backs-bitcoin-act/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Historic Shift? Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances Big news is stirring in the world of cryptocurrency and US politics! According to reports originating from Walter Bloomberg on X, Senator Cynthia Lummis made a significant announcement at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference. She stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump supports the proposed Bitcoin Act . This revelation comes as a separate, equally intriguing development unfolds: a bill proposing the U.S. government purchase a staggering 1 million BTC is reportedly heading to the Senate floor next week. These intertwined events signal a potentially pivotal moment for Bitcoin and its place within the United States’ financial and strategic landscape. Understanding the Potential Impact of Donald Trump’s Stance on Bitcoin The statement from Senator Lummis regarding Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act is particularly noteworthy given his past cautious, and at times critical, comments on cryptocurrencies. While he has previously expressed skepticism about cryptos competing with the dollar, his alleged support for specific Bitcoin legislation suggests an evolving perspective or a strategic alignment with a growing segment of the electorate interested in digital assets. Trump’s influence, especially within the Republican party, is undeniable. An endorsement from a figure of his stature could lend significant political weight to pro-Bitcoin initiatives in Congress. What might this support mean in practical terms? It could potentially: Encourage more Republican lawmakers to openly support Bitcoin-friendly legislation. Signal to regulators a potential shift in executive branch attitude towards the asset class, should he return to office. Boost mainstream confidence in Bitcoin by associating it with a major political figure. However, it’s also important to consider the political dynamics. Endorsements can be complex, and the depth of this ‘support’ for the Bitcoin Act would need to be scrutinized as more details emerge. Political backing is a crucial element in navigating the complex path of Crypto Policy in Washington. Exploring the Ambitious US Bitcoin Bill: Why Buy 1 Million BTC? Parallel to the news about Trump’s support, reports indicate a distinct bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC is slated to reach the Senate floor. This proposal is ambitious, to say the least. 1 million Bitcoin represents a substantial portion of the total supply (currently just under 21 million) and, at current market prices, would involve an enormous expenditure, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. Why would the U.S. government consider such a move? Several potential rationales could be behind this proposed US Bitcoin Bill : Strategic Reserve: Treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold or oil reserves, to diversify the national balance sheet. Hedge Against Inflation: Acquiring Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies. Asserting Leadership: Positioning the U.S. as a leader in the future of digital finance and technology. Attracting Talent and Innovation: Signaling a commitment to the crypto industry, potentially encouraging businesses and innovators to remain or establish themselves in the U.S. Such a purchase would be unprecedented for a major global power. It would likely have significant implications for the global financial system and the perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate, state-level asset. Senator Lummis: A Steadfast Voice for Bitcoin in Washington Senator Lummis of Wyoming has consistently been one of the most vocal and knowledgeable advocates for Bitcoin and digital assets in the U.S. Senate. Her background, which includes owning Bitcoin herself, lends her credibility within the crypto community. She has been instrumental in trying to shape constructive Crypto Policy rather than purely restrictive regulation. The ‘Bitcoin Act’ she mentioned, while details are still emerging, is likely aligned with her known legislative priorities. These priorities typically include: Providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, distinguishing between commodities, securities, and other asset types. Protecting individuals’ right to self-custody their digital assets. Ensuring that innovation in the crypto space can thrive in the U.S. under clear rules. Integrating digital assets into the existing financial framework where appropriate, without stifling their unique properties. Her efforts, often in collaboration with other pro-crypto lawmakers like Senator Gillibrand on broader regulatory frameworks, highlight the growing bipartisan interest in understanding and legislating for the digital asset space. Her statement at the Bitcoin 2025 conference underscores the ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto industry. Navigating the Complex Terrain of US Crypto Policy The landscape of Crypto Policy in the United States is complex and constantly evolving. Various government agencies – including the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve – have overlapping jurisdictions and differing views on how digital assets should be regulated. Congress has seen multiple bills introduced, but comprehensive legislation has been slow to pass. The potential advancement of a US Bitcoin Bill and the reported support from Donald Trump introduce new variables into this equation. It suggests that political will might be strengthening for specific, potentially bold, actions related to Bitcoin . However, significant hurdles remain: Political Opposition: Not all lawmakers are favorable towards Bitcoin or see a role for the government in holding it. Concerns about volatility, illicit use, and environmental impact are often raised. Regulatory Uncertainty: Even if a bill passes, the specific agencies tasked with implementation would need clear directives, which can be subject to interpretation and delay. Logistical Challenges: Acquiring 1 million BTC would require careful execution to avoid massive market disruption. Public Debate: A move of this magnitude would spark widespread public and economic debate about its wisdom and implications. The coming weeks, particularly as the reported 1M BTC bill potentially reaches the floor, will be critical in understanding the seriousness and potential path forward for these initiatives. What This Means for Bitcoin and the Market News of potential state-level adoption or significant government interaction with Bitcoin is typically viewed positively by the market. It can increase legitimacy, signal long-term viability, and potentially create significant demand. If a US Bitcoin Bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC were to pass and be enacted, the direct market impact would be substantial. The mechanics of such a purchase (e.g., over what timeframe, through which entities) would dictate the immediate price reaction, but the long-term removal of such a large amount of Bitcoin from the circulating supply could be profoundly bullish. Beyond the direct purchase, the symbolic impact of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could influence other nations and institutions, potentially accelerating global adoption and integration into traditional finance. However, it’s crucial to approach these developments with cautious optimism. Legislative processes are lengthy and uncertain. Bills can be amended, delayed, or fail. The current news, while exciting, is based on reports of statements and upcoming legislative steps, not finalized law. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those interested in the intersection of politics and crypto, these developments are compelling. Here are a few things to keep an eye on: Details of the ‘Bitcoin Act’: What specific provisions does it contain? How does it aim to shape Crypto Policy ? Progress of the 1 Million BTC Bill: Does it reach the floor? What is the debate surrounding it? Who are its key sponsors and opponents? Further Clarification from Donald Trump: Will he publicly confirm or elaborate on his support for the Bitcoin Act ? Market Reaction: How does the price of Bitcoin react to the news and subsequent legislative updates? Statements from Other Policymakers: Do other senators or representatives voice support or opposition to these initiatives? Staying informed through reliable news sources and tracking legislative progress will be key to understanding how these potential developments might unfold and impact the future of Bitcoin . Summary: A Momentous Juncture for Bitcoin in the USA The confluence of Senator Lummis’s report on Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act and the potential movement of a US Bitcoin Bill proposing a 1 million BTC purchase represents a potentially momentous period for cryptocurrency in the United States. While the path forward for any legislation is always uncertain, these developments highlight the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in political discourse and its growing consideration as a strategic asset at the highest levels. The coming weeks could provide clearer signals on the future direction of Crypto Policy and the potential for unprecedented government interaction with the world’s leading digital asset.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Ethereum surged past $2,600 in early Asia hours, up 3.7%, breaking decisively above its previous resistance level of around $2,500 following a prolonged consolidation period, according to CoinDesk Research's AI-assisted technical analysis model. The rally is supported by robust trading volume and significant institutional confidence, underscored by $248 million in net inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs last week, led prominently by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. DeFi activity is also strengthening, with Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) rising 3.59% over the last 24 hours to $64.37 billion, according to DeFi Llama. However, the rally faces potential headwinds. Ethereum’s active addresses currently sit at 406,180, nearly flat compared to approximately 430,000 addresses one year ago, indicating muted user growth. Additionally, stablecoin flows reveal mixed signals; traditional stalwarts USDT and USDC remain relatively flat, while emerging stablecoins such as Ethena's USDe and BUIDL demonstrate stronger growth trends, signaling shifts within Ethereum’s broader stablecoin ecosystem. Despite bullish momentum and strong institutional backing, subdued retail investor participation and tepid user growth suggest this rally could face near-term constraints. Bitcoin Soars While Luxury Watches Stall: A Pandemic-Era Correlation Breaks Down Bitcoin (BTC) and luxury watches, once pandemic-era companions buoyed by stimulus and speculative exuberance, have sharply diverged over the past year, market data shows, with BTC surging 56.9%, according to CoinDesk market data , while WatchCharts.com luxury watch index fell by 4%. As recently as mid-2023, prices for bitcoin and luxury watches moved closely in tandem, buoyed by central banks and governments injecting substantial liquidity into global markets. However, the two have since taken distinctly different paths. OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai attributes Bitcoin’s sustained upward trajectory to increased institutional adoption and maturation as a credible asset. In contrast, the secondary market for luxury watches has cooled significantly from its pandemic peak. “The real collectors stayed in watches while speculators moved on, and bitcoin has matured to take its place in many investors’ portfolios,” Lai said. “Watches make great heirlooms, but I'll take Bitcoin any day as a generational asset. You can't lose it, scratch it during a move, or have it stolen, as long as you keep your seed phrase secure.” Yet, in recent months, the luxury watch market has shown early signs of a modest recovery, posting a 0.3% gain over the last three months. Jake Plonskier, founder of Watches.io, credits this rebound to external economic pressures rather than renewed crypto-driven speculation. He notes rising tariffs and surging gold prices as key catalysts. “Gold and silver are decent proxies for the watch market,” Plonskier explained, highlighting Rolex’s January decision to raise MSRP by 14% for its gold models. He added that crypto's lasting impact on luxury watches is primarily demographic: ""Crypto wealth introduced a whole new market that can afford watches. Now men under 30 can afford Pateks and APs, which traditionally never would have been purchased by this type of clientele.” Circle Prepares for IPO Filing Circle Internet Group, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""CRCL,"" aiming to sell 24 million class A shares priced between $24 and $26 each, CoinDesk previously reported. The company itself will offer 9.6 million shares, potentially raising nearly $250 million, while selling stakeholders are providing an additional 14.4 million shares, possibly earning close to $375 million. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment has indicated interest in purchasing $150 million worth of shares during the IPO, which is being managed by joint lead active bookrunners J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The IPO filing follows previous unsuccessful attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021 and a brief consideration of a $5 billion sale to firms such as Coinbase or Ripple. Marathon Digital CEO Says U.S. Government Should Mine BTC Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel urged the U.S. government to start actively mining bitcoin to fulfill President Trump's directive for a strategic bitcoin reserve, suggesting excess hydroelectricity could support domestic mining operations, CoinDesk previously reported. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025, Thiel emphasized the necessity of tangible steps beyond the current plan of using approximately 200,000 seized bitcoins from government forfeitures. Senator Cynthia Lummis supports this broader vision through her proposed BITCOIN Act, advocating for converting underperforming government gold certificates into bitcoin to expand the reserve substantially. However, Lummis acknowledges significant legislative hurdles remain, citing a general lack of congressional understanding about bitcoin and competing priorities such as stablecoin and market structure regulations. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin bounced back strongly from a correction to $107,604, stabilizing just below key resistance at $110,000, supported by easing EU trade tensions and continued accumulation from long-term investors, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. ETH: Ethereum broke decisively above $2,600 on strong institutional ETF inflows and rising DeFi activity, though flat active address growth could limit further upside. Gold: Gold currently trades at $3,315.30 per ounce, down 0.77%, as Citi upgrades its near-term forecast to between $3,100 and $3,500 due to ongoing trade uncertainties, while remaining cautious longer term amid expectations of economic improvement and Fed rate cuts. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225, which opened at 38,003.67 on Wednesday, is forecasted to rise approximately 5% to 39,600 by year-end, according to a Reuters poll , as U.S. trade uncertainties eased, though near-term volatility remained likely, with analysts predicting further gains to 42,000 by the end of 2026. S&P 500: The benchmark S&P 500 closed about 2.1% higher Tuesday, boosted by optimism over a delayed implementation of U.S.-EU tariffs and improved prospects for a trade agreement.

The company is currently testing the waters to see if developers are interested in integrating this service into their apps. The tech firm preferred ChatGPT to provide this service since it is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s largest consumer applications, with around 600 million monthly active users. Therefore, with ChatGPT, the company appears keen to try and expand into other consumer areas – such as online shopping, social media, and personal devices. Another benefit of the “ Sign in with ChatGPT” service could help OpenAI compete with other giant consumer technology companies such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft. These companies integrate themselves into people’s lives with all sorts of online services, among them a convenient way to sign in to third-party apps quickly. OpenAI marks a significant milestone with the “Sign in with ChatGPT” service OpenAI previewed “Sign in with ChatGPT” earlier this month for developers in Codex CCLI, OpenAI’s open-source AI coding tool in the terminal. The capability enables developers to attach their ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Pro accounts to their API accounts. The company offered Plus users who signed into ChatGPT $5 in API credits and Pro users $50 in API credits to convince them to try the new service. OpenAI is planning to link its sign-in system with a range of companies . The tech firm has also offered developer interest forms to developers wanting to try this service in their apps. The form asked businesses to declare their app’s user base. It listed possible ranges, from small companies with fewer than 1,000 weekly users to large apps with over 100 million weekly users. The form also inquires how developers currently charge for AI features and whether they use the OpenAI API. In the meantime, in 2023, CEO Sam Altman stated that the company might be able to offer a “sign in with OpenAI” option by 2024. Now, it appears that OpenAI is working on this feature and wants to release it in 2025. However, it is unclear when the sign-in feature will become available to those ChatGPT users and how many companies have signed up. The request for comment sent to OpenAI was not immediately returned. OpenAI revealed a new ChatGPT search feature for online shopping services OpenAI shared significant changes to ChatGPT search, which would improve the web search experience in ChatGPT, enabling more capabilities, such as online shopping, for users on April 28. According to the latest updates, ChatGPT provides a range of choices to users when they search for products, displays images and reviews of these products, and links to the sites where users can buy the products. In addition, the company noted that users could ask specific questions using everyday language and receive fast and reliable results. This was after OpenAI tested the feature first in categories including fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. To ensure the new features start operating effectively, the firm introduced this update in GPT-4o, the standard AI model for ChatGPT, for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free users, as well as for users who are not logged in worldwide. This ChatGPT search update is part of OpenAI’s strategy to compete with Google by offering a more personalized way to find products and information online. Notably, online shopping is a key area for Google, but the advertising market for priority placements in Google Search has also affected the quality of its service over the years. OpenAI reported that its search feature was growing quickly. Last month, users conducted over a billion web searches using ChatGPT, according to information from reliable sources.

While many have debated when and if artificial intelligence would begin displacing human workers, new data suggests we might be seeing the initial effects, particularly concerning entry level tech jobs . Are Entry Level Tech Jobs Disappearing Due to AI? Recent research indicates a potential shift in tech hiring trends that could be linked to the rise of AI. SignalFire, a venture capital firm that tracks job movements across millions of employees and companies using LinkedIn data, has observed a notable change in how tech companies are recruiting. Their analysis for 2024 shows a decrease in the hiring of recent college graduates compared to 2023. Simultaneously, these same companies, especially the top 15 big tech firms, have increased their recruitment of experienced professionals. Specifically: Big tech companies reduced new graduate hiring by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Startups saw an 11% decrease in graduate recruitment year-over-year. While other factors could contribute to this dip, SignalFire’s head of research, Asher Bantock, believes there is significant evidence suggesting AI is a major factor. The World Economic Forum also supports this, with a survey indicating 40% of employers plan to cut staff where AI can automate tasks. Why AI Automation Targets Junior Roles Why are entry level tech jobs particularly susceptible to AI automation ? These roles often involve tasks that are routine, repetitive, and lower-risk. Generative AI is becoming increasingly capable of handling such duties. Examples include: Basic coding and debugging Preliminary financial research and analysis Software installation and basic support AI’s ability to perform these tasks means companies may require fewer human employees for entry-level positions. Gabe Stengel, founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, shared his experience. His company’s AI tool can automate much of the analysis work he did early in his investment banking career, such as diligence, financial review, and material preparation. Major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly considered reducing junior staff hires significantly and adjusting pay, acknowledging that AI makes some tasks less demanding than before. The Growing Need for Experience Amidst Changing Tech Hiring Trends Despite the potential challenges for new graduates, the demand for experienced tech professionals is rising. SignalFire’s report highlights this trend: Big tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience. Startups hired 14% more individuals in the same seniority range. This creates a challenging situation for recent graduates: they need experience to get hired, but cannot gain experience without being hired. Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, notes that AI exacerbates this long-standing paradox. Navigating the Future of Tech Jobs As we look at the future of tech jobs , adapting to AI is crucial. The advice for those entering the field is clear: master AI tools. As Doshay puts it, “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it.” Developing proficiency in AI-powered platforms and understanding how to leverage them for complex tasks will be essential for career growth. Understanding the impact of AI is vital for anyone in the tech sector, including those interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain, where AI applications are also expanding. Staying informed on these developments is key to navigating the evolving landscape. Join us at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI to delve deeper into the convergence of AI and technology.

Now, a prominent voice from within the government itself has added significant weight to the discussion. At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, crypto-friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis shared a remarkable belief: she estimates the U.S. government currently possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC). Senator Lummis Shares Insight on Bitcoin Holdings Senator Cynthia Lummis, known for her supportive stance on digital assets and blockchain technology, delivered this striking estimate during her appearance at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference. The revelation, reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, on X, immediately sent ripples through the crypto news landscape. While the number itself is substantial, the context provided by Senator Lummis is equally important. According to Terrett’s report, Senator Lummis is not entirely certain of the precise 200,000 figure. She indicated that the specific details regarding these significant Bitcoin holdings were classified following an audit conducted under the direction of the White House. The fact that such information is classified underscores the sensitive nature with which the government views its digital asset reserves. Senator Lummis did mention that she has been offered a private briefing on the matter, suggesting a level of transparency is available to her as a legislator, even if the full details remain shielded from the public eye. Her willingness to share her estimated figure, despite the classified nature, highlights the growing importance of discussing government involvement with cryptocurrencies openly, even within the bounds of national security. Why Does the US Government Hold Bitcoin? Understanding Government Crypto Acquisitions Many might wonder how the US government Bitcoin holdings accumulated in the first place. Unlike individual investors buying BTC on exchanges, the vast majority of the government’s cryptocurrency stash comes from seizures related to criminal activities. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), regularly confiscate cryptocurrencies used in illicit operations, including: Drug trafficking Money laundering Cybercrime (like ransomware attacks) Fraud schemes Perhaps the most famous example involves the Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road online marketplace, shut down by the FBI in 2013. Over the years, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from various illegal enterprises. These assets are then held in government wallets, pending legal proceedings or decisions on their disposition. Comparing Estimates: Is 200K BTC a New High for Government Crypto? Prior to Senator Lummis’s statement, public estimates of the Government crypto holdings derived primarily from reported seizures. While official, consolidated figures are hard to come by publicly, various reports have tracked known government confiscations over time. These reports have often placed the publicly acknowledged holdings in the range of tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands of BTC, though exact figures fluctuate as assets are seized or occasionally sold. Senator Lummis’s belief in a 200,000 BTC holding is significant because it represents a high-end estimate from someone with potential access to more detailed, albeit classified, information. It suggests that the government’s total stash, combining all agencies and past seizures, could be considerably larger than what is commonly discussed based solely on public announcements. It’s crucial to remember that Lummis stated this as her ‘belief’ based on classified information, rather than a confirmed, declassified figure. The exact number could be slightly higher or lower, but the ballpark figure of 200,000 BTC positions the U.S. government as one of the largest single holders of Bitcoin globally, outside of potentially Satoshi Nakamoto’s presumed holdings and major exchanges or investment funds. The Classified Nature of US Government Bitcoin Holdings The fact that the specific details surrounding the US government Bitcoin audit and total holdings are classified raises important questions. Why the secrecy? Several potential reasons exist: Market Impact: Disclosing the exact amount could potentially influence the Bitcoin market, especially if the government were to signal an intent to sell a large portion. Keeping the precise figure confidential reduces the risk of market manipulation or volatility based on government actions. National Security: The methods used to track, seize, and secure these digital assets might involve sensitive law enforcement or intelligence techniques that the government wishes to keep secret from criminals and foreign adversaries. Ongoing Investigations: Revealing total holdings might inadvertently disclose information related to ongoing criminal investigations or asset recovery efforts. Strategic Asset Status: The government might view Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold reserves or foreign currency holdings, where full transparency is not always deemed necessary or beneficial. While classification might serve legitimate government interests, it also creates a lack of public transparency regarding significant public assets. This is a point of tension for advocates of open government and the transparent handling of seized assets. Senator Lummis: A Key Voice in Crypto Regulation Senator Cynthia Lummis’s comments are particularly noteworthy given her prominent role in advocating for clear and sensible Crypto regulation in the United States. As a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, she has consistently called for greater clarity and certainty for the crypto industry. Her insights into the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings highlight a paradox: the U.S. government is simultaneously a major holder of crypto assets and a key player in the ongoing debate about how to regulate them. This dual role adds complexity to the regulatory conversation. Does the government’s experience managing seized crypto assets inform its approach to regulating the broader market? How should the disposition of these assets (selling vs. holding) be decided, and what should be the criteria? Senator Lummis’s perspective, coming from someone who understands both the governmental machinery and the principles of digital assets, is invaluable in bridging the gap between Washington D.C. and the crypto ecosystem. Her willingness to speak about potentially classified information, even in broad terms, signals the importance she places on public awareness and discussion surrounding these topics. What Does This Mean for the Future? The revelation of a belief in 200,000 BTC Government crypto holdings, coupled with the classified audit, suggests a few things: The U.S. government is likely one of the largest single entities holding Bitcoin. The government is actively auditing and managing these digital assets, indicating a growing institutional acknowledgment of their value (and potential risks). Transparency around government crypto holdings is limited, raising questions about public oversight and potential market impact if these assets were ever liquidated. Legislators like Senator Lummis are pushing for more understanding and potentially more transparency regarding these holdings and their implications for policy. The disposition of seized crypto assets remains a point of interest. While the government has sold off portions of its seized Bitcoin in the past, holding a significant reserve could also be viewed strategically. It could be seen as a hedge, a potential source of funds, or even leverage in future financial or geopolitical contexts. Conclusion: The Classified Cache of US Government Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis’s statement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a compelling glimpse into the opaque world of US government Bitcoin holdings. Her belief that the government holds around 200,000 BTC, a figure tied to a classified White House audit, confirms that the U.S. government is a major, albeit secretive, player in the Bitcoin market. This significant holding, primarily accumulated through law enforcement seizures, raises critical questions about transparency, market impact, and the government’s evolving strategy towards digital assets. As discussions around Crypto regulation continue to evolve, the government’s own substantial Government crypto reserves will undoubtedly remain a topic of interest and debate. Senator Lummis’s willingness to bring this estimated figure into the public discourse, despite its classified origins, underscores the growing need for clarity regarding how these assets are managed and what their existence signifies for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital economy.

The letter responds to a recent speech by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce titled “New Paradigm,” where she raised an important question: When does a cryptocurrency stop being part of an investment contract and become just a digital asset? In their letter, Ripple thanked the SEC team for meeting with them on May 20, 2025, and offered further thoughts on the issue. Ripple argued that most cryptocurrencies traded today are not securities. They pointed to legal analysis from Lewis Cohen and others, which says that when crypto tokens are sold in secondary markets — like exchanges — they usually don’t meet the legal definition of a security. Today, @Ripple submitted an additional letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force addressing a key question from Commissioner Peirce’s “New Paradigm” speech: When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract? We appreciate the continued engagement with the Task Force.… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 27, 2025 Ripple also opened up about last year’s court ruling by Judge Torres in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The judge decided that while some of Ripple’s early XRP sales to big investors counted as investment contracts, the XRP token itself is not a security when sold in secondary markets. Ripple acknowledged the SEC’s concern about bad actors misusing crypto markets but said it’s up to Congress, not the SEC, to change the laws. They warned against vague rules like deciding if a token is “fully functional” or “sufficiently decentralized” , as these can confuse the market. Instead, Ripple suggested a clearer legal framework. For example, if a crypto token was once sold as part of an investment contract, it should be considered separate from that contract when: Any promises made by the issuer to the original buyer have been fulfilled. The current holder has no legal rights to demand anything from the issuer. Ripple also proposed a safe harbor rule to protect honest crypto projects that are still developing, helping them avoid legal risks while following clear guidelines. Additionally, Ripple recommended using the maturity of a crypto network — how big and established it is — rather than vague ideas like decentralization, to decide whether it should still be regulated as a security. They suggested that tokens on open, permissionless networks with a large market value, operational for years, and without one party having control, should no longer fall under securities laws.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 01:54:28

Dogecoin shows short-term promise with strong user activity, and XRP has rallied hard, but both face long-term questions. Dogecoin’s movement is often driven by user sentiment, and XRP’s recent spike is now challenged by fading network signals. BlockDAG , on the other hand, is gaining traction as a Web3 development layer. Built with a DAG-style Proof-of-Work structure, smart contracts, and auto-scaling features, it supports decentralized applications with real-world value. This setup addresses the performance limitations of older chains, offering high throughput and scalability developers can count on. BlockDAG’s $272M Raise Signals Strong Demand for a Scalable Web3 Stack BlockDAG is more than just a blockchain project. It is being developed as a robust Web3 foundation that offers speed, scalability, and real utility. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) combined with Proof-of-Work allows it to process transactions and smart contracts in parallel. This solves congestion issues seen in traditional blockchains and supports demanding use cases like DeFi, digital ID, and Web3 gaming. Its architecture is built like a Web3 operating system. Features like auto-scaling, smart contract automation, and cross-chain compatibility are designed to simplify work for developers. BlockDAG provides a framework that enables developers to build advanced applications without compromising performance or decentralization. This makes it a practical choice for long-term application development. BlockDAG’s traction is clearly visible. The project has raised over $272 million so far. More than 21.3 billion coins have been sold. Batch 28 is now priced at $0.0262, showing a gain of 2,520% since Batch 1. However, until June 13, a special frozen price of $0.0020 is available, offering a 2,400% profit margin before the $0.05 launch. Adding to the momentum, the GO LIVE reveal will announce exchange listings, expected to drive even more attention. Dogecoin Maintains Key Price Support, Eyes $0.26 Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading around $0.227, down slightly by 1.65% over the past day. Technical analysis shows DOGE holding support at $0.21, with possible upward momentum toward $0.26 if support holds. Looking forward, predictions for 2025 range widely. Optimistic projections see DOGE hitting $0.731, while others take a more conservative stance at $0.341. These outlooks depend on several factors like adoption trends and macroeconomic signals. Additionally, DOGE’s active addresses have grown by over 500%, signaling increased network activity. This spike in user engagement could help maintain price strength if broader market sentiment stays positive. Despite these signals, Dogecoin remains highly speculative. Anyone following the coin should be aware of its volatility and base decisions on thorough understanding rather than hype. XRP Trend Alert Suggests Risk of Pullback After Massive Surge XRP has soared more than 385% since the end of 2024. But recent signals suggest a slowdown could be coming. Data shows that over 70% of its realized cap was bought near recent highs, a pattern seen in previous peaks. Another concern is the network slowdown. Active addresses have dropped by over 90% since March 2025, bringing usage back to pre-rally levels. This drop in activity could hurt XRP’s support level going forward. From a technical angle, XRP is now forming a falling wedge pattern. If this setup plays out, the price could dip around 25%, testing the $1.76 support zone. These signs point to a cautious outlook as the chart hints at a cooling period. BlockDAG Stands Out with Utility-First Vision for Web3 Short-term price moves often distract from what matters most: tech utility and future growth. Dogecoin relies on meme-driven interest. XRP faces uncertainty with dropping activity. BlockDAG, though, brings a real Layer 1 framework that supports developers and future-ready dApps. It’s built for performance, not just hype. With smart contract integration, speed, and scalability, BlockDAG positions itself as more than just another name in crypto. It may just be the pick for those looking beyond charts and headlines.

Glassnode Reveals,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-investor-behavior-shape-trends-glassnode/,"The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained how Bitcoin investor behavior tends to reflect in price trend reversals and continuations. Glassnode Highlights Key Behavioral Patterns Behind Bitcoin Moves In a new thread on X, Glassnode has shared a new way to categorize Bitcoin investors based on their on-chain spending patterns. Under this indicator, called the Supply by Investor Behavior, there are five cohorts: Conviction Buyers, First Buyers, Momentum Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers. First Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers are pretty self-explanatory. Conviction Buyers refer to the investors who buy despite a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, while Momentum Buyers refer to those who buy during uptrends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? “The metric tracks the cumulative token supply held by each cohort over time,” notes the analytics firm in the chart’s description on its website. “To focus solely on investor behavior, we exclude exchanges and smart contracts.” Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the indicator over Bitcoin’s history: To showcase how the behavior of these groups has an effect on the asset’s trajectory, the analytics firm has zoomed in on the data of two cohorts: Conviction Buyers and First Buyers. First, here is the chart specifically for the Bitcoin Conviction Buyers: From the graph, it’s visible that the BTC supply held by the Conviction Buyers generally observes a spike alongside inflection points in the cryptocurrency’s price. In particular, their supply tends to reach a peak coinciding with bear market lows. These investors also step in to buy dips during uptrends, helping stabilize pullbacks. “But conviction alone isn’t enough to spark a rally – that’s where First Buyers come in,” explains Glassnode. Below is a chart that highlights the role of the First Buyers. As displayed in the chart, demand from First Buyers went up alongside Bitcoin’s recovery out of the bear market, with a particularly sharp surge coinciding with the bull rally in Q1 2024. Related Reading: XRP Sees Wave Of Inflows: 70% Of Realized Cap Now New Money The supply of the First Buyers let off during the consolidation phase that followed this rally, but demand returned in the second half of the year, helping fuel the run beyond $100,000. The Bitcoin market downturn this year again accompanied a decline in the supply of the First Buyers, this time to a much stronger degree than last year’s drawdown. New capital inflows seem to have made a sharp return once more, however, as the metric’s value has switched to rapid growth, potentially explaining the rally to the new all-time high. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $109,800, up over 4% in the past week.

Most notably, Coinbase – the leading US-based crypto exchange – recorded a net outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculation about renewed institutional demand and a potential continuation of the rally. Coinbase Sees 7,883 Bitcoin Outflow According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Coinbase experienced a daily outflow of 8,742 BTC on May 26. After accounting for BTC deposits, the net outflow stood at 7,883 BTC – marking the third-largest single-day BTC outflow from the exchange in the past month. For the uninitiated, daily BTC outflow refers to the total amount of Bitcoin withdrawn from an exchange within a day, while net outflow is the difference between BTC withdrawn and deposited – showing the actual net movement of funds. A positive net outflow means more BTC left the exchange than entered, often signaling accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Historically, large BTC outflows from Coinbase are often followed by institutional announcements or spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. Since all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs – except Fidelity’s – source their BTC from Coinbase, the scale of this transaction suggests potential ETF involvement or a corporate acquisition. One likely candidate is Strategy, led by Michael Saylor. The company recently disclosed a purchase of 7,390 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Saylor has also hinted at another large acquisition, although only time will tell whether the latest Coinbase outflows are connected to the firm. Supporting this institutional narrative is the Coinbase Premium Index, which has remained consistently positive over the past month. This metric reflects stronger buying pressure from US-based investors, often linked to institutional demand. The analyst concluded: These outflows reflect sustained demand from U.S.-based institutions. If this appetite continues, it may lay the groundwork for another leg up in Bitcoin’s price. Especially when fueled by ETF inflows, such moves can lead to sharp price breaks and new highs. New BTC ATH Soon? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,589, just 1.9% below its all-time high. However, multiple on-chain and technical indicators suggest that BTC could soon break into uncharted territory.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) has flipped back to positive, signaling bullish momentum. Moreover, on-chain metrics show that holders are not rushing to sell, even while sitting on significant unrealized gains, suggesting belief in further price appreciation. At press time, BTC trades at $109,589, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report. Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources. “So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar “For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.” Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching. The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%. The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop. Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.” NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadar The average loan duration is also lower ; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025. Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.” NFT market downturn also hurts lending Part of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago. “With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.” Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadar The protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share. “The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said. “Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.” Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-28 02:11:48

Ethereum has carried the decentralized world on its shoulders for nearly a decade. But as it approaches 2030, it faces new challenges—and fierce rivals. Today, ETH trades at $2,626, with steady movement across technical indicators. While its price has dipped slightly by -0.27% in 24 hours, its long-term momentum remains intact. Developers continue to look toward Ethereum’s transition roadmap, with an eye on scalability, modularity, and execution environment upgrades. This article breaks down Ethereum’s projected trajectory to 2030 and compares it with emerging technologies like Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics, now deep into its 36th presale stage, is positioning itself as a problem-solver for what Ethereum still struggles with—interoperability and seamless real-world connectivity. It aims to bridge what others couldn’t: fragmented chain environments, siloed data, and transaction paths. Qubetics enters the conversation not as competition but as a complementary force reshaping digital utility. Ethereum: Current Price at $2,626 with Long-Term Focus on Network Scalability Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized application ecosystems. As of today, ETH is priced at $2,626, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15.01 billion and a market cap of $308.69 billion. While its price action has cooled slightly, its technological ambition hasn’t. Ethereum is entering a critical era of upgrades: proto-danksharding, rollup compression, execution sharding, and stateless clients. These terms aren’t just buzz—they represent Ethereum’s structural transition into a globally scalable, resource-efficient blockchain. Developers are focusing on enabling modular execution environments and improving data availability layers. In simple terms, Ethereum is building a world where transactions are faster, cheaper, and programmable at scale. It’s developing from a smart contract platform into a digital economy framework. This directly feeds into rising interest in Ethereum Price Prediction 2030—as more decentralized applications are built on-chain, demand for ETH as “fuel” increases. For developers and community members alike, this is a signal: Ethereum isn’t stalling; it’s loading the next chapter. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Can ETH Reach the Next Milestone? Given Ethereum’s current momentum and roadmap, the question arises—where does ETH stand in 2030? Based on recent user predictions and growth modeling, Ethereum could reach approximately $3,263.39 by 2030. That marks a potential 27.6% increase from its current value. This estimate is grounded in Ethereum’s ongoing infrastructure upgrades, increasing institutional interest, and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems. The 2030 vision includes Ethereum handling millions of transactions per second through rollups and Layer-2s, enabling mainstream financial tools to be fully decentralized and borderless. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030 also considers market confidence. A significant portion of community sentiment remains very bullish, with over 39% of participants projecting strong long-term growth. This positive momentum is amplified by increased staking participation, Layer-2 development, and cross-chain bridge compatibility efforts that strengthen Ethereum’s overall utility. For blockchain developers and protocol architects, this long-term outlook encourages continuous investment in building with Ethereum—not just holding ETH, but leveraging its framework to shape real economies and autonomous digital systems. Qubetics ($TICS): Over $17.4M Raised, 514M Tokens Sold, Real Use Cases with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics ($TICS) delivers what many talked about but few delivered: true interoperability between blockchains. Unlike other protocols that rely on bridges or wrapped tokens, Qubetics enables blockchains to talk directly. This means a digital ID verified on a private enterprise chain can be instantly authenticated on a public Ethereum smart contract. Or consider a logistics database powered by one chain automatically syncing shipping records with a customs database hosted on another. They’re the kind of cross-chain functionality Qubetics makes possible. By solving real-world issues like disconnected data flows, system latency, and chain incompatibility, it creates a digital infrastructure where blockchain solutions can operate without friction. This technology doesn’t just talk across networks—it makes networks function as one. With over 514 million $TICS tokens sold, more than 27,100 holders, and $17.4 million raised already. Currently in Stage 36, each $TICS token is priced at $0.3064, with a 226% return potential if it hits $1 post-presale. As it scales, projected returns stretch to 1,531% at $5, 1,858% at $6, and up to 4,795% at $15 after Mainnet launch. These numbers aren’t simply optimistic—they’re grounded in utility-driven adoption and exponential network value. Early participants recognize what’s building: a unified blockchain layer that will make legacy infrastructure look outdated. Final Perspective on Ethereum and Qubetics in the Blockchain Future Ethereum drives programmability, Qubetics introduces universal interoperability. Together, they’re not splitting the digital economy—they’re building it. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030 sits at the center of this evolution. With its current value at $2,556.95, a projection to $3,263.39 reflects both confidence and technical readiness. Qubetics fills the gaps Ethereum wasn’t built to address—unifying protocols across chains, real-time, and at scale. As Qubetics continues its Stage 36 crypto presale , early buyers already recognize the layered value building underneath. Ethereum continues to attract developers preparing for the next decade.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31 and is eyeing to break some important resistance levels. According to the latest analysis, XRP remains in a bullish trend on the daily chart because it continues to form higher lows and higher highs. This kind of price movement is usually seen as a healthy sign in the market. Meanwhile, the stock market and several other cryptocurrencies have also started to bounce back slightly, which could support XRP’s price in the short term. Adding to this, analysts have noticed the early signs of a bullish divergence on XRP’s 6-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI). This happens when the price keeps moving lower or stays flat, but the RSI slowly begins to rise, forming higher lows and higher highs. This is often a signal that the market could soon see a short-term recovery or at least a break from its recent downward trend. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch: However, it’s important to remember that this signal alone doesn’t guarantee a major rally. It might lead to a small upward move or some sideways price action, giving traders and investors a break from the bearish pressure seen recently. Looking at the bigger picture, XRP still holds a larger bullish trend on the daily time frame, at least for now. In terms of price levels, XRP is facing light resistance around the $2.35 mark, with more resistance expected at $2.44. The strongest resistance area is currently between $2.55 and $2.62. On the other hand, XRP has significant support between $2.10 and $2.15, along with another key support level close to $2.30.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 02:19:33

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a decline in whale transactions, leaving traders guessing their next moves. Meanwhile, the Pi network has dropped again following the release of millions of new coins, which sparked fresh selling pressure. While both SHIB and Pi Coin face slowdowns, BlockDAG (BDAG) is seeing rising activity. Its presale has now passed $272 million, aiming for a $600M target, with a limited-time price of $0.002 locked until June 13. With this opportunity narrowing, many are taking notice as BlockDAG continues gaining traction. SHIB Whale Activity Drops as Price Holds Pattern According to recent data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a 74% decline in large transaction volumes, falling from 5.76 trillion SHIB to just 1.47 trillion in five days. This decrease, often linked to whale behavior, has created speculation about a potential pause or a waiting period ahead of a market move. Despite reduced activity, 78% of holders are still holding onto SHIB for over a year. The market remains steady between important moving averages. The current trend suggests a waiting game, as Shiba Inu’s price does not signal a clear upward or downward move. Pi Network Faces Pressure from Upcoming Token Release The Pi network price dropped 5.4% to around $0.74 on May 27. The fall came ahead of the release of 37 million new Pi coins over a span of three days. This token unlock has raised fears of more sell-offs, which could drag the price under the key $0.65 support level. Pi had recently touched a high of $1.67, showing signs of recovery, but that did not last. Although trading volumes remain active, resistance around $0.94 is proving hard to overcome. Market confidence appears cautious, with supply pressure weighing on price strength. BlockDAG Presale Crosses $272M as June 13 Deadline Nears BlockDAG is gaining major attention as it moves toward its $600 million presale goal. With over $272 million raised and more than 21.3 billion coins sold, its momentum is growing. The current price is fixed at $0.002 only until June 13. After that, it moves to $0.0262 in Batch 28, showing a potential 2,520% return since Batch 1. This frozen price represents a possible 2,400% gain before the $0.05 launch price. Its growth is supported by engaging features like the Buyer Battles contest, where 150 million coins are allocated daily, with leftovers going to the top buyer. A 25% referral program gives rewards to both the buyer and the referrer, making it more appealing. The project now has more than 170,000 holders, adding to its strong community. BlockDAG will also see 15 new exchange listings, bringing the total to 20 after its GO LIVE reveal. Analysts are watching closely, with some predicting short-term gains up to $1 and longer-term targets as high as $10. As the June 13 deadline nears, many see this presale as a rare entry point. With momentum building, BlockDAG is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about crypto projects this year. Summing Up SHIB’s decline in large transfers points to a quiet phase in whale activity, though long-term holders remain firm. The Pi network price continues to struggle with supply issues, despite steady trading. In comparison, BlockDAG is making strong progress. With $272 million raised, a fixed $0.002 entry until June 13, and upcoming listings after its GO LIVE reveal, it’s becoming one of the most discussed projects in crypto circles.

45184038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759473,1748401243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45184038.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Calm Feels Dangerous—All Eyes On Vegas And June Reversal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-calm-dangerous-vegas-june-reversal/,"Bitcoin hovers between $107,000 and $111,000, a deceptively narrow range that masks an options market bristling with tension. In a note to clients released today, Singapore-based QCP Capital argues that the lull is anything but benign. “Bitcoin’s reaction to last Friday’s macro developments was relatively restrained, even as equities rallied sharply,” the desk writes, pointing to “steady” institutional inflows into spot-BTC ETFs as the anchor keeping spot prices in check. Bitcoin Calm Before The Storm? The stability, however, has not bled into derivatives: “Front-end implied volatility held firm, with BTC consolidating in a tight range,” QCP observes, adding that traders are actively paying up for one- and two-week downside protection ahead of the Bitcoin Conference that opens in Las Vegas later today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters A Massive Week: Key Events To Watch QCP frames the three-day gathering—whose speaker roster includes US Vice President JD Vance, Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, and Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr.—as the key near-term volatility catalyst. “The sustained elevation in near-term vols suggests that traders are positioning around headline risk,” the firm writes. Memories of last year’s Nashville conference linger: a keynote by US President Trump sent one-day implied volatility above 90 before collapsing, with spot BTC tumbling nearly 30 percent in forty-eight hours. “That episode continues to shape market memory,” QCP warns, even as it assigns a low probability to a repeat. The positioning data argue for caution all the same. Perpetual futures open interest has retreated in the past twenty-four hours, and funding rates have slid back toward neutral levels—signs, QCP says, of “a defensive tilt.” Retail voices that typically embrace leverage are dialing back risk as well. Popular trader James Wynn has publicly trimmed longs, echoing an uptick in demand for short-dated puts that QCP describes as “persistent.” ETF flows remain the counterweight to that defensiveness. US spot-Bitcoin products absorbed 7,869 BTC last Friday, the largest single-day haul since late April, according to Glassnode data. For the week ending 23 May, net inflows reached $2.75 billion, the second-strongest weekly print of the year. Those allocations, QCP argues, “offer underlying support,” but are not large enough to overwhelm options-driven short-term swings should headlines jolt sentiment. Rumors—since denied—that Trump Media is exploring a $3 billion crypto raise exemplify the hair-trigger backdrop. “Headline sensitivity is elevated,” QCP writes. In its base case, Bitcoin holds its current band until the Las Vegas speeches conclude, after which “front-end vols are expected to compress as risk premia fade.” Higher Until Early June? Not everyone agrees that the compression will come quickly. The pseudonymous macro-cycle analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero), whose FOMC-timing model correctly flagged Bitcoin’s March low and February high, remains emphatically long. “This is not a ‘top in June’ call,” he posts on X. “This is a call that we go higher from here, and I remain bullish. Big difference.” Related Reading: Massive Whale Activity Detected on Binance as Bitcoin Tests New Highs He argues that Bitcoin historically grinds upward until roughly ten calendar days before an FOMC meeting; the next one lands on 18 June. “Price likely keeps going higher until the 8th–18th of June,” he writes, adding that cyclical weekly timing “lines up” and that he is “looking for longs upon short-time-frame pullbacks.” Astronomer’s conviction rests on a broader twenty-four-week cycle that he dates from the October 2024 breakout. “We are only week six,” he notes, implying that the upside phase is barely half-way through. He concedes that “alts always lag behind BTC,” but argues that pressing the momentum trade now is critical: “Going with momentum as long as possible gets you in the right mindset before trying to short too early.” For the moment, spot prices stay eerily placid even as the options market prices a storm. Whether that storm strikes upward or downward may depend on a sound bite delivered from a Las Vegas stage or on a policy nuance telegraphed from the Marriner Eccles Building three weeks later. Until then, Bitcoin’s calm is precisely what makes veteran traders nervous—and why hedging desks are doing brisk business selling fear. At press time, BTC traded at $110,661.

33767162,[object Object],1748401245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Kidnapping Case: Crypto Entrepreneur Arrested For Torture And Extortion,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-kidnapping-crypto-entrepreneur-arrested/,"John Woeltz was arrested in New York City on Friday for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a man in an attempt to access his Bitcoin (BTC) password. Once celebrated as a rising star in the crypto world, Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” now faces serious criminal charges. Victim Escapes Torture In NYC According to a report by Fortune, Woeltz was apprehended after the victim, 28-year-old Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, managed to escape from Woeltz’s luxurious NoLIta townhouse. The victim flagged down a traffic agent, who promptly notified the police. Carturan had reportedly been held captive for three weeks within the 17-room residence. Prosecutors allege that during his captivity, Woeltz and his accomplice, William Duplessie, subjected Carturan to severe torture. Reports indicate that he was pistol-whipped, shocked with a taser, forced to smoke crack cocaine, and even had his leg cut with a saw. Carturan also recounted a harrowing experience of being suspended over a ledge at the top of the five-story building. The ordeal began when Carturan, a business associate of Woeltz, visited the townhouse on May 6. It is alleged that Woeltz and Duplessie confiscated Carturan’s passport and electronic devices, threatening him with violence unless he disclosed the password to his BTC wallet , which purportedly contained millions of dollars. Neither Woeltz’s nor Duplessie’s lawyers provided immediate comments regarding the allegations. However, court documents indicate that Woeltz has been charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a firearm. Rising Trend Of Bitcoin Kidnappings Woeltz’s background paints a stark contrast to his current predicament. Growing up in Paducah, Kentucky, he moved to invest in tech startups after graduating from the University of Kentucky. He then entered the cryptocurrency arena in 2018, where he gained recognition as part of the winning team at the ETHGlobal San Francisco hackathon. Subsequently, he became the managing director of Silicon River Capital, a blockchain investment fund. In recent years, Woeltz had shifted his focus to Bitcoin mining in Kentucky, even joining a state technology working group aimed at integrating blockchain technology into critical infrastructure and public services. This incident highlights a troubling trend of violent kidnappings targeting wealthy Bitcoin owners . The rise of such crimes has prompted some individuals to seek “wrench attack” insurance, named after a meme that depicts bandits attempting to bypass high-tech security measures through brute force. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $108,680, with no change from Monday’s price. Compared to its recently reached record high of $111,800, BTC is trading over 3% below. However, in the monthly time frame, the Bitcoin price has held onto gains of 17%.

Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy” Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22 , however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter. “A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher,” the analysts said. It isn’t unusual for Bitcoin to consolidate for an extended time after reaching all-time highs. After Bitcoin reached a high of $73,679 in March 2024, it swung within about a $20,000 range until Donald Trump was elected US president that November. The third quarter of the year has, on average, been Bitcoin’s worst-performing quarter since 2013, with an average return of just 6.03% over the past 11 years, according to CoinGlass data. The next worst quarter on average is Q2, which has historically posted a stronger average return of 27.25%. Q4 has been the best-performing quarter on average for Bitcoin since 2013. Source: CoinGlass The analysts said that Bitcoin had entered a “short-term range-bound phase,” with a significant amount of short-term holders — those holding Bitcoin for under 155 days — selling off their positions over the past 30 days. “With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realized in the past month, the near-term supply overhang is expected — but so is structural demand. According to Bitbo data, the short-term holder realized price for Bitcoin was $95,781, while Bitcoin was trading at $108,929 at the time of publication. This represents an average profit of 13.72% for short-term holders. Related: Bitcoin profit taking lingers, but rally to $115K will liquidate $7B shorts Bitfinex’s analysts said that Bitcoin’s ETF “bid strength,” low volatility and Bitcoin’s spot premium all signal a maturing market “poised for eventual continuation once macro clarity improves.” The trading week ending May 23 saw around $2.75 billion flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw approximately $2.75 billion in inflows between May 19 and May 23. Source: Farside Crypto investors will be watching the US Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision on June 18 for more clarity on the macro environment. The Fed kept rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% in May. Bitcoin reaching new highs earlier this month was an event several crypto pundits predicted would happen earlier this year. On March 7, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there was a 50% chance Bitcoin would reach new highs before June . Similarly, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said Bitcoin may hit “new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. “Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals. The move builds on Square’s existing Bitcoin Conversions feature that allows merchants to automatically convert sales to BTC. For consumers, payment is as simple as scanning a QR code, with Square handling the technicalities behind the scenes and Lightning enabling near-instant settlement.

45185424,https://coinpedia.org/?p=462057,1748403975,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"These 5 Top Altcoins Are Like Bitcoin at $1, Stack Now",https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/these-5-top-altcoins-are-like-bitcoin-at-1-stack-now/,"The post These 5 Top Altcoins Are Like Bitcoin at $1, Stack Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A crypto analyst has shared his outlook for altcoins in 2025, expecting a classic altcoin season where capital moves from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other altcoins. According to Kyle, while distractions like meme coins may affect the market, growing institutional investment is set to help the overall crypto space. SUI First top pick is Sui (SUI) — a project built by developers behind Facebook’s former Diem project. With advanced security features, a unique Move programming language, and a growing U.S. presence, Sui is seen as a safer yet high-potential altcoin. The analyst expects a possible 5x to 10x return in the next bull run, thanks to its innovative approach and expanding partnerships, including with tech giant Microsoft. Gunzilla Games (GUNZ) Next is Gunzilla Games, a Web3 gaming company. Co-produced by Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (of District 9 and Elysium fame), the game runs on its own custom blockchain built for Web3 gaming, called GUNZ. The platform already records over 150,000 on-chain transactions daily in its beta stage. Despite this activity, the token’s market cap remains low at around $33 million. The analyst believes it’s undervalued and expects the token to surge as Web3 gaming narratives heat up, especially before investor token unlocks begin in 10 months. Mind Network (FHE) Next is Mind Network, a privacy-focused blockchain project specializing in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) — a groundbreaking tech that allows encrypted data to be processed without being decrypted. This is crucial for secure on-chain financial activity, especially for high-frequency traders and institutions who need to keep their strategies private. The project has been designated as a Tier 1 partner in Chainlink’s Build Program, placing it among a select few projects essential to Chainlink’s infrastructure plans. Sitting at a market cap of just $26 million, the analyst considers it a high-beta play on Chainlink’s future adoption in traditional finance systems. Bluefin (BLUE) The fourth altcoin was Bluefin. It’s a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain. It works a lot like Hyperliquid, which is another popular DEX for trading futures and spot tokens. But while Hyperliquid has its own chain, Bluefin runs on Sui. This makes it faster and gives it some different benefits. Since it launched, it has done over $65 billion in trading volume. It recently added a spot trading option too. What’s interesting is that today, a competitor called Cetus got hacked, and all its liquidity was locked. Because of that, Bluefin’s token price jumped 25% as traders moved over. Worldcoin (WLD) The fifth altcoin mentioned was Worldcoin, created by Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI. It’s a crypto project that uses eye scans to confirm people’s identities, which raised a lot of privacy concerns at first. When it launched, only a small part of its tokens were available to trade, while the rest were locked up. This caused the price to drop at first, but now they’ve made changes to control how many tokens can be released at a time",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 03:46:15

Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., which operates Truth Social, announced on Tuesday that it entered into subscription agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors to facilitate the Bitcoin purchase.

Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s chief executive and chairman, says the firm is adopting a Bitcoin treasury because it views BTC as an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” “Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+.

It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Big Bets In Tech According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup.

On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. Treasury Holdings And US Debt According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Plans For A New Stablecoin Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip?

Pi Coin ( PI ) is trading at $0.7504 at press time, up just 0.2% over the last day. In the past seven days, the token has fluctuated between $0.7406 and $0.8586, and it is still 74% below its peak of $2.99 in February. Despite recent price stagnation, trading volume has increased. Over the past 24 hours, Pi Network has recorded over $145 million in volume, up 16.2% from the previous day, indicating renewed but cautious interest among market participants. Yet the focus remains on a wave of upcoming token unlocks. On May 26, 10 million PI were released, followed by 12 million on May 27, as per Pi Scan data . The largest near-term unlock is set for May 28, when 15 million tokens will enter circulation, marking the biggest single-day release in the current 30-day window. You might also like: Pi Network price could miss out on the crypto bull run as insiders sell Looking ahead, another 263 million tokens will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. On-chain data indicates that more holders are moving their tokens to centralized exchanges, which raises the possibility of more sell-side pressure at a time when unlocks seem to be increasing supply. Still, Pi Network is attempting to build long-term value. The recently launched $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund is designed to support AI, gaming, fintech, and e-commerce startups, creating potential real-world use cases for the token. Successful decentralized application launches and broader adoption could help revive buying interest over time. From a technical standpoint, Pi is trading in a narrow Bollinger Band range, with the lower band at $0.53 and the upper band at $1.15. Although the direction is still unknown, the price’s mid-range position suggests low volatility and a coiled setup, which frequently precedes a breakout. PI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Momentum indicators are largely neutral. The relative strength index, which is at 48.36, indicates a lack of clear direction, while the stochastic RSI, which is at 18.16, indicates short-term oversold conditions. The MACD has shown bearish momentum by crossing below its signal line at 0.0047. The majority of short- and medium-term moving averages are above the current price and continue to act as resistance. Strong volume and a breakout above $0.85 might pave the way for a move to $1.00 and possibly $1.15. In a bearish scenario, if the $0.74–$0.75 range is not held, Pi may return to the psychological level of $0.70, with additional risk reaching $0.65 or even the lower Bollinger Band at $0.53. If there is consistent selling pressure, the massive supply overhang from impending unlocks could accelerate this decline.

ETF Approval Odds Now at 71% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano has been trading in a tight range this week, but a breakout could follow soon. With the SEC’s big ETF decision set for tomorrow, traders are hopeful that this could spark a bullish move for ADA. The odds of an ADA ETF approval have surged to 71% on Tuesday on Polymarket , the highest since April 20. This comes ahead of a key May 29 deadline for the SEC to decide on Grayscale’s proposed Cardano ETF. Grayscale's Cardano $ADA ETF deadline for decision is this week. The SEC must approve, deny, or delay it by this Thursday, May 29. Do you think it'll get approval this week? pic.twitter.com/84o9lyLksJ — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) May 26, 2025 The SEC has up to 240 days to review Grayscale’s spot ADA ETF filing, with the final deadline set for October 22. According to the official acknowledgement on February 24, it can delay its decision multiple times. So, a delay could be more likely instead of rejection or approval. ADA Holds Steady, ETF Optimism Peaks at 71% In mid-April, the chances of approval before the end of 2025 were only 37% on Polymarket. But the odds now over 70% show that traders are optimistic even after the SEC delayed XRP ETFs recently. Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst at Bloomberg, says there’s a 75% chance the ETF will launch this year. He also thinks the SEC might approve several crypto ETFs as soon as this summer. XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are also in the ETF spotlight, with multiple spot filings in play. Polymarket shows strong odds for approvals before 2025 – 84% for XRP, 83% for SOL, and 67% for DOGE. Cardano’s Ecosystem Trails A key hurdle Cardano is facing is its ecosystem underperformance. The network currently supports only 48 DeFi apps, holds $443 million in total value locked, and has only $31 million in stablecoins. However, newer chains like Unichain and Sonic are outpacing Cardano by a wide margin. Technicals Signal Bullish Setup for ADA Cardano’s technicals are bullish as the weekly chart is flashing bullish signals. It continues to trade above the 100-week moving average, a key long-term support level. If the momentum holds, it could retest last year’s high of $1.207. If it breaks out above that level, then $2 may be next. It is currently trading at $0.7524. RSI is neutral at 51, but MACD and momentum indicators are slightly bearish, which shows short-term weakness. But long-term trends 30-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs remain bullish with strong long-term support. The decision tomorrow could be a major catalyst for ADA’s next move. An approval from the SEC could open the door to institutional money and send ADA soaring past $0.84, kicking off a fresh rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 04:13:40

Unlike in past market cycles, long-term holders are not in a hurry to sell. On-chain data reveals a notable lack of aggressive selling despite substantial profit potential, indicating strong conviction among long-term investors and little structural drag on the uptrend. Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts stated in a May 28 X post that the LTH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator is one of the most obvious indicators of this resilience. Although this metric peaked at 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in early 2024, it is currently only at 2.1. While MVRV and NUPL measure the potential for profit-taking, LTH-SOPR captures when that potential is realized—when long-term holders actually move coins to lock in gains or cut losses.

Although there will inevitably be some re-distribution in response to rising prices, Coutts stressed that the current muted activity indicates long-term confidence is still strong.

Accumulation patterns can be seen in almost every wallet type. Alongside larger cohorts such as those with 100–1,000 BTC and 1,000–10,000 BTC, wallets with less than 1 BTC have also returned to accumulation mode. The only group that still exhibits net selling behavior is the 1–10 BTC group. Further, profit-taking during Bitcoin’s latest breakout has been surprisingly restrained. Glassnode noted that when BTC surpassed $100,000 last December, realized profit volumes exceeded $2.1 billion. In contrast, the most recent rally to a new high saw just $1 billion in realized profits, despite higher prices. When $BTC hit all-time high yesterday, total profit-taking volume was around $1.00B – less than half the amount realized when #Bitcoin first crossed $100K last December, which hit $2.10B. Despite a higher price, profit realization was far more muted. pic.twitter.com/GtZXU23yO9 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 22, 2025 Additionally, coin age data demonstrates that older coins are still mostly inactive. Just 13.4% of active supply is older than six months as of May 2025, down from 24.7% in December 2024. This decline indicates that while newer participants provide short-term momentum, older holders are likely sitting tight. The bullish outlook is supported by institutional interest. Over $5.3 billion has been invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs in the last month, as per SoSoValue data , and U.S.-listed funds currently oversee over $40 billion in total assets. Meanwhile, corporate accumulation keeps growing. Last week, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) increased its holdings to 576,230 BTC by purchasing an additional 7,390 BTC. The Japanese company Metaplanet has also boosted its holdings to more than 7, 000 BTC. Over 30,000 BTC is now being acquired each month by public companies collectively.

45186517,https://square.htx.com/?p=44606,1748406148,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"HTX Research：The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy",https://square.htx.com/htx-research/,"1. Overview Singapore, 28 May , 2025 – The global macroeconomic environment is undergoing profound adjustments, and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin price fluctuations, is increasingly affected by the complex influences of macro liquidity, market risk appetite, major policy trends, and investment strategy choices. In terms of liquidity, abundant funds often boost the prices of assets such as Bitcoin, while the opposite creates suppression. At the same time, given Bitcoin’s current high volatility and its periodic linkage with traditional risk assets (such as US stocks), the overall risk appetite of the market is also a key driver of its price performance. In addition, government fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies, as well as investment strategy choices for stablecoins and other crypto assets, are increasingly becoming important variables affecting market direction. This report will focus on four core dimensions: liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, to deeply analyze the key variables affecting the Bitcoin market in the current macro background, including the evolution of rate cut expectations, the continuation of Quantitative Tightening (QT), the dynamics of the US Treasury General Account (TGA), the monetary policy shifts of major economies such as Japan, as well as factors such as geopolitics, tax reduction policies, regulatory policies, institutional entry and stablecoin financial management, striving to provide investors with a clear outlook on the future market trend of Bitcoin through detailed data support and rigorous logical deduction. 2. Liquidity Analysis: Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, QT Continuing, TGA Reflowing in June, Yen Expected to Raise Rates, US Dollar Liquidity May Continue to Tighten in the Near Term 2.1 Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, Focus on Data and Tariffs Previously, the market had significant expectations for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. However, recent macroeconomic data and policy signals have led to a substantial adjustment of these expectations.. In mid-May 2025, following the release of US CPI data and an easing of US-China tariff, market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year have cooled. The prevailing sentiment now anticipates two rate cuts this year (September, December), a more cautious outlook compared to the previous expectation of three cuts, with the first in July. The core driving force for this change lies in Fed Chairman Powell’s firm stance, the continued strong performance of the job market, and ongoing concerns about the future inflation path, particularly potential tariff impacts . 2.1.1 Powell’s Stance: Adhering to “Data-Dependent”, Refusing to Pay for Tariffs Fed Chairman Powell has consistently emphasized a “data-dependent” policy stance in multiple public speeches, explicitly refusing to accommodate external pressures, such as those related to tariff policies. This means that any decision on rate cuts must be based on solid economic data. Key indicators include sustained progress towards the 2% inflation target and a significant cooling of the job market. This “Data-dependent” approach also aligns with Powell’s professional considerations. Powell’s term will end in May 2026, a premature rate cut without clear economic data support, followed by uncontrolled inflation, would directly signify a policy failure on his part. Conversely, if the U.S. economy were to enter a recession during his tenure, necessitating rapid rate cuts, such a downturn could be attributed to broader policy impacts. Consequently, Powell is inclined to await more definitive economic signals before implementing rate cuts, thereby mitigating unnecessary policy risks.. In addition, Powell’s refusal to “pay for tariffs” signifies an unwillingness to implicitly endorse policies that introduce market uncertainty by cutting rates to offset tariff-induced shocks. However, Powell has also indicated in past speeches that the Federal Reserve would intervene if market volatility threatened the stability of the financial system. Therefore, Powell is likely to prioritize clear data support for inflation and employment before initiating any rate cuts, potentially disregarding political pressures. These two core economic indicators remain central to future rate cut decisions. . 2.1.2 Job Market: Strong Performance Supports High Interest Rates The continued strength of the US job market is a pivotal factor supporting the Fed’s decision to maintain the current elevated interest rate environment. Current US economic data underscores this resilience., In April 2025, non-farm payrolls increased by 177,000, significantly exceeding the anticipated 130,000, while the unemployment rate stood at a robust 4.2%. Multiple indicators suggest this strong employment trend is likely to persist. In terms of tariff conflicts , the unexpected easing of US-China tariff conflicts is proving beneficial for US export industries targeting the Chinese market, which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on US economic growth and the job market. Furthermore, potential tariff revenue could alleviate fiscal pressure, indirectly support government spending and contribute to overall economic health. In terms of corporate performance , First-quarter reports from US listed companies reveal strong results, with 73% of S&P 500 index constituents reporting earnings that surpassed expectations This positive corporate performance bodes well for employment and investment. In terms of employment , recent data is strong, reinforcing the expectation that the economy will not be weak in the short term, and the unemployment rate is unlikely to break the key threshold of 4.5% in the short term. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, the Fed has ample justification to maintain high interest rates to combat inflation. However, it is important to note that some data suggests a nascent trend of deterioration in the US job market, requiring ongoing observation. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, such as a surge in the unemployment rate or new job additions consistently falling significantly below expectations or even turning negative, the Fed will retain greater policy flexibility. This allows the Fed to prioritize inflation control without the immediate need to stimulate the economy through rate cuts. A strong job market means continued support for wage growth, which could exert persistent upward pressure on service inflation, thereby complicating the overall trajectory of inflation decline. 2.1.3 Inflation Outlook: CPI Year-on-Year Temporarily Creates New Low, Tariff Shock May Appear in the Third Quarter While the US CPI in April 2025 fell to 2.3% year-on-year, marking its lowest level since February 2021, this trend has, to some extent, assuaged immediate market anxieties about a resurgence in inflation and initially boosted rate cut expectations.. However, judgment on the future inflation outlook still needs to be cautious. The risk point currently highly concerned by the market is the potential impact of US-China tariff policies. Even with recent easing in US-China tariff conflicts, some imported goods still face high tariffs, with costs mostly borne by consumers. Goods subject to tariffs of over 30% entering the US in the coming months may trigger a one-time inflation shock. Internal research by the Fed also supports the view that tariffs may cause a one-time shock to inflation. Nationwide economist Ayres predicts that the summer CPI year-on-year may return to above 3%. This potential upward risk of inflation driven by tariffs will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the Fed’s rate cut decisions and may further delay the timing of rate cuts. Summary In summary, despite the recent slight improvement in CPI data, Fed Chairman Powell’s cautious “data-dependent” stance, the continued strong job market, and concerns about future (especially third quarter) inflation shocks that may be triggered by tariffs have collectively led to a significant cooling of market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year. In the short term, market liquidity expectations are thus suppressed, and the upside for risk assets such as Bitcoin may be limited. 2.2 The Fed’s “Balance Sheet Reduction” is Ongoing, TGA Will Reflow in June, Liquidity May Contract Periodically. If Debt Ceiling Agreement is Reached in August, TGA May Extract Liquidity in the Short Term In addition to expected changes in interest rate policy, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction plan (i.e., Quantitative Tightening, QT) and its interaction with the Treasury’s TGA account are also key variables affecting market liquidity. Since June 2022, the Fed has actively engaged in reducing its massive balance sheet, aiming to withdraw excess liquidity from the market. The official policy path still tends to end this round of balance sheet reduction in the second half of 2025. Looking at SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), an indicator reflecting the degree of funding tightness within the US federal funds market, SOFR has demonstrated relative stability recently, at most reaching the level of IORB (Interest on Reserve Balances), with limited market funding tightness. If subsequent volatility expands, it will need to be closely monitored. Looking at the ratio of Fed depository institution reserves to commercial bank total assets, it is still above 13%, in a state where liquidity is not tight. Based on past experience, when this ratio is less than 10-12%, market interest rates will experience more obvious fluctuations, such as the brief liquidity crisis in the second half of 2019. In summary, this means that in the coming months, QT will continue and withdraw liquidity from the market, although its marginal impact may weaken as the balance sheet reduction approaches its end. A more direct impact onliquidity shock may come from the dynamics of the US Treasury’s TGA account. The TGA represents the Treasury’s deposit account at the Fed, and changes in its balance directly affect the level of reserves in the banking system, thereby affecting market liquidity. When the TGA balance increases, it means that the Treasury absorbs funds from the market and deposits them into the Fed, leading to a decrease in bank reserves and tightening liquidity; conversely, when the TGA balance decreases, it releases liquidity. Currently, the TGA account is experiencing continuously outflows,thereby supplementing market liquidity, but it is expected that in June 2025, with the seasonality of tax revenue, the TGA account balance may see a significant rebound, which will create periodic contraction pressure on short-term market liquidity. In addition, the US debt ceiling issue is another important uncertainty factor. According to the latest forecast by the Bipartisan Policy Center, if Congress fails to suspend or raise the debt ceiling in time, the so-called “X-date” (the day when federal government funds are exhausted) may come between August and early October 2025.) The US Treasury Secretary has also warned that the “X-date” may come in August. Historically, debt ceiling issues are often resolved at the last minute, but the game process before that brings uncertainty to the market. Once the debt ceiling issue is resolved, for example in August, the Treasury typically quickly replenishes the previously consumed TGA account funds through large-scale bond issuance. This will lead to a rapid increase in the TGA balance in the short term, thereby extracting a large amount of liquidity from the market, impacting the financial market, especially the short-term interest rate market. Therefore, considering all factors, the Fed’s continued balance sheet reduction operations, coupled with the seasonal reflux of the TGA account in June, and the rapid replenishment of the TGA account after the debt ceiling issue is resolved in August, are all likely to exert periodic tightening pressure on US dollar liquidity in the coming months. 2.3 Yen Rate Hike Expectations Heating Up, Carry Trade Further Contracting Among major central banks, the continued policy shift of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is another factor that may have a profound impact on global and US dollar liquidity. For a long time, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, making the yen one of the main funding currencies for global carry trades. This dynamic involves investors borrowing low-cost yen to invest in higher-yielding assets in other countries, thereby objectively injecting liquidity into the global market. However, with the gradual emergence of inflation pressure in Japan and the improvement of economic prospects, the Bank of Japan has begun to continuously adjust its monetary policy stance. The Bank of Japan has already raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on January 24, 2025, while also raising its expected increase in core CPI for fiscal year 2025 from 1.9% to 2.4%, showing that its judgment on the persistence of inflation has strengthened. The market generally expects that the Bank of Japan may continue its pace of rate hikes in 2025. The continued rate hikes by the Bank of Japan may affect global and US dollar liquidity through the following paths: Narrowing the US-Japan interest rate differential, suppressing carry trades: The Bank of Japan’s rate hikes will directly push up yen financing costs, narrowing the interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies (especially the US). When the US-Japan interest rate differential narrows to a certain extent, the attractiveness of yen carry trades will significantly decrease, possibly leading to some carry trades being unwound, i.e., selling overseas assets to exchange back to yen to repay loans. This process is equivalent to withdrawing liquidity from the global market (including the US dollar market). Enhanced attractiveness of yen assets, funds flowing back to Japan: As Japan’s interest rate levels rise and its economic outlook improves, domestic Japanese assets, such as yen-denominated bonds and stocks, may become more attractive to international investors, possibly attracting some funds that were previously invested overseas (including US dollar assets) to flow back to Japan, which will also have a certain siphoning effect on global US dollar liquidity. Changes in market expectations and risk aversion sentiment: The continued normalization of the Bank of Japan’s policy may change the market’s expectation of a long-term continuation of the global low interest rate environment. In specific market conditions, if the yen strengthens due to rate hikes, it may also attract some funds to flow in during times of heightened risk aversion, indirectly affecting the liquidity allocation of other markets. Although the Fed’s future rate cut pace will also affect the dynamics of the US-Japan interest rate differential, the Bank of Japan’s gradual exit from ultra-loose policy and entry into a rate hike channel is undoubtedly an important variable in the global liquidity landscape. Its continued tightening actions, especially in the context of the Fed not yet significantly easing, may put further pressure on global, especially US dollar, liquidity supply. 2.4 Market Liquidity Summary and Forecast: Short-term Tightening, Mid-term Gradual Improvement with Variables 2.4.1 Short-term (next 1-3 months) liquidity outlook: Tight Continued impact of Fed policy: Before inflation data shows persistent and convincing decline and the job market shows significant cooling, the Fed will most likely maintain the current interest rate level unchanged, with rate cut expectations continuing to be pushed back. At the same time, Quantitative Tightening (QT) is still proceeding as planned, continuously withdrawing liquidity from the market. Seasonal and policy shocks of the TGA account: In June 2025, the TGA account may see a seasonal rebound due to factors such as tax inflows, causing short-term liquidity withdrawal. More importantly, if the US debt ceiling issue is resolved around August, the Treasury’s large-scale debt issuance to quickly replenish the TGA account will significantly tighten market liquidity, possibly causing volatility in the short-term interest rate market. Spillover effects of Bank of Japan tightening: If the Bank of Japan continues its rate hike trajectory, it will further narrow the US-Japan interest rate differential, possibly prompting some yen carry trades to unwind, reducing the supply of yen liquidity to the global market, indirectly creating a tightening effect on US dollar liquidity. Market performance expectations: Under the combined effect of the above factors, overall market liquidity is expected to maintain a tight stance in the short term, and may even experience periodic liquidity tension. For risk assets such as Bitcoin, this means that upside may face greater resistance, and market volatility may intensify. 2.4.2 Mid-term (next 3-12 months) liquidity outlook: Gradual improvement but with significant variables Fed policy shift’s gradual nature: The market generally expects the Fed to initiate a rate cut cycle in the second half or end of 2025, and end QT in the second half of 2025. If this expectation materializes, it will bring substantial marginal improvement to market liquidity. However, the magnitude and pace of rate cuts will be highly dependent on economic data (inflation, employment) at that time, with significant uncertainty. If inflation is stubborn or the economy is unexpectedly strong, the timing of rate cuts may be further delayed, and the extent of improvement will also be limited. Manifestation and digestion of tariff impact: If the inflation shock brought by US-China tariffs appears as expected in the third quarter and is gradually absorbed by the market, without triggering uncontrolled inflation expectations, then in the context of subsequent inflation data decline, the Fed’s policy space may reopen. But if the tariff shock exceeds expectations, it may extend the duration of high interest rates and tightening policies. Synchronicity of global central bank policies: Looking at the mid-term, if inflation in major economies is effectively controlled, central bank policies may gradually shift towards easing, forming a synergistic effect that collectively enhances the global liquidity environment. But if the recovery pace of major economies is uneven, policy divergence may intensify, making the path of global liquidity improvement more tortuous. Potential impact of “black swan” events: Escalation of geopolitical conflicts, unexpected financial risks in major economies, and other unforeseen “black swan” events may all have a significant impact on mid-term liquidity expectations. Market performance expectations: Looking to the mid-term, market liquidity is expected to gradually transition from the current tight state to marginal improvement, but the improvement process may be gradual and full of twists and turns. Risk assets such as Bitcoin may gain breathing and rebound opportunities during windows of improved liquidity expectations, but sustained upward movement still requires clearer signals of liquidity easing and fundamental support. Investors need to closely monitor the evolution of various macroeconomic data and policy signals, and flexibly adjust expectations. In summary, for the immediate future, the overall market liquidity environment remains unoptimistic, with short-term tight pressure being relatively certain, while mid-term improvement expectations exist, both the path and magnitude of this improvement are subject to considerable uncertainty. For the Bitcoin market, which is highly dependent on liquidity, this means a need to more cautiously assess risks and be fully prepared for market volatility. 3. Risk Appetite Analysis: Short-term Boost, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists Market risk appetite is another core driver affecting the prices of risk assets such as Bitcoin. Recently, a series of events have had complex effects on market sentiment, overall showing a pattern of short-term boost but significant mid-term uncertainty still existing. 3.1 Tariffs Better Than Expected in Short Term, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists The US-China tariff issue has consistently been a significant driver of global market sentiment, with any developments directly influencing investor risk appetite. In mid-May 2025, economic and trade talks between China and the US yielded an unexpected consensus on tariffs, with both sides agreeing to significantly reduce previously imposed high tariffs within the next 90 days. This breakthrough surpassed the expectations of many market analysts and has provided a clear boost to short-term market risk appetite.: Market sentiment quickly improved: After the news was announced, global capital markets reacted positively, with risk asset prices generally rising. Recession concerns eased: Previously, the market was concerned that escalating US-China trade frictions might lead the global economy into recession, or at least a “hard landing”. The easing of tariffs has reduced the probability of this extreme risk occurring. Corporate earnings expectations improved: High tariffs directly increase corporate operating costs and erode profitability. The reduction or suspension of tariffs helps improve the earnings outlook for companies in related industries, thereby boosting investor confidence in these companies’ stocks. However, although the easing of tariffs has brought positive effects in the short term, uncertainty still exists in the mid-term: Nature of the 90-day buffer period: The agreement reached has a 90-day buffer or suspension period. This means it is not a final solution, and both parties still need to negotiate further arrangements after 90 days. Should a more comprehensive, longer-term agreement is not reached by then, or if new friction points emerge, the tariff issue may escalate again, reversing the current optimistic sentiment. Structural contradictions still exist: Behind the US-China trade frictions are manifestations of deep-seated contradictions in economic structure, technological competition, geopolitics, and other aspects between the two countries. These structural contradictions are difficult to completely eliminate in the short term, which may lead to long-term and complex game-playing in the trade field. Therefore, while the tariff easing has indeed provided a significant short-term boost to market risk appetite, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin, investors must remain vigilant regarding the uncertainty beyond the 90-day buffer period and the enduring, complex nature of US-China trade frictions. Any future developments concerning tariffs will continue to be a crucial disruptive factor influencing overall market risk appetite. 3.2 Geopolitical Situation Still Unclear, But Shows Signs of Improvement (Russia-Ukraine Conflict May End, India-Pakistan Conflict Temporary Ceasefire) Geopolitical risk is an important factor affecting global market risk appetite, and any escalation or easing of conflicts may trigger significant fluctuations in market sentiment. Recently, some positive signals have emerged in some major geopolitical conflict areas. Although the overall situation remains unclear, the marginal improvement helps repair short-term risk appetite. India-Pakistan conflict temporary ceasefire: The tensions between India and Pakistan that have attracted attention recently showed signs of easing in early May 2025. After a period of mutual accusations and escalating military actions, India and Pakistan have agreed to a temporary ceasefire under external mediation or their own considerations. Although this ceasefire is described by some media as a “fragile peace” and its durability remains to be seen, it undoubtedly alleviates the risk of a large-scale conflict erupting in the South Asian subcontinent in the short term. With the easing of international conflicts such as India-Pakistan, global risk aversion sentiment has receded somewhat, which is favorable for risk assets. Potential changes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for several years and has had a profound impact on global energy prices, supply chains, and the geopolitical landscape. Following his assumption of office, President Trump has actively sought to promote a ceasefire between the two sides, and Russia has also conveyed signals of openness to such a possibility.. If there are any signs of substantive ceasefire negotiations, softening of positions by major participants, or progress in external mediation, it could significantly boost global market risk appetite. Conversely, if the conflict escalates again or spills over, it will quickly suppress market sentiment. Dynamics of conflicts in other regions: In addition to the above hotspots, the situation in other potential conflict points around the world (such as the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, etc.) also needs attention. Any unexpected outbreak of conflict or escalation of tensions could rapidly change the landscape of global risk appetite. Overall, the recent temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict is a positive development, helping to cool market risk aversion sentiment in the short term. However, the overall uncertainty of the global geopolitical situation remains high, the direction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still unclear, and other potential risk points still exist. Therefore, the impact of geopolitical factors on market risk appetite will be dynamic, and investors need to closely monitor relevant developments and be alert to any events that may cause sudden changes in market sentiment. 3.3 International Institutional Entry: Deploying Cryptocurrencies or Holding Bitcoin-Listed Companies The increasing participation of institutional investors serves as a crucial indicator of an asset class’s maturity and overall market confidence. In recent years, despite the dramatic fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, international institutions’ interest in and deployment of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has not stopped, but rather shows a trend of continuous deepening and diversification. This trend provides a positive support for market risk appetite in the medium to long term. Continued growth in the scale of listed companies holding Bitcoin: An increasing number of publicly traded companies are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves or making direct investments in the cryptocurrency. According to Bitwise data, in the first quarter of 2025, the total amount of Bitcoin held by globally publicly traded companies exceeded 688,000, with a quarter-on-quarter growth of 16.11%, accounting for 3.28% of the total Bitcoin supply. CoinEdition points out that listed companies have purchased more than 196,000 Bitcoin so far in 2025, exceeding the new Bitcoin supply mined during the same period, reflecting the growing demand for corporate inflation hedging and strategic reserves. MicroStrategy and Tesla are typical representatives. The Bitcoin holding behavior of these listed companies not only directly increases the demand for Bitcoin, but also conveys to the market the institutional recognition of Bitcoin’s long-term value, thereby boosting overall market confidence. Potential interest from sovereign funds and pension funds: Although currently disclosed information is limited, market speculation suggests that some sovereign wealth funds and large pension funds are actively researching or making small-scale allocations to crypto assets. If more such large long-term investors enter the market in the future, it will have a more profound impact on the Bitcoin market. In summary, in the short term, market risk appetite has been boosted by tariff easing, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation, and continued institutional entry, but in the mid-term, many uncertainty factors still exist, and market sentiment may still fluctuate with the progress of key events. For high-volatility assets like Bitcoin, their price performance will be highly dependent on the direction of overall market risk appetite, while positive changes at the policy level are laying the foundation for structural improvement in its risk appetite. 3.4 Risk Appetite Level Summary and Outlook In the short term (next 1-3 months), market risk appetite has been significantly boosted by factors such as the 90-day easing agreement on US-China tariffs, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation such as the temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict, and continued international institutional entry into cryptocurrencies. This optimistic sentiment is expected to continue in the short term, providing support for risk assets such as Bitcoin. However, the market still needs to be vigilant about technical corrections after the previous positive news is digested, as well as emotional fluctuations brought by sudden news. Looking at the mid-term (next 3-12 months), market risk appetite faces greater uncertainty, but also has the potential for structural improvement. Key variables influencing mid-term risk appetite include the trajectory of US-China trade relations after the 90-day tariff buffer period concludes, the evolution of major geopolitical risks such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the growth prospects and policy paths of major global economies. If these factors all develop in a positive direction, market risk appetite is expected to continue to improve; otherwise, it may come under pressure again. Whether institutional funds can continue to flow into the crypto market on a large scale will also be an important indicator measuring mid-term market confidence. 4. Policy Game and Fiscal Trends: Tax Cuts, Regulation, and Strategic Reserves’ Multidimensional Impact Beyond liquidity and risk appetite, policy-level games and changes are increasingly becoming key variables affecting the crypto market. This chapter will deeply analyze the Trump administration’s tax reduction policy, the dynamics of cryptocurrency strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, the evolution of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the latest progress in innovative policies such as US stock tokenization, exploring the potential impact paths of these policy variables on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. 4.1 “Big Beautiful Tax Plan” Reappears: Stimulus and Deficit Coexist President Trump, who took office in early 2025, is actively promoting his signature “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, which will have a profound impact on macro liquidity and market risk appetite. In early May, the House Ways and Means Committee released part of the tax cut bill, with core content including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and raising the child tax credit cap. At the same time, Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution in April, authorizing a total tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years, including $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. This transcendent fiscal stimulus plan is described by the Trump administration as injecting “rocket fuel” into the economy, aimed at stimulating economic growth. However, such a large-scale tax cut plan, accompanied by the reality that spending cuts are difficult to implement, will inevitably expand the fiscal deficit and need to be accompanied by raising the debt ceiling. According to authoritative institution estimates, the permanent extension of the 2017 tax reform alone will add about $4.6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. The Trump administration has also proposed partially offsetting the cost of tax cuts by significantly increasing tariff revenue, but this strategy may have the side effects of suppressing trade activities and raising prices. Overall, this tax policy is biased towards easing in the short term, which is favorable for risk asset sentiment, but in the mid-term, concerns about fiscal sustainability will rise significantly. 4.2 Positive Signals of Crypto-Friendly Policies and Latest Progress in US Stock Tokenization Exploration Recently, the United States has shown some positive signals in cryptocurrency regulation and innovation, especially at the policy level and market practice level, providing new catalysts for the improvement of risk appetite. 4.2.1 Policy Environment Has Begun to Change and Legislative Attempts Are Being Made Although the comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US is still forming, some positive developments worth noting have emerged at the legislative level. The US Senate has made significant progress in stablecoin legislation. The much-anticipated “GENIUS Act” aims to provide a clear framework for stablecoin issuance and regulation. Reports as of mid-May 2025 indicate that related negotiations have reached consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, and a key Senate vote has already taken place around May 19, with the bill advancing. The core content of the bill includes Federal Reserve regulation for stablecoin issuers with assets exceeding $10 billion, while smaller institutions are regulated by state-level regulatory authorities, and requires all stablecoins to be 100% backed by high-quality liquid assets such as US dollar cash or short-term US Treasury bonds. Recent amendments also address strengthening rules for technology companies entering financial assets, enhancing consumer protection mechanisms, and reinforcing oversight of government officials’ related activities.. Although the House has previously passed a similar “STABLE Act”, and the Senate has once been hindered due to key Democratic senators withdrawing support, both parties are still actively promoting it. In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands has recently passed its regional stablecoin bill, allowing the issuance of the “Tinian Island Stablecoin” pegged to the US dollar. These legislative efforts, whether at the federal or local level, indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure observation or scattered enforcement actions towards providing clearer guidance and standardized development for the market, which is crucial for the long-term healthy development of the stablecoin market and the stability of overall crypto market risk appetite. In addition, discussions on digital asset market structure are also underway, aiming to balance innovation and investor protection. Although the process may be long and full of game-playing, these legislative efforts themselves indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure suppression to standardized development, which is crucial for the stability of long-term risk appetite. 4.2.2 US Stock Tokenization Exploration and Latest Progress US stock tokenization, that is, transforming traditional stocks into digital tokens (Security Token Offering, STO) through blockchain technology, is becoming a new emerging field of market attention. This innovation aims to improve the liquidity, accessibility, and trading efficiency of US stocks, reduce transaction costs, and may provide more convenient investment channels for global investors. According to the latest market dynamics, the exploration of US stock tokenization is accelerating: Regulatory attention and discussion: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown continued attention to tokenization. For example, the SEC’s Special Working Group on Crypto Assets held a roundtable on tokenization issues on May 12, 2025, to explore its potential regulatory framework and market impact. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw also delivered a keynote speech at the meeting, indicating that regulatory agencies are actively researching and evaluating this emerging field. Market participants’ active practice: Specific stock tokenization platforms are already emerging in the market. For example, MyStonks announced the launch of its on-chain US stock token market on May 10, 2025, and emphasized that its tokens are backed by 100% custodial assets, marking the gradual implementation of compliant US stock tokenization trading platforms. Entry of traditional financial institutions and infrastructure construction: Large traditional financial institutions have also begun to deploy in the tokenization field. JPMorgan announced at the Consensus conference in May 2025 that it has successfully completed settlement tests of tokenized US Treasury bonds on public blockchains in collaboration with Ondo Finance and Chainlink, and expressed a positive outlook for broader securities tokenization (including stocks). In addition, asset management company VanEck also announced on May 15, 2025, the launch of its tokenized US Treasury fund on multiple blockchain networks. Although these developments are not directly equivalent to US stock tokenization, they lay important infrastructure and practical experience for the overall asset tokenization, especially the on-chain circulation and settlement of securities assets, indicating that US stock tokenization may receive stronger technical and market support in the future. Growth expectations of market size: Industry research institutions have optimistic expectations for the market size of tokenized assets. For example, Markets Media’s report on May 14, 2025, cited research indicating that the tokenization scale of real-world assets (RWA) is expected to grow from about $0.6 trillion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion in 2030, with the tokenization of securities assets being an important component. Although US stock tokenization still faces challenges at the legal level (such as the issue of “equal rights for stocks and tokens”) and regulatory approval, its huge potential and the positive interaction between regulation and the market have attracted widespread attention from the industry. If regulatory policies can gradually become clear and support such innovation, the advancement of US stock tokenization will greatly expand the application scenarios of digital assets, and may attract more traditional financial institutions and investors to enter the crypto field, thereby significantly enhancing market risk appetite. Trend of incorporating crypto assets into traditional financial products: In addition to US stock tokenization, discussions on incorporating cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) into traditional financial products (such as the 401(k) retirement plans mentioned by Coinbase CEO) are also heating up. If such integration is achieved, it will bring considerable incremental funds and a broader investor base to the crypto market, which is a great boost to market confidence and risk appetite. 4.3 Latest Progress of US Federal and State Bitcoin Strategic Reserves New regulations on “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” at the US federal level: Recently, there have been some discussions and legislative attempts at the US federal level regarding the establishment of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which has profound significance for the positioning of Bitcoin and institutional acceptance. According to a presidential action released by the White House on March 6, 2025, it mentioned the initiative to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and US digital asset reserve, and pointed out that government Bitcoin deposited in the strategic Bitcoin reserve “shall not be sold and shall be maintained as a reserve asset of the United States”. Furthermore, relevant legislative proposals exist at the US Congressional level, such as the 2025 BITCOIN Act (S.954), which aims to formalize a strategic Bitcoin reserve and ensure transparent management of federal government Bitcoin holdings. These federal-level initiatives, even in their preliminary stages, significantly elevate Bitcoin’s status as a strategic asset, providing stronger policy expectations and legal endorsement for institutional investors to include it in their asset allocation strategies. US states have made uneven progress in incorporating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into reserve assets, but the overall trend is noteworthy. New Hampshire took the lead in early May 2025 by passing the landmark H.B. 302 bill, formally authorizing the establishment of a state-level strategic crypto reserve, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of state funds in digital assets including Bitcoin and precious metals, becoming the first state in the US to achieve such legislation. This breakthrough provides an important demonstration effect for other states. However, not all state attempts have been smooth sailing. For example, a similar bill in Arizona aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves was vetoed by the governor in May 2025. According to the latest statistics, about 26 states across the US are considering or have proposed legislative drafts related to Bitcoin reserves, but the final prospects of many bills remain unclear, and proposals in some states have also encountered resistance or been vetoed. Nevertheless, these positive explorations and legislative attempts at the state level, whether successful or not, reflect that the recognition of Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset is gradually deepening, and may pave the way for attracting more traditional institutional investors (such as pension funds, endowment funds, etc.) to pay attention to and allocate Bitcoin, although the process may be full of challenges. 4.4 Policy Game Summary and Outlook The current policy environment presents a complex and evolving dynamic, characterized by both positive catalysts and potential risk points. The Trump administration’s large-scale tax cut plan will boost market sentiment in the short term, but may cause liquidity fluctuations in the mid-term due to the expansion of the fiscal deficit; policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of the tax cut bill, the final establishment and implementation of regulations related to strategic Bitcoin reserves, the improvement of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the implementation of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization will be key variables affecting the structural changes in the crypto market. The outcomes of these policy deliberations will directly affect the direction of market liquidity and risk appetite, thereby having a profound impact on the price performance of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Investors need to grasp the structural opportunities brought by long-term institutionalization trends while paying attention to short-term policy fluctuations. 5. Stablecoin Financial Management Strategies and Yield Comparison in the Current Environment In the face of the current macro and regulatory environment, stable yield-generating stablecoin financial management strategies are favored by investors. In the high interest rate background, some USD stablecoin financial solutions can already provide yields comparable to or even exceeding traditional markets, while the risk is relatively controllable. The following will introduce several recently hot stablecoin financial management strategies in the market, including their annualized yields, risk characteristics, and will be supplemented with charts comparing the yields of different strategies, helping readers with different risk preferences to choose optimally. 5.1 Backpack Backpack Exchange provides a one-stop trading and financial management platform, and its USD lending model has attracted attention recently. Backpack increases lending rates to give lenders extra returns . Currently, lending USD on Backpack can earn about 4.94% APY total return, including the basic market interest rate and 3.8% additional incentives. This yield is not particularly high compared to other platforms, but it excels in simplicity and transparency (essentially lending USDC to margin traders to earn interest). Backpack is suitable for low-risk preference users to obtain a rate slightly higher than money market funds. 5.2 Resolv Resolv Labs’ USR stablecoin strategy is a true Delta-neutral yield model. It hedges price risk through position combinations, while generating returns from funding rates of futures perpetual contracts and other risk-free arbitrage opportunities, then separating the returns to RLP token holders, keeping USR stable at 1:1. The current comprehensive annualized yield of this strategy is about 15% , part of which comes from incentives from protocols such as Pendle. The USR pool on the Base chain on the Pendle platform shows about 17.0% APY (including Pendle reward contributions), while the USR yield on Ethereum is slightly lower at about 9.4%. Overall, Resolv USR is a high-yield stablecoin, but it should be noted that it is backed by complex derivative strategies and incentive tokens. 5.3 Aave + Pendle This refers to depositing funds into lending protocols such as Aave to earn basic interest (e.g., depositing USDC to get 4%), and then tokenizing future interest through Pendle for trading, to lock in higher fixed rates or mine Pendle incentives. Currently, products on the Pendle platform that lock in Aave/Compound interest rates, such as CUSDC, CUSDT pools, have annualized rates of around 11%. For example, Compound’s USD stablecoin yield token CUSDO in the Pendle pool has an APY of about 11.5%. This means that through Pendle, users have the opportunity to amplify Aave’s 4-5% interest rate to nearly double digits (part of the return comes from Pendle platform rewards). The advantage is that it is still based on the interest of top lending protocols, with high security; the disadvantage is that it requires accepting Pendle token floating rewards and a certain operational threshold. All things considered, this strategy can currently achieve ~10% annualized returns . 5.4 Falcon Finance Falcon has launched the USDf (sUSDf) synthetic stablecoin strategy. Its model is to stake various assets to mint USDf, and through protocol design, USDf holders earn high yields. According to reports, USDf staking can provide over 10% APY . Falcon has recently integrated with Pendle, incorporating sUSDf into Pendle pools, further increasing on-chain yield rates. The Falcon strategy offers tempting returns, but it should be noted that USDf is an emerging synthetic asset, and systemic risk and collateral quality need to be evaluated. 5.5 Coinshift csUSDL The csUSDL launched by Coinshift is an institutional-grade stablecoin yield token . It is based on USDL issued by Paxos (100% backed by short-term US Treasury bonds and cash), with on-chain lending interest from the Morpho protocol added on top. Users holding csUSDL can automatically increase their balance daily without the need for locking or staking. Since the underlying assets are T-Bills and Aave lending, csUSDL returns mainly come from US Treasury bond interest (currently about 5%) plus DeFi interest, with a current total APY of around 10% . Its advantages are high transparency, security (supported by regulated assets + smart contract audits), and liquidity supported through Curve and others. Its disadvantage is that the yield rate is not outstanding but still better than traditional bank interest rates. 6. Conclusion and Investment Outlook: Multidimensional Impact of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy and Investment Strategy Combining the four dimensions of liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, we make the following judgment on the Bitcoin market outlook: In the short term (next 1-3 months): The Bitcoin market may show a pattern of intensified volatility or even downward pressure. On one hand, the significantly tight liquidity expectation, especially the potential shock from the unwinding of yen carry trades, will limit its upside space; on the other hand, the improvement in risk appetite in the short term may provide some support, but it is difficult to completely offset the negative impact of tightening liquidity. The Trump administration’s tax cut policy, while boosting market sentiment in the short term, could introduce liquidity shocks in the third quarter due to potential US debt ceiling issues and the need for Treasury General Account (TGA) replenishment. The market may see a correction after consolidation at high levels, or experience violent fluctuations within a range. Investors need to closely monitor the release of various macroeconomic data, policy signals, and the latest developments in tariffs and geopolitical situations, operate flexibly, and pay high attention to risk control. In the mid-term (next 3-12 months): The direction of the Bitcoin market will be more uncertain, with both opportunities and challenges. If global liquidity can achieve marginal improvement as expected, and market risk appetite continues to warm up due to the positive resolution of various uncertainty factors (especially the positive implementation of regulatory policies and the deepening of institutional adoption), then Bitcoin is expected to usher in a new round of upward trend. Policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. However, if liquidity tightening exceeds expectations, or frequent risk events lead to a sharp rise in risk aversion sentiment, Bitcoin may also face significant correction pressure. Key points to watch: In the coming period, investors should focus on the following aspects: The Fed’s policy path: including interest rate decisions, the end point and method of QT, and public statements by Powell and other officials. US inflation and employment data: These are the core basis affecting Fed decisions. Subsequent progress of US-China tariff negotiations : The direction after the 90-day buffer period is crucial. Evolution of major global geopolitical risks : Especially the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India-Pakistan conflict, and Middle East situation. Changes in the US TGA account and debt ceiling issues : The potential impact on short-term liquidity cannot be ignored. Bank of Japan’s monetary policy and yen carry trade dynamics : Direct impact on global liquidity allocation and US dollar liquidity. Progress of global cryptocurrency regulatory policies : Especially legislative and enforcement dynamics in major markets such as the US, including the progress of regulations related to “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and the implementation of the stablecoin regulatory framework. Scale and continuity of institutional fund inflows into the crypto market : Especially data on Bitcoin spot ETFs and actual allocations of sovereign and state-level reserves. Specific implementation of Trump’s tax cut policy : Including its impact path on fiscal deficit, debt ceiling, and market liquidity. Development and innovation of the stablecoin market : Including clarification of the regulatory framework, evolution of yield products, and changes in institutional participation. In summary, the Bitcoin market in 2025 will trudge forward in the fog of macroeconomics and the game of multiple policies. Investors need to maintain a high degree of vigilance and flexibility, deeply research market fundamentals, rationally evaluate risks, and make prudent investment decisions. Finding certainty in uncertainty will be the key to investing in Bitcoin in the coming period. At the same time, stablecoin financial management strategies also provide investors with an effective way to obtain stable returns amid market volatility, which deserves appropriate weight in asset allocation.
