A significant step has been taken towards potentially bringing a SUI ETF to mainstream investors. Asset management firm 21Shares has officially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a spot SUI ETF on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This move is generating considerable buzz within the Cryptocurrency ETF space and for the SUI community. What Exactly Did 21Shares File for a Spot SUI ETF? On May 23, 21Shares submitted a 19b-4 rule change filing to the SEC. This filing is a crucial step required by exchanges (in this case, Nasdaq ) when proposing a rule change that would allow a new type of product, like a spot crypto ETF, to be listed and traded. This follows their initial S-1 registration statement filing on May 1, which outlines the proposed structure and details of the fund itself. Think of the S-1 as the blueprint for the ETF, and the 19b-4 as the formal request to the exchange ( Nasdaq ) and the regulator (SEC) to allow trading of that blueprint’s product. The proposed SUI ETF would hold actual SUI tokens, relying on reputable custodians like Bitgo and Coinbase Custody to securely store the underlying assets. This structure is what defines it as a ‘spot’ ETF, directly tracking the price of SUI by holding the asset itself. Why is a Spot ETF Such a Big Deal for SUI and Crypto? The concept of a Spot ETF for cryptocurrencies has been a major topic of discussion and anticipation. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset. For SUI, this means the fund would own SUI tokens. Here’s why this is significant: Increased Accessibility: A Spot ETF makes it much easier for traditional investors, including institutions and retail investors with brokerage accounts, to gain exposure to SUI without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, set up wallets, or worry about private keys. Regulatory Clarity: SEC approval of a SUI ETF would lend a degree of regulatory legitimacy to SUI as an asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential for Greater Liquidity: As more capital flows in through an ETF structure, it could potentially increase liquidity and market efficiency for SUI. Mainstream Adoption: Listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq places SUI alongside traditional financial assets, integrating it further into the mainstream financial system. This move by 21Shares is part of a broader trend where asset managers are pushing for regulated investment products for various cryptocurrencies, following the successful launches of spot Bitcoin and potentially spot Ethereum ETFs. What Are the Challenges and Next Steps for the SUI ETF Filing? While the filing is a positive development, it’s not a guarantee of approval. The path to launching a Cryptocurrency ETF in the U.S., especially a Spot ETF for an altcoin like SUI, involves navigating the SEC’s rigorous review process. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC examines factors like market manipulation concerns, investor protection, and the readiness of the underlying market. Precedent: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, approval for other altcoins is less certain and depends on the SEC’s evolving stance and assessment of each specific asset’s market. Timing: The SEC has specific timelines for reviewing 19b-4 filings, which can involve comment periods and potential delays. The next steps involve the SEC reviewing the filing, potentially soliciting public comments, and ultimately deciding whether to approve or deny the rule change. The crypto community and potential investors will be closely watching for updates from the SEC regarding this SUI ETF proposal from 21Shares . How Does This Filing Fit into the Broader Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape? The filing for a SUI ETF by 21Shares highlights the growing interest from traditional finance in offering regulated investment products for a wider range of digital assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. It signifies a maturation of the crypto market and increasing demand from investors for familiar, regulated avenues to access these assets. This development, alongside filings for other single-asset crypto ETFs and thematic crypto funds, paints a picture of a financial ecosystem slowly but surely integrating digital assets. The success or challenges faced by this specific SUI ETF filing could potentially set precedents or provide insights for future altcoin ETF applications. What Does This Mean for SUI Holders and Enthusiasts? For those already invested in SUI or following the project, the filing of a Spot ETF is generally seen as a bullish signal. It indicates growing institutional interest and the potential for significant new capital inflows if approved. While the immediate price impact is speculative, the long-term implications of increased accessibility and legitimacy could be substantial. It’s important for investors to stay informed about the filing process and understand that SEC approval is not guaranteed. However, the fact that firms like 21Shares are actively pursuing these products underscores the perceived potential and demand for SUI within the broader financial market. In conclusion, 21Shares ‘ filing for a Spot SUI ETF on Nasdaq is a pivotal moment for the SUI ecosystem and the broader Cryptocurrency ETF market. While challenges remain, the filing represents a significant step towards potentially bringing SUI into the portfolios of a wider range of investors through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. The coming months will be critical as the SEC reviews this proposal.

A significant transaction recently caught the eye of market watchers, specifically a substantial ETH transfer . We’re talking about 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $265 million, making its way from the Arbitrum network directly to the Binance exchange. This kind of activity, often highlighted by services like Whale Alert, raises immediate questions about market dynamics and potential future actions. What Happened with this Significant ETH Transfer ? The core event is straightforward: a single, massive transfer of 100,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens occurred. This isn’t your everyday transaction; it represents a considerable portion of value moving across networks. The source was identified as a wallet on the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution, and the destination was a wallet associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Whale Alert, a service that tracks large crypto transactions, was the first to publicly report this movement, bringing it to the attention of traders and analysts worldwide. To put the scale into perspective: Amount: 100,000 ETH Approximate Value: $265 million (at the time of the report) Origin: Arbitrum Network Destination: Binance Exchange Reported By: Whale Alert This kind of movement is often associated with a ‘ crypto whale ‘ – an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their actions can sometimes have a noticeable impact on market sentiment and liquidity. Why Move Funds From Arbitrum to Binance ? Exploring the Reasons Moving such a large sum of ETH from a Layer 2 network like Arbitrum to a centralized exchange like Binance isn’t done without reason. Arbitrum is popular for its lower transaction fees and faster speeds compared to the Ethereum mainnet, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or simply holding assets efficiently. Moving funds OFF a Layer 2 and ONTO a CEX suggests a shift in intended activity. Here are some common motivations behind such a large ETH transfer : Preparing to Sell: The most common assumption is that the owner intends to sell some or all of the ETH on the exchange. Centralized exchanges like Binance offer high liquidity, making it possible to execute large sell orders without drastically impacting the price (though a $265M order would still require careful execution). Arbitrage Opportunities: The whale might be moving funds to capitalize on price differences between Binance and other exchanges or platforms. Staking or Earning: While staking is possible on Layer 2, Binance offers various staking, lending, or yield-generating products that the whale might want to utilize. Increased Security (Perceived): Some large holders prefer the perceived security and insurance offered by major centralized exchanges for storing significant assets, especially if they are less active in DeFi. Consolidation: The whale might be consolidating funds from various sources (including Arbitrum) into one place, likely on an exchange, to manage their portfolio more easily or prepare for a large transaction. Funding Other Activities: The funds might be moved to Binance to be converted into other cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, or to fund operations elsewhere. Without direct knowledge of the wallet owner’s identity or strategy, these remain potential explanations. However, the move from a L2 focused on decentralized activity back to a centralized hub like Binance is a key detail. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale ? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their large holdings mean their trading activities can potentially influence market prices due to the sheer volume involved. While the identity behind this specific ETH transfer remains anonymous (as is common in crypto), tracking whale movements is a popular strategy among traders trying to anticipate market shifts. Key characteristics of whale activity: Large Transaction Sizes: Easily moving millions or billions of dollars worth of crypto. Potential Market Impact: Their buy or sell orders can absorb or add significant liquidity. Strategic Movements: Whales often move funds between wallets, exchanges, or networks as part of a larger strategy (e.g., accumulating, distributing, preparing for news events). Anonymity (Often): While transactions are public on the blockchain, linking them to a specific real-world identity is difficult unless the address is publicly associated with an exchange or known entity. This particular whale, moving 100,000 ETH from Arbitrum to Binance , is certainly flexing considerable financial muscle. Understanding their potential motives is crucial for interpreting the event’s significance. What Does This Large ETH Transfer Mean for the Market? A large ETH transfer , especially one of this magnitude ($265M) moving onto a major exchange like Binance , immediately triggers speculation about potential market impact. Here’s a breakdown of what it could signify and the challenges it presents for market interpretation: Potential Implications: Increased Selling Pressure: The most common concern is that the whale intends to sell, which could add selling pressure to the market, potentially leading to a price drop if executed quickly or as a large market order. Liquidity Shift: Moving funds to Binance increases the exchange’s ETH liquidity, which can be beneficial for large trades but also facilitates large sell-offs. Market Sentiment Indicator: Some traders view large transfers to exchanges as a bearish signal, assuming intent to sell. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as bullish (holding or moving to cold storage/DeFi). Preparation for Volatility: Whales sometimes position their assets on exchanges when anticipating significant market volatility, making it easier to react quickly. Challenges in Interpretation: Unknown Intent: As discussed, the whale might not sell immediately or at all. They could be preparing for other strategies. Execution Strategy: Even if they plan to sell, they might do so gradually through over-the-counter (OTC) deals or limit orders spread over time, minimizing market impact. Multiple Factors: The crypto market is influenced by countless factors – macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, technological updates, overall market sentiment – not just single whale movements. Actionable Insights for Readers: While a single whale move isn’t a definitive market predictor, it’s a data point to consider. Keep an eye on the market’s reaction in the short term. Understand that while this large ETH transfer is significant, it’s just one piece of the complex market puzzle. Don’t make trading decisions based solely on this event, but use it as part of your broader market analysis. Summary: Watching the Waves Made by the Crypto Whale The transfer of 100,000 ETH from Arbitrum to Binance is undoubtedly a notable event, highlighting the movements of a major crypto whale . This large ETH transfer , valued at $265 million, sparks crucial questions about the whale’s intentions, with potential reasons ranging from preparing to sell to leveraging exchange services. While such movements can sometimes precede significant price action, interpreting their exact impact is challenging due to the anonymity and varied potential strategies of the whale. Market participants should view this event as an important data point reported by Whale Alert, but remember that the crypto market’s direction is shaped by a confluence of factors. Staying informed about these large transfers, particularly onto major exchanges like Binance , is part of being a vigilant market observer.

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company behind Truth Social, is reportedly making a massive move into the cryptocurrency space. This isn’t just a small pilot program; the company has announced plans to raise a significant amount of capital specifically to build a substantial Bitcoin Treasury . Trump Media’s Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Plan Takes Shape According to recent reports, Trump Media has entered into agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors. The goal? To raise a staggering $2.5 billion. This capital infusion is structured in two parts: $1.5 billion will come from common stock offerings, and an additional $1 billion will be raised through convertible notes. This significant fundraising effort underscores the company’s serious intent. The primary stated purpose for deploying these funds is to establish a corporate Bitcoin Treasury . This means the company intends to convert a portion of the raised capital into Bitcoin, holding it on its balance sheet as a reserve asset. If executed as planned, this would position Trump Media as one of the largest public companies globally by the sheer size of its potential BTC Holdings . Key details emerging about this planned offering include: Total Raise Amount: $2.5 billion Funding Structure: $1.5B via common stock, $1B via convertible notes Number of Investors: Around 50 institutional investors Primary Use of Funds: Establishing a Bitcoin Treasury Expected Closing Date: By May 29 Custody Providers: Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital This strategic decision highlights a growing trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and low-yielding instruments. Why Corporate Bitcoin? Understanding the Treasury Trend The concept of a Corporate Bitcoin treasury gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns. Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy, arguing that holding Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against currency devaluation and serves as a superior store of value compared to cash reserves. Several factors motivate companies to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies through inflation. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time, potentially boosting shareholder value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset can help diversify financial risk. Signaling Innovation: Holding Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and embrace of new technologies. While the primary drivers often relate to macroeconomic concerns and potential financial upside, the decision also involves embracing a relatively new and volatile asset class. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Who Else is Entering the Space? Trump Media’s move is part of a broader wave of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve seen increasing interest and investment from hedge funds, asset managers, and even other public corporations. Some notable public companies that have allocated significant capital to BTC Holdings include: Company Primary Business Reported BTC Holdings (Approx.) Notes MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Pioneer in the corporate treasury strategy, continues to accumulate. Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Purchased early, sold a portion, currently holds a significant amount. Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services & Mobile Payments ~8,030 BTC fintech company, strong advocate for Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~18,000 BTC Bitcoin miner holding a substantial portion of mined coins. Note: These figures are approximate and subject to change based on company disclosures and market activity. The involvement of approximately 50 institutional investors in Trump Media’s fundraising round further underscores the growing appetite among traditional financial players for exposure to the digital asset space, even if indirectly through a public company’s balance sheet. Estimating Trump Media’s Potential BTC Holdings If Trump Media were to allocate a substantial portion of the $2.5 billion raise towards purchasing Bitcoin, its potential BTC Holdings could be significant. For context, MicroStrategy’s current holdings are valued in the billions of dollars. A $2.5 billion allocation, depending on the prevailing Bitcoin price at the time of purchase, could place Trump Media among the top corporate holders globally. For example, if Bitcoin were trading around $60,000 per coin, a $1 billion allocation could potentially acquire over 16,000 BTC. A $2 billion allocation could acquire over 33,000 BTC. These numbers would immediately position Trump Media’s treasury alongside or even exceeding some of the existing large corporate holders, excluding dedicated Bitcoin mining or investment firms. The exact amount allocated to Bitcoin will depend on the company’s treasury management strategy and other potential uses for the raised capital. However, the stated intent to establish a “Bitcoin treasury” suggests a meaningful allocation is planned. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury While the potential upsides of holding Bitcoin are attractive, establishing a Bitcoin Treasury also comes with unique challenges and risks that companies must carefully consider. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The primary allure is the potential for Bitcoin’s value to increase significantly over time, boosting the company’s balance sheet value. Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against inflation and currency debasement, particularly relevant in the current global economic climate. Enhanced Profile: Can attract investors interested in technology and digital assets, potentially broadening the company’s shareholder base. Significant Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which can introduce significant volatility to the company’s balance sheet and earnings reports. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance and legal risks. Security and Custody: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Relying on reputable custodians like Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital is crucial. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, potentially impacting how holdings are reported and taxed. Public and Shareholder Scrutiny: The decision to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin may face criticism from some shareholders or the public. Companies adopting this strategy must implement robust risk management frameworks and ensure transparent communication with their investors. What’s Next for Trump Media and Corporate Crypto? The expected closing of the $2.5 billion offering by May 29 is a key date to watch. Following the successful raise, the focus will shift to how and when Trump Media begins accumulating Bitcoin for its treasury. The market reaction to this news, both for TMKG shares and the Bitcoin price itself, will also be closely monitored. This move by a high-profile, publicly traded company could potentially encourage other corporations, perhaps those previously hesitant, to explore adding digital assets to their balance sheets. It further validates the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance, driven by growing Institutional Bitcoin interest. The role of the chosen custodians, Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital, is also noteworthy. These platforms provide the secure infrastructure necessary for managing large-scale BTC Holdings , a critical component for any corporate treasury strategy involving digital assets. Ultimately, Trump Media’s plan to establish a large Bitcoin Treasury through this significant fundraising effort marks a notable development in the intersection of traditional finance, public companies, and the evolving world of cryptocurrency. It’s a story that will continue to unfold, offering insights into the future of corporate finance and the increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.

An earlier attempt failed on a bipartisan basis after Senate Democrats, led by long-time crypto sceptic Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as several Republicans including Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Kentucky’s Rand Paul, voted against cloture. Lummis, whose staff (along with that of the bill’s co-sponsor, Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York)) has played a key role in the behind-the-scenes negotiations to get the GENIUS Act passed, said that she thinks the Senate has reached a final deal. If the bill passes, both Lummis and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), the bill's sponsor, claimed that it would be the first piece of legislation passed out of the Senate Banking Committee in eight years. “It’s taken a tremendous amount of work,” Hagerty said, speaking on a separate panel discussion on Tuesday. Hagerty added that long-time crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the bill’s main opponent, made a concerted effort to drag out the proceedings in the hopes of stalling the legislation’s progress. Hagerty said that the bill, once passed, would be the most bipartisan piece of legislation to pass through the Senate Banking Committee in over a decade. While the bill’s supporters see that as a win, they’re also frustrated with the difficulty in getting legislation in general passed through the committee. “We don’t have the muscle memory anymore to legislate. That’s our job,” Lummis said. “It really is very frustrating, very exhausting, and you have to keep your creativity, your sense of humor and your patience about you.” Lummis added that she was “very hopeful” the Senate could work behind-the-scenes with the House on a market structure bill, noting that the House has the advantage of “muscle memory” (following its passage of FIT21 last year) over the Senate when it comes to the next hurdle of crypto legislation.",Policy|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-27 23:18:10

Strive, a name increasingly associated with strategic investments, has just closed a substantial Strive PIPE round , pulling in a remarkable $750 million. This isn’t just another funding announcement; it signals an aggressive move into specific, often overlooked, corners of the market, particularly those involving Bitcoin claims and broader crypto acquisition strategies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s a noteworthy development for anyone following the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. Unpacking the $750M Strive PIPE Round So, what exactly happened? Strive successfully completed a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) round. This is a way for a publicly traded company (or one planning to go public soon) to raise capital by selling stock directly to a select group of accredited investors, often at a discount to the current market price. In this case, Strive raised an initial $750 million by selling shares at $1.35 each. But wait, there’s more. The deal includes an option to increase the total funding by another $750 million upon the exercise of warrants. This means the potential total capital infusion could reach a staggering $1.5 billion, providing Strive with significant firepower for its stated objectives. Why use a PIPE? For companies, it can be a faster way to raise large sums of capital compared to traditional public offerings. For investors, it offers a chance to buy shares at a potentially favorable price, especially if they believe in the company’s long-term strategy. This particular Strive PIPE round is one of the larger ones seen recently, especially within the context of digital asset-related ventures, highlighting the growing institutional appetite for exposure to this sector, albeit through structured deals. Where is This Massive Digital Asset Investment Headed? According to reports, the primary purpose of this significant capital raise is to fuel Strive’s acquisition strategy. This isn’t a simple buy-and-hold Bitcoin play. Strive is targeting a diverse range of assets, indicating a complex, multi-pronged approach: Biotech Firms: This might seem surprising in a crypto context, but it suggests Strive is building a diversified portfolio, potentially leveraging insights or capital from one sector to support another. It highlights that Strive’s ambitions extend beyond just digital assets. Distressed Bitcoin Claims: This is where things get particularly interesting for the crypto community. Strive is specifically looking to acquire claims related to situations where Bitcoin or other digital assets are tied up, often due to exchange failures, hacks, or legal disputes. Discounted Structured Bitcoin Credit Instruments: This refers to complex financial products where Bitcoin is involved, often as collateral or part of a lending/borrowing arrangement, that are currently trading below their intrinsic value. This strategy suggests Strive is looking for value in non-traditional places, leveraging potential discounts available in complex or distressed situations rather than just buying liquid assets on the open market. Focusing on Distressed Bitcoin Claims: The Mt. Gox Angle The mention of Mt Gox claims is particularly noteworthy. Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, which famously collapsed in 2014 after a massive hack. Years later, rehabilitation efforts are still ongoing to return a portion of the lost Bitcoin to creditors. These claims have been traded privately for years, often at significant discounts to the market value of the underlying Bitcoin, due to the uncertainty and long timeline involved in the recovery process. Strive’s interest in Bitcoin claims like those from Mt. Gox signals a belief that the potential upside from resolving these claims outweighs the risks and complexities. Buying distressed claims requires specialized legal and financial expertise to navigate the recovery process and potentially profit from the difference between the purchase price and the eventual payout. This isn’t limited to Mt. Gox. There are other instances of exchanges or platforms where customer assets have been frozen or lost, creating opportunities to acquire these distressed claims at a discount. Strive appears to be positioning itself as a major player in this niche, aiming to capitalize on the eventual release of these locked-up digital assets. The Broader Impact of This Crypto Acquisition Strategy What does Strive’s aggressive crypto acquisition plan mean for the wider market? Firstly, it validates the idea that there is significant value locked up in distressed digital asset situations. A $750M-$1.5B war chest dedicated partly to acquiring these assets could accelerate the process of getting some of this capital back into circulation, potentially impacting market liquidity and sentiment. Secondly, it highlights the increasing sophistication of institutional players entering the digital asset space. Strive isn’t just buying Bitcoin; they are engaging in complex financial engineering and distressed asset recovery, strategies common in traditional finance but relatively new on a large scale in crypto. Thirdly, the focus on discounted structured credit instruments involving Bitcoin shows a growing interest in the more complex layers of the digital asset ecosystem beyond just spot trading. This suggests maturation in the market, with players seeking opportunities in derivatives, lending, and structured products. Potential Benefits and Opportunities Strive’s strategy could unlock several benefits: For Strive: Potential for significant returns by acquiring assets below market value and successfully navigating recovery processes. Diversification across biotech and digital assets. For Claim Holders: Provides liquidity options for those holding distressed Bitcoin claims who prefer cash now over waiting years for an uncertain payout. For the Market: Could help clear up legacy issues like Mt. Gox, potentially returning significant amounts of Bitcoin to circulation. Signals strong institutional confidence in the long-term value of digital assets, even those tied up in complex situations. Challenges and Risks Ahead However, this strategy is not without its hurdles: Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and recovering value from distressed assets is complex and requires specialized expertise and legal work. Market Volatility: The value of the underlying Bitcoin or other digital assets can fluctuate wildly, impacting the profitability of claims and credit instruments.

Worldpay, a giant in the payment processing world, is stepping firmly into the realm of digital currencies by enabling USDC payouts for its clients in the United States and Europe. This move isn’t just news; it’s a clear signal that major financial players see the value and necessity of integrating crypto solutions into mainstream finance, particularly for businesses operating across borders. Worldpay’s Major Step into Crypto Payments Worldpay, known for processing trillions of dollars in transactions annually ($2.5 trillion last year alone, to be precise), is a critical piece of infrastructure for businesses worldwide. Their decision to support payouts in USDC, a leading regulated stablecoin, marks a pivotal moment. It signifies a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets within established financial systems. For years, cross-border payments have been plagued by delays, high fees, and complex processes. Worldpay’s embrace of crypto payments via USDC aims to tackle these very pain points head-on, offering a potentially faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative for global businesses. What is Worldpay Offering? USDC Payouts Explained At its core, Worldpay is enabling businesses to send funds directly to recipients using USDC . Instead of relying solely on traditional banking rails that can involve multiple intermediaries and take days to settle, businesses can now leverage the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology. This service is specifically designed for companies that have significant global disbursement needs – think platforms paying international freelancers, marketplaces settling with overseas sellers, or corporations sending funds to remote employees or partners. The integration is being facilitated with support from specialized crypto infrastructure providers BVNK and Fireblocks, ensuring robust and secure handling of digital assets within Worldpay’s existing framework. Here’s a simple breakdown of what this means: For Businesses: They can initiate payouts through their Worldpay interface. Behind the Scenes: Worldpay, supported by partners like BVNK and Fireblocks, handles the conversion and transfer of funds into USDC on the blockchain. For Recipients: They receive USDC directly, often in minutes rather than days, provided they have a compatible digital wallet address. Why Stablecoin for Global Disbursements? The choice of stablecoin , specifically USDC, is crucial here. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency (in USDC’s case, the US dollar). This stability is paramount for payments and disbursements. Businesses need predictability; they need to know that the value of the funds they send today will be the same when the recipient receives them. Volatility is the enemy of payroll and supplier payments. By using a stablecoin , Worldpay mitigates this risk, making digital currency payouts a viable and attractive option for standard business operations where value preservation is key. Benefits of using a stablecoin like USDC for payouts include: Value Stability: Reduces exchange rate risk compared to volatile crypto assets. Speed: Transactions can settle much faster than traditional methods, often within minutes. Cost-Effectiveness: Can potentially offer lower transaction fees, especially for cross-border transfers. 24/7 Availability: Blockchain networks operate around the clock, unlike traditional banking hours. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (though recipient identity is not always public, the transaction itself is traceable). The Role of BVNK and Fireblocks in This Digital Currency Move Worldpay isn’t building this infrastructure entirely from scratch. They are leveraging the expertise of specialized firms in the digital asset space. BVNK likely provides the crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, handling aspects like crypto-to-fiat conversions and regulatory compliance in the digital asset realm. Fireblocks is a leading provider of secure digital asset custody and transfer technology, ensuring that the movement and storage of the digital currency (USDC) are protected against hacks and operational risks. This collaboration highlights a common trend: large traditional finance companies partnering with established crypto infrastructure providers to safely and efficiently enter the digital asset market. Benefits for Businesses Using Worldpay USDC Payouts So, why should a business consider switching to USDC payouts via Worldpay ? The advantages are compelling, particularly for those with a global footprint: 1. Faster Settlement Times: Waiting days for international wires can impact cash flow and operational efficiency. USDC transactions can settle in minutes, drastically speeding up payment cycles. 2. Reduced Costs: Traditional cross-border payments often involve multiple correspondent banks, each adding fees. Blockchain transactions can cut out intermediaries, potentially lowering costs significantly, especially for frequent or smaller transfers. 3. 24/7 Global Reach: The traditional financial system operates on business hours and weekends. Blockchain is always on, enabling businesses to send payouts anytime, anywhere, instantly reaching recipients across different time zones. 4. Access to New Markets/Recipients: For individuals or businesses in regions with limited access to traditional banking but growing crypto adoption, receiving USDC might be easier and more accessible than receiving a bank transfer. 5. Enhanced Transparency: While not absolute anonymity, the blockchain provides a clear, immutable record of transactions, which can simplify reconciliation and auditing processes. Navigating Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are significant, businesses considering USDC payouts should also be aware of potential challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is still evolving globally. Businesses need to ensure they and their recipients comply with local laws regarding digital asset holdings and transactions. Recipient Onboarding: Recipients need to have a compatible digital wallet and understand how to receive and potentially convert USDC. Worldpay and its partners will likely provide tools or guidance, but recipient education is key. Integration Complexity: While Worldpay aims to make it seamless, integrating new payment methods into existing accounting and treasury systems requires planning. USDC Specifics: While stable, USDC’s stability relies on its reserves. Businesses should understand how USDC is backed and regulated (Circle is a regulated entity, and USDC is subject to audits). Tax Implications: Handling and transacting in digital currencies have tax implications that businesses need to understand and manage according to relevant jurisdictions. Real-World Applications and Examples Who stands to benefit most from this new service? Consider these scenarios: Freelance Platforms: Paying remote workers across the globe quickly and affordably. E-commerce Marketplaces: Settling payments with international sellers or suppliers. Gaming Platforms: Distributing rewards or earnings to players worldwide. Payroll for Remote Teams: Sending salaries or stipends to employees in different countries. Remittance Services: Offering faster and potentially cheaper ways for individuals to receive money from abroad (though Worldpay’s focus is B2B/B2B2C). These examples illustrate the practical, tangible benefits of leveraging a stablecoin like USDC for routine business disbursements. It moves crypto beyond speculation and into a tool for operational efficiency. The Broader Impact on Finance Worldpay’s move is more than just a new feature; it’s a bellwether for the future of global finance. When a player of Worldpay’s size and influence integrates digital currencies, it signals a maturing market and encourages further institutional adoption. It validates the potential of stablecoins as a reliable medium of exchange for mainstream financial activities. This could pave the way for other large payment processors and financial institutions to explore similar integrations, accelerating the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It also puts pressure on traditional payment networks to innovate and improve their speed and cost-efficiency. Conclusion: A New Era for Global Payments Worldpay’s introduction of USDC payouts in the U.S. and Europe is a significant development for businesses with global payment needs. By leveraging the stability of USDC and the underlying blockchain technology, supported by experts like BVNK and Fireblocks, Worldpay is offering a compelling alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. While challenges related to regulation and adoption remain, the benefits of speed, cost-efficiency, and 24/7 availability are clear. This move solidifies the role of stablecoins like USDC as practical tools for global commerce and signals a promising future where digital currency is seamlessly integrated into the world’s financial infrastructure, potentially revolutionizing how businesses send and receive money across borders.

While our primary focus is on the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, understanding movements in traditional markets, particularly the stock market open , is crucial. This is because there’s often a significant crypto market impact tied to shifts in broader investor confidence and capital flows. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters to you. Decoding the Positive US Stock Markets Open The trading day commenced with a notable uptick across major indices, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. This higher open didn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s typically influenced by a confluence of factors, ranging from economic data releases and corporate earnings reports to geopolitical developments and overall market psychology. When US stock markets start the day strong, it can suggest increased risk appetite, which sometimes spills over into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Breaking Down the Numbers: S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow The positive momentum is clearly reflected in the performance of the key benchmarks shortly after the open: S&P 500: Gained 0.88% NASDAQ Composite: Saw a significant rise of 1.37% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Increased by 0.59% These numbers indicate broad-based strength, with technology and growth stocks, heavily represented in the NASDAQ, showing particular vigor. The S&P 500 , often seen as a barometer for the broader market, also posted solid gains. This collective upward movement paints a picture of optimism pervading the traditional financial sector. The Crypto Market Impact: Understanding the Correlation Now, let’s connect the dots. The relationship between traditional markets and crypto is complex and evolving. At times, Bitcoin and altcoins have acted as uncorrelated assets, moving independently. However, in recent years, particularly with increased institutional involvement, we’ve seen periods of strong correlation. A positive stock market open , especially one driven by factors like easing inflation fears or strong economic outlooks, can foster a risk-on environment. In such an environment, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies. This potential crypto market impact is why monitoring traditional indices is valuable for crypto enthusiasts. What This Investor Sentiment Shift Could Mean A higher open across major indices like the S&P 500 often reflects improving investor sentiment . When confidence is high, market participants are more willing to invest, leading to increased buying pressure. This positive mood can be contagious, potentially influencing sentiment in adjacent markets like crypto. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers (regulatory news, technological developments, specific project updates), positive macroeconomic tailwinds and robust investor sentiment in traditional finance can provide a supportive backdrop. Benefits of Positive Stock Market Sentiment for Crypto: Potential for increased capital inflow into crypto. Improved overall market confidence. Reduced panic selling driven by macroeconomic fears. Challenges and Nuances: Correlation isn’t guaranteed; crypto can decouple. Specific crypto news can outweigh traditional market influence. Volatility remains inherent in the crypto space regardless of stock market performance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive US stock markets open and the potential for a positive crypto market impact , what should crypto investors consider? Observe Correlation: Pay attention to whether crypto assets are tracking traditional markets or showing independent movement. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising stock market often signals higher risk appetite. Consider if this aligns with your own investment strategy. Stay Informed: While stock market news is relevant, remember that crypto markets have their own ecosystem of news and developments that are equally, if not more, important. Diversify Wisely: A strong traditional market doesn’t eliminate crypto volatility. Maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. The current stock market open provides a snapshot of the broader financial mood. While it’s a positive sign, it’s just one piece of the puzzle when navigating the crypto landscape. Summary In conclusion, US stock markets saw a strong open today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ, and Dow all posting gains. This positive start reflects improved investor sentiment in traditional finance. While the connection isn’t always direct, a robust stock market open can potentially have a positive crypto market impact by fostering a risk-on environment. Crypto investors should monitor these trends as part of a broader strategy, keeping in mind the unique drivers and inherent volatility of the digital asset space.

According to on-chain researcher Carmelo Alemán, TRX could “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if BTC continues its bull run through the rest of the year. A Catalyst for Altcoin Growth Bitcoin, down 0.5% in 24 hours to trade at $109,500 at this writing, remains the gravitational force in crypto markets. As Alemán noted in a May 27 quick take on CryptoQuant, tokens with a high association to BTC, usually measured using the Pearson coefficient, tend to amplify gains during bull cycles. “A strong correlation with Bitcoin means that tokens sharing this dynamic could experience significantly assured growth,” the analyst wrote. They highlighted cryptocurrencies like TRX, Sui (SUI), Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) for their historical synchronicity with BTC’s movements. According to them, while Bitcoin’s $2.17 trillion market cap limits its upside, TRX’s $26 billion valuation offers more explosive potential. “Bitcoin is unlikely to grow more than 2x from its current price,” argued the researcher. “Highly correlated tokens could triple, quadruple, or more, simply because their smaller market caps make such expansions more feasible.” The king cryptocurrency’s current rally has created fertile ground for connected altcoins. Although it has cooled slightly from its May 22 all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, it has risen 16.4% over the past month. Still, its seven-day performance shows a more modest 3.7% uptick. Nonetheless, the broader trajectory remains bullish, with BTC up 60% across the last 12 months, riding on the back of institutional demand and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. Against this backdrop, TRX has edged out its more established counterpart across multiple timeframes. Since yesterday, the token has risen 1.9%, while over the last 30 days it has gained more than 10.4%. However, across the year, TRX has really shone, with its 146.4% improvement more than doubling BTC’s gains in the same period. The upward trend has brought the altcoin to $0.2768, just 35% below its ATH of $0.4313, reached in December last year. TRX’s Resilience and Risk Metrics Signal Strength It’s not the BTC tie-in alone that’s driving bullish sentiment. Tron has seen rapid network growth and increased adoption across Asia. Additionally, in a historic shift, the supply of Tether (USDT) on the network surpassed that on Ethereum, signaling rising utility and trust. CryptoQuant’s recent drawdown heatmaps and risk metrics back this up, showing that TRX maintains one of the most resilient positions in the market, even as other altcoins stumble. The token’s 180-day Sharpe Ratio stands between 0.1 and 0.15, while its Normalized Risk Metric hovers near 0.5, indicating a strong risk-return profile. Mid this month, data from the on-chain analytics platform also revealed that all TRX holders, from one-week traders to long-term investors, were in profit . This rare alignment often triggers a positive feedback loop, as lucrative users tend to evangelize the asset, attracting new entrants.

According to crypto data from Coingecko, BNB price gained over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $687 on Tuesday, during the late North American trading session, As a result, BNB regained a market cap of over $100 billion, with a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1 billion. The notable surge in crypto FOMO significantly helped BNB price to regain bullish sentiment amid the highly anticipated altseason. BNB Rises on Favorable Fundamentals The rise and adoption of the BNB chain by mainstream users has heavily bolstered the success of its decentralized financial products. For instance, the PancakeSwap (CAKE ) has continued to record historical daily volume following the notable mainstream adoption of the ecosystem’s tokens and memecoins. According to market data from Defillama, the BSC network had a total value locked of about $6.5 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $10.1 billion. Most importantly, the BSC chain recorded a daily average active users of about 2 million. Short Term Targets BNB price has gradually followed Bitcoin (BTC) price action in the past two months. In the past three weeks, BNB price has consolidated in a symmetrical ascending triangular pattern, with a crucial resistance level around $687. As a result, it is safe to assume that the BNB bulls have been gaining more ground over the sellers in the past. With Bitcoin price on the cusp of a major rally, catalyzed by heightened demand from institutional investors , BNB price is well positioned to rally beyond $687. Moreover, the four-hour MACD line remains above the zero line amid the growing bullish histograms. As the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) works on piercing the 70 percent level, BNB price is aiming at rallying above $790 soon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-27 23:49:04

A recent, alarming development in Paris highlights this dark side, where police have made significant arrests in connection with violent crypto-related kidnapping attempts. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the growing threat of crypto crime Paris and the urgent need for enhanced security measures among crypto holders. Understanding the Rise of Crypto Crime Paris Why are individuals with cryptocurrency holdings becoming targets for violent crime? The answer lies in the perceived wealth associated with digital assets and the pseudonymous nature of transactions, which some criminals mistakenly believe makes tracking impossible. While blockchain technology offers transparency, accessing someone’s digital wallet, especially under duress, presents a direct path to potential riches for criminals. The crypto crime Paris cases are not isolated incidents but reflect a disturbing global trend where digital wealth is translating into real-world physical threats. Criminals are becoming more sophisticated, moving beyond online scams to physical violence. This escalation underscores a critical challenge for the crypto community: how to enjoy the benefits of digital assets without becoming a target. Details of the Shocking Crypto Kidnapping Cases The recent arrests in Paris are linked to at least two particularly brutal cases of crypto kidnapping . According to reports, these weren’t random acts but targeted attacks on individuals believed to hold substantial cryptocurrency. One victim was the father of a well-known poker player, while the other target was the daughter of a crypto exchange CEO. These choices suggest criminals are researching and identifying individuals associated with the crypto industry or those known for significant digital asset holdings. The violence involved in these attempts is particularly chilling. Victims were reportedly assaulted, with one suffering a horrific injury, losing a finger. Such brutality highlights the extreme lengths these criminals are willing to go to extort digital assets. The successful police operation leading to the Paris crypto arrests is a crucial step in disrupting such rings, but the incidents themselves serve as a grim warning to others. Paris Crypto Arrests: Police Action and Warnings French authorities have taken decisive action, leading to the Paris crypto arrests of 12 suspects. It’s concerning to note that this group reportedly included minors, indicating the potential for recruitment of younger individuals into these dangerous criminal activities. The police investigation into these crypto kidnapping plots underscores the increasing focus of law enforcement on crimes involving digital assets, particularly when they spill over into violent physical acts. Following these arrests, authorities have issued strong warnings to the public, especially to those holding cryptocurrency. A key piece of advice is to avoid publicly flaunting wealth or advertising significant crypto holdings. In the digital age, even seemingly innocuous online posts or mentions in social circles can attract unwanted attention from individuals looking for potential targets. Law enforcement is urging crypto holders to exercise extreme caution in both their online and offline interactions. Prioritizing Cryptocurrency Security and Crypto Safety The Paris incidents make it clearer than ever that robust cryptocurrency security is paramount. Protecting your digital assets goes beyond just technical measures; it also involves personal safety and discretion. Here are some essential crypto safety tips and security measures that every crypto holder should consider: Maintain a Low Profile: Avoid discussing your crypto investments or holdings publicly, including on social media. The less visible your connection to significant digital wealth, the lower your risk of becoming a target for crypto crime Paris or elsewhere. Enhance Wallet Security: Relying solely on exchange accounts can be risky. Explore using hardware wallets for cold storage of significant holdings. For active funds, consider wallets that offer advanced security features. Implement Multi-Signature (Multisig) Wallets: Multisig requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This means that even if one key is compromised or obtained under duress, the attacker cannot move funds without the other keys. This is a powerful defense against coercion. Utilize Time Locks: Some wallets and smart contracts allow for time locks, which prevent funds from being moved until a certain amount of time has passed. This can provide a window for intervention if a transfer is initiated under duress. Use Strong, Unique Passwords and 2FA: Basic security hygiene is still critical. Use complex, unique passwords for all crypto-related accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. Be Wary of Phishing and Scams: While the Paris cases involved physical violence, online threats remain prevalent. Be vigilant against phishing emails, fake websites, and social engineering attempts designed to steal your keys or seed phrases. Review Permissions for DApps: When interacting with decentralized applications (DApps), be cautious about the permissions you grant to your wallet. These measures, particularly multisig and time locks, add layers of protection specifically relevant in scenarios involving physical threats or unauthorized access attempts, making it significantly harder for criminals to quickly drain wallets even if they gain physical access or coerce a victim. The Broader Implications for Crypto Safety The violent crypto kidnapping cases in Paris are a grim indicator of how real-world crime is adapting to the digital asset landscape. As the value and adoption of cryptocurrencies grow, so too does the potential risk for those who hold them. It’s no longer just about protecting against hackers or online scams; physical safety and discretion are becoming increasingly important aspects of overall crypto safety . Law enforcement agencies worldwide are playing catch-up, developing specialized units and expertise to tackle crypto crime . However, the first line of defense remains the individual crypto holder. By being informed about the risks, adopting stringent cryptocurrency security practices, and maintaining a degree of privacy regarding one’s holdings, individuals can significantly reduce their vulnerability. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant, Stay Secure The arrests in Paris over violent crypto kidnapping attempts are a stark and disturbing reminder that the risks in the crypto world extend beyond volatile markets and online fraud. Physical safety is now a significant concern for those with visible or perceived crypto wealth. The successful Paris crypto arrests are a positive step, but the underlying threat of violent crypto crime Paris and globally persists. It is imperative for all crypto holders to re-evaluate their cryptocurrency security posture. Adopt advanced wallet security features like multisig and time locks, be acutely aware of your digital footprint, and exercise caution in your interactions. Your crypto safety depends not just on technical safeguards but also on smart, discreet personal behavior.

This allows customers to scan and spend crypto on-site, a key milestone in its plan to make BTC everyday money. The initiative reflects Block’s belief that Bitcoin can become the internet’s native currency , giving small businesses more payment options and control. Square starts live Bitcoin payments at a live event Square launched its new real-time Bitcoin payment system that was set up inside BTC Inc.’s pop-up merchandise truck during the Bitcoin 2025 conference at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The system is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than regular on-chain payments because it uses the Lightning Network, a special technology that processes transactions off the main blockchain. Users don’t need to understand how crypto works to make a payment as they’ll scan a QR code at checkout and let Square handle the real-time conversion rates, payment confirmation, and converting bitcoin into US dollars. Block’s Bitcoin product team lead, Miles Suter, joined in 2017 and is now helping connect Bitcoin across multiple Block products. This includes Spiral, Cash App, Bitkey, and Square, after years of experience building crypto tools. The Las Vegas event was a live test to see how real-time BTC payments could work in retail. Block plans to make the feature globally available by 2026 with regulatory approval from the target areas. Block builds full toolkit to help small businesses use Bitcoin Block wants to make Bitcoin the native currency of the internet and is building a complete set of tools to help small and medium-sized businesses accept, manage, and benefit from using Bitcoin in everyday operations. The company has doubled down on Bitcoin as its core bet on the future of money, while other fintech firms invest in stablecoins and tokenized dollars. Over 1,000 sellers have adopted the company’s Bitcoin Conversion tool, automatically changing a portion of their daily sales into BTC. The company claims that the merchants’ Bitcoin holdings grew by around 70% over the past year. Block’s new real-time Bitcoin checkout feature also allows merchants to receive payment in BTC and instantly convert it to US dollars without any price volatility or risk. Block is also building its “Bitcoin for Business” toolkit to help small businesses accept payments in BTC through a standard transaction or a quick QR code scan and instantly convert between US dollars and Bitcoin. Sellers who want to hold their Bitcoin can withdraw it to Block’s secure self-custody wallet, Bitkey, without using third-party exchange platforms. Block’s Bitcoin ecosystem connects Cash App for trading, Bitkey for wallet and custody, Spiral for open-source development, and Proto for mining infrastructure to build a full-stack Bitcoin platform that works for both consumers and merchants. Bitcoin prices are at an all-time high, while many companies still treat it as a store of value. Block believes they can increase Bitcoin adoption rates by showing real utility. Block also hopes to level the playing field and push Bitcoin into the mainstream economy, one sale at a time, by giving small businesses the same tools that big companies use.

The 2025 investment question everyone’s asking,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/28/is-ruvi-the-next-doge-the-2025-investment-question-everyones-asking/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has carved out a unique place in the crypto world. Originally started as a joke, the meme-based cryptocurrency rose to prominence thanks to its community-driven nature and endorsements from high-profile personalities like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s success is a testament to the power of community engagement and the ability of unconventional ideas to challenge market norms. But as we look ahead to 2025, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be the next big thing that redefines crypto success stories. Dogecoin’s legacy Dogecoin began as a playful take on cryptocurrency, capturing the internet’s adoration with its Shiba Inu mascot. Despite its lighthearted origins, it became a serious contender, achieving astounding growth and a committed user base. However, critics have pointed out the coin’s lack of utility, which could limit its potential in the long term. Ruvi AI’s game-changing vision While Dogecoin leaned heavily on humor and community, Ruvi AI brings a fundamentally different approach to the table. Built as a decentralized AI superapp, Ruvi combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to provide secure, scalable, and innovative solutions. It’s a project rooted in strong technical fundamentals, making it more than just a token; it’s a platform aiming to solve real-world problems. Ruvi’s community-driven ecosystem ensures its users are not just participants but active contributors to its growth and development. This blend of utility and shared ownership has positioned Ruvi AI as a project with significant long-term potential, drawing comparisons to Dogecoin’s early days in terms of community enthusiasm but offering far more in terms of practical application and growth opportunities. A fast-growing success story Ruvi AI’s presale performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. During Phase 1, tokens sold out in just over two weeks, rewarding early supporters with a 50% gain. Currently priced at $0.015, Ruvi’s next presale phase will see a 33% price increment, and analysts predict the token could reach $1 in the near future. These numbers reflect a strong investor belief in Ruvi AI’s potential. Ruvi’s recent collaboration with WEEX Exchange further amplifies its reach and market accessibility, ensuring adequate liquidity and global availability of its token. Tailored investment opportunities Ruvi AI offers a variety of investment tiers for participants looking to maximize returns: VIP Tier 1 ($510 investment with 20% bonus): Total Tokens: 40,800 (34,000 base + 6,800 bonus). Value at $0.07: $2,856. Value at $1: $40,800. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07: $15,680. Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $0.07: $89,600. Value at $1: $1,280,000. Community leaderboard incentives Ruvi AI actively rewards its most loyal and engaged community members through its leaderboard rewards program: Top 10 Contributors: 500,000 bonus tokens, valued at $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 Contributors: 250,000 bonus tokens, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 Contributors: 100,000 bonus tokens, equating to $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. Ruvi AI vs Dogecoin Where Dogecoin thrives on simplicity and viral culture, Ruvi AI offers real-world utility and scalability, setting it apart in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Its innovative decentralized AI platform stands to revolutionize industries and solve pressing challenges in data security, machine learning, and decentralized finance. Simply put, Ruvi AI has the technical edge that Dogecoin lacks, combined with a community enthusiasm reminiscent of Dogecoin’s rise. Join the revolution Could Ruvi AI be the next Dogecoin? While their paths may differ, the potential impact of Ruvi AI on the cryptocurrency space is undeniable. Its blend of innovation, community focus, and robust investment incentives make it one of 2025’s most exciting projects. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big crypto success story.

The top performing cryptos now reflect more than momentum. They bring tools, systems, and networks designed to last. One example is Unstaked, a project gaining traction with its approach to on-chain engagement. Alongside it, Solana, Render, and Hedera are also showing signs of technical strength and increasing traction. Here’s how Unstaked fits into the wider group of top performing cryptos, and how others compare. 1. Unstaked ($UNSD): Building AI Tools Before Launch Unstaked has not launched yet, but its presale growth shows rising interest. Now in stage 15, the price sits at $0.009831, and more than $7.5 million has been raised. The confirmed launch price is $0.1819, setting expectations for future value. Still, it’s not only the pricing that is drawing attention. The project plans to allow users to launch AI agents designed to handle online marketing and engagement. These agents are not yet operational but will become available after launch. The idea is to use these agents across apps like X, Telegram, Discord, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Each tier is matched to a different user need, offering flexible use as the platform grows. The starting plan gives one AI agent and up to 50 monthly posts. The next level, called the Creator Plan, gives access to three agents and links to five platforms. The highest plan includes ten agents, no platform limit, 5,000 monthly posts, and tools for tracking performance. Together, these tools create a setup that works for individuals, content creators, and full marketing teams. As people look for the top performing cryptos with more than hype, Unstaked makes a strong case for utility at scale. 2. Solana (SOL): Network Stability Supports Price Climb Solana continues to show why it remains a major player among high-speed blockchains. After recovering from earlier volatility, the network has maintained strong price levels and developer interest. Its fast transaction speeds, reaching more than 65,000 TPS, support a growing ecosystem of dApps. As network stability improves, Solana is seeing renewed activity in both DeFi and NFTs. The recent upward price move has caught attention, especially from those watching top performing cryptos. Institutional capital has also begun entering the ecosystem through new staking tools and growth incentives. If this trend continues and uptime remains reliable, Solana may hold its position among top-performing names over the coming weeks. 3. Render (RNDR): Meeting Demand for Decentralized Compute Render has made progress in the GPU and AI computing space, offering decentralized solutions for rendering tasks and machine learning. As demand for processing power rises, RNDR has attracted users from digital design, gaming, and AI development industries. This connection to real-world use cases is helping drive its market value. The project recently shared updates on upcoming integrations and extended utility, helping lift the RNDR price. It continues to appear on lists of top performing cryptos because of its position in a growing field that connects both creative content and AI. Render gives access to distributed computing at a time when centralized GPU services face scaling issues and cost barriers. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Networks Gain Momentum Hedera Hashgraph stands apart by targeting enterprise applications. Its council includes major companies like Google and IBM, and its design supports energy-efficient, high-throughput operations. The proof-of-stake model behind Hedera helps balance performance and sustainability. HBAR has recently posted notable gains, drawing attention from those tracking top performing cryptos. Its network has seen more activity around tokenized assets and stablecoins, adding to its appeal. While Hedera may not move on short-term hype, its steady ecosystem growth and enterprise focus make it a strong candidate for long-term strategies. Final Take: Utility and Structure May Shape What’s Next Solana, Render, and Hedera each bring different strengths to the market. Their use cases and network development offer steady momentum. Unstaked adds another layer by introducing tools that help projects grow independently. Its AI agent system, while not yet live, is designed for automation and scalability across digital platforms. With several pricing tiers and a utility model built into its framework, Unstaked combines infrastructure with function. The presale is still underway, and the difference between its current and confirmed launch price offers a notable upside. For those scanning the market for top performing cryptos , the real question might be which project offers both short-term movement and long-term systems users can depend on. Unstaked is working toward both.

45178685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759359,1748390423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45178685.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-120000-could-be-next/,"A new Bitcoin price analysis confirms that the flagship cryptocurrency is still in a bullish trend after its recent bounce off a key re-accumulation zone. With key structural support levels intact and a bullish AB=CD pattern unfolding, analysts are now eyeing a potential surge above $120,000, marking a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price Targets $122,000 After AB=CD Completion According to a technical analysis report by TradingView crypto analyst Weslad, Bitcoin is accurately following a well-defined bullish trajectory, potentially paving the way for a surge to $122,000. With BTC now priced at $109,747 at the time of writing, reaching this ATH target would represent an 11.17% increase from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens This optimistic forecast comes on the heels of an accurate AB=CD pattern on the BTC chart—-a harmonic structure that previously hinted at significant upside potential. Notably, the Bitcoin price has since retraced into a key re-accumulation zone between $104,000 and $107,000 — a move the analyst described as a healthy correction rather than a reversal. Weslad has disclosed that the present re-accumulation zone is a price range where buyers are believed to be stepping in again. As long as Bitcoin stays within or above this zone, the analyst asserts that its market will remain bullish. Currently, Bitcoin is trading well-above the crucial psychological support of $100,000, reinforcing its bullish position. The broader market structure also remains intact within an Ascending Channel, supported by higher timeframe demand zones. According to Weslad’s analysis, if Bitcoin can firmly hold its price within the $104,000 – $107,000 range, the cryptocurrency could see a significant increase to the 2.618 Fibonacci Extension level near $122,000. Adding to this bullish case, a breakout above the $112,000 resistance is also needed to confirm the next leg of this move, marking a potentially stronger and larger upside momentum. BTC Set For Major Pullback Before Breakout As the Bitcoin price approaches the local resistance around $111,000, Weslad warns that the market may face a temporary hurdle before the continuation of the projected uptrend. The TradingView analyst notes that if price action is rejected at this resistance level, traders should anticipate a potential re-test of the $107,000 – $108,000 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Indicator Says It’s Not Over Yet As Parabola Signals Fail This area has served as a reliable barrier during the recent consolidation phase and is expected to hold firm in the event of a minor correction. Most recently, Weslad affirmed that this anticipated corrective move has already concluded, signaling that the market is now poised for the “real growth phase.” With the base demand zone around $86,000 – $91,000 and strong support around $96,000 – $99,000, Bitcoin’s overall structure remains bullish unless a decisive breakdown below $100,000 occurs. Until then, all eyes remain on the $112,000 breakout level, which could trigger a potential surge toward the projected $122,000 target.

Right now, smart buyers are skipping the hype and focusing on undervalued projects with solid use cases and strong long-term growth. That’s where Web3 ai stands out. It’s designed to serve both solo traders and institutional teams with powerful analytics and practical tools. For anyone looking to get ahead before the market picks up speed, here’s the list of top bullish crypto projects that could turn the fortunes. 1. Web3 ai: $5.7M Raised, 1,747% ROI Potential, Real AI Tools in Action Web3 ai is quickly gaining ground with a platform built for all types of market participants. It delivers an adaptive AI ecosystem designed for both individual traders and institutional teams. Post-launch, users can access AI-generated signals, live price alerts, and clear portfolio updates daily. Meanwhile, institutions can plug into robust APIs for automated strategies, risk tracking, and detailed performance analysis. Now in Stage 6 of its presale, Web3 ai ($WAI) is priced at $0.000383 and has raised over $6 million so far. With a listing price expected at $0.005242, the projected ROI stands at 1747%. This isn’t a project waiting for traction, it’s already building smart tools that respond to shifting market trends. For those scanning the bullish crypto to buy now, Web3 ai stands out as an early-stage opportunity with real-world utility and long-term upside. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Still Leading with Smart Contract Strength Ethereum stays strong as one of the most reliable platforms in crypto. It supports the biggest tools in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. This gives it a huge edge, especially after switching to proof-of-stake, which cuts energy use and improves speed. With more developers and businesses using Ethereum, its network keeps growing. Layer 2 tools like Arbitrum and Optimism also help scale up its power. Even with new coins launching, Ethereum remains a top option for those looking for steady growth. It’s still one of the best picks for anyone exploring the most bullish crypto in the market. Its deep network use and strong base make it a go-to name for both new and experienced holders. 3. SUI: Fast and Ready for Future dApps SUI is building momentum as a high-speed Layer 1 chain. Created by former Meta developers, it focuses on speed, low latency, and solid performance, perfect for apps in gaming and finance. Its design allows multiple transactions at once without slowdown, which is a major plus for developers who want real-time use without delays. Its smooth tools and strong network support are also attracting teams that want a reliable space to build. As more builders look for efficient blockchains, SUI’s rise makes sense. With solid features and room to grow, SUI ranks as a bullish crypto that can be watched closely among today’s best options. 4. XRP: Quiet Climb Through Real Financial Utility XRP is making a steady comeback, backed by its use in real banking systems and clearer legal ground. Ripple’s push for cross-border payments has made XRP more than just a coin; it’s now part of a larger system that moves money fast and cheaply across countries. Now that there’s better clarity on XRP’s legal side, more people are paying attention again. Its core strength is in fast transactions with low costs, exactly what institutions need. As real-world use continues to grow, XRP is becoming a bullish crypto to hold, especially for those focused on blockchain’s role in global finance. Last Note Getting in before the crowd often leads to the highest returns. Web3 ai proves that with a current presale price of just $0.000383 in Stage 6 and over $6 million raised. Aiming for a listing price of $0.005242, the project shows strong growth potential. The projected 1747% ROI isn’t just hype; it’s backed by solid planning and working tools. At the same time, Ethereum offers smart contract power, SUI delivers speed, and XRP offers real banking use. All of them show traits of bullish crypto projects worth watching. But for early movers looking for value and utility, Web3 ai leads the pack among the top cryptos to buy right now. The market is shifting, and coins with true function are winning. From solid networks to tools with real impact, each project here stands out for its use, not just its price action.

Hyperliquid is closing in on a $4.5 breakout, driven by steady demand for its decentralized trading model and consistent support levels. Pepe is also attracting interest, with technical indicators suggesting a possible 20 percent rally. Its chart structure and buyer activity reflect renewed optimism among short-term traders. But beyond the quick gains, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering a different kind of strength. With nearly 200,000 wallet holders, over $272 million raised, and a 2,520 percent ROI since launch, it is building long-term traction that goes deeper than price trends. Hyperliquid Eyes Breakout as $4.5 Resistance Comes into Focus Hyperliquid (HYPE) is showing strong technical positioning as it hovers near the $4.5 resistance level. Recent price action has remained solid above $3.80, with steady trading volume supporting continued momentum. Short-term moving averages are trending upward, and buyers have consistently defended support zones, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Interest in Hyperliquid’s decentralized perpetual exchange platform is growing, which adds utility to the token’s current valuation. If HYPE breaks above $4.5 with confirmation, it may open the way to higher targets in the short term. Continued volume strength and user growth will be key indicators to watch. PEPE Builds Strength as Technical Signals Support 20% Upside Pepe (PEPE) is flashing bullish signals, with its price holding steady around $0.00001436 and a reliable support base at $0.0000135. The convergence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages below the current price suggests a phase of consolidation that often leads to upward movement. The Relative Strength Index currently sits at 62, signaling more room for growth before reaching overbought conditions. If PEPE holds above support and buying pressure increases, the next key target lies at $0.000015. A strong push beyond that could extend gains toward the $0.000018 to $0.000020 range. BlockDAG Approaches 200K Holders as Presale Surge Gains Real Momentum BlockDAG is rapidly approaching a major milestone with nearly 200,000 unique holders now participating in its 2025 presale. This surge is more than just a number. It represents widespread grassroots momentum and a growing level of confidence in the project’s long-term value. Unlike many early-stage tokens that lose traction, BlockDAG continues to expand its base with strong appeal among developers, crypto newcomers, and experienced market participants. The project’s presale has already raised more than $272 million and sold over 21.3 billion BDAG coins. Since batch 1, this has translated into a remarkable 2,520 percent return. Currently in batch 28 at a standard rate of $0.0262, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time price freeze at just $0.0020 until June 13. This window gives late adopters a rare opportunity to access the token at early-stage levels. What makes this growth especially significant is that it stems from real development progress. BlockDAG supports EVM-based smart contracts and already has a live testnet running, proving that the technology is being built and tested in real time. These fundamentals strengthen its credibility beyond typical presale hype. As BlockDAG edges closer to 200,000 holders, its presale momentum continues to build. With transparent milestones, scalable tech, and strategic pricing, the project is shaping up to be one of the most impactful launches of 2025. Closing Remarks Short-term moves in tokens like Hyperliquid and Pepe often bring temporary attention, especially when technical patterns align. But BlockDAG’s steady approach toward 200,000 holders signals something more durable. This is not just a reaction to charts but a reflection of growing community strength and belief in long-term outcomes. With over $272 million raised and a presale that continues to expand, BlockDAG is showing signs of real traction. It is not chasing momentum. It is creating it. For those looking beyond immediate gains, BlockDAG presents a broader vision grounded in scale, utility, and consistent progress.

According to the analyst, HYPE is “still cheap” when you take into account the platform’s growth trajectory in the decentralized exchange space. “Why do you still get paid on buying HYPE at $39: – Lots of normies unable to buy, these people cannot figure out how to get on-chain – Spot not listed in any tier-one exchange – Claiming token is expensive here is not pricing in any growth, while Hyperliquid’s been growing open interest double-digit percentage week-over-week – $770,000,000 at present revenues of buybacks (market buys) – Exchanges are the most profitable businesses in the entire crypto world, you get exposure to the fastest-growing one – No unlocks from private market investors, no vesting bags and no sweetheart deals – Most importantly, builder codes, if you’re a developer building a product that wants to interact with perp trading, there is only one venue to build on and that’s Hyperliquid. Still cheap, my take profit levels at $40 billion circulating. Not fully diluted valuation. $100 also psychological level to be aware of.” HYPE has a market cap of $12.402 billion, indicating a 222% upside potential if the layer-1 platform hits Flood’s profit-taking level. At time of writing, HYPE is worth $37.07.

Two major players, Avalanche and Filecoin , have officially connected their networks through a groundbreaking cross-chain data bridge. This development isn’t just a technical integration; it represents a significant step forward for the entire Web3 ecosystem, particularly concerning how decentralized applications handle and store data. What Exactly is This Avalanche-Filecoin Cross-Chain Bridge? At its core, the announcement from Ava Labs, the team behind the high-performance Avalanche blockchain, and the Filecoin Foundation, supporting the decentralized storage network, details the creation of a link between Avalanche’s C-Chain (its smart contract compatible chain) and the Filecoin network. Think of it as building a secure, digital highway between two previously separate digital cities. This specific bridge allows smart contracts operating on Avalanche to interact directly with the Filecoin network. What does this mean in practice? It means applications built on Avalanche can now leverage Filecoin’s vast, decentralized storage capabilities for storing data. Traditionally, storing large amounts of data directly on a blockchain like Avalanche can be expensive and inefficient. Blockchains are optimized for transaction processing and maintaining a secure, immutable ledger of state changes, not for housing terabytes of files or media. This is where Filecoin comes in, offering a network designed specifically for decentralized data storage. Why is a Cross-Chain Bridge Between Avalanche and Filecoin Important? The significance of this cross-chain bridge lies in solving a fundamental challenge in Web3 development: efficient and cost-effective data management. As decentralized applications (dApps) become more complex, they generate and require access to increasing amounts of data – user profiles, game assets, historical transaction logs, multimedia content, and more. Attempting to store all this data on a transactional blockchain is impractical. It drives up costs, slows down network performance, and isn’t the right tool for the job. Centralized storage solutions, while cheaper, reintroduce single points of failure and contradict the core principles of decentralization. This bridge provides a decentralized alternative. By allowing Avalanche smart contracts to send data to and retrieve data from Filecoin, developers get the best of both worlds: Avalanche’s Speed and Scalability: For executing smart contracts and handling high-throughput transactions. Filecoin’s Decentralized Storage: For storing large, static, or less frequently accessed data reliably and affordably. The connection ensures that while the bulk of the data resides off-chain on Filecoin, the critical link, the ‘pointer’ or identifier for that data, can be securely stored and verified on the Avalanche blockchain. This maintains the integrity and decentralized nature of the application. Unlocking the Power of Decentralized Storage for Avalanche Filecoin is a leading network in the decentralized storage space. Unlike cloud storage providers like AWS or Google Cloud, Filecoin operates on a peer-to-peer network where storage providers earn rewards for storing data reliably and proving they are doing so over time. This creates a robust, censorship-resistant, and potentially more cost-effective way to store digital information. Bringing Filecoin’s capabilities directly to the Avalanche ecosystem via this bridge unlocks several possibilities: Cost Efficiency: Storing large files on Filecoin is significantly cheaper than storing them directly on the Avalanche C-Chain. This reduces operational costs for dApps. Enhanced Data Persistence: Data stored on Filecoin is replicated across multiple independent storage providers, making it more resilient to outages or censorship than data stored on a single centralized server. Scalability: Filecoin is designed to scale horizontally, accommodating massive amounts of data as the network grows. Avalanche dApps can now tap into this scalable infrastructure. Decentralization: Aligning data storage with the decentralized nature of the Avalanche blockchain strengthens the overall decentralization of applications built on it. This integration makes building data-intensive dApps on Avalanche more viable and more truly decentralized. How Does This Integration Benefit Web3 Data Storage? The broader impact of this bridge extends to the entire landscape of Web3 data storage . As Web3 evolves, the need for robust, decentralized, and efficient ways to manage data becomes paramount. NFTs require metadata storage, decentralized social networks need content storage, gaming platforms need asset storage, and so on. This Avalanche-Filecoin bridge serves as a prime example of how different blockchain networks and decentralized protocols can specialize and then connect to create a more powerful and functional ecosystem. Avalanche focuses on high-speed, low-cost transaction processing and smart contract execution, while Filecoin focuses on verifiable, decentralized data storage. By bridging these capabilities, developers building on Avalanche now have a direct, standardized way to implement a common Web3 pattern: using a fast, transactional chain for logic and state, and a decentralized storage network for associated data. This pattern is crucial for enabling the next generation of dApps that move beyond simple token transfers and DeFi to more complex applications requiring significant data handling. Practical Examples: What Can Developers Build? With the Avalanche-Filecoin bridge in place, developers on Avalanche can now build dApps with enhanced data capabilities. Here are a few examples: NFT Platforms: Store high-resolution images, videos, or complex metadata associated with NFTs on Filecoin, while keeping the token ownership and core attributes verifiable on Avalanche. This is a common challenge for NFT projects. Decentralized Social Media: Store user-generated content like posts, images, and videos on Filecoin, with links and content hashes stored on Avalanche for integrity and censorship resistance. Gaming: Store game assets, maps, character data, or historical game replays on Filecoin, linking them to in-game items or player profiles managed by smart contracts on Avalanche. Supply Chain and Logistics: Store detailed documents, images, or sensor data related to goods on Filecoin, while using Avalanche to track ownership, provenance, and key events in the supply chain. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Store proposals, meeting minutes, large datasets for analysis, or archival information on Filecoin, accessible and verifiable by DAO members via smart contracts on Avalanche. These examples highlight how offloading data storage to Filecoin via the bridge makes these types of dApps more feasible and performant on the Avalanche network. Considering the Challenges of Cross-Chain Interoperability While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent complexities and potential challenges associated with any cross-chain bridge : Security Risks: Bridges can be potential targets for exploits. Ensuring the security of the bridge infrastructure itself is paramount. Both Ava Labs and Filecoin Foundation will need to prioritize robust security measures and audits. Complexity for Developers: While the bridge simplifies the connection, developers still need to understand how to interact with both the Avalanche smart contract environment and the Filecoin APIs or libraries to manage data storage requests and retrievals. Data Retrieval Speed: Accessing data stored on a decentralized network like Filecoin might have different latency characteristics compared to accessing data directly on a blockchain or from a centralized server. Developers need to design their dApps accordingly. Maintaining Decentralization: The bridge mechanism itself must be designed in a way that doesn’t introduce new points of centralization. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the long-term success and adoption of this integration. Comparing Data Storage Options in Web3 To better understand the value proposition, let’s briefly compare different approaches to data storage in Web3: Storage Method Pros Cons Best For On-Chain Storage (e.g., directly on Avalanche) Highest decentralization, maximum security/immutability, directly linked to smart contract state. Extremely expensive for large data, limited capacity, low performance for retrieval. Critical, small pieces of data directly tied to contract logic (e.g., ownership pointers, simple flags). Centralized Storage (e.g., AWS S3) Cheap, fast, easy to use, high capacity. Single point of failure, censorship risk, not decentralized, goes against Web3 ethos. Not recommended for core dApp data requiring decentralization or censorship resistance. Decentralized Storage (e.g., Filecoin via Bridge) Decentralized, censorship-resistant, potentially cost-effective for large data, scalable, verifiable links on-chain. Can be more complex to implement than centralized, retrieval speed varies, bridge security is critical. Large files, multimedia, historical data, backups, any data needing decentralization but not requiring constant, instant on-chain verification of the full content. The Avalanche-Filecoin bridge enables developers to effectively utilize the ‘Decentralized Storage’ option, which is often the sweet spot for many modern dApps. Actionable Insights for the Web3 Ecosystem What should developers, users, and investors take away from this integration? Here are some actionable insights: Developers on Avalanche: Explore the documentation and tools provided by Ava Labs and Filecoin Foundation to integrate decentralized storage into your dApps. This can significantly improve the cost structure and capabilities of your applications, especially those handling significant data. Filecoin Storage Providers: Increased demand for Filecoin storage from the Avalanche ecosystem could lead to more opportunities and revenue for storage providers. Users of Avalanche dApps: Expect to see more complex and data-rich applications emerge on Avalanche as developers leverage this new capability. Data associated with dApps may become more resilient and decentralized. Web3 Enthusiasts and Investors: This integration highlights the growing trend of cross-chain interoperability and the importance of specialized decentralized protocols working together. Pay attention to similar bridges and collaborations in the space. The combination of fast execution layers and robust data layers is powerful for Web3 data storage . This is a concrete example of how the Web3 space is maturing, with different networks building bridges to leverage each other’s strengths. The Future of Interoperability and Decentralized Data The connection between Avalanche and Filecoin is part of a larger movement towards a more interconnected and specialized Web3 ecosystem. No single blockchain can be the best at everything. High-performance chains excel at transaction speed, while networks like Filecoin excel at data storage, and others focus on specific use cases like privacy or identity. Cross-chain bridges are essential infrastructure enabling these specialized networks to communicate and cooperate. This particular bridge between Avalanche and Filecoin is a significant step for both ecosystems and for the overall vision of a decentralized internet where data is stored and managed in a way that aligns with core Web3 principles. Expect to see more such integrations in the future as the demand for scalable, cost-effective, and decentralized data solutions continues to grow across all layers of the Web3 stack. Conclusion: A Powerful Connection for Web3 The new cross-chain bridge linking Avalanche and Filecoin is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a strategic move that significantly enhances the capabilities of decentralized applications on Avalanche. By providing a seamless way to access Filecoin’s decentralized storage network, this integration addresses a critical need for efficient and cost-effective data management in Web3. Developers now have powerful tools to build more complex, data-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the Avalanche network and contributing to the broader vision of robust, decentralized Web3 data storage . This collaboration marks a positive step forward for interoperability and the continued evolution of the decentralized web.

The widely popular MetaMask wallet , primarily known for its deep integration with the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains, has reportedly added support for the Solana (SOL) network. This development, highlighted by Unfolded on X, marks a significant step towards greater interoperability in the blockchain space. For years, MetaMask has been the go-to Web3 wallet for millions of users navigating decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and other compatible networks. Solana, on the other hand, operates on a different technical architecture (not EVM-compatible) and has traditionally required dedicated wallets like Phantom, Solflare, or Exodus. The reported MetaMask Solana integration means users may no longer need to switch between different wallet applications or browser extensions to manage assets or interact with dApps across these two major ecosystems. This could streamline the user experience significantly and open up new possibilities for users and developers alike. Understanding the MetaMask Solana Integration It’s important to clarify the nature of this integration. Based on available information and how MetaMask typically extends its functionality to non-EVM chains, this support is facilitated through MetaMask Snaps. MetaMask Snaps are a system that allows third-party developers to build features that extend the core functionality of the MetaMask wallet. Think of Snaps as plugins for your wallet. Instead of MetaMask building native support for every single blockchain (which would be a massive undertaking), they provide a framework for the community to build these connections. In this case, a Snap specifically designed for Solana allows MetaMask to understand and interact with the Solana blockchain. This approach offers flexibility and allows MetaMask to rapidly expand its supported networks without compromising its core codebase. However, it also means users need to install a specific Solana Snap (like the one developed by the Solflare team, which has been a key player in bringing Solana to MetaMask) to enable this functionality. Why This Matters for Your Crypto Wallet Experience The addition of Solana support to MetaMask has several potential benefits, impacting how users interact with the broader decentralized landscape. Consolidated Asset Management: Users who hold assets on both Ethereum/EVM chains and Solana can now potentially view and manage them within a single interface – their familiar MetaMask wallet . Easier Access to Solana dApps: Interacting with decentralized applications on the Solana network becomes much more accessible for existing MetaMask users. They can connect their MetaMask wallet (with the Solana Snap installed) directly to Solana dApps for activities like trading, lending, borrowing, or exploring NFTs. Reduced Friction for New Users: For someone new to Solana but already using MetaMask, the barrier to entry is lowered. They don’t need to set up and learn a completely new wallet system from scratch. Enhanced Interoperability: This integration is a significant step towards a more interconnected Web3 world, where the boundaries between different blockchains become less rigid. This move positions MetaMask even more strongly as a universal Web3 wallet , capable of serving users across multiple distinct blockchain ecosystems. Benefits for Solana Wallet Users and the Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem also stands to gain considerably from this development. Increased Exposure: Millions of active MetaMask users are now potentially just a few clicks away from exploring Solana. This vastly expands the potential user base for Solana dApps and services. Inflow of Capital and Users: Easier access can lead to more users bridging assets to Solana, participating in its DeFi protocols, and engaging with its NFT market. Validation: Being integrated into the most popular crypto wallet lends further credibility and visibility to the Solana network. Developer Opportunities: Solana developers can now potentially target a wider audience, including users who primarily reside in the EVM ecosystem. This isn’t just about MetaMask adding a chain; it’s about bridging two of the largest non-EVM blockchain communities, fostering growth and interaction between them. Navigating Your Solana Wallet Experience in MetaMask While the integration is exciting, users should be aware of how it works in practice. Since it relies on Snaps, the experience might differ slightly from using a native Solana wallet. Here’s a general idea of what to expect: Installation: You will need to find and install a trusted Solana Snap from within the MetaMask interface or via the MetaMask Snaps directory. Projects like Solflare have been at the forefront of developing these Snaps. Account Management: The Snap will allow MetaMask to generate and manage Solana addresses associated with your MetaMask seed phrase or private keys. You’ll be able to see your SOL balance and SPL tokens. Transaction Signing: When you interact with a Solana dApp, the transaction request will be routed through the installed Solana Snap within MetaMask for your review and approval. Potential Differences: The user interface for Solana-specific actions within MetaMask (via the Snap) might look and feel slightly different compared to interacting with EVM chains. Features specific to certain native Solana wallets might not be immediately available or could be implemented differently via the Snap. It’s crucial to ensure you are installing a legitimate Snap from a reputable source to maintain the security of your assets. Considerations and Actionable Insights As with any new integration, there are points to consider: Security: Only install Snaps from verified and trusted developers. Snaps have access to your MetaMask environment, so verifying their legitimacy is paramount. Functionality: While the core functionality of managing assets and interacting with dApps should work, some advanced features found in dedicated Solana wallets might not be fully supported initially via the Snap. User Experience: The experience might evolve as the Snaps technology matures and developers refine their implementations. Transaction Fees: Remember that even when using MetaMask, you are still interacting with the Solana network, which requires SOL for transaction fees (gas). Actionable Steps: If you’re interested, explore the MetaMask Snaps directory to find a Solana Snap. Research the developer of the Snap to ensure they are reputable (e.g., Solflare is a well-known Solana wallet provider). Start with a small amount of SOL to test the functionality before transferring significant assets. Always double-check transaction details before confirming them in MetaMask. This integration is powerful, but responsible usage is key. The Future of Your Web3 Wallet The MetaMask Solana integration is more than just adding another chain; it represents a shift in the paradigm of crypto wallet design. As Web3 matures, the need for wallets that can seamlessly interact across multiple, distinct blockchain ecosystems becomes increasingly important. MetaMask’s move via Snaps demonstrates a scalable way to achieve this interoperability. While dedicated wallets for specific chains will likely remain popular for power users, the ability to manage assets and access dApps from different networks within a single, familiar interface like MetaMask significantly lowers the barrier for the average user and promotes a more connected decentralized world. Conclusion: A Unified Crypto Wallet Experience? The news of MetaMask enabling Solana support via Snaps is genuinely exciting. It brings together two massive blockchain communities and offers users the potential for a more streamlined and unified Web3 wallet experience. While it’s crucial to use trusted Snaps and understand the technical nuances, this development is a clear indicator of the industry’s movement towards greater interoperability and user convenience. It solidifies MetaMask’s position as a leading crypto wallet and opens up the vibrant Solana ecosystem to a broader audience.

At the ongoing Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Sun expressed his admiration for President Donald Trump’s outspoken dedication to digital assets and blockchain. Sun said during a panel discussion that the game has certainly changed for digital assets in the US thanks to the influence of President Donald Trump. The conference, which is held in Las Vegas, has drawn major players in the crypto industry to the city, including lawmakers, entrepreneurs, and developers. Sun’s remarks were noteworthy in that he linked recent Bitcoin price spikes to policies backed by Trump and to expressions of public support. While speaking on a panel, Justin Sun claimed that Bitcoin would have never reached an all-new high of $100,000 without Trump. Bitcoin reached $100,000 in December 2024, a month after Trump’s election victory. The rally has continued, and the coin was trading recently above $109,000. Sun also mentioned being at a high-profile “crypto dinner” hosted by Trump a couple of days ago. He is the top holder of the TRUMP meme coin. In addition to his shares, Sun has also pumped $75 million into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an entity allegedly very close to Trump’s digital asset plans. Trump buys Bitcoin as US creates satellites to store BTC in space In March 2025, President Trump passed an executive order for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , a move solely intended to hedge Bitcoin as part of the US treasury. The reserve is financed directly by Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil investigations — not taxpayer funds. The hope is to treat Bitcoin like gold, a strategic store of value that the government holds long-term. Trump’s directive also established a new US Digital Asset Stockpile to oversee other cryptocurrencies. An executive order was also to review the government’s digital asset holdings. And though Senator Cynthia Lummis reported that the government owns something like 200,000 BTC, the entire report has yet to be released after a security review by the White House. The crypto-friendly wave on Capitol Hill keeps rolling. According to long-time Bitcoin advocate Senator Cynthia Lummis, the US Senate will consider the BITCOIN Act next week. The bill is intended to codify the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and permit the federal government to purchase as many as 1 million BTC over five years. The bill encourages broader acceptance of Bitcoin throughout federal infrastructure and payment systems. This aligns with Trump’s general crypto stance: to relax crypto laws, court blockchain investment, and protect minors’ rights. Lummis said it wasn’t just about Bitcoin and advancing America’s financial independence. The Senate is also considering a Stablecoin Bill , a legislation that would be the country’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Some analysts say such common-sense leadership has the potential to bring long-awaited legal clarity and financial confidence to US crypto markets through the BITCOIN Act and the Stablecoin Bill. The US Senate seems to be getting close to passing its landmark stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act — a battle its champion Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said has been incredibly hard-fought. “It has been extremely difficult,” Lummis said during a fireside chat with Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “I had no idea how hard this was going to be.” Trump drives US Bitcoin strategy forward With Trump’s support and Congress already legislating, the US is quickly becoming the No. 1 place in the world for cryptocurrency innovation. Classic Chinese crypto players like Justin Sun are toasting the move — and doubling down on US crypto investments. The market likes what it sees. Bitcoin is in the $109,000 range today, and Ethereum is rising. Big exchanges and mining operations are moving on American turf, citing stable policy and rising institutional interest. One thing is apparent as the world looks on: under President Trump, Bitcoin will no longer be just a form of digital money — it will be the national strategy.

As the Bitcoin market experienced fluctuations, one notable figure faced significant financial setbacks, drawing attention from the crypto community. Who is James Wynn and What Happened to His Bitcoin Trading Position? James Wynn is recognized in the crypto space as a significant trader, often referred to as a “whale” due to the large size of his positions. Whales can significantly influence market dynamics, and their trading activity is closely watched by other participants. Recently, Wynn’s movements on the Hyperliquid platform became a focal point after he reportedly adjusted a substantial Bitcoin trading position. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, James Wynn reduced his highly leveraged 40x Bitcoin long position. This action occurred as the price of BTC dropped below the $108,300 mark. Reducing a leveraged position, especially a long one during a price decline, typically involves closing part of the position at a loss to mitigate further downside risk or avoid liquidation. The Impact on Hyperliquid: A Closer Look The trade in question took place on Hyperliquid , a decentralized perpetual exchange known for offering high leverage options to traders. Platforms like Hyperliquid enable users to trade derivatives contracts that track the price of underlying assets like Bitcoin, allowing them to speculate on price movements without owning the actual asset. The appeal of Hyperliquid lies in its high leverage, which can amplify potential profits but equally magnify losses. James Wynn’s large position on Hyperliquid highlights the significant capital deployed by major traders on such platforms. While these platforms offer accessibility and high leverage, they also concentrate risk, making large trades and their outcomes particularly noteworthy for market observers. Understanding the Risks of 40x Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading is a powerful tool that allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. Leverage is expressed as a ratio, such as 40:1 or simply 40x. In James Wynn’s case, 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital used as margin, he was controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of why 40x leverage is considered extremely high-risk: Amplified Gains and Losses: A small percentage move in the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is multiplied by the leverage factor. If Bitcoin moves up by just 1%, a 40x leveraged long position gains 40%. Conversely, if Bitcoin moves down by just 1%, the position loses 40%. Liquidation Risk: With 40x leverage, a price drop of only about 2.5% against the position’s direction can potentially wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to automatic liquidation by the platform to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. Sensitivity to Volatility: Highly leveraged positions are extremely sensitive to even minor market fluctuations. In a volatile market like crypto, maintaining such a position requires constant monitoring and significant risk management. James Wynn’s decision to reduce his position as Bitcoin fell below $108,300 was likely a strategic move to avoid a complete liquidation, albeit at a substantial cost. How Crypto Whale Activity Impacts the Market The actions of a Crypto whale like James Wynn can have ripple effects. While a single whale’s trade might not single-handedly crash the market, their large positions and movements are closely watched indicators. Points to consider about whale activity: Market Sentiment: When a known whale takes a large position or, as in this case, significantly reduces one at a loss, it can influence market sentiment. Other traders might interpret this as a signal about the whale’s outlook on the market direction. Liquidity: Large trades, whether opening, closing, or reducing, require significant liquidity on the exchange. On decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, these large orders can sometimes impact the order book and potentially influence short-term price action, though the platform is designed to handle large volumes. Transparency (on-chain): Thanks to on-chain analytics tools like Lookonchain, the movements of large wallets and known trading entities can be tracked, providing insights into potential market trends or risks. The Cost of High Stakes: $14.3M in Daily Losses The immediate consequence of James Wynn’s position reduction was a significant loss. According to Lookonchain, trimming his 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position resulted in an additional loss of approximately $4.75 million. This specific loss was incurred on the portion of the position that was closed. However, the total losses attributed to James Wynn from position reductions on that particular day were even higher, reaching approximately $14.3 million. This indicates that the reduction reported by Lookonchain might have been one of several adjustments made to his leveraged positions throughout the day as the market moved against him. These figures serve as a stark reminder of the potential financial downside in high-leverage trading. A $14.3 million loss in a single day is a substantial amount, even for a well-capitalized trader or entity. Actionable Insights for Traders While most retail traders do not operate with the capital or leverage levels of a Crypto whale like James Wynn, there are valuable lessons to be learned from this event: Understand Leverage: Before using leverage, fully grasp how it works and the risks involved. Higher leverage drastically increases liquidation risk. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use risk management tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Do not over-leverage. Market Volatility: Recognize that the crypto market is highly volatile. Prices can move sharply and quickly, making highly leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Whale Watching, Not Copying: While observing whale activity can be informative, blindly copying their trades is risky. Whales operate with different capital, strategies, and risk tolerance than retail traders. Choose Platforms Wisely: Understand the mechanics and risks associated with specific platforms like Hyperliquid, especially concerning their liquidation mechanisms and fees. James Wynn’s significant loss is a powerful example of the double-edged sword of high leverage. It highlights that even experienced traders with substantial capital are not immune to the risks inherent in volatile markets and aggressive trading strategies. Summary: A Cautionary Tale from the High-Leverage Arena The news of James Wynn facing a staggering $14.3 million in daily losses from reducing his 40x leveraged Bitcoin trading positions on Hyperliquid serves as a potent reminder of the potential pitfalls in the high-stakes world of crypto. This event underscores the extreme risks associated with high Leveraged trading , where even a slight unfavorable price movement can lead to massive losses or liquidation. As the market continues its volatile dance, the activities of a Crypto whale like Wynn offer valuable insights, not just into potential market shifts but, more importantly, into the critical need for robust risk management and a thorough understanding of the tools and platforms used. For both large and small traders, the principle remains the same: understand the risks before diving into the deep end of leveraged trading.

The major cryptocurrency exchange announced via their official X account that they plan to halt trading for four specific altcoins. This kind of event, a Coinbase trading suspension , is significant for the crypto market and requires immediate attention from affected users. What is This Coinbase Trading Suspension All About? On [Insert Date of Announcement – e.g., June 19th], Coinbase made a public announcement stating its intention to suspend trading for Helium Mobile (MOBILE), Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse (SYN). The specific date and time for this action are set for June 26 at 2 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) . This isn’t just a temporary pause; a suspension often precedes or is a form of delisting, meaning these assets will no longer be tradable on the Coinbase platform after the deadline. For traders and investors, a crypto trading suspension on a platform as large as Coinbase can have several immediate and long-term effects. It typically signals reduced liquidity for the affected assets on that specific exchange and can often lead to price volatility as holders react to the news. Understanding the implications is crucial for managing your digital assets effectively. Which Tokens Are Affected by the Crypto Trading Suspension? The announcement specifically names four tokens. Let’s take a quick look at each one: Helium Mobile (MOBILE): Part of the Helium network, focusing on decentralized wireless networks. Render (RNDR): A distributed GPU rendering network. It’s a prominent project in the decentralized rendering space. Ribbon Finance (RBN): A protocol focused on decentralized options and structured products. Synapse (SYN): A cross-chain bridge and decentralized exchange protocol. If you hold any of these specific assets – MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN – on your Coinbase account, this announcement directly affects you. It’s not just about trading; you need to consider what happens to your holdings after the suspension deadline. Understanding Coinbase Delisting Crypto Policies Why do exchanges like Coinbase decide to suspend or delist assets? While Coinbase’s specific reasons for these four tokens weren’t detailed in the initial announcement, delisting decisions are typically based on a variety of factors. These can include: The project no longer meeting listing standards (e.g., related to trading volume, liquidity). Regulatory concerns surrounding the asset. Changes in the project’s fundamentals or network performance. Security issues. Lack of community engagement or development activity. For users, understanding that exchanges periodically review their listed assets is part of navigating the crypto landscape. While a Coinbase delisting crypto asset isn’t uncommon in the broader market, it always warrants attention due to Coinbase’s significant user base and market influence. Crucial Actions for MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN Holders If you hold any of the affected tokens on Coinbase, you have a limited time to take action before the trading suspension on June 26 at 2 p.m. ET. Ignoring this deadline could leave your assets inaccessible for trading on the platform. Here are your primary options and the actionable insights you need: Token Action Required Before June 26, 2 p.m. ET Helium Mobile (MOBILE) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Render (RNDR) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Ribbon Finance (RBN) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Synapse (SYN) Sell or withdraw from Coinbase Option 1: Sell Your Holdings. You can choose to sell your MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, or SYN tokens on Coinbase before the deadline. This converts your holdings into another cryptocurrency or fiat currency available on the platform. Option 2: Withdraw Your Holdings. Alternatively, you can withdraw your tokens from your Coinbase account to an external wallet or another exchange that supports trading of these assets. Make sure the destination wallet or exchange is compatible with the specific token’s network. What Happens After the Deadline? After June 26 at 2 p.m. ET, you will likely lose the ability to trade these tokens on Coinbase. While withdrawal might still be possible for a period, it’s best practice to handle this well before the suspension date to avoid any potential issues or delays. Staying Informed with Crypto Exchange News This event highlights the importance of staying updated with crypto exchange news . Announcements like trading suspensions or delistings are critical pieces of information that can directly impact your investment strategy and the accessibility of your funds. Follow official exchange channels, reputable news sources, and set up alerts for assets you hold. Being proactive is key in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Don’t wait until the last minute if you hold any of the affected MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, SYN tokens on Coinbase. Plan your action now to ensure you retain control over your assets. Conclusion: Act Before the Deadline Coinbase’s upcoming trading suspension for MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, and SYN is a critical event for holders of these specific tokens. The deadline of June 26 at 2 p.m. ET is fast approaching. Whether you decide to sell your holdings or withdraw them to another platform or wallet, taking timely action is paramount to avoid potential complications.

However, one rising star is catching the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi-focused altcoin under $1 that analysts believe could outperform legacy tokens in the year ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a total of $9.3 million from over 11,500 purchasers of its tokens. The official presale structure has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, which is a 16.67% increase. Already having achieved a 200% profit from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). With utility, innovation, and hype aligning, these four cryptocurrencies could define the next era of blockchain growth. Crypto Giants Set to Lead 2025 Rally: DOGE, ADA, and ETH Price Outlook Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture investor interest with its strong community support and increasing real-world use cases, currently trading around $0.22. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) is priced close to $0.75 and is moving forward as parts of its DeFi ecosystem grow which could result in a move toward $1 in value. Ethereum’s (ETH) price stands at just above $2,500 due to strong interest, as its updated structure promises to make transactions perform much faster and at greater profit, translating into significant price increases. Although the established altcoins guide the market, newcomers like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are catching the eye for their ability to disrupt it. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is introducing a USD-pegged stablecoin, secured via the Ethereum network and running on it. Because its extra collateral protects prices, it is able to avoid the collapse problems algorithmic tokens encounter. For security, the Edge relies on open-source smart contracts confirmed safe and complete by Certik, making it trusted by a wide range of users and large organizations. Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and the rapidly rising Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are poised to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. MUTM’s impressive presale success, raising $9.3 million from over 11,500 investors, and current Phase 5 pricing at $0.03, with an anticipated 16.67% increase to $0.035 next phase, sets the stage for at least 100% ROI at its official $0.06 launch price. Backed by a unique buy-and-distribute model and a fully collateralized stablecoin audited by Certik, MUTM combines innovation, security, and community trust. Early investors have a prime opportunity to capitalize on this breakout altcoin alongside established giants. Take action now and secure your position in Mutuum Finance, don’t miss out on the potential gains in 2025.

At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is already making big moves, spiking on massive trades and growing technical support. These shifts highlight how community engagement is influencing performance. A clear example is BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its 25% referral reward structure is turning everyday buyers into promoters. With an easy system, instant BDAG rewards, and low entry costs, BlockDAG is scaling fast. The project has already raised over $272 million. Chainlink: Resistance Test at $21.99 Holds Traders’ Focus Chainlink (LINK) price movement is pressing against a strong resistance trendline. Trading around $15.39, the coin is testing patience, with many pointing to $21.99 as the next target if it breaks past the downtrend from December 2024. A breakout here could change LINK’s short-term direction and trigger further gains. However, volume levels remain mixed and momentum appears shaky. The $21.99 mark remains the key number for now, with many traders waiting for a confirmed move above. Hyperliquid: Whale Moves and Technicals Push Toward $43.17 Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped over 11% in just one day, touching $39.93. The surge followed public trading wins, including James Wynn’s $25 million BTC play. Market watchers also spotted $28 million in whale buys near $35. Technicals suggest more upside. HYPE is testing the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $43.17. RSI is at a hot 85.72, and MACD is also flashing bullish, meaning the move could continue if momentum sticks. BlockDAG: $272M Raised as Referrals Ignite Viral Growth BlockDAG’s referral system is built for simplicity and speed. When someone refers a friend, they receive 25% of their purchase value in BDAG. The person joining also earns an extra 5%, making it rewarding on both ends. With an entry point as low as $15, the system encourages fast sharing and onboarding. Already, more than 170,000 holders have joined the BDAG ecosystem, reflecting just how quickly this model is scaling. The numbers behind BlockDAG back the hype. It has raised over $272 million and sold more than 21.3 billion coins so far. The price, which began at $0.001, has jumped to $0.0262, showing a 2,520% gain from batch one. Until June 13, BDAG is available for a limited time at a frozen price of $0.0020, offering a possible 2,400% upside before it reaches its official launch price of $0.05. What’s building excitement is the confirmed GO LIVE reveal set for June 13. BlockDAG will announce listings on 20 centralized exchanges, a move that could boost visibility and drive larger participation. With a solid referral program, accessible pricing, and upcoming major milestones, BlockDAG appears well-positioned among the top crypto players to watch in 2025. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) remains in limbo as it presses against major resistance. Hyperliquid (HYPE), meanwhile, is proving that volume and excitement can shift charts quickly. But the standout right now is BlockDAG. Its $272 million raise and viral referral system are changing how new projects grow.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just taken a significant step regarding a proposed XRP ETF , moving it into a deeper stage of scrutiny. This action by the SEC review process is closely watched by investors and the wider crypto community, signaling potential future avenues for mainstream adoption of XRP. What Does the Latest SEC Review Mean for the WisdomTree XRP ETF? The recent announcement confirms that the SEC has concluded the initial public comment period for the proposed WisdomTree XRP spot ETF. This phase allows the public, market participants, and interested parties to submit their views and concerns regarding the application. The SEC considers these comments as part of its decision-making process. With the comment period now closed, the application has officially moved into the ‘further review’ stage. This is a standard, yet critical, part of the regulatory journey for any potential financial product like a spot ETF . It means the SEC staff will now delve deeper into the specifics of the proposal, analyzing its structure, potential market impact, and compliance with existing securities laws. For those following cryptocurrency investment trends, this represents tangible progress. Key Milestones in the WisdomTree XRP ETF Journey: Application Accepted: The formal process began when the application was officially accepted by the SEC on February 19, 2025. This acceptance marked the start of the regulatory clock. Public Comment Period Ends: This recent step signifies the end of collecting external feedback. Initiation of Further Review: The application is now under active, detailed examination by SEC staff. Decision Deadline: A final decision on approval or rejection is anticipated by the end of October 2025. This falls within the SEC’s standard 240-day review window for such applications, though extensions are sometimes possible. Why is a Spot ETF Important for Cryptocurrency Investment Like XRP? A spot ETF , or Exchange Traded Fund, holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, XRP. This differs from futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts related to the asset. For investors, a spot ETF offers several potential advantages: Accessibility: It allows investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, and dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for mainstream and institutional investors. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. Regulation & Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investors a layer of protection and oversight that might not be present when buying XRP directly on some less-regulated platforms. Simplified Taxation: Managing tax implications can be simpler with ETF shares compared to tracking individual crypto transactions. For XRP specifically, the approval of a spot ETF by a reputable firm like WisdomTree could be transformative. It would signal a significant step towards regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance, potentially attracting substantial new capital into the XRP ecosystem. The outcome of this SEC review is therefore of immense interest to anyone involved in cryptocurrency investment . Understanding the SEC Review Process and Timeline The SEC follows a multi-stage process when reviewing proposed ETFs, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies. The 240-day window mentioned in the update is the maximum time the SEC typically takes after an application is published in the Federal Register. Here’s a simplified look at the typical path: Initial Filing: The issuer (like WisdomTree) submits a proposal (Form 19b-4). Publication & Comment Period: The proposal is published, opening a public comment window (usually 21-45 days). Initial Review & Potential Delay: The SEC has an initial period (typically 45 days) to approve, disapprove, or delay the decision. Delays are common for complex applications. Further Review & Additional Delays: The SEC can extend the review period multiple times, up to the maximum 240 days from the Federal Register publication. This ‘further review’ stage is where the WisdomTree application currently sits following the close of comments. Final Decision: Within the 240-day limit (or earlier), the SEC must issue a final order approving or disapproving the rule change that would allow the ETF to list and trade. The fact that the WisdomTree application has progressed past the comment phase and is now under detailed SEC review keeps it firmly on this timeline towards a potential decision by October 2025. This structured process provides a degree of predictability, albeit with the ever-present possibility of regulatory hurdles. Why WisdomTree is Pursuing an XRP ETF WisdomTree is a well-established asset management firm with a history of innovation in the ETF space. They have already launched cryptocurrency-related products in other jurisdictions and have shown a keen interest in bringing digital asset exposure to their clients through regulated vehicles in the U.S. Their pursuit of an XRP ETF indicates their belief in the potential demand for XRP exposure among investors and their confidence that a compliant product can be structured. WisdomTree’s reputation adds weight to the application and highlights the growing institutional interest in offering diverse cryptocurrency investment options beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to an XRP Spot ETF While the progression to the ‘further review’ stage is positive, significant challenges remain for the WisdomTree XRP ETF . The most prominent challenge is XRP’s unique regulatory history in the U.S., specifically the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple (the company associated with XRP) alleging that XRP is an unregistered security. Although there have been significant legal developments in that case, including court rulings clarifying aspects of XRP’s status, the overall regulatory cloud has not fully dissipated. The SEC’s final decision will heavily weigh whether they believe a spot ETF for XRP can be structured in a way that protects investors and is resistant to market manipulation, especially given the historical regulatory questions surrounding the asset. The outcome of the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple could also indirectly influence the SEC’s stance. However, the opportunity is substantial. An approved XRP ETF could unlock significant institutional and retail capital, providing a regulated gateway to cryptocurrency investment in XRP. It could enhance liquidity and potentially impact XRP’s price positively, similar to the effect seen with Bitcoin and, more recently, Ethereum spot ETFs (pending their own final approvals). Potential Impacts of an Approved XRP ETF: Increased institutional participation in XRP. Improved liquidity and price discovery on regulated markets. Enhanced legitimacy for XRP as an investable asset class. Wider adoption of XRP among traditional investors. The SEC review is the key hurdle that determines if these opportunities can be realized. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Watchers For those interested in XRP or broader cryptocurrency investment , the progression of the WisdomTree XRP ETF application is a development worth tracking closely. Here are some insights: Stay Informed: Follow official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources for updates on the review process and the upcoming decision deadline in October 2025. Understand the Risks: An ETF application moving to further review does not guarantee approval. Regulatory approval is never certain, especially in the evolving crypto space. Evaluate the Asset Itself: While an ETF provides easy access, it’s crucial to understand the underlying asset, XRP, its use cases, technology, and regulatory landscape independently of the ETF wrapper. Consider Your Strategy: Think about how an XRP ETF, if approved, might fit into your overall investment strategy. It could offer a new way to gain exposure compared to direct ownership. The outcome of this specific SEC review for the WisdomTree XRP ETF could set a precedent for future single-asset crypto ETF applications beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it a landmark decision for the entire cryptocurrency investment landscape. Conclusion: Waiting on the SEC’s Final Word The U.S. SEC’s decision to move the WisdomTree XRP ETF application into the further review stage is a procedural but meaningful step forward. It confirms the application is under active consideration and remains on track for a potential decision by the end of October 2025. While challenges related to XRP’s regulatory status persist, the progression of this spot ETF application highlights the growing institutional interest in bringing diverse cryptocurrency investment products to market. The crypto community and traditional finance world alike will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the SEC review . An approval could unlock significant capital and mainstream adoption for XRP, while a rejection would underscore the ongoing regulatory hurdles facing certain digital assets in the U.S. Until the final decision arrives, the journey of the WisdomTree XRP ETF continues to be a key narrative in the evolving story of crypto regulation and investment.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Don Jr. said he wasn’t an early adopter of bitcoin or crypto, only finding his way to blockchain technology after realizing the “fragile” nature of the traditional financial system. “We were real estate guys, we were hard assets, we built buildings — [bitcoin] was a bit nebulous,” he said during a fireside chat with Rumble CEO and founder Chris Pavlovski. “But once we got into that political sector…we were getting de-banked, we were getting de-insured, we were getting de-everything. It was brutal.” Don Jr. said he and Eric “definitely” had a hand in helping their father, who called bitcoin a scam in 2021, understand the potential of crypto and blockchain technology. “We were the ones who were getting subpoenaed in nonsense lawsuits, we were the ones who are dealing with getting de-banked … we’re the guys who probably saw that first-hand,” he said of him and his brother. “We probably, maybe got there a little bit before him. Once we started explaining the potential, he’s a quick study … he got there pretty quickly.” Once Trump embraced crypto on the campaign trail, Don Jr. said he got a laugh out of other candidates, including Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon. “I would pay money, a lot of money, maybe my entire crypto wallet, to have Kamala Harris explain blockchain technology,” Don Jr. said. “That would be the greatest word salad in the history of Kamala Harris word salad.” Don Jr. added that his father “cares about doing what’s right for America,” saying the democratization of finance “is a fundamental tenant after, like, world peace, of what he wants to accomplish in this administration.” The Trump family’s crypto ventures, including the TRUMP memecoin and World Liberty Financial, have been heavily criticized in both the industry and the government for being opaque and allegedly presenting conflicts of interest. However, since Trump took office, there has been a renewed push for new regulations and the passage of crypto legislation, as well as the apparent end to the so-called regulation-by-enforcement practiced by regulators during former President Joe Biden’s administration. With stablecoin legislation seemingly around the corner, potentially followed by a comprehensive market structure bill and strategic bitcoin reserve legislation, Don Jr. said the improved regulatory clarity for the industry will be a boon for bitcoin. “I think you have the perfect storm for this thing just going to the moon, as they say,” he said.",Policy|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-28 01:08:06

This acquisition comes as the company prepares for a notable merger, positioning itself firmly within the evolving landscape where traditional industries intersect with the world of cryptocurrency. What’s Behind KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Strategy? KindlyMD, primarily known for its work in the healthcare and data sectors, has signaled a clear strategic shift by adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. This isn’t a sudden decision, but rather a planned initiative. The company had previously announced its intention to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund, indicating a long-term view on the cryptocurrency as part of its financial architecture. Why would a healthcare and data company venture into the volatile world of Bitcoin? Several factors likely play a role: Store of Value: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, KindlyMD may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, seeking a non-sovereign store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify the company’s treasury assets beyond traditional cash and equivalents. Alignment with Future Plans: As we’ll discuss, this move is intrinsically linked to KindlyMD’s upcoming merger, suggesting Bitcoin will play a central role in the combined entity’s operations or strategy. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing technological and financial world. This strategic pivot underscores a growing confidence among diverse companies regarding Bitcoin’s role not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Traction KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend. Over the past few years, Corporate Bitcoin Adoption has moved from a fringe idea to a notable financial strategy for businesses across various sectors. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) were early pioneers, holding substantial amounts of BTC on their balance sheets. The motivations often cited by these companies include: Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against potential inflation driven by quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins) and decentralized nature drawing comparisons to gold. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Attracting Talent and Investors: Aligning with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies can appeal to a certain demographic of employees and investors. While the trend faces challenges like price volatility and regulatory uncertainty, the increasing number of companies, now including a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder like KindlyMD, exploring or adopting this strategy suggests it’s becoming a more mainstream consideration for treasury management. Understanding the KindlyMD Nakamoto Merger The timing of KindlyMD’s Bitcoin purchase is particularly interesting when viewed alongside its planned merger with Nakamoto. Nakamoto is described as a Bitcoin investment firm. This planned union suggests a powerful synergy: KindlyMD’s expertise in healthcare and data combined with Nakamoto’s specialization in Bitcoin and potentially other digital asset investments. The Nakamoto Merger is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of this year. While specific details about the post-merger entity’s structure and strategic focus are anticipated, the pre-merger Bitcoin acquisition by KindlyMD strongly implies that digital assets, and specifically Bitcoin, will be a core component of the combined company’s strategy. This could involve: Managing a larger, combined Bitcoin treasury. Developing services or products that leverage both healthcare data and blockchain/Bitcoin technology. Offering Bitcoin-related investment or treasury management services to other companies. The merger represents a fascinating convergence of a traditional data-rich industry (healthcare) with the cutting-edge world of digital asset investment, potentially paving the way for new business models and applications. Details of the Recent BTC Purchase According to reports, KindlyMD’s recent acquisition involved the purchase of 21 Bitcoin. The average price paid per Bitcoin was reported to be $109,027. This BTC Purchase price is notably above Bitcoin’s historical trading range, reflecting the specific market conditions at the time of the acquisition. It’s important to understand what this means: Specific Timing: The purchase occurred at a point where Bitcoin’s price was trading significantly higher than its average over its lifetime. This could be influenced by market sentiment, institutional demand, or other factors specific to the purchase date. Average Price: The figure $109,027 represents the average cost across the 21 BTC acquired. This implies the purchase might have occurred over a short period, potentially in chunks, as KindlyMD executed its strategy. Size of Purchase: While 21 BTC might seem like a specific number, its value is substantial at that average price point (over $2.2 million). This indicates a serious commitment to their announced Bitcoin reserve strategy. This purchase solidifies KindlyMD’s balance sheet commitment to Bitcoin ahead of the anticipated merger, signaling confidence in the asset’s future value and its role within the combined company’s strategy. Implications for Healthcare Company Bitcoin Holders and Beyond The fact that a Healthcare Company Bitcoin is now on the list of corporate holders adds another layer to the narrative of mainstream adoption. While the primary business of KindlyMD is healthcare and data, this financial decision could have broader implications: Setting a Precedent: Could this encourage other companies in the healthcare or data-heavy sectors to explore similar treasury strategies? Integration Potential: The merger with Nakamoto hints at potential integrations of Bitcoin or blockchain technology within healthcare data management, security, or patient incentives, although details remain to be seen. Increased Institutional Interest: Every new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to the overall narrative of institutional acceptance, potentially attracting further investment and stability to the market. For readers interested in this trend, it highlights the importance of watching company financial reports and announcements for insights into how diverse industries are beginning to interact with digital assets. It also underscores the need to understand the risks associated with holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Summary: A Strategic Move for KindlyMD KindlyMD’s purchase of 21 Bitcoin at an average price of $109,027 is a significant development, reinforcing the trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . This move is strategically timed ahead of its planned Nakamoto Merger in Q3 2024. By establishing a KindlyMD Bitcoin reserve fund and executing this specific BTC Purchase , the company signals its commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy, potentially setting a precedent for other firms, including those classified as a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder. The merger with a Bitcoin investment firm like Nakamoto further solidifies this direction, promising an interesting future at the intersection of healthcare data and digital finance.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, a strong online presence is often built on robust web platforms. This makes the latest news from WordPress particularly relevant: a dedicated WordPress AI team has been formed to steer the integration of AI into the world’s most popular content management system. The Formation of the WordPress AI Team WordPress, the engine powering over 40% of the web, announced on Tuesday, June 4th, 2024, the official formation of a specialized team focused on artificial intelligence. This move signals a strategic commitment to embedding AI capabilities thoughtfully and effectively within the platform and its vast ecosystem. The newly established team brings together experienced individuals from key players in the web and AI space. Notable members include: James LePage: Leader of AI at Automattic, the parent company behind WordPress.com and a major contributor to the open-source WordPress project. Felix Arntz and Pascal Birchler: Both bringing expertise from Google, a company at the forefront of AI research and development. Jeff Paul: Director of Open Source at 10up, a prominent web design and development firm deeply involved in the WordPress community. This composition of the WordPress AI team , drawing talent from Automattic, Google, and a leading agency, highlights a multi-faceted approach to AI integration, combining platform insights, cutting-edge AI knowledge, and practical development experience. The Landscape: Abundant AI Plugins WordPress Already Exist Even before the formal team was announced, the open-source nature of WordPress meant that developers were already experimenting heavily with AI. The platform’s extensive plugin directory is a testament to this innovation. Currently, there are over 660 different AI plugins WordPress developers have created and published. These plugins cover a wide range of functionalities, demonstrating the community’s eagerness to leverage AI for various web development tasks. Some of the most popular types of AI-powered plugins include: AI-Powered Template Builders: Tools that use AI to assist in designing website layouts and structures, potentially simplifying the initial setup process. AI SEO Optimization Tools: Plugins that analyze content and provide suggestions for improving search engine rankings, keyword usage, and meta descriptions. Chatbots: AI-driven conversational interfaces that can be added to websites to interact with visitors, answer questions, and provide support. Content Generation Assistants: Tools that help users write blog posts, product descriptions, or other website copy using AI. Image Generation and Editing: Plugins that integrate AI services to create or modify images for website use. The existence of this large number of AI plugins WordPress highlights the clear demand and potential for AI within the ecosystem, but also the need for guidance and standards. Guiding the Future of WordPress AI Development The creation of a formalized team signals that WordPress wants to take a more active, organized role in shaping how AI is integrated. Rather than letting AI development proceed in a fragmented manner solely through individual plugin efforts, WordPress aims to provide direction and ensure consistency. Mary Hubbard, WordPress Executive Director, emphasized this point in a blog post, stating, “A unified team stewards AI development thoughtfully, avoids fragmentation, and ensures alignment with the long-term goals of WordPress.” This proactive approach to WordPress AI development is crucial for maintaining the platform’s stability, security, and user experience as AI capabilities become more deeply embedded. The team will likely focus on identifying core AI functionalities that could benefit the platform itself, setting standards for how AI should be implemented in plugins, and potentially developing official AI-powered features or APIs for developers to build upon. Practical Examples of WordPress AI Tools in Action Looking at the existing landscape of WordPress AI tools provides a glimpse into the practical applications users are already benefiting from. For instance, an AI SEO plugin can analyze your blog post in real-time and suggest improvements to make it more search-engine friendly, saving time and effort compared to manual optimization. Similarly, an AI template builder might allow a user to describe the type of website they want, and the AI could generate initial design concepts or even complete page layouts, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for creating a professional-looking site. These examples show how WordPress AI tools are moving beyond simple tasks to potentially transform workflows for content creators, marketers, and small business owners using the platform. What This Means for AI in Web Development WordPress’s decision to form a dedicated AI team is a significant indicator of the growing importance of AI in web development as a whole. As the most widely used CMS, WordPress’s approach to AI integration will likely influence standards and expectations across the industry. The trend points towards a future where AI is not just an optional add-on but a fundamental part of the web development process, assisting with design, content creation, optimization, and user interaction. This could lead to more efficient workflows, more personalized user experiences, and potentially new types of websites and web applications that weren’t feasible before. The focus on stewarding this development also suggests a recognition of the challenges involved, such as ensuring AI is used ethically, maintaining data privacy, and managing the complexity that AI can introduce. WordPress taking a lead role in navigating these issues is vital for the responsible growth of AI in web development . Actionable Insights for Users and Developers For users of WordPress, the formation of the WordPress AI team is good news. It suggests that future AI features and plugins might be more reliable, better integrated, and aligned with the platform’s overall direction. When exploring AI plugins, look for those that show active development and clear benefits, and keep an eye on official announcements from the WordPress team regarding recommended practices or tools. For developers, this is an opportunity to engage with the core WordPress project on AI initiatives. Understanding the direction the new team is taking will be crucial for building future-proof and well-integrated AI plugins WordPress users will trust. Contributing to the open-source efforts related to AI development within WordPress can also provide valuable experience and visibility. Conclusion: A Powerful Step Forward The formation of the WordPress AI team marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the broader web development landscape. By bringing together expertise and dedicating resources to guide AI integration, WordPress is positioning itself to harness the transformative potential of AI in a structured and deliberate manner. This move promises to deliver more powerful, intuitive, and efficient tools for the millions who rely on WordPress to build and manage their online presence, paving the way for a new era in web creation powered by artificial intelligence.

Famous for a cautious, calculated style honed over decades in traditional finance, Mandell’s new position reflects a deeper contrast in how old-school investors look at digital assets. Mandell shared a screenshot on X showing his large position of 35,000 BITB shares, bought at an average price of $59.98. At press time, BITB had ticked up to $60.02, netting him a small but notable gain of $1,491.80. His post on X read, “I’ve made some bad choices when deciding how to invest in Bitcoin, but today I’m a Bitwiser.” Mandell and other Wall Street vets invest in Bitcoin Mandell’s move into Bitcoin is no small sign. He has managed billions of dollars at several leading hedge funds , including Caxton Associates, where he was Director and Head of Fixed Income Trading. Mandell, who boasts more than two decades of experience in navigating the turbulence of the markets, isn’t one to chase trends or make public investment declarations lightly. His public support for a financial instrument tied to Bitcoin is also a striking reversal. Not long ago, many in his circles considered crypto assets too dangerous or unregulated for serious portfolios. That reality seems to be changing — driven partly by more familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Mandell’s involvement indicates the increasing acceptance of BTC as a legitimate store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risk. It’s a subtle but strong vote favoring Bitcoin’s role in the financial mainstream. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, created to ideally cater to those who want exposure to crypto markets without dealing with digital wallets and private keys, has quickly become a favorite product. Unlike traditional investments in crypto, ETFs such as BITB trade on well-known stock exchanges, and their transactions are governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This regulatory clarity appeals to cautious investors. Since launching earlier this year, BITB has been one of the most traded Bitcoin ETFs, with over $4B in assets under management at the end of May. Bitwise ETF attracts investors as demand surges Beyond offering regulated crypto exposure, Bitwise has pledged some ETF proceeds to support open-source Bitcoin development . It has also bolstered the company’s credibility among the crypto-native crowd and drew in ESG-conscious institutional investors. Mandell’s entry into the ETF may sound like another portfolio update. But for many observers, it’s far bigger than that — validating BTC as an asset class worthy of consideration in institutional portfolios. Crypto and legacy finance are converging at warp speed. As regulatory uncertainty declines and Bitcoin becomes more accessible with financial instruments like ETFs, it’s no longer just a digital punchline passed around in tech-savvy circles. Instead, it’s becoming a core part of global investment strategies. Now, retail investors have another clear example of a respected Wall Street figure who is entering the crypto space disciplined and transparently. For many, Mandell’s move signals that Bitcoin has secured its place—not just as a speculative gamble but as a legitimate part of long-term asset allocation.

Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-backs-bitcoin-act/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Historic Shift? Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances Big news is stirring in the world of cryptocurrency and US politics! According to reports originating from Walter Bloomberg on X, Senator Cynthia Lummis made a significant announcement at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference. She stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump supports the proposed Bitcoin Act . This revelation comes as a separate, equally intriguing development unfolds: a bill proposing the U.S. government purchase a staggering 1 million BTC is reportedly heading to the Senate floor next week. These intertwined events signal a potentially pivotal moment for Bitcoin and its place within the United States’ financial and strategic landscape. Understanding the Potential Impact of Donald Trump’s Stance on Bitcoin The statement from Senator Lummis regarding Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act is particularly noteworthy given his past cautious, and at times critical, comments on cryptocurrencies. While he has previously expressed skepticism about cryptos competing with the dollar, his alleged support for specific Bitcoin legislation suggests an evolving perspective or a strategic alignment with a growing segment of the electorate interested in digital assets. Trump’s influence, especially within the Republican party, is undeniable. An endorsement from a figure of his stature could lend significant political weight to pro-Bitcoin initiatives in Congress. What might this support mean in practical terms? It could potentially: Encourage more Republican lawmakers to openly support Bitcoin-friendly legislation. Signal to regulators a potential shift in executive branch attitude towards the asset class, should he return to office. Boost mainstream confidence in Bitcoin by associating it with a major political figure. However, it’s also important to consider the political dynamics. Endorsements can be complex, and the depth of this ‘support’ for the Bitcoin Act would need to be scrutinized as more details emerge. Political backing is a crucial element in navigating the complex path of Crypto Policy in Washington. Exploring the Ambitious US Bitcoin Bill: Why Buy 1 Million BTC? Parallel to the news about Trump’s support, reports indicate a distinct bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC is slated to reach the Senate floor. This proposal is ambitious, to say the least. 1 million Bitcoin represents a substantial portion of the total supply (currently just under 21 million) and, at current market prices, would involve an enormous expenditure, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. Why would the U.S. government consider such a move? Several potential rationales could be behind this proposed US Bitcoin Bill : Strategic Reserve: Treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold or oil reserves, to diversify the national balance sheet. Hedge Against Inflation: Acquiring Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies. Asserting Leadership: Positioning the U.S. as a leader in the future of digital finance and technology. Attracting Talent and Innovation: Signaling a commitment to the crypto industry, potentially encouraging businesses and innovators to remain or establish themselves in the U.S. Such a purchase would be unprecedented for a major global power. It would likely have significant implications for the global financial system and the perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate, state-level asset. Senator Lummis: A Steadfast Voice for Bitcoin in Washington Senator Lummis of Wyoming has consistently been one of the most vocal and knowledgeable advocates for Bitcoin and digital assets in the U.S. Senate. Her background, which includes owning Bitcoin herself, lends her credibility within the crypto community. She has been instrumental in trying to shape constructive Crypto Policy rather than purely restrictive regulation. The ‘Bitcoin Act’ she mentioned, while details are still emerging, is likely aligned with her known legislative priorities. These priorities typically include: Providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, distinguishing between commodities, securities, and other asset types. Protecting individuals’ right to self-custody their digital assets. Ensuring that innovation in the crypto space can thrive in the U.S. under clear rules. Integrating digital assets into the existing financial framework where appropriate, without stifling their unique properties. Her efforts, often in collaboration with other pro-crypto lawmakers like Senator Gillibrand on broader regulatory frameworks, highlight the growing bipartisan interest in understanding and legislating for the digital asset space. Her statement at the Bitcoin 2025 conference underscores the ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto industry. Navigating the Complex Terrain of US Crypto Policy The landscape of Crypto Policy in the United States is complex and constantly evolving. Various government agencies – including the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve – have overlapping jurisdictions and differing views on how digital assets should be regulated. Congress has seen multiple bills introduced, but comprehensive legislation has been slow to pass. The potential advancement of a US Bitcoin Bill and the reported support from Donald Trump introduce new variables into this equation. It suggests that political will might be strengthening for specific, potentially bold, actions related to Bitcoin . However, significant hurdles remain: Political Opposition: Not all lawmakers are favorable towards Bitcoin or see a role for the government in holding it. Concerns about volatility, illicit use, and environmental impact are often raised. Regulatory Uncertainty: Even if a bill passes, the specific agencies tasked with implementation would need clear directives, which can be subject to interpretation and delay. Logistical Challenges: Acquiring 1 million BTC would require careful execution to avoid massive market disruption. Public Debate: A move of this magnitude would spark widespread public and economic debate about its wisdom and implications. The coming weeks, particularly as the reported 1M BTC bill potentially reaches the floor, will be critical in understanding the seriousness and potential path forward for these initiatives. What This Means for Bitcoin and the Market News of potential state-level adoption or significant government interaction with Bitcoin is typically viewed positively by the market. It can increase legitimacy, signal long-term viability, and potentially create significant demand. If a US Bitcoin Bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC were to pass and be enacted, the direct market impact would be substantial. The mechanics of such a purchase (e.g., over what timeframe, through which entities) would dictate the immediate price reaction, but the long-term removal of such a large amount of Bitcoin from the circulating supply could be profoundly bullish. Beyond the direct purchase, the symbolic impact of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could influence other nations and institutions, potentially accelerating global adoption and integration into traditional finance. However, it’s crucial to approach these developments with cautious optimism. Legislative processes are lengthy and uncertain. Bills can be amended, delayed, or fail. The current news, while exciting, is based on reports of statements and upcoming legislative steps, not finalized law. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those interested in the intersection of politics and crypto, these developments are compelling. Here are a few things to keep an eye on: Details of the ‘Bitcoin Act’: What specific provisions does it contain? How does it aim to shape Crypto Policy ? Progress of the 1 Million BTC Bill: Does it reach the floor? What is the debate surrounding it? Who are its key sponsors and opponents? Further Clarification from Donald Trump: Will he publicly confirm or elaborate on his support for the Bitcoin Act ? Market Reaction: How does the price of Bitcoin react to the news and subsequent legislative updates? Statements from Other Policymakers: Do other senators or representatives voice support or opposition to these initiatives? Staying informed through reliable news sources and tracking legislative progress will be key to understanding how these potential developments might unfold and impact the future of Bitcoin . Summary: A Momentous Juncture for Bitcoin in the USA The confluence of Senator Lummis’s report on Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act and the potential movement of a US Bitcoin Bill proposing a 1 million BTC purchase represents a potentially momentous period for cryptocurrency in the United States. While the path forward for any legislation is always uncertain, these developments highlight the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in political discourse and its growing consideration as a strategic asset at the highest levels. The coming weeks could provide clearer signals on the future direction of Crypto Policy and the potential for unprecedented government interaction with the world’s leading digital asset.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Ethereum surged past $2,600 in early Asia hours, up 3.7%, breaking decisively above its previous resistance level of around $2,500 following a prolonged consolidation period, according to CoinDesk Research's AI-assisted technical analysis model. The rally is supported by robust trading volume and significant institutional confidence, underscored by $248 million in net inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs last week, led prominently by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. DeFi activity is also strengthening, with Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) rising 3.59% over the last 24 hours to $64.37 billion, according to DeFi Llama. However, the rally faces potential headwinds. Ethereum’s active addresses currently sit at 406,180, nearly flat compared to approximately 430,000 addresses one year ago, indicating muted user growth. Additionally, stablecoin flows reveal mixed signals; traditional stalwarts USDT and USDC remain relatively flat, while emerging stablecoins such as Ethena's USDe and BUIDL demonstrate stronger growth trends, signaling shifts within Ethereum’s broader stablecoin ecosystem. Despite bullish momentum and strong institutional backing, subdued retail investor participation and tepid user growth suggest this rally could face near-term constraints. Bitcoin Soars While Luxury Watches Stall: A Pandemic-Era Correlation Breaks Down Bitcoin (BTC) and luxury watches, once pandemic-era companions buoyed by stimulus and speculative exuberance, have sharply diverged over the past year, market data shows, with BTC surging 56.9%, according to CoinDesk market data , while WatchCharts.com luxury watch index fell by 4%. As recently as mid-2023, prices for bitcoin and luxury watches moved closely in tandem, buoyed by central banks and governments injecting substantial liquidity into global markets. However, the two have since taken distinctly different paths. OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai attributes Bitcoin’s sustained upward trajectory to increased institutional adoption and maturation as a credible asset. In contrast, the secondary market for luxury watches has cooled significantly from its pandemic peak. “The real collectors stayed in watches while speculators moved on, and bitcoin has matured to take its place in many investors’ portfolios,” Lai said. “Watches make great heirlooms, but I'll take Bitcoin any day as a generational asset. You can't lose it, scratch it during a move, or have it stolen, as long as you keep your seed phrase secure.” Yet, in recent months, the luxury watch market has shown early signs of a modest recovery, posting a 0.3% gain over the last three months. Jake Plonskier, founder of Watches.io, credits this rebound to external economic pressures rather than renewed crypto-driven speculation. He notes rising tariffs and surging gold prices as key catalysts. “Gold and silver are decent proxies for the watch market,” Plonskier explained, highlighting Rolex’s January decision to raise MSRP by 14% for its gold models. He added that crypto's lasting impact on luxury watches is primarily demographic: ""Crypto wealth introduced a whole new market that can afford watches. Now men under 30 can afford Pateks and APs, which traditionally never would have been purchased by this type of clientele.” Circle Prepares for IPO Filing Circle Internet Group, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""CRCL,"" aiming to sell 24 million class A shares priced between $24 and $26 each, CoinDesk previously reported. The company itself will offer 9.6 million shares, potentially raising nearly $250 million, while selling stakeholders are providing an additional 14.4 million shares, possibly earning close to $375 million. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment has indicated interest in purchasing $150 million worth of shares during the IPO, which is being managed by joint lead active bookrunners J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The IPO filing follows previous unsuccessful attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021 and a brief consideration of a $5 billion sale to firms such as Coinbase or Ripple. Marathon Digital CEO Says U.S. Government Should Mine BTC Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel urged the U.S. government to start actively mining bitcoin to fulfill President Trump's directive for a strategic bitcoin reserve, suggesting excess hydroelectricity could support domestic mining operations, CoinDesk previously reported. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025, Thiel emphasized the necessity of tangible steps beyond the current plan of using approximately 200,000 seized bitcoins from government forfeitures. Senator Cynthia Lummis supports this broader vision through her proposed BITCOIN Act, advocating for converting underperforming government gold certificates into bitcoin to expand the reserve substantially. However, Lummis acknowledges significant legislative hurdles remain, citing a general lack of congressional understanding about bitcoin and competing priorities such as stablecoin and market structure regulations. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin bounced back strongly from a correction to $107,604, stabilizing just below key resistance at $110,000, supported by easing EU trade tensions and continued accumulation from long-term investors, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. ETH: Ethereum broke decisively above $2,600 on strong institutional ETF inflows and rising DeFi activity, though flat active address growth could limit further upside. Gold: Gold currently trades at $3,315.30 per ounce, down 0.77%, as Citi upgrades its near-term forecast to between $3,100 and $3,500 due to ongoing trade uncertainties, while remaining cautious longer term amid expectations of economic improvement and Fed rate cuts. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225, which opened at 38,003.67 on Wednesday, is forecasted to rise approximately 5% to 39,600 by year-end, according to a Reuters poll , as U.S. trade uncertainties eased, though near-term volatility remained likely, with analysts predicting further gains to 42,000 by the end of 2026. S&P 500: The benchmark S&P 500 closed about 2.1% higher Tuesday, boosted by optimism over a delayed implementation of U.S.-EU tariffs and improved prospects for a trade agreement.

The company is currently testing the waters to see if developers are interested in integrating this service into their apps. The tech firm preferred ChatGPT to provide this service since it is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s largest consumer applications, with around 600 million monthly active users. Therefore, with ChatGPT, the company appears keen to try and expand into other consumer areas – such as online shopping, social media, and personal devices. Another benefit of the “ Sign in with ChatGPT” service could help OpenAI compete with other giant consumer technology companies such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft. These companies integrate themselves into people’s lives with all sorts of online services, among them a convenient way to sign in to third-party apps quickly. OpenAI marks a significant milestone with the “Sign in with ChatGPT” service OpenAI previewed “Sign in with ChatGPT” earlier this month for developers in Codex CCLI, OpenAI’s open-source AI coding tool in the terminal. The capability enables developers to attach their ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Pro accounts to their API accounts. The company offered Plus users who signed into ChatGPT $5 in API credits and Pro users $50 in API credits to convince them to try the new service. OpenAI is planning to link its sign-in system with a range of companies . The tech firm has also offered developer interest forms to developers wanting to try this service in their apps. The form asked businesses to declare their app’s user base. It listed possible ranges, from small companies with fewer than 1,000 weekly users to large apps with over 100 million weekly users. The form also inquires how developers currently charge for AI features and whether they use the OpenAI API. In the meantime, in 2023, CEO Sam Altman stated that the company might be able to offer a “sign in with OpenAI” option by 2024. Now, it appears that OpenAI is working on this feature and wants to release it in 2025. However, it is unclear when the sign-in feature will become available to those ChatGPT users and how many companies have signed up. The request for comment sent to OpenAI was not immediately returned. OpenAI revealed a new ChatGPT search feature for online shopping services OpenAI shared significant changes to ChatGPT search, which would improve the web search experience in ChatGPT, enabling more capabilities, such as online shopping, for users on April 28. According to the latest updates, ChatGPT provides a range of choices to users when they search for products, displays images and reviews of these products, and links to the sites where users can buy the products. In addition, the company noted that users could ask specific questions using everyday language and receive fast and reliable results. This was after OpenAI tested the feature first in categories including fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. To ensure the new features start operating effectively, the firm introduced this update in GPT-4o, the standard AI model for ChatGPT, for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free users, as well as for users who are not logged in worldwide. This ChatGPT search update is part of OpenAI’s strategy to compete with Google by offering a more personalized way to find products and information online. Notably, online shopping is a key area for Google, but the advertising market for priority placements in Google Search has also affected the quality of its service over the years. OpenAI reported that its search feature was growing quickly. Last month, users conducted over a billion web searches using ChatGPT, according to information from reliable sources.

While many have debated when and if artificial intelligence would begin displacing human workers, new data suggests we might be seeing the initial effects, particularly concerning entry level tech jobs . Are Entry Level Tech Jobs Disappearing Due to AI? Recent research indicates a potential shift in tech hiring trends that could be linked to the rise of AI. SignalFire, a venture capital firm that tracks job movements across millions of employees and companies using LinkedIn data, has observed a notable change in how tech companies are recruiting. Their analysis for 2024 shows a decrease in the hiring of recent college graduates compared to 2023. Simultaneously, these same companies, especially the top 15 big tech firms, have increased their recruitment of experienced professionals. Specifically: Big tech companies reduced new graduate hiring by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Startups saw an 11% decrease in graduate recruitment year-over-year. While other factors could contribute to this dip, SignalFire’s head of research, Asher Bantock, believes there is significant evidence suggesting AI is a major factor. The World Economic Forum also supports this, with a survey indicating 40% of employers plan to cut staff where AI can automate tasks. Why AI Automation Targets Junior Roles Why are entry level tech jobs particularly susceptible to AI automation ? These roles often involve tasks that are routine, repetitive, and lower-risk. Generative AI is becoming increasingly capable of handling such duties. Examples include: Basic coding and debugging Preliminary financial research and analysis Software installation and basic support AI’s ability to perform these tasks means companies may require fewer human employees for entry-level positions. Gabe Stengel, founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, shared his experience. His company’s AI tool can automate much of the analysis work he did early in his investment banking career, such as diligence, financial review, and material preparation. Major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly considered reducing junior staff hires significantly and adjusting pay, acknowledging that AI makes some tasks less demanding than before. The Growing Need for Experience Amidst Changing Tech Hiring Trends Despite the potential challenges for new graduates, the demand for experienced tech professionals is rising. SignalFire’s report highlights this trend: Big tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience. Startups hired 14% more individuals in the same seniority range. This creates a challenging situation for recent graduates: they need experience to get hired, but cannot gain experience without being hired. Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, notes that AI exacerbates this long-standing paradox. Navigating the Future of Tech Jobs As we look at the future of tech jobs , adapting to AI is crucial. The advice for those entering the field is clear: master AI tools. As Doshay puts it, “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it.” Developing proficiency in AI-powered platforms and understanding how to leverage them for complex tasks will be essential for career growth. Understanding the impact of AI is vital for anyone in the tech sector, including those interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain, where AI applications are also expanding. Staying informed on these developments is key to navigating the evolving landscape. Join us at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI to delve deeper into the convergence of AI and technology.

Now, a prominent voice from within the government itself has added significant weight to the discussion. At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, crypto-friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis shared a remarkable belief: she estimates the U.S. government currently possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC). Senator Lummis Shares Insight on Bitcoin Holdings Senator Cynthia Lummis, known for her supportive stance on digital assets and blockchain technology, delivered this striking estimate during her appearance at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference. The revelation, reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, on X, immediately sent ripples through the crypto news landscape. While the number itself is substantial, the context provided by Senator Lummis is equally important. According to Terrett’s report, Senator Lummis is not entirely certain of the precise 200,000 figure. She indicated that the specific details regarding these significant Bitcoin holdings were classified following an audit conducted under the direction of the White House. The fact that such information is classified underscores the sensitive nature with which the government views its digital asset reserves. Senator Lummis did mention that she has been offered a private briefing on the matter, suggesting a level of transparency is available to her as a legislator, even if the full details remain shielded from the public eye. Her willingness to share her estimated figure, despite the classified nature, highlights the growing importance of discussing government involvement with cryptocurrencies openly, even within the bounds of national security. Why Does the US Government Hold Bitcoin? Understanding Government Crypto Acquisitions Many might wonder how the US government Bitcoin holdings accumulated in the first place. Unlike individual investors buying BTC on exchanges, the vast majority of the government’s cryptocurrency stash comes from seizures related to criminal activities. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), regularly confiscate cryptocurrencies used in illicit operations, including: Drug trafficking Money laundering Cybercrime (like ransomware attacks) Fraud schemes Perhaps the most famous example involves the Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road online marketplace, shut down by the FBI in 2013. Over the years, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from various illegal enterprises. These assets are then held in government wallets, pending legal proceedings or decisions on their disposition. Comparing Estimates: Is 200K BTC a New High for Government Crypto? Prior to Senator Lummis’s statement, public estimates of the Government crypto holdings derived primarily from reported seizures. While official, consolidated figures are hard to come by publicly, various reports have tracked known government confiscations over time. These reports have often placed the publicly acknowledged holdings in the range of tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands of BTC, though exact figures fluctuate as assets are seized or occasionally sold. Senator Lummis’s belief in a 200,000 BTC holding is significant because it represents a high-end estimate from someone with potential access to more detailed, albeit classified, information. It suggests that the government’s total stash, combining all agencies and past seizures, could be considerably larger than what is commonly discussed based solely on public announcements. It’s crucial to remember that Lummis stated this as her ‘belief’ based on classified information, rather than a confirmed, declassified figure. The exact number could be slightly higher or lower, but the ballpark figure of 200,000 BTC positions the U.S. government as one of the largest single holders of Bitcoin globally, outside of potentially Satoshi Nakamoto’s presumed holdings and major exchanges or investment funds. The Classified Nature of US Government Bitcoin Holdings The fact that the specific details surrounding the US government Bitcoin audit and total holdings are classified raises important questions. Why the secrecy? Several potential reasons exist: Market Impact: Disclosing the exact amount could potentially influence the Bitcoin market, especially if the government were to signal an intent to sell a large portion. Keeping the precise figure confidential reduces the risk of market manipulation or volatility based on government actions. National Security: The methods used to track, seize, and secure these digital assets might involve sensitive law enforcement or intelligence techniques that the government wishes to keep secret from criminals and foreign adversaries. Ongoing Investigations: Revealing total holdings might inadvertently disclose information related to ongoing criminal investigations or asset recovery efforts. Strategic Asset Status: The government might view Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold reserves or foreign currency holdings, where full transparency is not always deemed necessary or beneficial. While classification might serve legitimate government interests, it also creates a lack of public transparency regarding significant public assets. This is a point of tension for advocates of open government and the transparent handling of seized assets. Senator Lummis: A Key Voice in Crypto Regulation Senator Cynthia Lummis’s comments are particularly noteworthy given her prominent role in advocating for clear and sensible Crypto regulation in the United States. As a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, she has consistently called for greater clarity and certainty for the crypto industry. Her insights into the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings highlight a paradox: the U.S. government is simultaneously a major holder of crypto assets and a key player in the ongoing debate about how to regulate them. This dual role adds complexity to the regulatory conversation. Does the government’s experience managing seized crypto assets inform its approach to regulating the broader market? How should the disposition of these assets (selling vs. holding) be decided, and what should be the criteria? Senator Lummis’s perspective, coming from someone who understands both the governmental machinery and the principles of digital assets, is invaluable in bridging the gap between Washington D.C. and the crypto ecosystem. Her willingness to speak about potentially classified information, even in broad terms, signals the importance she places on public awareness and discussion surrounding these topics. What Does This Mean for the Future? The revelation of a belief in 200,000 BTC Government crypto holdings, coupled with the classified audit, suggests a few things: The U.S. government is likely one of the largest single entities holding Bitcoin. The government is actively auditing and managing these digital assets, indicating a growing institutional acknowledgment of their value (and potential risks). Transparency around government crypto holdings is limited, raising questions about public oversight and potential market impact if these assets were ever liquidated. Legislators like Senator Lummis are pushing for more understanding and potentially more transparency regarding these holdings and their implications for policy. The disposition of seized crypto assets remains a point of interest. While the government has sold off portions of its seized Bitcoin in the past, holding a significant reserve could also be viewed strategically. It could be seen as a hedge, a potential source of funds, or even leverage in future financial or geopolitical contexts. Conclusion: The Classified Cache of US Government Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis’s statement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a compelling glimpse into the opaque world of US government Bitcoin holdings. Her belief that the government holds around 200,000 BTC, a figure tied to a classified White House audit, confirms that the U.S. government is a major, albeit secretive, player in the Bitcoin market. This significant holding, primarily accumulated through law enforcement seizures, raises critical questions about transparency, market impact, and the government’s evolving strategy towards digital assets. As discussions around Crypto regulation continue to evolve, the government’s own substantial Government crypto reserves will undoubtedly remain a topic of interest and debate. Senator Lummis’s willingness to bring this estimated figure into the public discourse, despite its classified origins, underscores the growing need for clarity regarding how these assets are managed and what their existence signifies for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital economy.

The letter responds to a recent speech by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce titled “New Paradigm,” where she raised an important question: When does a cryptocurrency stop being part of an investment contract and become just a digital asset? In their letter, Ripple thanked the SEC team for meeting with them on May 20, 2025, and offered further thoughts on the issue. Ripple argued that most cryptocurrencies traded today are not securities. They pointed to legal analysis from Lewis Cohen and others, which says that when crypto tokens are sold in secondary markets — like exchanges — they usually don’t meet the legal definition of a security. Today, @Ripple submitted an additional letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force addressing a key question from Commissioner Peirce’s “New Paradigm” speech: When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract? We appreciate the continued engagement with the Task Force.… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 27, 2025 Ripple also opened up about last year’s court ruling by Judge Torres in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The judge decided that while some of Ripple’s early XRP sales to big investors counted as investment contracts, the XRP token itself is not a security when sold in secondary markets. Ripple acknowledged the SEC’s concern about bad actors misusing crypto markets but said it’s up to Congress, not the SEC, to change the laws. They warned against vague rules like deciding if a token is “fully functional” or “sufficiently decentralized” , as these can confuse the market. Instead, Ripple suggested a clearer legal framework. For example, if a crypto token was once sold as part of an investment contract, it should be considered separate from that contract when: Any promises made by the issuer to the original buyer have been fulfilled. The current holder has no legal rights to demand anything from the issuer. Ripple also proposed a safe harbor rule to protect honest crypto projects that are still developing, helping them avoid legal risks while following clear guidelines. Additionally, Ripple recommended using the maturity of a crypto network — how big and established it is — rather than vague ideas like decentralization, to decide whether it should still be regulated as a security. They suggested that tokens on open, permissionless networks with a large market value, operational for years, and without one party having control, should no longer fall under securities laws.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 01:54:28

Dogecoin shows short-term promise with strong user activity, and XRP has rallied hard, but both face long-term questions. Dogecoin’s movement is often driven by user sentiment, and XRP’s recent spike is now challenged by fading network signals. BlockDAG , on the other hand, is gaining traction as a Web3 development layer. Built with a DAG-style Proof-of-Work structure, smart contracts, and auto-scaling features, it supports decentralized applications with real-world value. This setup addresses the performance limitations of older chains, offering high throughput and scalability developers can count on. BlockDAG’s $272M Raise Signals Strong Demand for a Scalable Web3 Stack BlockDAG is more than just a blockchain project. It is being developed as a robust Web3 foundation that offers speed, scalability, and real utility. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) combined with Proof-of-Work allows it to process transactions and smart contracts in parallel. This solves congestion issues seen in traditional blockchains and supports demanding use cases like DeFi, digital ID, and Web3 gaming. Its architecture is built like a Web3 operating system. Features like auto-scaling, smart contract automation, and cross-chain compatibility are designed to simplify work for developers. BlockDAG provides a framework that enables developers to build advanced applications without compromising performance or decentralization. This makes it a practical choice for long-term application development. BlockDAG’s traction is clearly visible. The project has raised over $272 million so far. More than 21.3 billion coins have been sold. Batch 28 is now priced at $0.0262, showing a gain of 2,520% since Batch 1. However, until June 13, a special frozen price of $0.0020 is available, offering a 2,400% profit margin before the $0.05 launch. Adding to the momentum, the GO LIVE reveal will announce exchange listings, expected to drive even more attention. Dogecoin Maintains Key Price Support, Eyes $0.26 Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading around $0.227, down slightly by 1.65% over the past day. Technical analysis shows DOGE holding support at $0.21, with possible upward momentum toward $0.26 if support holds. Looking forward, predictions for 2025 range widely. Optimistic projections see DOGE hitting $0.731, while others take a more conservative stance at $0.341. These outlooks depend on several factors like adoption trends and macroeconomic signals. Additionally, DOGE’s active addresses have grown by over 500%, signaling increased network activity. This spike in user engagement could help maintain price strength if broader market sentiment stays positive. Despite these signals, Dogecoin remains highly speculative. Anyone following the coin should be aware of its volatility and base decisions on thorough understanding rather than hype. XRP Trend Alert Suggests Risk of Pullback After Massive Surge XRP has soared more than 385% since the end of 2024. But recent signals suggest a slowdown could be coming. Data shows that over 70% of its realized cap was bought near recent highs, a pattern seen in previous peaks. Another concern is the network slowdown. Active addresses have dropped by over 90% since March 2025, bringing usage back to pre-rally levels. This drop in activity could hurt XRP’s support level going forward. From a technical angle, XRP is now forming a falling wedge pattern. If this setup plays out, the price could dip around 25%, testing the $1.76 support zone. These signs point to a cautious outlook as the chart hints at a cooling period. BlockDAG Stands Out with Utility-First Vision for Web3 Short-term price moves often distract from what matters most: tech utility and future growth. Dogecoin relies on meme-driven interest. XRP faces uncertainty with dropping activity. BlockDAG, though, brings a real Layer 1 framework that supports developers and future-ready dApps. It’s built for performance, not just hype. With smart contract integration, speed, and scalability, BlockDAG positions itself as more than just another name in crypto. It may just be the pick for those looking beyond charts and headlines.

Glassnode Reveals,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-investor-behavior-shape-trends-glassnode/,"The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained how Bitcoin investor behavior tends to reflect in price trend reversals and continuations. Glassnode Highlights Key Behavioral Patterns Behind Bitcoin Moves In a new thread on X, Glassnode has shared a new way to categorize Bitcoin investors based on their on-chain spending patterns. Under this indicator, called the Supply by Investor Behavior, there are five cohorts: Conviction Buyers, First Buyers, Momentum Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers. First Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers are pretty self-explanatory. Conviction Buyers refer to the investors who buy despite a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, while Momentum Buyers refer to those who buy during uptrends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? “The metric tracks the cumulative token supply held by each cohort over time,” notes the analytics firm in the chart’s description on its website. “To focus solely on investor behavior, we exclude exchanges and smart contracts.” Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the indicator over Bitcoin’s history: To showcase how the behavior of these groups has an effect on the asset’s trajectory, the analytics firm has zoomed in on the data of two cohorts: Conviction Buyers and First Buyers. First, here is the chart specifically for the Bitcoin Conviction Buyers: From the graph, it’s visible that the BTC supply held by the Conviction Buyers generally observes a spike alongside inflection points in the cryptocurrency’s price. In particular, their supply tends to reach a peak coinciding with bear market lows. These investors also step in to buy dips during uptrends, helping stabilize pullbacks. “But conviction alone isn’t enough to spark a rally – that’s where First Buyers come in,” explains Glassnode. Below is a chart that highlights the role of the First Buyers. As displayed in the chart, demand from First Buyers went up alongside Bitcoin’s recovery out of the bear market, with a particularly sharp surge coinciding with the bull rally in Q1 2024. Related Reading: XRP Sees Wave Of Inflows: 70% Of Realized Cap Now New Money The supply of the First Buyers let off during the consolidation phase that followed this rally, but demand returned in the second half of the year, helping fuel the run beyond $100,000. The Bitcoin market downturn this year again accompanied a decline in the supply of the First Buyers, this time to a much stronger degree than last year’s drawdown. New capital inflows seem to have made a sharp return once more, however, as the metric’s value has switched to rapid growth, potentially explaining the rally to the new all-time high. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $109,800, up over 4% in the past week.

Most notably, Coinbase – the leading US-based crypto exchange – recorded a net outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculation about renewed institutional demand and a potential continuation of the rally. Coinbase Sees 7,883 Bitcoin Outflow According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Coinbase experienced a daily outflow of 8,742 BTC on May 26. After accounting for BTC deposits, the net outflow stood at 7,883 BTC – marking the third-largest single-day BTC outflow from the exchange in the past month. For the uninitiated, daily BTC outflow refers to the total amount of Bitcoin withdrawn from an exchange within a day, while net outflow is the difference between BTC withdrawn and deposited – showing the actual net movement of funds. A positive net outflow means more BTC left the exchange than entered, often signaling accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Historically, large BTC outflows from Coinbase are often followed by institutional announcements or spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. Since all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs – except Fidelity’s – source their BTC from Coinbase, the scale of this transaction suggests potential ETF involvement or a corporate acquisition. One likely candidate is Strategy, led by Michael Saylor. The company recently disclosed a purchase of 7,390 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Saylor has also hinted at another large acquisition, although only time will tell whether the latest Coinbase outflows are connected to the firm. Supporting this institutional narrative is the Coinbase Premium Index, which has remained consistently positive over the past month. This metric reflects stronger buying pressure from US-based investors, often linked to institutional demand. The analyst concluded: These outflows reflect sustained demand from U.S.-based institutions. If this appetite continues, it may lay the groundwork for another leg up in Bitcoin’s price. Especially when fueled by ETF inflows, such moves can lead to sharp price breaks and new highs. New BTC ATH Soon? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,589, just 1.9% below its all-time high. However, multiple on-chain and technical indicators suggest that BTC could soon break into uncharted territory.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) has flipped back to positive, signaling bullish momentum. Moreover, on-chain metrics show that holders are not rushing to sell, even while sitting on significant unrealized gains, suggesting belief in further price appreciation. At press time, BTC trades at $109,589, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report. Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources. “So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar “For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.” Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching. The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%. The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop. Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.” NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadar The average loan duration is also lower ; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025. Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.” NFT market downturn also hurts lending Part of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago. “With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.” Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadar The protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share. “The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said. “Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.” Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-28 02:11:48

Ethereum has carried the decentralized world on its shoulders for nearly a decade. But as it approaches 2030, it faces new challenges—and fierce rivals. Today, ETH trades at $2,626, with steady movement across technical indicators. While its price has dipped slightly by -0.27% in 24 hours, its long-term momentum remains intact. Developers continue to look toward Ethereum’s transition roadmap, with an eye on scalability, modularity, and execution environment upgrades. This article breaks down Ethereum’s projected trajectory to 2030 and compares it with emerging technologies like Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics, now deep into its 36th presale stage, is positioning itself as a problem-solver for what Ethereum still struggles with—interoperability and seamless real-world connectivity. It aims to bridge what others couldn’t: fragmented chain environments, siloed data, and transaction paths. Qubetics enters the conversation not as competition but as a complementary force reshaping digital utility. Ethereum: Current Price at $2,626 with Long-Term Focus on Network Scalability Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized application ecosystems. As of today, ETH is priced at $2,626, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15.01 billion and a market cap of $308.69 billion. While its price action has cooled slightly, its technological ambition hasn’t. Ethereum is entering a critical era of upgrades: proto-danksharding, rollup compression, execution sharding, and stateless clients. These terms aren’t just buzz—they represent Ethereum’s structural transition into a globally scalable, resource-efficient blockchain. Developers are focusing on enabling modular execution environments and improving data availability layers. In simple terms, Ethereum is building a world where transactions are faster, cheaper, and programmable at scale. It’s developing from a smart contract platform into a digital economy framework. This directly feeds into rising interest in Ethereum Price Prediction 2030—as more decentralized applications are built on-chain, demand for ETH as “fuel” increases. For developers and community members alike, this is a signal: Ethereum isn’t stalling; it’s loading the next chapter. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Can ETH Reach the Next Milestone? Given Ethereum’s current momentum and roadmap, the question arises—where does ETH stand in 2030? Based on recent user predictions and growth modeling, Ethereum could reach approximately $3,263.39 by 2030. That marks a potential 27.6% increase from its current value. This estimate is grounded in Ethereum’s ongoing infrastructure upgrades, increasing institutional interest, and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems. The 2030 vision includes Ethereum handling millions of transactions per second through rollups and Layer-2s, enabling mainstream financial tools to be fully decentralized and borderless. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030 also considers market confidence. A significant portion of community sentiment remains very bullish, with over 39% of participants projecting strong long-term growth. This positive momentum is amplified by increased staking participation, Layer-2 development, and cross-chain bridge compatibility efforts that strengthen Ethereum’s overall utility. For blockchain developers and protocol architects, this long-term outlook encourages continuous investment in building with Ethereum—not just holding ETH, but leveraging its framework to shape real economies and autonomous digital systems. Qubetics ($TICS): Over $17.4M Raised, 514M Tokens Sold, Real Use Cases with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics ($TICS) delivers what many talked about but few delivered: true interoperability between blockchains. Unlike other protocols that rely on bridges or wrapped tokens, Qubetics enables blockchains to talk directly. This means a digital ID verified on a private enterprise chain can be instantly authenticated on a public Ethereum smart contract. Or consider a logistics database powered by one chain automatically syncing shipping records with a customs database hosted on another. They’re the kind of cross-chain functionality Qubetics makes possible. By solving real-world issues like disconnected data flows, system latency, and chain incompatibility, it creates a digital infrastructure where blockchain solutions can operate without friction. This technology doesn’t just talk across networks—it makes networks function as one. With over 514 million $TICS tokens sold, more than 27,100 holders, and $17.4 million raised already. Currently in Stage 36, each $TICS token is priced at $0.3064, with a 226% return potential if it hits $1 post-presale. As it scales, projected returns stretch to 1,531% at $5, 1,858% at $6, and up to 4,795% at $15 after Mainnet launch. These numbers aren’t simply optimistic—they’re grounded in utility-driven adoption and exponential network value. Early participants recognize what’s building: a unified blockchain layer that will make legacy infrastructure look outdated. Final Perspective on Ethereum and Qubetics in the Blockchain Future Ethereum drives programmability, Qubetics introduces universal interoperability. Together, they’re not splitting the digital economy—they’re building it. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030 sits at the center of this evolution. With its current value at $2,556.95, a projection to $3,263.39 reflects both confidence and technical readiness. Qubetics fills the gaps Ethereum wasn’t built to address—unifying protocols across chains, real-time, and at scale. As Qubetics continues its Stage 36 crypto presale , early buyers already recognize the layered value building underneath. Ethereum continues to attract developers preparing for the next decade.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31 and is eyeing to break some important resistance levels. According to the latest analysis, XRP remains in a bullish trend on the daily chart because it continues to form higher lows and higher highs. This kind of price movement is usually seen as a healthy sign in the market. Meanwhile, the stock market and several other cryptocurrencies have also started to bounce back slightly, which could support XRP’s price in the short term. Adding to this, analysts have noticed the early signs of a bullish divergence on XRP’s 6-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI). This happens when the price keeps moving lower or stays flat, but the RSI slowly begins to rise, forming higher lows and higher highs. This is often a signal that the market could soon see a short-term recovery or at least a break from its recent downward trend. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch: However, it’s important to remember that this signal alone doesn’t guarantee a major rally. It might lead to a small upward move or some sideways price action, giving traders and investors a break from the bearish pressure seen recently. Looking at the bigger picture, XRP still holds a larger bullish trend on the daily time frame, at least for now. In terms of price levels, XRP is facing light resistance around the $2.35 mark, with more resistance expected at $2.44. The strongest resistance area is currently between $2.55 and $2.62. On the other hand, XRP has significant support between $2.10 and $2.15, along with another key support level close to $2.30.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 02:19:33

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a decline in whale transactions, leaving traders guessing their next moves. Meanwhile, the Pi network has dropped again following the release of millions of new coins, which sparked fresh selling pressure. While both SHIB and Pi Coin face slowdowns, BlockDAG (BDAG) is seeing rising activity. Its presale has now passed $272 million, aiming for a $600M target, with a limited-time price of $0.002 locked until June 13. With this opportunity narrowing, many are taking notice as BlockDAG continues gaining traction. SHIB Whale Activity Drops as Price Holds Pattern According to recent data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a 74% decline in large transaction volumes, falling from 5.76 trillion SHIB to just 1.47 trillion in five days. This decrease, often linked to whale behavior, has created speculation about a potential pause or a waiting period ahead of a market move. Despite reduced activity, 78% of holders are still holding onto SHIB for over a year. The market remains steady between important moving averages. The current trend suggests a waiting game, as Shiba Inu’s price does not signal a clear upward or downward move. Pi Network Faces Pressure from Upcoming Token Release The Pi network price dropped 5.4% to around $0.74 on May 27. The fall came ahead of the release of 37 million new Pi coins over a span of three days. This token unlock has raised fears of more sell-offs, which could drag the price under the key $0.65 support level. Pi had recently touched a high of $1.67, showing signs of recovery, but that did not last. Although trading volumes remain active, resistance around $0.94 is proving hard to overcome. Market confidence appears cautious, with supply pressure weighing on price strength. BlockDAG Presale Crosses $272M as June 13 Deadline Nears BlockDAG is gaining major attention as it moves toward its $600 million presale goal. With over $272 million raised and more than 21.3 billion coins sold, its momentum is growing. The current price is fixed at $0.002 only until June 13. After that, it moves to $0.0262 in Batch 28, showing a potential 2,520% return since Batch 1. This frozen price represents a possible 2,400% gain before the $0.05 launch price. Its growth is supported by engaging features like the Buyer Battles contest, where 150 million coins are allocated daily, with leftovers going to the top buyer. A 25% referral program gives rewards to both the buyer and the referrer, making it more appealing. The project now has more than 170,000 holders, adding to its strong community. BlockDAG will also see 15 new exchange listings, bringing the total to 20 after its GO LIVE reveal. Analysts are watching closely, with some predicting short-term gains up to $1 and longer-term targets as high as $10. As the June 13 deadline nears, many see this presale as a rare entry point. With momentum building, BlockDAG is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about crypto projects this year. Summing Up SHIB’s decline in large transfers points to a quiet phase in whale activity, though long-term holders remain firm. The Pi network price continues to struggle with supply issues, despite steady trading. In comparison, BlockDAG is making strong progress. With $272 million raised, a fixed $0.002 entry until June 13, and upcoming listings after its GO LIVE reveal, it’s becoming one of the most discussed projects in crypto circles.

45184038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759473,1748401243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45184038.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Calm Feels Dangerous—All Eyes On Vegas And June Reversal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-calm-dangerous-vegas-june-reversal/,"Bitcoin hovers between $107,000 and $111,000, a deceptively narrow range that masks an options market bristling with tension. In a note to clients released today, Singapore-based QCP Capital argues that the lull is anything but benign. “Bitcoin’s reaction to last Friday’s macro developments was relatively restrained, even as equities rallied sharply,” the desk writes, pointing to “steady” institutional inflows into spot-BTC ETFs as the anchor keeping spot prices in check. Bitcoin Calm Before The Storm? The stability, however, has not bled into derivatives: “Front-end implied volatility held firm, with BTC consolidating in a tight range,” QCP observes, adding that traders are actively paying up for one- and two-week downside protection ahead of the Bitcoin Conference that opens in Las Vegas later today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters A Massive Week: Key Events To Watch QCP frames the three-day gathering—whose speaker roster includes US Vice President JD Vance, Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, and Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr.—as the key near-term volatility catalyst. “The sustained elevation in near-term vols suggests that traders are positioning around headline risk,” the firm writes. Memories of last year’s Nashville conference linger: a keynote by US President Trump sent one-day implied volatility above 90 before collapsing, with spot BTC tumbling nearly 30 percent in forty-eight hours. “That episode continues to shape market memory,” QCP warns, even as it assigns a low probability to a repeat. The positioning data argue for caution all the same. Perpetual futures open interest has retreated in the past twenty-four hours, and funding rates have slid back toward neutral levels—signs, QCP says, of “a defensive tilt.” Retail voices that typically embrace leverage are dialing back risk as well. Popular trader James Wynn has publicly trimmed longs, echoing an uptick in demand for short-dated puts that QCP describes as “persistent.” ETF flows remain the counterweight to that defensiveness. US spot-Bitcoin products absorbed 7,869 BTC last Friday, the largest single-day haul since late April, according to Glassnode data. For the week ending 23 May, net inflows reached $2.75 billion, the second-strongest weekly print of the year. Those allocations, QCP argues, “offer underlying support,” but are not large enough to overwhelm options-driven short-term swings should headlines jolt sentiment. Rumors—since denied—that Trump Media is exploring a $3 billion crypto raise exemplify the hair-trigger backdrop. “Headline sensitivity is elevated,” QCP writes. In its base case, Bitcoin holds its current band until the Las Vegas speeches conclude, after which “front-end vols are expected to compress as risk premia fade.” Higher Until Early June? Not everyone agrees that the compression will come quickly. The pseudonymous macro-cycle analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero), whose FOMC-timing model correctly flagged Bitcoin’s March low and February high, remains emphatically long. “This is not a ‘top in June’ call,” he posts on X. “This is a call that we go higher from here, and I remain bullish. Big difference.” Related Reading: Massive Whale Activity Detected on Binance as Bitcoin Tests New Highs He argues that Bitcoin historically grinds upward until roughly ten calendar days before an FOMC meeting; the next one lands on 18 June. “Price likely keeps going higher until the 8th–18th of June,” he writes, adding that cyclical weekly timing “lines up” and that he is “looking for longs upon short-time-frame pullbacks.” Astronomer’s conviction rests on a broader twenty-four-week cycle that he dates from the October 2024 breakout. “We are only week six,” he notes, implying that the upside phase is barely half-way through. He concedes that “alts always lag behind BTC,” but argues that pressing the momentum trade now is critical: “Going with momentum as long as possible gets you in the right mindset before trying to short too early.” For the moment, spot prices stay eerily placid even as the options market prices a storm. Whether that storm strikes upward or downward may depend on a sound bite delivered from a Las Vegas stage or on a policy nuance telegraphed from the Marriner Eccles Building three weeks later. Until then, Bitcoin’s calm is precisely what makes veteran traders nervous—and why hedging desks are doing brisk business selling fear. At press time, BTC traded at $110,661.

Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy” Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22 , however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter. “A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher,” the analysts said. It isn’t unusual for Bitcoin to consolidate for an extended time after reaching all-time highs. After Bitcoin reached a high of $73,679 in March 2024, it swung within about a $20,000 range until Donald Trump was elected US president that November. The third quarter of the year has, on average, been Bitcoin’s worst-performing quarter since 2013, with an average return of just 6.03% over the past 11 years, according to CoinGlass data. The next worst quarter on average is Q2, which has historically posted a stronger average return of 27.25%. Q4 has been the best-performing quarter on average for Bitcoin since 2013. Source: CoinGlass The analysts said that Bitcoin had entered a “short-term range-bound phase,” with a significant amount of short-term holders — those holding Bitcoin for under 155 days — selling off their positions over the past 30 days. “With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realized in the past month, the near-term supply overhang is expected — but so is structural demand. According to Bitbo data, the short-term holder realized price for Bitcoin was $95,781, while Bitcoin was trading at $108,929 at the time of publication. This represents an average profit of 13.72% for short-term holders. Related: Bitcoin profit taking lingers, but rally to $115K will liquidate $7B shorts Bitfinex’s analysts said that Bitcoin’s ETF “bid strength,” low volatility and Bitcoin’s spot premium all signal a maturing market “poised for eventual continuation once macro clarity improves.” The trading week ending May 23 saw around $2.75 billion flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw approximately $2.75 billion in inflows between May 19 and May 23. Source: Farside Crypto investors will be watching the US Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision on June 18 for more clarity on the macro environment. The Fed kept rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% in May. Bitcoin reaching new highs earlier this month was an event several crypto pundits predicted would happen earlier this year. On March 7, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said there was a 50% chance Bitcoin would reach new highs before June . Similarly, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said Bitcoin may hit “new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. “Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals. The move builds on Square’s existing Bitcoin Conversions feature that allows merchants to automatically convert sales to BTC. For consumers, payment is as simple as scanning a QR code, with Square handling the technicalities behind the scenes and Lightning enabling near-instant settlement.

According to Kyle, while distractions like meme coins may affect the market, growing institutional investment is set to help the overall crypto space. SUI First top pick is Sui (SUI) — a project built by developers behind Facebook’s former Diem project. With advanced security features, a unique Move programming language, and a growing U.S. presence, Sui is seen as a safer yet high-potential altcoin. The analyst expects a possible 5x to 10x return in the next bull run, thanks to its innovative approach and expanding partnerships, including with tech giant Microsoft. Gunzilla Games (GUNZ) Next is Gunzilla Games, a Web3 gaming company. Co-produced by Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (of District 9 and Elysium fame), the game runs on its own custom blockchain built for Web3 gaming, called GUNZ. The platform already records over 150,000 on-chain transactions daily in its beta stage. Despite this activity, the token’s market cap remains low at around $33 million. The analyst believes it’s undervalued and expects the token to surge as Web3 gaming narratives heat up, especially before investor token unlocks begin in 10 months. Mind Network (FHE) Next is Mind Network, a privacy-focused blockchain project specializing in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) — a groundbreaking tech that allows encrypted data to be processed without being decrypted. This is crucial for secure on-chain financial activity, especially for high-frequency traders and institutions who need to keep their strategies private. The project has been designated as a Tier 1 partner in Chainlink’s Build Program, placing it among a select few projects essential to Chainlink’s infrastructure plans. Sitting at a market cap of just $26 million, the analyst considers it a high-beta play on Chainlink’s future adoption in traditional finance systems. Bluefin (BLUE) The fourth altcoin was Bluefin. It’s a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain. It works a lot like Hyperliquid, which is another popular DEX for trading futures and spot tokens. But while Hyperliquid has its own chain, Bluefin runs on Sui. This makes it faster and gives it some different benefits. Since it launched, it has done over $65 billion in trading volume. It recently added a spot trading option too. What’s interesting is that today, a competitor called Cetus got hacked, and all its liquidity was locked. Because of that, Bluefin’s token price jumped 25% as traders moved over. Worldcoin (WLD) The fifth altcoin mentioned was Worldcoin, created by Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI. It’s a crypto project that uses eye scans to confirm people’s identities, which raised a lot of privacy concerns at first.

It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Big Bets In Tech According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies.

It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. Treasury Holdings And US Debt According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Plans For A New Stablecoin Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip?

Regulatory Headwinds Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors.

Pi Coin ( PI ) is trading at $0.7504 at press time, up just 0.2% over the last day. In the past seven days, the token has fluctuated between $0.7406 and $0.8586, and it is still 74% below its peak of $2.99 in February. Despite recent price stagnation, trading volume has increased. Over the past 24 hours, Pi Network has recorded over $145 million in volume, up 16.2% from the previous day, indicating renewed but cautious interest among market participants. Yet the focus remains on a wave of upcoming token unlocks. On May 26, 10 million PI were released, followed by 12 million on May 27, as per Pi Scan data . The largest near-term unlock is set for May 28, when 15 million tokens will enter circulation, marking the biggest single-day release in the current 30-day window. You might also like: Pi Network price could miss out on the crypto bull run as insiders sell Looking ahead, another 263 million tokens will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. On-chain data indicates that more holders are moving their tokens to centralized exchanges, which raises the possibility of more sell-side pressure at a time when unlocks seem to be increasing supply. Still, Pi Network is attempting to build long-term value. The recently launched $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund is designed to support AI, gaming, fintech, and e-commerce startups, creating potential real-world use cases for the token. Successful decentralized application launches and broader adoption could help revive buying interest over time. From a technical standpoint, Pi is trading in a narrow Bollinger Band range, with the lower band at $0.53 and the upper band at $1.15. Although the direction is still unknown, the price’s mid-range position suggests low volatility and a coiled setup, which frequently precedes a breakout. PI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Momentum indicators are largely neutral. The relative strength index, which is at 48.36, indicates a lack of clear direction, while the stochastic RSI, which is at 18.16, indicates short-term oversold conditions. The MACD has shown bearish momentum by crossing below its signal line at 0.0047. The majority of short- and medium-term moving averages are above the current price and continue to act as resistance. Strong volume and a breakout above $0.85 might pave the way for a move to $1.00 and possibly $1.15. In a bearish scenario, if the $0.74–$0.75 range is not held, Pi may return to the psychological level of $0.70, with additional risk reaching $0.65 or even the lower Bollinger Band at $0.53. If there is consistent selling pressure, the massive supply overhang from impending unlocks could accelerate this decline.

ETF Approval Odds Now at 71% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano has been trading in a tight range this week, but a breakout could follow soon. With the SEC’s big ETF decision set for tomorrow, traders are hopeful that this could spark a bullish move for ADA. The odds of an ADA ETF approval have surged to 71% on Tuesday on Polymarket , the highest since April 20. This comes ahead of a key May 29 deadline for the SEC to decide on Grayscale’s proposed Cardano ETF. Grayscale's Cardano $ADA ETF deadline for decision is this week. The SEC must approve, deny, or delay it by this Thursday, May 29. Do you think it'll get approval this week? pic.twitter.com/84o9lyLksJ — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) May 26, 2025 The SEC has up to 240 days to review Grayscale’s spot ADA ETF filing, with the final deadline set for October 22. According to the official acknowledgement on February 24, it can delay its decision multiple times. So, a delay could be more likely instead of rejection or approval. ADA Holds Steady, ETF Optimism Peaks at 71% In mid-April, the chances of approval before the end of 2025 were only 37% on Polymarket. But the odds now over 70% show that traders are optimistic even after the SEC delayed XRP ETFs recently. Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst at Bloomberg, says there’s a 75% chance the ETF will launch this year. He also thinks the SEC might approve several crypto ETFs as soon as this summer. XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are also in the ETF spotlight, with multiple spot filings in play. Polymarket shows strong odds for approvals before 2025 – 84% for XRP, 83% for SOL, and 67% for DOGE. Cardano’s Ecosystem Trails A key hurdle Cardano is facing is its ecosystem underperformance. The network currently supports only 48 DeFi apps, holds $443 million in total value locked, and has only $31 million in stablecoins. However, newer chains like Unichain and Sonic are outpacing Cardano by a wide margin. Technicals Signal Bullish Setup for ADA Cardano’s technicals are bullish as the weekly chart is flashing bullish signals. It continues to trade above the 100-week moving average, a key long-term support level. If the momentum holds, it could retest last year’s high of $1.207. If it breaks out above that level, then $2 may be next. It is currently trading at $0.7524. RSI is neutral at 51, but MACD and momentum indicators are slightly bearish, which shows short-term weakness. But long-term trends 30-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs remain bullish with strong long-term support. The decision tomorrow could be a major catalyst for ADA’s next move. An approval from the SEC could open the door to institutional money and send ADA soaring past $0.84, kicking off a fresh rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 04:13:40

Unlike in past market cycles, long-term holders are not in a hurry to sell. On-chain data reveals a notable lack of aggressive selling despite substantial profit potential, indicating strong conviction among long-term investors and little structural drag on the uptrend. Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts stated in a May 28 X post that the LTH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator is one of the most obvious indicators of this resilience. Although this metric peaked at 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in early 2024, it is currently only at 2.1. While MVRV and NUPL measure the potential for profit-taking, LTH-SOPR captures when that potential is realized—when long-term holders actually move coins to lock in gains or cut losses. At previous tops, the signal has been clear: LTH-SOPR hit 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in… pic.twitter.com/KM5ENDNHa6 — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) May 28, 2025 This shows that LTHs are realizing fewer profits than they did during previous bull runs, even with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent surge. Although there will inevitably be some re-distribution in response to rising prices, Coutts stressed that the current muted activity indicates long-term confidence is still strong.

Accumulation patterns can be seen in almost every wallet type. Alongside larger cohorts such as those with 100–1,000 BTC and 1,000–10,000 BTC, wallets with less than 1 BTC have also returned to accumulation mode. The only group that still exhibits net selling behavior is the 1–10 BTC group. Further, profit-taking during Bitcoin’s latest breakout has been surprisingly restrained. Glassnode noted that when BTC surpassed $100,000 last December, realized profit volumes exceeded $2.1 billion. In contrast, the most recent rally to a new high saw just $1 billion in realized profits, despite higher prices. When $BTC hit all-time high yesterday, total profit-taking volume was around $1.00B – less than half the amount realized when #Bitcoin first crossed $100K last December, which hit $2.10B. Despite a higher price, profit realization was far more muted. pic.twitter.com/GtZXU23yO9 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 22, 2025 Additionally, coin age data demonstrates that older coins are still mostly inactive. Just 13.4% of active supply is older than six months as of May 2025, down from 24.7% in December 2024. This decline indicates that while newer participants provide short-term momentum, older holders are likely sitting tight. The bullish outlook is supported by institutional interest. Over $5.3 billion has been invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs in the last month, as per SoSoValue data , and U.S.-listed funds currently oversee over $40 billion in total assets. Meanwhile, corporate accumulation keeps growing. Last week, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) increased its holdings to 576,230 BTC by purchasing an additional 7,390 BTC. The Japanese company Metaplanet has also boosted its holdings to more than 7, 000 BTC. Over 30,000 BTC is now being acquired each month by public companies collectively.

Overview Singapore, 28 May , 2025 – The global macroeconomic environment is undergoing profound adjustments, and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin price fluctuations, is increasingly affected by the complex influences of macro liquidity, market risk appetite, major policy trends, and investment strategy choices. In terms of liquidity, abundant funds often boost the prices of assets such as Bitcoin, while the opposite creates suppression. At the same time, given Bitcoin’s current high volatility and its periodic linkage with traditional risk assets (such as US stocks), the overall risk appetite of the market is also a key driver of its price performance. In addition, government fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies, as well as investment strategy choices for stablecoins and other crypto assets, are increasingly becoming important variables affecting market direction. This report will focus on four core dimensions: liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, to deeply analyze the key variables affecting the Bitcoin market in the current macro background, including the evolution of rate cut expectations, the continuation of Quantitative Tightening (QT), the dynamics of the US Treasury General Account (TGA), the monetary policy shifts of major economies such as Japan, as well as factors such as geopolitics, tax reduction policies, regulatory policies, institutional entry and stablecoin financial management, striving to provide investors with a clear outlook on the future market trend of Bitcoin through detailed data support and rigorous logical deduction. 2. Liquidity Analysis: Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, QT Continuing, TGA Reflowing in June, Yen Expected to Raise Rates, US Dollar Liquidity May Continue to Tighten in the Near Term 2.1 Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, Focus on Data and Tariffs Previously, the market had significant expectations for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. However, recent macroeconomic data and policy signals have led to a substantial adjustment of these expectations.. In mid-May 2025, following the release of US CPI data and an easing of US-China tariff, market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year have cooled. The prevailing sentiment now anticipates two rate cuts this year (September, December), a more cautious outlook compared to the previous expectation of three cuts, with the first in July. The core driving force for this change lies in Fed Chairman Powell’s firm stance, the continued strong performance of the job market, and ongoing concerns about the future inflation path, particularly potential tariff impacts . 2.1.1 Powell’s Stance: Adhering to “Data-Dependent”, Refusing to Pay for Tariffs Fed Chairman Powell has consistently emphasized a “data-dependent” policy stance in multiple public speeches, explicitly refusing to accommodate external pressures, such as those related to tariff policies. This means that any decision on rate cuts must be based on solid economic data. Key indicators include sustained progress towards the 2% inflation target and a significant cooling of the job market. This “Data-dependent” approach also aligns with Powell’s professional considerations. Powell’s term will end in May 2026, a premature rate cut without clear economic data support, followed by uncontrolled inflation, would directly signify a policy failure on his part. Conversely, if the U.S. economy were to enter a recession during his tenure, necessitating rapid rate cuts, such a downturn could be attributed to broader policy impacts. Consequently, Powell is inclined to await more definitive economic signals before implementing rate cuts, thereby mitigating unnecessary policy risks.. In addition, Powell’s refusal to “pay for tariffs” signifies an unwillingness to implicitly endorse policies that introduce market uncertainty by cutting rates to offset tariff-induced shocks. However, Powell has also indicated in past speeches that the Federal Reserve would intervene if market volatility threatened the stability of the financial system. Therefore, Powell is likely to prioritize clear data support for inflation and employment before initiating any rate cuts, potentially disregarding political pressures. These two core economic indicators remain central to future rate cut decisions. . 2.1.2 Job Market: Strong Performance Supports High Interest Rates The continued strength of the US job market is a pivotal factor supporting the Fed’s decision to maintain the current elevated interest rate environment. Current US economic data underscores this resilience., In April 2025, non-farm payrolls increased by 177,000, significantly exceeding the anticipated 130,000, while the unemployment rate stood at a robust 4.2%. Multiple indicators suggest this strong employment trend is likely to persist. In terms of tariff conflicts , the unexpected easing of US-China tariff conflicts is proving beneficial for US export industries targeting the Chinese market, which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on US economic growth and the job market. Furthermore, potential tariff revenue could alleviate fiscal pressure, indirectly support government spending and contribute to overall economic health. In terms of corporate performance , First-quarter reports from US listed companies reveal strong results, with 73% of S&P 500 index constituents reporting earnings that surpassed expectations This positive corporate performance bodes well for employment and investment. In terms of employment , recent data is strong, reinforcing the expectation that the economy will not be weak in the short term, and the unemployment rate is unlikely to break the key threshold of 4.5% in the short term. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, the Fed has ample justification to maintain high interest rates to combat inflation. However, it is important to note that some data suggests a nascent trend of deterioration in the US job market, requiring ongoing observation. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, such as a surge in the unemployment rate or new job additions consistently falling significantly below expectations or even turning negative, the Fed will retain greater policy flexibility. This allows the Fed to prioritize inflation control without the immediate need to stimulate the economy through rate cuts. A strong job market means continued support for wage growth, which could exert persistent upward pressure on service inflation, thereby complicating the overall trajectory of inflation decline. 2.1.3 Inflation Outlook: CPI Year-on-Year Temporarily Creates New Low, Tariff Shock May Appear in the Third Quarter While the US CPI in April 2025 fell to 2.3% year-on-year, marking its lowest level since February 2021, this trend has, to some extent, assuaged immediate market anxieties about a resurgence in inflation and initially boosted rate cut expectations.. However, judgment on the future inflation outlook still needs to be cautious. The risk point currently highly concerned by the market is the potential impact of US-China tariff policies. Even with recent easing in US-China tariff conflicts, some imported goods still face high tariffs, with costs mostly borne by consumers. Goods subject to tariffs of over 30% entering the US in the coming months may trigger a one-time inflation shock. Internal research by the Fed also supports the view that tariffs may cause a one-time shock to inflation. Nationwide economist Ayres predicts that the summer CPI year-on-year may return to above 3%. This potential upward risk of inflation driven by tariffs will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the Fed’s rate cut decisions and may further delay the timing of rate cuts. Summary In summary, despite the recent slight improvement in CPI data, Fed Chairman Powell’s cautious “data-dependent” stance, the continued strong job market, and concerns about future (especially third quarter) inflation shocks that may be triggered by tariffs have collectively led to a significant cooling of market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year. In the short term, market liquidity expectations are thus suppressed, and the upside for risk assets such as Bitcoin may be limited. 2.2 The Fed’s “Balance Sheet Reduction” is Ongoing, TGA Will Reflow in June, Liquidity May Contract Periodically. If Debt Ceiling Agreement is Reached in August, TGA May Extract Liquidity in the Short Term In addition to expected changes in interest rate policy, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction plan (i.e., Quantitative Tightening, QT) and its interaction with the Treasury’s TGA account are also key variables affecting market liquidity. Since June 2022, the Fed has actively engaged in reducing its massive balance sheet, aiming to withdraw excess liquidity from the market. The official policy path still tends to end this round of balance sheet reduction in the second half of 2025. Looking at SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), an indicator reflecting the degree of funding tightness within the US federal funds market, SOFR has demonstrated relative stability recently, at most reaching the level of IORB (Interest on Reserve Balances), with limited market funding tightness. If subsequent volatility expands, it will need to be closely monitored. Looking at the ratio of Fed depository institution reserves to commercial bank total assets, it is still above 13%, in a state where liquidity is not tight. Based on past experience, when this ratio is less than 10-12%, market interest rates will experience more obvious fluctuations, such as the brief liquidity crisis in the second half of 2019. In summary, this means that in the coming months, QT will continue and withdraw liquidity from the market, although its marginal impact may weaken as the balance sheet reduction approaches its end. A more direct impact onliquidity shock may come from the dynamics of the US Treasury’s TGA account. The TGA represents the Treasury’s deposit account at the Fed, and changes in its balance directly affect the level of reserves in the banking system, thereby affecting market liquidity. When the TGA balance increases, it means that the Treasury absorbs funds from the market and deposits them into the Fed, leading to a decrease in bank reserves and tightening liquidity; conversely, when the TGA balance decreases, it releases liquidity. Currently, the TGA account is experiencing continuously outflows,thereby supplementing market liquidity, but it is expected that in June 2025, with the seasonality of tax revenue, the TGA account balance may see a significant rebound, which will create periodic contraction pressure on short-term market liquidity. In addition, the US debt ceiling issue is another important uncertainty factor. According to the latest forecast by the Bipartisan Policy Center, if Congress fails to suspend or raise the debt ceiling in time, the so-called “X-date” (the day when federal government funds are exhausted) may come between August and early October 2025.) The US Treasury Secretary has also warned that the “X-date” may come in August. Historically, debt ceiling issues are often resolved at the last minute, but the game process before that brings uncertainty to the market. Once the debt ceiling issue is resolved, for example in August, the Treasury typically quickly replenishes the previously consumed TGA account funds through large-scale bond issuance. This will lead to a rapid increase in the TGA balance in the short term, thereby extracting a large amount of liquidity from the market, impacting the financial market, especially the short-term interest rate market. Therefore, considering all factors, the Fed’s continued balance sheet reduction operations, coupled with the seasonal reflux of the TGA account in June, and the rapid replenishment of the TGA account after the debt ceiling issue is resolved in August, are all likely to exert periodic tightening pressure on US dollar liquidity in the coming months. 2.3 Yen Rate Hike Expectations Heating Up, Carry Trade Further Contracting Among major central banks, the continued policy shift of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is another factor that may have a profound impact on global and US dollar liquidity. For a long time, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, making the yen one of the main funding currencies for global carry trades. This dynamic involves investors borrowing low-cost yen to invest in higher-yielding assets in other countries, thereby objectively injecting liquidity into the global market. However, with the gradual emergence of inflation pressure in Japan and the improvement of economic prospects, the Bank of Japan has begun to continuously adjust its monetary policy stance. The Bank of Japan has already raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on January 24, 2025, while also raising its expected increase in core CPI for fiscal year 2025 from 1.9% to 2.4%, showing that its judgment on the persistence of inflation has strengthened. The market generally expects that the Bank of Japan may continue its pace of rate hikes in 2025. The continued rate hikes by the Bank of Japan may affect global and US dollar liquidity through the following paths: Narrowing the US-Japan interest rate differential, suppressing carry trades: The Bank of Japan’s rate hikes will directly push up yen financing costs, narrowing the interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies (especially the US). When the US-Japan interest rate differential narrows to a certain extent, the attractiveness of yen carry trades will significantly decrease, possibly leading to some carry trades being unwound, i.e., selling overseas assets to exchange back to yen to repay loans. This process is equivalent to withdrawing liquidity from the global market (including the US dollar market). Enhanced attractiveness of yen assets, funds flowing back to Japan: As Japan’s interest rate levels rise and its economic outlook improves, domestic Japanese assets, such as yen-denominated bonds and stocks, may become more attractive to international investors, possibly attracting some funds that were previously invested overseas (including US dollar assets) to flow back to Japan, which will also have a certain siphoning effect on global US dollar liquidity. Changes in market expectations and risk aversion sentiment: The continued normalization of the Bank of Japan’s policy may change the market’s expectation of a long-term continuation of the global low interest rate environment. In specific market conditions, if the yen strengthens due to rate hikes, it may also attract some funds to flow in during times of heightened risk aversion, indirectly affecting the liquidity allocation of other markets. Although the Fed’s future rate cut pace will also affect the dynamics of the US-Japan interest rate differential, the Bank of Japan’s gradual exit from ultra-loose policy and entry into a rate hike channel is undoubtedly an important variable in the global liquidity landscape. Its continued tightening actions, especially in the context of the Fed not yet significantly easing, may put further pressure on global, especially US dollar, liquidity supply. 2.4 Market Liquidity Summary and Forecast: Short-term Tightening, Mid-term Gradual Improvement with Variables 2.4.1 Short-term (next 1-3 months) liquidity outlook: Tight Continued impact of Fed policy: Before inflation data shows persistent and convincing decline and the job market shows significant cooling, the Fed will most likely maintain the current interest rate level unchanged, with rate cut expectations continuing to be pushed back. At the same time, Quantitative Tightening (QT) is still proceeding as planned, continuously withdrawing liquidity from the market. Seasonal and policy shocks of the TGA account: In June 2025, the TGA account may see a seasonal rebound due to factors such as tax inflows, causing short-term liquidity withdrawal. More importantly, if the US debt ceiling issue is resolved around August, the Treasury’s large-scale debt issuance to quickly replenish the TGA account will significantly tighten market liquidity, possibly causing volatility in the short-term interest rate market. Spillover effects of Bank of Japan tightening: If the Bank of Japan continues its rate hike trajectory, it will further narrow the US-Japan interest rate differential, possibly prompting some yen carry trades to unwind, reducing the supply of yen liquidity to the global market, indirectly creating a tightening effect on US dollar liquidity. Market performance expectations: Under the combined effect of the above factors, overall market liquidity is expected to maintain a tight stance in the short term, and may even experience periodic liquidity tension. For risk assets such as Bitcoin, this means that upside may face greater resistance, and market volatility may intensify. 2.4.2 Mid-term (next 3-12 months) liquidity outlook: Gradual improvement but with significant variables Fed policy shift’s gradual nature: The market generally expects the Fed to initiate a rate cut cycle in the second half or end of 2025, and end QT in the second half of 2025. If this expectation materializes, it will bring substantial marginal improvement to market liquidity. However, the magnitude and pace of rate cuts will be highly dependent on economic data (inflation, employment) at that time, with significant uncertainty. If inflation is stubborn or the economy is unexpectedly strong, the timing of rate cuts may be further delayed, and the extent of improvement will also be limited. Manifestation and digestion of tariff impact: If the inflation shock brought by US-China tariffs appears as expected in the third quarter and is gradually absorbed by the market, without triggering uncontrolled inflation expectations, then in the context of subsequent inflation data decline, the Fed’s policy space may reopen. But if the tariff shock exceeds expectations, it may extend the duration of high interest rates and tightening policies. Synchronicity of global central bank policies: Looking at the mid-term, if inflation in major economies is effectively controlled, central bank policies may gradually shift towards easing, forming a synergistic effect that collectively enhances the global liquidity environment. But if the recovery pace of major economies is uneven, policy divergence may intensify, making the path of global liquidity improvement more tortuous. Potential impact of “black swan” events: Escalation of geopolitical conflicts, unexpected financial risks in major economies, and other unforeseen “black swan” events may all have a significant impact on mid-term liquidity expectations. Market performance expectations: Looking to the mid-term, market liquidity is expected to gradually transition from the current tight state to marginal improvement, but the improvement process may be gradual and full of twists and turns. Risk assets such as Bitcoin may gain breathing and rebound opportunities during windows of improved liquidity expectations, but sustained upward movement still requires clearer signals of liquidity easing and fundamental support. Investors need to closely monitor the evolution of various macroeconomic data and policy signals, and flexibly adjust expectations. In summary, for the immediate future, the overall market liquidity environment remains unoptimistic, with short-term tight pressure being relatively certain, while mid-term improvement expectations exist, both the path and magnitude of this improvement are subject to considerable uncertainty. For the Bitcoin market, which is highly dependent on liquidity, this means a need to more cautiously assess risks and be fully prepared for market volatility. 3. Risk Appetite Analysis: Short-term Boost, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists Market risk appetite is another core driver affecting the prices of risk assets such as Bitcoin. Recently, a series of events have had complex effects on market sentiment, overall showing a pattern of short-term boost but significant mid-term uncertainty still existing. 3.1 Tariffs Better Than Expected in Short Term, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists The US-China tariff issue has consistently been a significant driver of global market sentiment, with any developments directly influencing investor risk appetite. In mid-May 2025, economic and trade talks between China and the US yielded an unexpected consensus on tariffs, with both sides agreeing to significantly reduce previously imposed high tariffs within the next 90 days. This breakthrough surpassed the expectations of many market analysts and has provided a clear boost to short-term market risk appetite.: Market sentiment quickly improved: After the news was announced, global capital markets reacted positively, with risk asset prices generally rising. Recession concerns eased: Previously, the market was concerned that escalating US-China trade frictions might lead the global economy into recession, or at least a “hard landing”. The easing of tariffs has reduced the probability of this extreme risk occurring. Corporate earnings expectations improved: High tariffs directly increase corporate operating costs and erode profitability. The reduction or suspension of tariffs helps improve the earnings outlook for companies in related industries, thereby boosting investor confidence in these companies’ stocks. However, although the easing of tariffs has brought positive effects in the short term, uncertainty still exists in the mid-term: Nature of the 90-day buffer period: The agreement reached has a 90-day buffer or suspension period. This means it is not a final solution, and both parties still need to negotiate further arrangements after 90 days. Should a more comprehensive, longer-term agreement is not reached by then, or if new friction points emerge, the tariff issue may escalate again, reversing the current optimistic sentiment. Structural contradictions still exist: Behind the US-China trade frictions are manifestations of deep-seated contradictions in economic structure, technological competition, geopolitics, and other aspects between the two countries. These structural contradictions are difficult to completely eliminate in the short term, which may lead to long-term and complex game-playing in the trade field. Therefore, while the tariff easing has indeed provided a significant short-term boost to market risk appetite, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin, investors must remain vigilant regarding the uncertainty beyond the 90-day buffer period and the enduring, complex nature of US-China trade frictions. Any future developments concerning tariffs will continue to be a crucial disruptive factor influencing overall market risk appetite. 3.2 Geopolitical Situation Still Unclear, But Shows Signs of Improvement (Russia-Ukraine Conflict May End, India-Pakistan Conflict Temporary Ceasefire) Geopolitical risk is an important factor affecting global market risk appetite, and any escalation or easing of conflicts may trigger significant fluctuations in market sentiment. Recently, some positive signals have emerged in some major geopolitical conflict areas. Although the overall situation remains unclear, the marginal improvement helps repair short-term risk appetite. India-Pakistan conflict temporary ceasefire: The tensions between India and Pakistan that have attracted attention recently showed signs of easing in early May 2025. After a period of mutual accusations and escalating military actions, India and Pakistan have agreed to a temporary ceasefire under external mediation or their own considerations. Although this ceasefire is described by some media as a “fragile peace” and its durability remains to be seen, it undoubtedly alleviates the risk of a large-scale conflict erupting in the South Asian subcontinent in the short term. With the easing of international conflicts such as India-Pakistan, global risk aversion sentiment has receded somewhat, which is favorable for risk assets. Potential changes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for several years and has had a profound impact on global energy prices, supply chains, and the geopolitical landscape. Following his assumption of office, President Trump has actively sought to promote a ceasefire between the two sides, and Russia has also conveyed signals of openness to such a possibility.. If there are any signs of substantive ceasefire negotiations, softening of positions by major participants, or progress in external mediation, it could significantly boost global market risk appetite. Conversely, if the conflict escalates again or spills over, it will quickly suppress market sentiment. Dynamics of conflicts in other regions: In addition to the above hotspots, the situation in other potential conflict points around the world (such as the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, etc.) also needs attention. Any unexpected outbreak of conflict or escalation of tensions could rapidly change the landscape of global risk appetite. Overall, the recent temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict is a positive development, helping to cool market risk aversion sentiment in the short term. However, the overall uncertainty of the global geopolitical situation remains high, the direction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still unclear, and other potential risk points still exist. Therefore, the impact of geopolitical factors on market risk appetite will be dynamic, and investors need to closely monitor relevant developments and be alert to any events that may cause sudden changes in market sentiment. 3.3 International Institutional Entry: Deploying Cryptocurrencies or Holding Bitcoin-Listed Companies The increasing participation of institutional investors serves as a crucial indicator of an asset class’s maturity and overall market confidence. In recent years, despite the dramatic fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, international institutions’ interest in and deployment of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has not stopped, but rather shows a trend of continuous deepening and diversification. This trend provides a positive support for market risk appetite in the medium to long term. Continued growth in the scale of listed companies holding Bitcoin: An increasing number of publicly traded companies are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves or making direct investments in the cryptocurrency. According to Bitwise data, in the first quarter of 2025, the total amount of Bitcoin held by globally publicly traded companies exceeded 688,000, with a quarter-on-quarter growth of 16.11%, accounting for 3.28% of the total Bitcoin supply. CoinEdition points out that listed companies have purchased more than 196,000 Bitcoin so far in 2025, exceeding the new Bitcoin supply mined during the same period, reflecting the growing demand for corporate inflation hedging and strategic reserves. MicroStrategy and Tesla are typical representatives. The Bitcoin holding behavior of these listed companies not only directly increases the demand for Bitcoin, but also conveys to the market the institutional recognition of Bitcoin’s long-term value, thereby boosting overall market confidence. Potential interest from sovereign funds and pension funds: Although currently disclosed information is limited, market speculation suggests that some sovereign wealth funds and large pension funds are actively researching or making small-scale allocations to crypto assets. If more such large long-term investors enter the market in the future, it will have a more profound impact on the Bitcoin market. In summary, in the short term, market risk appetite has been boosted by tariff easing, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation, and continued institutional entry, but in the mid-term, many uncertainty factors still exist, and market sentiment may still fluctuate with the progress of key events. For high-volatility assets like Bitcoin, their price performance will be highly dependent on the direction of overall market risk appetite, while positive changes at the policy level are laying the foundation for structural improvement in its risk appetite. 3.4 Risk Appetite Level Summary and Outlook In the short term (next 1-3 months), market risk appetite has been significantly boosted by factors such as the 90-day easing agreement on US-China tariffs, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation such as the temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict, and continued international institutional entry into cryptocurrencies. This optimistic sentiment is expected to continue in the short term, providing support for risk assets such as Bitcoin. However, the market still needs to be vigilant about technical corrections after the previous positive news is digested, as well as emotional fluctuations brought by sudden news. Looking at the mid-term (next 3-12 months), market risk appetite faces greater uncertainty, but also has the potential for structural improvement. Key variables influencing mid-term risk appetite include the trajectory of US-China trade relations after the 90-day tariff buffer period concludes, the evolution of major geopolitical risks such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the growth prospects and policy paths of major global economies. If these factors all develop in a positive direction, market risk appetite is expected to continue to improve; otherwise, it may come under pressure again. Whether institutional funds can continue to flow into the crypto market on a large scale will also be an important indicator measuring mid-term market confidence. 4. Policy Game and Fiscal Trends: Tax Cuts, Regulation, and Strategic Reserves’ Multidimensional Impact Beyond liquidity and risk appetite, policy-level games and changes are increasingly becoming key variables affecting the crypto market. This chapter will deeply analyze the Trump administration’s tax reduction policy, the dynamics of cryptocurrency strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, the evolution of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the latest progress in innovative policies such as US stock tokenization, exploring the potential impact paths of these policy variables on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. 4.1 “Big Beautiful Tax Plan” Reappears: Stimulus and Deficit Coexist President Trump, who took office in early 2025, is actively promoting his signature “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, which will have a profound impact on macro liquidity and market risk appetite. In early May, the House Ways and Means Committee released part of the tax cut bill, with core content including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and raising the child tax credit cap. At the same time, Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution in April, authorizing a total tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years, including $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. This transcendent fiscal stimulus plan is described by the Trump administration as injecting “rocket fuel” into the economy, aimed at stimulating economic growth. However, such a large-scale tax cut plan, accompanied by the reality that spending cuts are difficult to implement, will inevitably expand the fiscal deficit and need to be accompanied by raising the debt ceiling. According to authoritative institution estimates, the permanent extension of the 2017 tax reform alone will add about $4.6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. The Trump administration has also proposed partially offsetting the cost of tax cuts by significantly increasing tariff revenue, but this strategy may have the side effects of suppressing trade activities and raising prices. Overall, this tax policy is biased towards easing in the short term, which is favorable for risk asset sentiment, but in the mid-term, concerns about fiscal sustainability will rise significantly. 4.2 Positive Signals of Crypto-Friendly Policies and Latest Progress in US Stock Tokenization Exploration Recently, the United States has shown some positive signals in cryptocurrency regulation and innovation, especially at the policy level and market practice level, providing new catalysts for the improvement of risk appetite. 4.2.1 Policy Environment Has Begun to Change and Legislative Attempts Are Being Made Although the comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US is still forming, some positive developments worth noting have emerged at the legislative level. The US Senate has made significant progress in stablecoin legislation. The much-anticipated “GENIUS Act” aims to provide a clear framework for stablecoin issuance and regulation. Reports as of mid-May 2025 indicate that related negotiations have reached consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, and a key Senate vote has already taken place around May 19, with the bill advancing. The core content of the bill includes Federal Reserve regulation for stablecoin issuers with assets exceeding $10 billion, while smaller institutions are regulated by state-level regulatory authorities, and requires all stablecoins to be 100% backed by high-quality liquid assets such as US dollar cash or short-term US Treasury bonds. Recent amendments also address strengthening rules for technology companies entering financial assets, enhancing consumer protection mechanisms, and reinforcing oversight of government officials’ related activities.. Although the House has previously passed a similar “STABLE Act”, and the Senate has once been hindered due to key Democratic senators withdrawing support, both parties are still actively promoting it. In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands has recently passed its regional stablecoin bill, allowing the issuance of the “Tinian Island Stablecoin” pegged to the US dollar. These legislative efforts, whether at the federal or local level, indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure observation or scattered enforcement actions towards providing clearer guidance and standardized development for the market, which is crucial for the long-term healthy development of the stablecoin market and the stability of overall crypto market risk appetite. In addition, discussions on digital asset market structure are also underway, aiming to balance innovation and investor protection. Although the process may be long and full of game-playing, these legislative efforts themselves indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure suppression to standardized development, which is crucial for the stability of long-term risk appetite. 4.2.2 US Stock Tokenization Exploration and Latest Progress US stock tokenization, that is, transforming traditional stocks into digital tokens (Security Token Offering, STO) through blockchain technology, is becoming a new emerging field of market attention. This innovation aims to improve the liquidity, accessibility, and trading efficiency of US stocks, reduce transaction costs, and may provide more convenient investment channels for global investors. According to the latest market dynamics, the exploration of US stock tokenization is accelerating: Regulatory attention and discussion: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown continued attention to tokenization. For example, the SEC’s Special Working Group on Crypto Assets held a roundtable on tokenization issues on May 12, 2025, to explore its potential regulatory framework and market impact. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw also delivered a keynote speech at the meeting, indicating that regulatory agencies are actively researching and evaluating this emerging field. Market participants’ active practice: Specific stock tokenization platforms are already emerging in the market. For example, MyStonks announced the launch of its on-chain US stock token market on May 10, 2025, and emphasized that its tokens are backed by 100% custodial assets, marking the gradual implementation of compliant US stock tokenization trading platforms. Entry of traditional financial institutions and infrastructure construction: Large traditional financial institutions have also begun to deploy in the tokenization field. JPMorgan announced at the Consensus conference in May 2025 that it has successfully completed settlement tests of tokenized US Treasury bonds on public blockchains in collaboration with Ondo Finance and Chainlink, and expressed a positive outlook for broader securities tokenization (including stocks). In addition, asset management company VanEck also announced on May 15, 2025, the launch of its tokenized US Treasury fund on multiple blockchain networks. Although these developments are not directly equivalent to US stock tokenization, they lay important infrastructure and practical experience for the overall asset tokenization, especially the on-chain circulation and settlement of securities assets, indicating that US stock tokenization may receive stronger technical and market support in the future. Growth expectations of market size: Industry research institutions have optimistic expectations for the market size of tokenized assets. For example, Markets Media’s report on May 14, 2025, cited research indicating that the tokenization scale of real-world assets (RWA) is expected to grow from about $0.6 trillion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion in 2030, with the tokenization of securities assets being an important component. Although US stock tokenization still faces challenges at the legal level (such as the issue of “equal rights for stocks and tokens”) and regulatory approval, its huge potential and the positive interaction between regulation and the market have attracted widespread attention from the industry. If regulatory policies can gradually become clear and support such innovation, the advancement of US stock tokenization will greatly expand the application scenarios of digital assets, and may attract more traditional financial institutions and investors to enter the crypto field, thereby significantly enhancing market risk appetite. Trend of incorporating crypto assets into traditional financial products: In addition to US stock tokenization, discussions on incorporating cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) into traditional financial products (such as the 401(k) retirement plans mentioned by Coinbase CEO) are also heating up. If such integration is achieved, it will bring considerable incremental funds and a broader investor base to the crypto market, which is a great boost to market confidence and risk appetite. 4.3 Latest Progress of US Federal and State Bitcoin Strategic Reserves New regulations on “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” at the US federal level: Recently, there have been some discussions and legislative attempts at the US federal level regarding the establishment of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which has profound significance for the positioning of Bitcoin and institutional acceptance. According to a presidential action released by the White House on March 6, 2025, it mentioned the initiative to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and US digital asset reserve, and pointed out that government Bitcoin deposited in the strategic Bitcoin reserve “shall not be sold and shall be maintained as a reserve asset of the United States”. Furthermore, relevant legislative proposals exist at the US Congressional level, such as the 2025 BITCOIN Act (S.954), which aims to formalize a strategic Bitcoin reserve and ensure transparent management of federal government Bitcoin holdings. These federal-level initiatives, even in their preliminary stages, significantly elevate Bitcoin’s status as a strategic asset, providing stronger policy expectations and legal endorsement for institutional investors to include it in their asset allocation strategies. US states have made uneven progress in incorporating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into reserve assets, but the overall trend is noteworthy. New Hampshire took the lead in early May 2025 by passing the landmark H.B. 302 bill, formally authorizing the establishment of a state-level strategic crypto reserve, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of state funds in digital assets including Bitcoin and precious metals, becoming the first state in the US to achieve such legislation. This breakthrough provides an important demonstration effect for other states. However, not all state attempts have been smooth sailing. For example, a similar bill in Arizona aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves was vetoed by the governor in May 2025. According to the latest statistics, about 26 states across the US are considering or have proposed legislative drafts related to Bitcoin reserves, but the final prospects of many bills remain unclear, and proposals in some states have also encountered resistance or been vetoed. Nevertheless, these positive explorations and legislative attempts at the state level, whether successful or not, reflect that the recognition of Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset is gradually deepening, and may pave the way for attracting more traditional institutional investors (such as pension funds, endowment funds, etc.) to pay attention to and allocate Bitcoin, although the process may be full of challenges. 4.4 Policy Game Summary and Outlook The current policy environment presents a complex and evolving dynamic, characterized by both positive catalysts and potential risk points. The Trump administration’s large-scale tax cut plan will boost market sentiment in the short term, but may cause liquidity fluctuations in the mid-term due to the expansion of the fiscal deficit; policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of the tax cut bill, the final establishment and implementation of regulations related to strategic Bitcoin reserves, the improvement of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the implementation of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization will be key variables affecting the structural changes in the crypto market. The outcomes of these policy deliberations will directly affect the direction of market liquidity and risk appetite, thereby having a profound impact on the price performance of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Investors need to grasp the structural opportunities brought by long-term institutionalization trends while paying attention to short-term policy fluctuations. 5. Stablecoin Financial Management Strategies and Yield Comparison in the Current Environment In the face of the current macro and regulatory environment, stable yield-generating stablecoin financial management strategies are favored by investors. In the high interest rate background, some USD stablecoin financial solutions can already provide yields comparable to or even exceeding traditional markets, while the risk is relatively controllable. The following will introduce several recently hot stablecoin financial management strategies in the market, including their annualized yields, risk characteristics, and will be supplemented with charts comparing the yields of different strategies, helping readers with different risk preferences to choose optimally. 5.1 Backpack Backpack Exchange provides a one-stop trading and financial management platform, and its USD lending model has attracted attention recently. Backpack increases lending rates to give lenders extra returns . Currently, lending USD on Backpack can earn about 4.94% APY total return, including the basic market interest rate and 3.8% additional incentives. This yield is not particularly high compared to other platforms, but it excels in simplicity and transparency (essentially lending USDC to margin traders to earn interest). Backpack is suitable for low-risk preference users to obtain a rate slightly higher than money market funds. 5.2 Resolv Resolv Labs’ USR stablecoin strategy is a true Delta-neutral yield model. It hedges price risk through position combinations, while generating returns from funding rates of futures perpetual contracts and other risk-free arbitrage opportunities, then separating the returns to RLP token holders, keeping USR stable at 1:1. The current comprehensive annualized yield of this strategy is about 15% , part of which comes from incentives from protocols such as Pendle. The USR pool on the Base chain on the Pendle platform shows about 17.0% APY (including Pendle reward contributions), while the USR yield on Ethereum is slightly lower at about 9.4%. Overall, Resolv USR is a high-yield stablecoin, but it should be noted that it is backed by complex derivative strategies and incentive tokens. 5.3 Aave + Pendle This refers to depositing funds into lending protocols such as Aave to earn basic interest (e.g., depositing USDC to get 4%), and then tokenizing future interest through Pendle for trading, to lock in higher fixed rates or mine Pendle incentives. Currently, products on the Pendle platform that lock in Aave/Compound interest rates, such as CUSDC, CUSDT pools, have annualized rates of around 11%. For example, Compound’s USD stablecoin yield token CUSDO in the Pendle pool has an APY of about 11.5%. This means that through Pendle, users have the opportunity to amplify Aave’s 4-5% interest rate to nearly double digits (part of the return comes from Pendle platform rewards). The advantage is that it is still based on the interest of top lending protocols, with high security; the disadvantage is that it requires accepting Pendle token floating rewards and a certain operational threshold. All things considered, this strategy can currently achieve ~10% annualized returns . 5.4 Falcon Finance Falcon has launched the USDf (sUSDf) synthetic stablecoin strategy. Its model is to stake various assets to mint USDf, and through protocol design, USDf holders earn high yields. According to reports, USDf staking can provide over 10% APY . Falcon has recently integrated with Pendle, incorporating sUSDf into Pendle pools, further increasing on-chain yield rates. The Falcon strategy offers tempting returns, but it should be noted that USDf is an emerging synthetic asset, and systemic risk and collateral quality need to be evaluated. 5.5 Coinshift csUSDL The csUSDL launched by Coinshift is an institutional-grade stablecoin yield token . It is based on USDL issued by Paxos (100% backed by short-term US Treasury bonds and cash), with on-chain lending interest from the Morpho protocol added on top. Users holding csUSDL can automatically increase their balance daily without the need for locking or staking. Since the underlying assets are T-Bills and Aave lending, csUSDL returns mainly come from US Treasury bond interest (currently about 5%) plus DeFi interest, with a current total APY of around 10% . Its advantages are high transparency, security (supported by regulated assets + smart contract audits), and liquidity supported through Curve and others. Its disadvantage is that the yield rate is not outstanding but still better than traditional bank interest rates. 6. Conclusion and Investment Outlook: Multidimensional Impact of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy and Investment Strategy Combining the four dimensions of liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, we make the following judgment on the Bitcoin market outlook: In the short term (next 1-3 months): The Bitcoin market may show a pattern of intensified volatility or even downward pressure. On one hand, the significantly tight liquidity expectation, especially the potential shock from the unwinding of yen carry trades, will limit its upside space; on the other hand, the improvement in risk appetite in the short term may provide some support, but it is difficult to completely offset the negative impact of tightening liquidity. The Trump administration’s tax cut policy, while boosting market sentiment in the short term, could introduce liquidity shocks in the third quarter due to potential US debt ceiling issues and the need for Treasury General Account (TGA) replenishment. The market may see a correction after consolidation at high levels, or experience violent fluctuations within a range. Investors need to closely monitor the release of various macroeconomic data, policy signals, and the latest developments in tariffs and geopolitical situations, operate flexibly, and pay high attention to risk control. In the mid-term (next 3-12 months): The direction of the Bitcoin market will be more uncertain, with both opportunities and challenges. If global liquidity can achieve marginal improvement as expected, and market risk appetite continues to warm up due to the positive resolution of various uncertainty factors (especially the positive implementation of regulatory policies and the deepening of institutional adoption), then Bitcoin is expected to usher in a new round of upward trend. Policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. However, if liquidity tightening exceeds expectations, or frequent risk events lead to a sharp rise in risk aversion sentiment, Bitcoin may also face significant correction pressure. Key points to watch: In the coming period, investors should focus on the following aspects: The Fed’s policy path: including interest rate decisions, the end point and method of QT, and public statements by Powell and other officials. US inflation and employment data: These are the core basis affecting Fed decisions. Subsequent progress of US-China tariff negotiations : The direction after the 90-day buffer period is crucial. Evolution of major global geopolitical risks : Especially the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India-Pakistan conflict, and Middle East situation. Changes in the US TGA account and debt ceiling issues : The potential impact on short-term liquidity cannot be ignored. Bank of Japan’s monetary policy and yen carry trade dynamics : Direct impact on global liquidity allocation and US dollar liquidity. Progress of global cryptocurrency regulatory policies : Especially legislative and enforcement dynamics in major markets such as the US, including the progress of regulations related to “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and the implementation of the stablecoin regulatory framework. Scale and continuity of institutional fund inflows into the crypto market : Especially data on Bitcoin spot ETFs and actual allocations of sovereign and state-level reserves. Specific implementation of Trump’s tax cut policy : Including its impact path on fiscal deficit, debt ceiling, and market liquidity. Development and innovation of the stablecoin market : Including clarification of the regulatory framework, evolution of yield products, and changes in institutional participation. In summary, the Bitcoin market in 2025 will trudge forward in the fog of macroeconomics and the game of multiple policies. Investors need to maintain a high degree of vigilance and flexibility, deeply research market fundamentals, rationally evaluate risks, and make prudent investment decisions. Finding certainty in uncertainty will be the key to investing in Bitcoin in the coming period. At the same time, stablecoin financial management strategies also provide investors with an effective way to obtain stable returns amid market volatility, which deserves appropriate weight in asset allocation.

In a statement posted on X on May 27, the foundation said the loan will cover funds that the hacker managed to bridge out of the Sui ( SUI ) network before validators froze their wallets. Cetus will combine the loan with its treasury assets to reimburse affected users in full, provided the community approves a separate on-chain vote to unlock the frozen funds. https://twitter.com/suinetwork/status/1927439620091834569?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Cetus echoed this sentiment in another statement, apologizing for the incident and asking the Sui community to support the recovery vote. “We are now in a position to fully cover the stolen assets currently off-chain,” the team said, “if the locked funds are recovered through the upcoming community vote.” On May 22, Cetus suffered a complex exploit targeting a flaw in its concentrated liquidity market maker contracts. The attacker exploited unchecked math operations in a third-party code library and manipulated prices using a flash swap. As a result, they were able to drain several pools by faking liquidity deposits and repeatedly withdrawing real tokens. You might also like: Cetus offers $5m reward for info on hacker The attacker managed to transfer a significant amount of the stolen assets to Ethereum ( ETH ), even though validators were able to freeze $162 million on-chain. These bridged funds are the focus of the current compensation plan. The hack caused the CETUS token to drop by 40% and is still 20% down in the past week. The total value locked on the Sui network also fell from $2.13 billion to $1.77 billion, as per DefiLlama data . Though the bug was in Cetus’ code and not Sui’s base infrastructure, the Sui Foundation acknowledged its role in supporting ecosystem-wide security. Alongside the loan, the foundation announced an additional $10 million commitment to fund audits, bug bounties, and formal verification tools. To encourage white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities before they are exploited, it also intends to broaden its bug bounty program to include high-value protocols like Cetus, which have over $50 million in TVL. While the quick action from validators helped prevent further damage, some in the community voiced concerns that freezing wallets undermines the decentralization ethos of blockchain. Others praised the swift response and transparent handling of the crisis. A detailed recovery plan from Cetus is expected soon. Compensation efforts are scheduled to begin regardless of the vote’s outcome, though full recovery depends on whether the community supports unfreezing the remaining funds.

The crypto asset has climbed over 10% in the past month, with its current price at $0.2748, reflecting a modest 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. While not grabbing headlines with dramatic surges, TRX’s steady growth aligns closely with the broader bullish cycle led by Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that it may benefit from macro-level investor sentiment. A recent analysis by Carmelo Alemán, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlights the increasing relevance of TRON in this market phase. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure Bitcoin Correlation Fuels Investor Optimism Alemán’s report, titled “The Crypto Elite Grows with Bitcoin and Why TRX Holds a Special Place,” explores how assets that demonstrate high correlation with Bitcoin, such as TRX, tend to mirror BTC’s market movements. This statistical connection, typically measured through correlation coefficients like Pearson’s, means that Bitcoin’s gains or retracements often influence similar movements in tokens like TRON. According to Alemán, the ongoing Bitcoin bull market, expected by some to last through Q4 2025, sets a favorable context for assets with strong historical correlation to BTC. Tokens, including TRX, SUI, ADA, XLM, HBAR, and Litecoin, are often observed to track Bitcoin’s behavior, rising during rallies and pulling back during corrections. For many investors, these assets present attractive opportunities given their lower market capitalizations compared to Bitcoin, making them capable of delivering larger percentage gains during bullish conditions. The analyst said: In practical terms, Bitcoin is unlikely to grow more than 2x from its current price, whereas highly correlated tokens could triple, quadruple, or more, simply because their smaller market caps make such expansions more feasible. In particular, Alemán draws attention to TRON’s upward momentum and growing network activity, especially in Asia. Notably, TRON recently surpassed Ethereum in the volume of USDT (Tether) issued on its network, signaling a shift in real-world utility and adoption. Alemán wrote: This is no small development: it reflects a restructuring in real network usage, and suggests that Tron could multiply significantly in value in the coming months, as it continues to move in tandem with Bitcoin’s trend. TRON Long-Term Growth Potential Beyond price action, Alemán also underscores TRON’s position in strategic portfolio planning. Because of its correlation with Bitcoin and its smaller relative size, TRON offers potential leverage to BTC’s market cycles. For long-term holders and tactical traders alike, this dynamic presents opportunities for outperformance during phases of sustained Bitcoin growth.

This day was distinguished by the 15th annual Bitcoin Pizza Day and high-profile events reinforcing crypto’s growing mainstream adoption. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $110,000 threshold, establishing a new all-time high. Concurrently, the highly anticipated TRUMP dinner occurred. Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX and the largest $TRUMP holder, officially attended. His prominent participation in this historic event once again brought crypto assets into the global spotlight. HTX DAO partnered with HTX to present a crypto extravaganza, featuring dual-city offline celebrations and millions of dollars in online incentives. This initiative commemorated Bitcoin’s remarkable 15-year journey of innovation while strengthening the bond between the platform and its community — uniting HTX’s global user base and showcasing crypto’s accelerating path toward mainstream adoption. Dual-City Events Honor 15th Bitcoin Pizza Day On Bitcoin Pizza Day, HTX DAO, in collaboration with community members and ecosystem partners, simultaneously hosted exclusive offline celebrations in Shenzhen and Beijing. These events paid tribute to Bitcoin’s pivotal 15th anniversary. Shenzhen’s “Interstellar Pizza Delivery Express” commenced with custom HTX DAO luxury cars traversing the city, delivering pizzas to users and recreating the iconic 2010 moment when “10,000 Bitcoin bought two pizzas.” In Beijing, an interactive “BTC Town” game was established, allowing users to engage with fundamental Bitcoin concepts through simulated “mining, hodling, and spending.” Participants also had opportunities to win limited-edition HTX DAO merchandise and special Dragon Boat Festival gift boxes by completing engaging tasks like photo check-ins. Furthermore, HTX & HTX DAO jointly spearheaded “Global 12-City” Pizza Day events across a diverse range of cities, including Chengdu, Xiangyang, and Wenzhou, as well as locations in Chinese Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. These events provided complimentary pizza to local users. This global series of Pizza Day activities, coinciding with Justin Sun’s attendance at the TRUMP dinner, symbolically connected Eastern community consensus with a historic convergence in Western mainstream politics. It served as a tribute to Bitcoin’s fifteen years of leading financial innovation, a collective declaration of crypto civilization’s move toward the mainstream, and a testament to HTX DAO and HTX’s steadfast commitment to driving Web3 global consensus. Online Extravaganza: Millions in USDT Rewards Ignite Community Enthusiasm HTX, in collaboration with diamond sponsors JUST Protocol, SunPump, APENFT, BitTorrent, WINkLink, and Steem, along with platinum sponsors Levva and ChainGPT, launched a themed online event titled “Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrate with Us on HTX.” The campaign spanned multiple business lines, including HTX Spot, HTX Futures, HTX P2P, HTX Earn, and HTX Community, distributing nearly $1 million USDT in rewards. The online events drew nearly 200,000 participants, while the “HTX Pizza Day Celebration: $200,000 Up for Grabs” alone attracted over 1 million users, distributing close to 200,000 USDT in rewards. The entire Pizza Day carnival not only boosted user engagement but also strengthened collaboration and resource integration between HTX and a wide range of Web3 projects. Inheriting the Crypto Spirit: Building a Global Web3 Future Fifteen years ago, the legendary tale of cryptocurrency began with the “10,000 BTC pizza order”. Today, the enduring significance of this event symbolizes the spirit of the entire Web3 era. Moving forward, HTX DAO and HTX will maintain a user-centric approach and global vision to nurture the Web3 ecosystem, continuously propelling the crypto industry toward stronger compliance and broader mainstream adoption.

In paperwork released by the US Office of Government Ethics on May 25, Brian Quintenz disclosed his key positions in crypto and market firms that would directly relate to the CFTC’s regulatory priorities and disclosed assets worth at least $3.4 million, according to a May 27 Bloomberg report. Quintenz was a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and is currently the global head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz , a position he said he will step down from if the Senate confirms him as CFTC chair. He holds an interest in three AH Capital Management investment funds, CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund, plus capital commitments to related general partners. He is also a board member of the prediction markets platform Kalshi and owns stock and unvested stock options in the firm, along with stock and vested stock options in the finance and lending brokerage Next Level Derivatives. His portfolio intersects directly with two major CFTC policy areas, crypto asset regulation and prediction markets. Kalashi settled a major legal battle with the CFTC over election betting earlier this month. Quintenz outlined the steps he will take to avoid conflicts of interest if confirmed as CFTC chairman in an agreement letter to John Einstman, the CFTC’s Designated Agency Ethics Official, dated May 21. “I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter,” he stated.

Source: US Office of Government Ethics He added that he will resign from all positions and divest conflicting assets within 90 days of confirmation. This includes recusing himself from a16z-related matters for two years, recusing from Kalashi matters for one year, and forfeiting unvested stock options at multiple companies. Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger Quintenz also said he would comply with standard conflict of interest laws and obtain ethics briefings, but will retain unpaid trustee positions for two family trusts.

CFTC commissioner exodus continues The CFTC has seen an exodus of commissioners recently amid concern over the Trump administration’s crypto embrace, with potentially all four remaining positions being up for grabs this year. On May 21, Democrat Commissioner Kristin Johnson announced that she plans to depart the agency later this year. Meanwhile, Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero previously said they would respectively step down on May 30 and May 31.

Despite Bitcoin’s impressive performance, a market analyst asserts that the bull cycle is still ongoing and that the asset is far from being “overheated.” Dan Crypto, a popular cryptocurrency analyst with over 600,000 followers on X, shared his outlook on the state of the Bitcoin market. According to the analyst, the funding rate, a key indicator designed to display market overheating, shows that although long bets have increased, it is incomparable to previous market tops. “By examining the proportion of bitcoins traded within 1 week to 1 month, we can assess short-term capital inflow and determine market overheating. Although Bitcoin’s price has reached an all-time high, short-term capital inflow is not as rapid as during past peaks.” He wrote in a post shared on CryptoQuant. He further observed that a handful of short-term holders have accumulated gains since the recent spike in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, a large profit-taking and prolonged correction season was followed in 2024. However, profit-taking at this time is significantly below levels seen in November 2024, the analyst remarked, adding that whale profit-taking is still very limited, despite Bitcoin successfully reaching a new all-time high. On another note, Bitcoin holdings in the spot ETF market have hit a new all-time high, per the analysts’ assertion. “The increased holdings by retail and institutional investors, especially in the US, significantly support the overall market uptrend.” He wrote.

He strongly emphasized the urgent need for identity-based security systems that can control what AI agents can access. In a recent interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, McKinnon emphasized that as AI agents transition from prototypes to production environments, they introduce novel cybersecurity challenges that organizations must urgently address. AI agents now work in real systems and must have safe, controlled access McKinnon told companies using AI agents in real business settings to treat the systems like coworkers. He explains that moving AI into “production” gives these agents real access to live systems that hold private customer information, internal files, and business data . This comes with big security risks that companies can’t afford to ignore. McKinnon warns that AI systems can now act independently and make unsupervised decisions that could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or accidental misuse of information. He advises that the only way to handle these risks safely is by using monitoring systems that check who or what is trying to access data. These systems only allow access if that individual or AI agent is trusted, verified, and has permission. McKinnon says that Okta’s identity management lets businesses manage, track, and control access for all types of users, including AI agents. Okta remains careful with its forecasts even after reporting strong earnings Okta reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter but didn’t raise its revenue forecast for upcoming quarters. Instead, Okta maintained a cautious and conservative outlook that dropped the company’s stock by more than 11% during after-hours trading. McKinnon said it is difficult to plan future growth with full confidence because of the unpredictable global economic climate. He said Okta’s leadership will stay grounded, plan carefully, and protect the company’s position rather than chase short-term goals too aggressively. This way, Okta will adjust when market conditions in industries where customer budgets and tech investment cycles keep shifting change. McKinnon also pointed out that investors may feel frustrated when companies like Okta don’t immediately speed up growth after reporting strong results. Todd said companies must avoid mistakes when building secure, scalable identity systems that work across human users and AI systems. Experts urge AI caution as Okta eyes secure future Artificial intelligence companies have been urged to replicate the safety calculations underpinning Robert Oppenheimer’s first nuclear test before releasing all-powerful systems. Max Tegmark, a leading voice in AI safety, said he had carried out calculations akin to the US physicist Arthur Compton before the Trinity test and had found a 90% probability that a highly advanced AI would pose an existential threat. McKinnon also explained that forcing growth too quickly will make it difficult for a company to support new customers properly. Still, he noted his excitement about where the company is headed and emphasized that patience and discipline keep a company strong. Okta is thinking beyond the next quarter and is preparing to lead in a future where AI and secure identity management will go hand in hand. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Research最新研报丨宏观新变局与比特币展望：流动性、风险偏好、政策博弈与投资策略深度透视,https://square.htx.com/https-square-htx-com-htx-research-zui-xin-yan-bao/,"1.概述 全球宏观经济环境正经历深刻调整，加密货币市场，特别是比特币的价格波动，日益受到宏观流动性、市场风险偏好、重大政策动向以及投资策略选择的复杂影响。在流动性层面，充裕的资金往往助推比特币等资产价格上行，反之则构成压制。同时，鉴于比特币当前的高波动性及其与传统风险资产（如美股）的阶段性联动，市场整体的风险偏好亦是其价格表现的关键驱动力。此外，各国政府的财政、货币与监管政策，以及稳定币等加密资产的投资策略选择，也日益成为影响市场走向的重要变量。 本报告由HTX Research撰写，聚焦流动性、风险偏好、政策博弈与投资策略四大核心维度，深入剖析当前宏观背景下影响比特币市场的关键变量，包括降息预期的演变、量化紧缩（QT）的持续、美国财政部一般账户（TGA）的动态、日本等主要经济体的货币政策转向，以及地缘政治、减税政策、监管政策、机构入场和稳定币理财等因素，力求通过详实的数据支撑和严谨的逻辑推演，为投资者提供对比特币未来市场走势的清晰展望。 当前全球政策宽松预期与市场风险偏好改善，为比特币及加密资产带来积极支撑。稳定币作为关键的流动性基础和价值锚，将持续增强市场的资金效率和抵御风险的能力。火币HTX近期上线了USD1、USDQ、EURQ、USDR、EURR等合规稳定币，紧扣宏观降息和监管透明化趋势，为用户提供更高效、安全的资金管理方式。 2.流动性分析：降息预期降温，QT持续，TGA六月回流、日元预期加息，美元流动性近期或持续收紧 2.1 降息预期降温，关注数据与关税 此前市场一度对美联储在2025年内多次降息抱有较高期望，但随着近期一系列宏观数据和政策信号的释放，这种预期已显著调整。2025年5月中旬，美国CPI数据公布及中美关税矛盾缓和后，市场对美联储年内降息预期降温，普遍预计年内降息两次（9月、12月），较此前三次（首次7月）更为谨慎。这一转变的核心驱动力在于美联储主席鲍威尔的坚定立场、持续强劲的就业市场表现以及对未来通胀路径（特别是关税潜在冲击）的担忧。 2.1.1 鲍威尔立场：坚守“数据先行”，拒绝为关税买单 美联储主席鲍威尔在多次公开讲话中强调了其 “数据先行” 的政策立场，拒绝为特朗普关税政策买单。这意味着，任何关于降息的决策都必须以确凿的经济数据为依据，特别是通货膨胀是否持续向2%的目标回归，以及就业市场是否出现显著降温。 “数据先行”符合鲍威尔对个人谋身的考虑。鲍威尔任期将于2026年5月结束。在任期内美国经济陷入衰退，美联储被迫快速降息以应对，这场衰退也可以归咎于特朗普的政策。然而，如果鲍威尔在经济数据未明确支持的情况下提前降息，而后续通胀因此失控，那么这将直接成为其政策失误的体现。因此，鲍威尔在降息决策上倾向于等待更确凿的经济信号，以避免承担不必要的政策风险。 此外，​​鲍威尔拒绝为关税买单。若为了抵消关税冲击而降息，相当于变相鼓励白宫制造更多政策不确定性。但鲍威尔此前讲话也暗示若市场动荡威胁金融系统稳定性，美联储仍会出手干预。 所以，鲍威尔或无视特朗普的施压，坚持看到明确数据支撑，才会启动降息。故降息的核心点，在于通胀和就业。 2.1.2 就业市场：强劲表现支撑高利率 持续强劲的美国就业市场是支撑美联储维持当前较高利率水平的关键因素之一。当前美国经济数据整体表现强劲，2025年4月新增非农17.7万（预期13.0万），失业率4.2%，显示就业韧性。目前从多个方面观测，就业或持续保持强劲。 关税冲突方面 ，中美关税矛盾的超预期缓和，利于美对华出口行业，无疑将对美国经济增长和就业市场产生积极影响。并且关税收入一定程度上能缓解财政压力，则可能间接支持政府支出，对经济亦有正面作用。 企业业绩方面 ，美股上市公司一季报业绩优异，标普500指数成分股中​​盈利超预期的公司占比为73%​​，印证经济韧性，利好就业与投资。 就业方面 ，近期数据强劲，强化经济短期不弱预期，失业率短期难破4.5%关键阈值。只要就业市场不急剧恶化，美联储有理由维持高利率抗通胀。但数据显示，美国就业市场有恶化的趋势，需要进一步观察。 只要就业市场不出现急剧恶化，例如失业率飙升或新增就业人数持续大幅低于预期甚至转负，美联储就拥有更大的政策空间来专注于控制通胀，而不必急于通过降息来刺激经济。强劲的就业市场意味着薪资增长仍有支撑，这可能对服务业通胀构成持续压力，从而使整体通胀回落的路径更为复杂。 2.1.3 通胀前景：CPI同比暂创新低，关税冲击恐在三季度显现 美国2025年4月CPI同比降至2.3%，为2021年2月以来的最低水平，趋势上也显现通胀退潮的现象。这在一定程度上缓解了市场对通胀再度加速的担忧，并一度提振了降息预期。 然而，对未来通胀前景的判断仍需谨慎。市场当前高度关注的风险点，即中美关税政策的潜在影响。即便中美关税冲突缓和，部分商品进口关税仍处高位，成本最终多由消费者承担。被加征30%以上的高关税商品在未来数月集中入美，或引发一次性通胀冲击。美联储内部的研究也支持了关于关税对通胀可能造成一次性冲击的看法，保险和金融公司Nationwide经济师艾耶斯预计夏季CPI同比或重回3%以上。这种由关税驱动的潜在通胀上行风险，无疑会增加美联储降息决策的复杂性，并可能进一步推迟降息的时点。 小结 综上所述，尽管近期CPI数据略有改善，但美联储主席鲍威尔“数据先行”的审慎立场、持续强劲的就业市场以及对未来（尤其是三季度）关税可能引发的通胀冲击的担忧，共同导致了市场对美联储年内降息预期的显著降温。短期内，市场流动性预期因此受到压制，比特币等风险资产的上行空间可能受限。 2.2 美联储的“缩表”进行时，TGA六月将回流，流动性或阶段性收缩。若八月债务上限达成，TGA或短期抽取流动性 除了利率政策的预期变化，美联储的资产负债表缩减计划（即量化紧缩，QT）及其与财政部TGA账户的互动，也是影响市场流动性的关键变量。自2022年6月起，美联储已开始缩减其庞大的资产负债表，旨在从市场中抽回过剩的流动性。官方政策路径目前仍倾向于在2025年下半年结束本轮缩表。 从体现美国联邦基金市场的资金紧缩程度的SOFR（担保隔夜融资利率）上看，SOFR近日相对稳定，至多达到IORB（准备金余额利率）的水平，市场资金紧张程度有限。若后续波动放大，则需重点关注。 从美联储存款机构准备金占商业银行总资产比例上看，目前仍高于13%，处于流动性未紧缩的状态。根据过往经验，当该比例小于 10 ~ 12%，市场利率便会出现较明显波动，如 2019 下半年曾短暂出现流动性危机。 综上，这意味着在未来几个月，QT仍将持续，并从市场中抽取流动性，尽管其边际影响可能随着缩表接近尾声而减弱。 更为直接的流动性冲击可能来自于美国财政部TGA账户的动态。TGA是财政部在美联储的存款账户，其余额的变动会直接影响银行系统的准备金水平，进而影响市场流动性。当TGA余额增加时，意味着财政部从市场中吸收资金存入美联储，导致银行准备金减少，流动性收紧；反之，当TGA余额减少时，则释放流动性。目前TGA账户在持续流出，补充市场流动性，但预计在2025年6月，随着税收收入的季节性，TGA账户余额可能出现显著回升，这将对短期市场流动性构成阶段性收缩压力。 此外，美国债务上限问题是另一个重要的不确定性因素。根据美国两党政策中心的最新预测，如果国会未能及时暂停或提高债务上限，所谓的 “X日” （即联邦政府资金耗尽之日）可能在2025年8月至10月初之间到来。美国财长也曾警告“X日”可能在8月来临。历史上，债务上限问题往往在最后时刻得到解决，但在此之前的博弈过程会给市场带来不确定性。一旦债务上限问题在例如8月份达成协议并解决，财政部通常会通过大规模发行债券来快速回补此前消耗的TGA账户资金。这将导致TGA余额在短期内迅速增加，从而从市场中抽取大量流动性，对金融市场尤其是短期利率市场造成冲击。 因此，综合来看，美联储持续的缩表操作，叠加6月份TGA账户的季节性回流，以及若8月份债务上限问题解决后TGA账户的快速回补，都可能在未来几个月对美元流动性造成阶段性的收紧压力。 2.3.日元加息预期升温，套息交易进一步收缩 在全球主要央行中，日本央行的政策持续转向是另一个可能对全球及美元流动性产生深远影响的因素。长期以来，日本央行维持超宽松货币政策，使得日元成为全球套息交易的主要融资货币之一。投资者借入低成本的日元，投资于收益率较高的其他国家资产，这在客观上向全球市场注入了流动性。然而，随着日本国内通胀压力的逐步显现和经济前景的改善，日本央行已开始持续调整其货币政策姿态。 日本央行在2025年1月24日已将政策利率从0.25%提升至0.5%，同时上调了对2025财年核心CPI的预期涨幅，从1.9%上调至2.4%，显示其对通胀持续性的判断有所增强。市场普遍预期，日本央行在2025年可能将延续其加息的步伐。日本央行持续加息将可能通过以下路径影响全球及美元流动性： 收窄美日利差，抑制套息交易 ：日本加息将直接推高日元融资成本，缩小日本与其他主要经济体（尤其是美国）的利差。当美日利差收窄到一定程度，日元套息交易的吸引力将显著下降，可能导致部分套息交易平仓，即卖出海外资产换回日元偿还贷款。这一过程相当于从全球市场（包括美元市场）抽回流动性。 日元资产吸引力提升，资金回流日本 ：随着日本利率水平的上升和经济前景的改善，日本国内资产（如日元债券、股票）对国际投资者的吸引力可能增强，可能吸引一部分原先投资于海外（包括美元资产）的资金回流日本本土，这也会对全球美元流动性造成一定的虹吸效应。 市场预期与避险情绪变化 ：日本央行政策的持续正常化，可能改变市场对全球低利率环境长期持续的预期。在特定市场环境下，如果日元因加息而走强，也可能在避险情绪升温时吸引部分资金流入，间接影响其他市场的流动性分配。 尽管美联储未来的降息步伐也会影响美日利差的动态，但日本央行逐步退出超宽松政策并进入加息通道，无疑是全球流动性版图中的一个重要变量。其持续的紧缩行动，尤其是在美联储尚未大幅宽松的背景下，恐将对全球特别是美元的流动性供给构成进一步的压力。 2.4.市场流动性总结与预判：短期偏紧，中期渐进改善存变数 综合以上对美联储降息预期降温、QT持续、TGA账户动态以及日本央行加息预期等多方面因素的分析，我们可以对当前及未来一段时间的市场流动性格局做出如下总结与预判： 2.4.1 短期（未来1-3个月）流动性展望：偏紧 美联储政策的持续影响 ：在通胀数据未出现持续且令人信服的回落以及就业市场未显著降温之前，美联储大概率将维持当前利率水平不变，降息预期持续后移。同时，量化紧缩（QT）仍在按计划进行，持续从市场抽取流动性。 TGA账户的季节性与政策性冲击 ：预计2025年6月份，TGA账户可能因税收流入等因素出现季节性回升，对流动性造成短期抽离。更为重要的是，若美国债务上限问题在8月份左右得到解决，财政部为快速回补TGA账户而进行的大规模发债，将显著收紧市场流动性，可能引发短期利率市场的波动。 日本央行紧缩的溢出效应 ：日本央行若继续其加息进程，将进一步收窄美日利差，可能促使部分日元套息交易平仓，减少全球市场的日元流动性供给，间接对美元流动性产生紧缩效应。 市场表现预期 ：在上述因素共同作用下，短期内整体市场流动性预计将维持偏紧态势，甚至可能出现阶段性的流动性紧张。这对比特币等风险资产而言，意味着上行可能面临较大阻力，市场波动性可能加剧。 2.4.2 中期（未来3-12个月）流动性展望：渐进改善但存在较大变数 美联储政策转向的渐进性 ：市场普遍预期美联储将在2025年下半年或年底启动降息周期，并在2025年下半年结束QT。若此预期兑现，将为市场流动性带来实质性的边际改善。然而，降息的幅度和节奏将高度依赖届时的经济数据（通胀、就业），存在较大不确定性。如果通胀顽固或经济意外强劲，降息时点可能进一步推迟，改善幅度也将受限。 关税影响的显现与消化 ：若中美关税带来的通胀冲击在三季度如期显现并被市场逐步消化，且未引发通胀预期的失控，那么在后续通胀数据回落的背景下，美联储的政策空间可能重新打开。但如果关税冲击超预期，则可能延长高利率和紧缩政策的持续时间。 全球央行政策的协同性 ：中期来看，若全球主要经济体通胀得到有效控制，各国央行政策可能逐步转向宽松，形成协同效应，共同改善全球流动性环境。但如果主要经济体复苏步伐不一，政策分化可能加剧，全球流动性改善的路径将更为曲折。 “黑天鹅”事件的潜在冲击 ：地缘政治冲突升级、主要经济体出现意外的金融风险等不可预见的“黑天鹅”事件，都可能对中期流动性预期产生重大影响。 市场表现预期 ：中期来看，市场流动性有望从当前的偏紧状态逐步向边际改善过渡，但改善的过程可能是渐进且充满波折的。比特币等风险资产可能在流动性预期改善的窗口期获得喘息和反弹机会，但持续性上涨仍需更明确的流动性宽松信号和基本面支撑。投资者需密切关注各项宏观数据和政策信号的演变，灵活调整预期。 总而言之，当前至未来一段时间，市场流动性环境整体不容乐观，短期偏紧的压力较为确定，中期虽有改善预期，但路径和幅度均存在较大不确定性。这对高度依赖流动性的比特币市场而言，意味着需要更加谨慎地评估风险，并对市场波动做好充分准备。 3. 风险偏好分析：短期提振，中期不确定性仍存 市场风险偏好是影响比特币等风险资产价格的另一核心驱动力。近期，一系列事件对市场情绪产生了复杂影响，整体呈现短期提振但中期不确定性依然显著的格局。 3.1. 关税短期超预期，中期不确定性仍存 中美关税问题一直是牵动全球市场神经的关键因素之一，其任何进展都会直接影响投资者的风险偏好。2025年5月中上旬，中美两国在经贸会谈中就关税问题达成了超预期的共识，同意在未来90天内大幅削减此前加征的高额关税。这一突破性进展，其积极程度超出了此前许多市场分析师的预期。这一轮中美关税的显著缓和，对短期市场风险偏好构成了明显的提振： 市场情绪迅速改善 ：消息公布后，全球资本市场反应积极，风险资产价格普遍上涨。 经济衰退担忧缓解 ：此前市场担心中美贸易摩擦升级可能导致全球经济陷入衰退，或至少是“硬着陆”。关税缓和降低了这种极端风险发生的概率。 企业盈利预期改善 ：高额关税直接增加了企业的运营成本，侵蚀了盈利能力。关税的削减或暂停，有助于改善相关行业企业的盈利前景，从而提振投资者对这些企业股票的信心。 然而，尽管短期内关税缓和带来了积极影响，但中期来看，不确定性依然存在： 90天缓冲期的本质 ：此次达成的协议具有90天的缓冲期或暂停期。这意味着这并非最终解决方案，双方在90天后仍需就后续安排进行谈判。如果届时未能达成进一步的、更长期的协议，或者出现新的摩擦点，关税问题仍有可能再度升级，从而逆转当前的乐观情绪。 结构性矛盾仍存 ：中美之间的贸易摩擦背后是两国经济结构、科技竞争、地缘政治等多方面深层次矛盾的体现。这些结构性矛盾难以在短期内完全消除，可能导致贸易领域的博弈长期化、复杂化。 因此，就关税问题而言，短期内市场的风险偏好确实得到了显著提振，比特币等风险资产也从中受益。但投资者仍需警惕90天缓冲期后的不确定性，以及中美贸易摩擦的长期性和复杂性。未来关税问题的任何风吹草动，仍将是影响市场风险偏好的重要扰动因素。 3.2. 地缘政治局势仍不明朗，但有向好迹象（俄乌冲突有望结束、印巴冲突暂时停火） 地缘政治风险是影响全球市场风险偏好的重要因素，任何冲突的升级或缓和都可能引发市场情绪的显著波动。近期，一些主要地缘冲突区域出现了一些积极信号，尽管整体局势仍不明朗，但边际上的改善有助于短期风险偏好的修复。 印巴冲突暂时停火 ：近期备受关注的印度与巴基斯坦之间的紧张局势在2025年5月上旬出现了缓和迹象。在经历了一段时间的相互指责和军事行动升级后，印巴双方在外部斡旋或自身考量下，已同意暂时停火。这一停火虽然被部分媒体形容为“脆弱的和平”，其能否持久尚待观察，但短期内无疑缓解了南亚次大陆爆发大规模冲突的风险。随着印巴等国际冲突缓和，全球避险情绪有所退潮，这对风险资产构成利好。 俄乌冲突的潜在变化 ：俄乌冲突已持续数年，对全球能源价格、供应链以及地缘政治格局产生了深远影响。特朗普上台后，一直有意促进双方停战，俄方也有接受的信号。如果出现任何实质性的停火谈判、主要参与方立场软化或外部调停取得进展的迹象，都可能显著提振全球市场的风险偏好。反之，若冲突再度升级或外溢，则会迅速打压市场情绪。 其他地区冲突的动态 ：除了上述热点地区，全球其他潜在冲突点（如中东地区、朝鲜半岛等）的局势也需要关注。任何意外的冲突爆发或紧张局势升级，都可能迅速改变全球风险偏好的格局。 总体而言，近期印巴冲突的暂时停火是一个积极的发展，有助于短期内市场避险情绪的降温。然而，全球地缘政治局势的整体不确定性依然较高，俄乌冲突的走向仍不明朗，其他潜在风险点也依然存在。因此，地缘政治因素对市场风险偏好的影响将是动态的，投资者需要密切关注相关进展，并警惕任何可能引发市场情绪突变的事件。 3.3. 国际机构入场：布局加密货币或持币上市公司 机构投资者的参与程度是衡量一个资产类别成熟度和市场信心的重要指标。近年来，尽管加密货币市场经历了剧烈波动，但国际机构对加密货币，特别是比特币的兴趣和布局并未停止，反而呈现出持续深化和多元化的趋势。这一趋势对市场风险偏好构成了中长期的积极支撑。 上市公司持币规模持续增长 ：越来越多的上市公司开始将比特币作为其库存储备资产的一部分，或直接投资于比特币。根据Bitwise的数据，2025年第一季度，全球公开交易公司持有的比特币总量已超过68.8万枚，季度环比增长16.11%，占比特币总供应量的3.28%。CoinEdition，指出2025年迄今上市公司已购买超过19.6万枚比特币，超过了同期新挖出的比特币供应量，这反映了企业对冲通胀和进行战略储备的需求日益增长。MicroStrategy和特斯拉是其中的典型代表。这些上市公司的持币行为，不仅直接增加了比特币的需求，更向市场传递了机构对比特币长期价值的认可，从而提振了整体市场信心。 主权基金和养老基金的潜在兴趣 ：尽管目前公开披露的信息有限，但市场一直有传言称部分主权财富基金和大型养老基金正在研究或小规模配置加密资产。如果未来有更多此类大型长期投资者入场，将对比特币市场产生更为深远的影响。 总而言之，短期内市场风险偏好因关税缓和、地缘局势边际改善以及机构持续入场而受到提振，但中期来看，诸多不确定性因素依然存在，市场情绪仍可能随关键事件的进展而波动。对于比特币这类高波动性资产，其价格表现将高度依赖于整体市场风险偏好的走向，而政策层面的积极变化正为其风险偏好的结构性改善奠定基础。 3.4.风险偏好层面总结与展望 短期内（未来1-3个月） ，市场风险偏好因中美关税达成90天缓和协议、印巴冲突暂时停火等地缘政治局势的边际改善、国际机构持续入场布局加密货币等因素而受到显著提振。这种乐观情绪有望在短期内持续，对比特币等风险资产构成支撑。然而，市场仍需警惕前期利好消化后的技术性回调，以及突发消息面带来的情绪波动。 中期来看（未来3-12个月） ，市场风险偏好面临较大的不确定性，但也存在结构性改善的潜力。90天关税缓冲期结束后的中美贸易关系走向、俄乌冲突等主要地缘政治风险的演变、全球主要经济体的增长前景与政策路径都将是影响中期风险偏好的关键变量。如果这些因素均向积极方向发展，市场风险偏好有望持续改善；反之，则可能再度承压。机构资金能否在新的政策框架下持续、大规模流入加密市场，以及新兴的代币化资产能否吸引增量资金，特别是美股代币化能否克服监管障碍并实现规模化发展，也将是衡量中期市场信心的重要风向标。 4. 政策博弈与财政动向：减税、监管与战略储备的多维影响 在流动性和风险偏好之外，政策层面的博弈与变化正日益成为影响加密市场的关键变量。本章将深入分析特朗普政府的减税政策、美国联邦及州级的加密货币战略储备动向、稳定币监管框架的演进以及美股代币化等创新政策的最新进展，探讨这些政策变量对比特币等加密资产的潜在影响路径。 4.1.”Big Beautiful Tax Plan”再现：刺激与赤字并存 2025年初就任的特朗普总统正积极推动其标志性的”巨大美丽税法”计划，这一大规模减税方案将对宏观流动性和市场风险偏好产生深远影响。5月上旬，众议院筹款委员会公布了部分减税法案文本，核心内容包括使2017年减税永久化、提高儿童税收抵免上限等。与此同时，参议院共和党人已在4月通过预算决议，授权未来10年内减税总额达$5万亿，其中新增减税$1.5万亿，同时将债务上限提高$5万亿。 这一跨越性的财政刺激方案被特朗普政府形容为向经济注入”火箭燃料”，旨在刺激经济增长。然而，如此大规模的减税计划伴随着支出削减难以落实的现实，势必将扩大财政赤字，并需要配合提高债务上限。据权威机构估算，仅2017年税改永久化一项，就将在未来10年内增添约$4.6万亿美元的国债规模。 特朗普政府同时提出通过大幅提高关税收入来部分抵消减税成本，但这一策略可能带来贸易活动抑制和物价上涨的副作用。总体而言，这一减税政策在短期内偏向宽松，有利于提振风险资产情绪，但中期来看，财政可持续性隐忧将明显上升。 4.2.加密友好政策的积极信号与美股代币化探索的最新进展 近期，美国在加密货币监管和创新方面展现出一些积极信号，特别是在政策层面和市场实践层面，为风险偏好的改善提供了新的催化剂。 4.2.1 政策环境已经开始转变并进行立法尝试 尽管美国对加密货币的全面监管框架仍在形成中，但立法层面出现了一些值得关注的积极动向。美国参议院在稳定币立法方面取得了显著进展。备受关注的《GENIUS Act》旨在为稳定币发行和监管提供清晰框架，据报道，截至2025年5月中旬，相关谈判已就约90%的条款达成共识，并计划在5月19日左右进行关键的参议院表决。该法案的核心内容包括对资产超过100亿美元的稳定币发行方由美联储进行监管，而规模较小的机构则由州一级监管机构负责，并要求所有稳定币必须得到美元现金或短期美国国债等高质量流动资产的100%支持。 最新的修正案还讨论了加强对科技公司涉足金融资产的规则、强化消费者保护机制以及加强对政府官员相关活动的监督等条款。尽管此前众议院已通过类似的《STABLE法案》，且参议院内部也曾因关键民主党议员撤回支持而一度受阻，但目前两党仍在积极推动。此外，北马里亚纳群岛近期也通过了其区域性的稳定币法案，允许发行与美元挂钩的稳定币。这些立法努力，无论是在联邦层面还是地方层面，都预示着监管正从纯粹的观望或零散的执法行动，向着为市场提供更明确指引和规范化发展的方向过渡，这对于稳定币市场的长期健康发展和整体加密市场风险偏好的稳定至关重要。 此外，关于数字资产市场结构的讨论也在进行中，旨在平衡创新与投资者保护。虽然过程可能漫长且充满博弈，但这些立法努力本身预示着监管正从纯粹的打压向规范化发展过渡，这对于长期风险偏好的稳定至关重要。 4.2.2 美股代币化的探索与最新进展 美股代币化，即将传统股票通过区块链技术转化为数字代币（Security Token Offering, STO），正成为市场关注的新兴领域。这一创新旨在提高美股的流动性、可访问性和交易效率，降低交易成本，并可能为全球投资者提供更便捷的投资渠道。根据最新市场动态，美股代币化的探索正在加速： 监管层面的关注与讨论 ：美国证券交易委员会（SEC）对代币化表现出持续关注。例如，SEC的加密资产特别工作组在2025年5月12日就代币化问题举行了圆桌会议，探讨其潜在的监管框架和市场影响，SEC委员Caroline Crenshaw也在会上发表了主题演讲，这表明监管机构正在积极研究和评估这一新兴领域。 市场参与者的积极实践 ：市场上已出现具体的股票代币化平台。例如，MyStonks于2025年5月10日宣布上线其链上美股代币市场，并强调其代币由100%的托管资产支持，这标志着合规的美股代币化交易平台正在逐步落地。 传统金融机构的入局与基础设施建设 ：大型传统金融机构也开始在代币化领域进行布局。摩根大通（JPMorgan）在2025年5月的Consensus大会上宣布，与Ondo Finance和Chainlink等合作，在公共区块链上成功完成了代币化美国国债的结算测试，并表示对更广泛的证券代币化（包括股票）抱有积极展望。此外，资产管理公司VanEck也在2025年5月15日宣布在多个区块链网络上推出其代币化的美国国债基金。这些进展虽然不直接等同于美股代币化，但为整体资产代币化，特别是证券类资产的链上流转和结算奠定了重要的基础设施和实践经验，预示着未来美股代币化可能获得更强的技术和市场支撑。 市场规模的增长预期 ：行业研究机构对代币化资产的市场规模抱有乐观预期。例如，Markets Media在2025年5月14日的报告中援引研究指出，现实世界资产（RWA）的代币化规模预计将从2025年的约0.6万亿美元增长至2030年的18.9万亿美元，其中证券类资产的代币化是重要组成部分。[新增内容结束] 尽管美股代币化在法律层面（如”股币同权”问题）和监管审批方面仍面临挑战，但其巨大的潜力以及监管和市场的积极互动，吸引了业界的广泛关注。若监管政策能逐步明朗并支持此类创新，美股代币化的推进将极大地拓展数字资产的应用场景，并可能吸引更多传统金融机构和投资者进入加密领域，从而显著提升市场风险偏好。 加密资产纳入传统金融产品的趋势 ：除了美股代币化，将加密货币（尤其是比特币）纳入传统金融产品（如Coinbase CEO提及的401(k)养老金计划）的讨论也在升温。若此类整合得以实现，将为加密市场带来可观的增量资金和更广泛的投资者基础，对市场信心和风险偏好是极大的提振。 4.3 美国联邦与州级比特币战略储备的最新进展 美国联邦层面的”战略比特币储备”新规动向：近期，美国联邦层面出现了一些关于建立”战略比特币储备”的讨论和立法尝试，这对比特币的定位和机构接受度具有深远意义。根据白宫在2025年3月6日发布的一项总统行动提及了建立战略比特币储备和美国数字资产储备的倡议，并指出存入战略比特币储备的政府比特币”不得出售，并应作为美国的储备资产进行维护”。此外，美国国会层面也有相关立法提案，如编号为S.954的2025年比特币法案，旨在建立战略比特币储备并确保联邦政府比特币持有量的透明管理。这些联邦层面的动议，即使尚在初步阶段，也极大地提升了比特币作为一种战略资产的地位，为机构投资者将其纳入资产配置提供了更强的政策预期和合法性背书。 美国州层面在比特币等加密货币纳入储备资产方面进展不一，但整体趋势值得关注。新罕布什尔州在2025年5月初率先通过了具有里程碑意义的H.B. 302法案，正式授权建立州级战略加密储备，允许州财政部长将最多5%的州资金投资于包括比特币在内的数字资产和贵金属，成为全美首个实现此类立法的州。 这一突破为其他州提供了重要的示范效应。 然而，并非所有州的尝试都一帆风顺。亚利桑那州一项类似的旨在将比特币纳入州储备的法案在2025年5月遭到了州长否决。 根据最新统计，全美约有26个州正在考虑或已经提出了与比特币储备相关的立法草案，但许多法案的最终前景仍不明朗，部分州的提案也遭遇了阻力或被否决。 尽管如此，州层面的这些积极探索和立法尝试，无论成功与否，都反映出比特币作为一种潜在储备资产的认知正在逐步深化，并可能为吸引更多传统机构投资者（如养老基金、捐赠基金等）关注和配置比特币铺平道路，尽管过程可能充满挑战。 4.4 政策博弈总结与展望 综合来看，当前的政策环境呈现出复杂多变的特点，既有积极的催化因素，也存在潜在的风险点。特朗普政府的大规模减税计划将在短期内提振市场情绪，但中期可能因财政赤字扩大而引发流动性波动；美国联邦和州级层面关于比特币战略储备的政策探索，以及稳定币监管框架的逐步明晰，正为加密资产的制度化和主流化铺平道路；美股代币化等创新政策的推进，则为数字资产的应用场景拓展提供了新的想象空间。 投资者应密切关注减税法案的具体落地情况，战略比特币储备相关法规的最终确立和执行、稳定币监管框架的完善以及美股代币化等创新政策的落地情况，将是影响加密市场结构性变化的关键变量。 政策博弈的结果将直接影响市场流动性和风险偏好的走向，进而对比特币等加密资产的价格表现产生深远影响。投资者需要在关注短期政策波动的同时，把握长期制度化趋势带来的结构性机遇。 5. 当前环境下的稳定币理财策略与收益比较 面对当前宏观和监管环境，稳健获取加密收益的 稳定币理财策略 受到投资者青睐。在高利率背景下，一些美元稳定币理财方案已经能提供媲美甚至超过传统市场的收益率，同时风险相对可控。以下将介绍几种近期市场热议的稳定币理财策略，包括各自的年化收益、风险特点，并辅以图表对比不同策略的收益率，帮助不同风险偏好的读者择优选择。 5.1 Backpack Backpack Exchange提供的一站式交易及理财平台，近期其 USD借贷 模式吸引关注。Backpack通过提高借贷利率，给予出借人 额外收益 。当前在Backpack上借出USD可以获得 约 4.94% APY 的总收益，其中包含基础市场利率和3.8%的额外激励。该收益相较其它平台并不算太高，但胜在简单透明（ essentially 将USDC借给保证金交易者赚取利息）。Backpack适合低风险偏好用户获取略高于货币基金的利率。 5.2 Resolv Resolv Labs推出的 USR稳定币 策略，是一种 真实Delta中性 收益模型。它通过头寸组合对冲价格风险，同时利用期货永续合约的资金费率和其他无风险套利机会产生收益，然后将收益分离给RLP代币持有人，让USR保持1:1稳定。该策略当前综合年化收益率约在 15% 左右，其中一部分来自Pendle等协议的激励。Pendle平台上Base链的USR池显示约17.0% APY（其中包含Pendle奖励贡献），以太坊上的USR收益略低约9.4%。总体而言，Resolv USR属于高收益稳定币，但要注意其背后包含复杂衍生品策略和激励代币支撑。 5.3 Aave + Pendle 这是指将资金存入Aave等借贷协议赚取基础利息（例如存入USDC得4%），然后通过Pendle将未来利息进行 收益代币化 交易，以锁定更高固定利率或挖取Pendle激励。当前Pendle平台上锁定Aave/Compound利率的产品如CUSDC、CUSDT池年化在11%左右。例如，Compound的USD稳定币收益代币CUSDO在Pendle池APY约11.5%。这意味着通过Pendle，用户有机会把Aave 4-5%的利率放大到接近两位数（部分收益来自Pendle平台奖励）。优点是仍以头部借贷协议的利息为基础，安全性高；缺点是需要接受Pendle代币浮动奖励和一定操作门槛。综合考虑，这类策略目前实际可获得 ~10%年化 。 5.4 Falcon Finance Falcon推出了 USDf （sUSDf）合成稳定币策略。其模型是质押各类资产铸出USDf，并通过协议设计使USDf持有者获得高收益。据报道，USDf质押可提供 1 0%以上APY 。Falcon近期与Pendle集成，将sUSDf纳入Pendle池，进一步提高链上收益率。Falcon策略收益诱人，但需注意USDf为新兴合成资产，系统性风险和抵押品质量需评估。 5.5 Coinshift csUSDL Coinshift推出的 csUSDL 是一种 机构级稳定币收益 代币。它由Paxos发行的USDL作为基础（100%由短期美债和现金支持），再叠加Morpho协议上的链上借贷利息。用户持有csUSDL即可每日自动增长余额，无需锁定或质押。由于底层资产为T-Bills和Aave借贷，csUSDL收益主要来源于美债利息（当前约5%）叠加DeFi利息），目前总APY在 10% 左右。其优势是高度透明、安全（受监管资产作支撑+智能合约审核），且流动性通过Curve等得到支持。劣势是收益率不算突出但也胜过传统银行利率。 6. 总结与展望：流动性、风险偏好、政策与投资策略的多维影响 综合流动性、风险偏好、政策博弈与投资策略四大维度，我们对比特币市场前景做出如下判断： 短期内（未来1-3个月）：比特币市场可能呈现震荡加剧甚至承压回调的格局。一方面，流动性显著偏紧的预期，特别是日元套息交易平仓可能带来的冲击，将限制其大幅上行的空间；另一方面，短期内风险偏好的改善可能为其提供一定支撑，但难以完全抵消流动性收紧的负面影响。特朗普政府的减税政策虽在短期内提振市场情绪，但债务上限问题和TGA账户补库可能在三季度带来流动性冲击。市场可能在高位盘整后出现回调，或在区间内剧烈波动。投资者需密切关注各项宏观数据发布、政策信号以及关税和地缘局势的最新进展，灵活操作，并高度注意控制风险。 中期内（未来3-12个月）：比特币市场的走向将更具不确定性，机遇与挑战并存。如果全球流动性能如期实现边际改善，且市场风险偏好因各项不确定性因素的积极化解（特别是监管政策的积极落地和机构采用的深化）而持续回暖，那么比特币有望迎来新一轮的上涨行情。美国联邦和州级层面关于比特币战略储备的政策探索，以及稳定币监管框架的逐步明晰，正为加密资产的制度化和主流化铺平道路；美股代币化等创新政策的推进，则为数字资产的应用场景拓展提供了新的想象空间。然而，如果流动性紧缩超预期，或风险事件频发导致避险情绪急剧升温，比特币也可能面临较大回调压力。 关键关注点： 未来一段时间，投资者应重点关注以下几个方面： 美联储的政策路径：包括利率决策、QT的结束时点和方式，以及鲍威尔等官员的公开表态。 美国通胀和就业数据：这是影响美联储决策的核心依据。 中美关税谈判的后续进展：90天缓冲期后的走向至关重要。 全球主要地缘政治风险的演变：特别是俄乌冲突、印巴冲突和中东局势。 美国TGA账户的变动及债务上限问题：对短期流动性的潜在冲击不容忽视。 日本央行的货币政策及日元套息交易动态：对全球流动性分配和美元流动性的直接影响。 全球加密货币监管政策的进展：特别是美国等主要市场的立法和执法动态，包括”战略比特币储备”相关法规的进展和稳定币监管框架的落地情况。 机构资金流入加密市场的规模和持续性：尤其是比特币现货ETF的数据以及主权和州级储备的实际配置情况。 特朗普减税政策的具体落地情况：包括其对财政赤字、债务上限和市场流动性的影响路径。 稳定币市场的发展与创新：包括监管框架的明确、收益率产品的演进以及机构参与度的变化。 总而言之，2025年的比特币市场，将在宏观经济的迷雾和多重政策的博弈中艰难前行。投资者需要保持高度的警惕和灵活性，深入研究市场基本面，理性评估风险，审慎做出投资决策。在不确定性中寻找确定性，将是未来一段时间投资比特币的关键所在。同时，稳定币理财策略也为投资者提供了在市场波动中获取稳定收益的有效途径，值得在资产配置中给予适当比重。 关于 HTX Research HTX Research 是 HTX

With June approaching, the project is gearing up for one of its biggest challenges yet: a massive token unlock that could heavily impact the Pi Coin price . As of now, Pi Coin is trading around $0.75, a drop from its recent high of over $1.50. Adding to concerns is the daily trading volume, which has shrunk to about $135 million — far lower than the impressive $1.7 billion volume it saw when Pi crossed the $1 mark . Why Is Pi Coin’s Price Falling? According to market experts, Pi’s price slide is driven by a simple market dynamic — there’s more selling than buying. As demand weakens and supply increases, prices naturally decline. And with a major unlock event on the horizon, investors are becoming even more skeptical. What’s Happening in June? In June 2025, 264 million Pi tokens are scheduled to be unlocked — the largest unlock event for the remainder of the year. This influx of tokens could flood the market, adding selling pressure and driving the price down further. Source: Piscan Interestingly, the official “.pi” domain is also set to expire on June 28, and some traders believe this could open doors for a short-term price rally, though opinions are divided. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Secures First Stablecoin Trading Pair on MEXC Exchange, But Price Dips 3% , Kraken Pro Adds Pi Futures Trading In a positive development, Pi Network has made a strategic move by officially entering the U.S. market through Kraken Pro, one of the world’s top cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform recently launched perpetual futures contracts for Pi Coin , allowing traders to leverage positions up to 20x — a sign that institutional interest could be growing. Despite the recent price slump, many still consider Pi Coin a project with long-term growth. The Pi Network team continues to work on expanding its ecosystem, developing new applications, investing millions into platform growth, easing user restrictions, and exploring more real-world utilities for its token. However, analysts believe that for Pi Coin to truly establish itself, it must secure listings on bigger exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. “I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to hear from my fellow commissioners about what makes sense to them, and there are many things that they’ve convinced me of and many things that I’ve convinced them of, so I think it does a disservice to regulation.” Christy Goldsmith Romero said that four CFTC commissioners departing is not ideal because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. Source: YouTube Goldsmith Romero’s last day will be May 31 , leaving Commissioner Kristin Johnson as the CFTC’s sole Democrat, who has also announced plans to depart the agency before 2026. Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger is also leaving on May 30 to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO and Republican acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said on May 15 that she plans to move “to the private sector” if Brian Quintenz were to be confirmed head of the agency. If Quintenz is confirmed, and Pham follows through on leaving, it would leave him solely in charge of the agency. Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party. Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.” “So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said. The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger “I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said. “But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.” Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.

In the video, he drew attention to a significant technical development: the apparent breakout from a long-term downtrend in XRP’s dominance, which has persisted since 2017. Market dominance refers to the share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization held by a specific asset. In 2017, during the height of the previous bull market, XRP’s dominance peaked at approximately 30%. According to Steph, this level signified that XRP comprised nearly one-third of the entire crypto market at that time. A recent analysis showed the notable resilience of XRP’s dominance , and Steph pointed out that current charts indicate the asset is now breaking its multi-year downtrend in dominance that began after that 2017 peak. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION 2025 pic.twitter.com/DJZjjNp9S9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 25, 2025 XRP Technical Reversal May Suggest Upward Momentum The analyst framed this breakout as a bullish signal, implying that a major trend reversal could be underway. The technical behavior of XRP’s dominance chart suggests growing investor interest and a possible shift in capital toward the asset relative to the broader market. Steph did not provide a specific price target. However, he argued that if the digital asset repeats its previous cycle performance, the price could “easily hit double and maybe even triple digits by the end of the cycle.” While this prediction is speculative, he bases it on historical dominance levels and the structural breakout observed in current data. Other analysts have also shared double-digit targets for the digital asset, adding credence to Steph’s argument. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His argument centers on the premise that such a reversal in market dominance is not a trivial signal. Historically, sustained increases in an asset’s dominance have often correlated with periods of strong price appreciation. Suppose XRP returns to dominance levels close to its former peak. In that case, the implication is that it would need to command a substantially larger share of the total crypto market capitalization, which could only occur through significant price appreciation. The New Regulatory Landscape for XRP XRP’s dominance has steadily declined since 2017 due to a combination of factors, including regulatory pressure, competition from other projects, and shifting investor focus. However, the regulatory landscape has changed , and the asset’s price movements since late 2024, along with its recent dominance breakout, suggest that a significant move is on the horizon.

Sounds ambitious, right? Well, according to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets at major U.S. asset management firm VanEck, this isn’t just a pipe dream, but a crucial step that requires specific US Bitcoin legislation to become a reality. Why a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve ? Unpacking the Concept The idea of a national Bitcoin strategic reserve is gaining traction in certain circles. At its core, it envisions the U.S. government accumulating and holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin. Why would the U.S. want to do this? National Security: In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, controlling a non-sovereign, globally recognized asset like Bitcoin could offer strategic advantages, potentially bypassing traditional financial systems or sanctions in critical situations. Economic Stability: Some proponents argue it could serve as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, acting as a modern store of value alongside traditional assets like gold. Geopolitical Influence: A large U.S. holding could influence the global Bitcoin market and solidify the nation’s position in the future digital economy. This isn’t just theoretical talk; it’s a concept being discussed at high levels, including conferences like Bitcoin 2025 where Matthew Sigel shared his insights. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy: Sigel’s Legislative Proposal Speaking at the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Matthew Sigel laid out a clear pathway he believes is the most effective for the U.S. to build this reserve: targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. Forget complex new crypto bills for a moment; Sigel suggests leveraging existing legislative processes to bake incentives directly into the system. His proposal centers on two key mechanisms: Tax Deductions for Methane Utilization: Sigel highlighted the environmental benefits and cost savings associated with Bitcoin mining operations that capture and utilize wasted methane gas. By offering specific tax deductions or incentives for miners engaging in this practice, the government could encourage environmentally friendlier mining while also potentially creating a pathway to acquire Bitcoin. Mandatory Bitcoin Allocation: A portion of the Bitcoin mined by these incentivized operations could be required to be provided directly to the federal government. This would create a direct, albeit potentially gradual, method for the government to accumulate Bitcoin for its reserve. This approach, as outlined by the VanEck Bitcoin expert, aims to align economic incentives for the private sector (miners) with the strategic goal of the government (building a reserve), making the expansion process more organic and less reliant on direct market purchases. The Crucial Role of US Bitcoin Legislation Sigel’s emphasis on legislation is critical. While executive orders can provide some direction, fundamental changes like establishing a strategic reserve and creating tax incentives typically require congressional action. Amending budget legislation is a powerful tool because it directly impacts financial flows and can mandate specific activities or allocate funds (or assets, in this case). Passing specific US Bitcoin legislation is often a slow and complex process, fraught with political debate. Sigel’s suggestion to use budget amendments implies a strategy of attaching crypto-related provisions to broader, must-pass spending bills, potentially streamlining the legislative path. Navigating the Political Minefield: Challenges to Crypto Policy US Building a Bitcoin strategic reserve through legislation isn’t without its hurdles. As Matthew Sigel pointed out, the current political climate around cryptocurrency in the U.S. is polarized. Sigel specifically mentioned the executive order (EO) issued by former U.S. President Donald Trump, noting that such actions, even if intended to explore crypto’s potential, often face significant legal challenges. He highlighted prominent anti-crypto politicians, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, as likely sources of opposition and potential lawsuits against government initiatives perceived as being too favorable to the crypto industry. Here are some political challenges facing crypto policy US : Regulatory Uncertainty: Different government agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury) have varying views and approaches to regulating crypto, creating confusion and making unified legislative action difficult. Political Opposition: A vocal group of politicians remains skeptical or outright hostile towards cryptocurrency, citing concerns about illicit finance, consumer protection, and environmental impact (though Sigel’s proposal attempts to address the latter). Lack of Education: Many policymakers still lack a deep understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, leading to hesitant or misinformed legislative attempts. Lobbying Efforts: Both pro- and anti-crypto lobbying groups are actively trying to influence legislation, adding another layer of complexity. Any legislative effort to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve would need to navigate these political crosscurrents, addressing concerns while building bipartisan support, a significant challenge in today’s political environment. Benefits and Challenges: A Closer Look Let’s break down the potential upsides and downsides of establishing a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve as proposed by Matthew Sigel : Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Enhances national security and geopolitical standing. Significant political opposition and potential lawsuits. Provides a potential hedge against economic instability. Implementation complexity (how to store, secure, manage?). Encourages environmentally friendly mining practices via incentives. Market impact of government accumulation or potential selling. Diversifies national assets beyond traditional reserves. Public perception and understanding. Stimulates domestic mining industry growth. Defining the purpose and use-cases of the reserve. While the benefits, particularly from a strategic and economic perspective, are compelling for proponents like VanEck Bitcoin ‘s Sigel, the practical and political hurdles remain substantial. The debate around crypto policy US is far from settled. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Policy US ? Matthew Sigel’s comments underscore a growing reality: cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly being viewed through a strategic national lens, not just as a speculative asset class. Discussions about integrating Bitcoin into national strategy, whether through reserves, regulatory frameworks, or fostering domestic industry (like mining), are becoming more prominent. His focus on budget legislation suggests that proponents of integrating Bitcoin into U.S. strategy are looking for pragmatic legislative avenues, potentially bypassing the gridlock often seen with standalone crypto bills. This approach could signal a shift in strategy for crypto advocates in Washington. For investors, miners, and the broader crypto community, these discussions highlight the potential for significant government involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which could have long-term implications for market structure, adoption, and innovation within the U.S. Conclusion: A Bold Vision Requiring Political Will Matthew Sigel’s proposal for expanding a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve through targeted budget legislation is a bold and pragmatic vision. By linking incentives for environmentally conscious mining with the goal of government accumulation, the plan offers a potential path to build national Bitcoin holdings organically. However, realizing this vision hinges entirely on navigating the complex and often contentious landscape of crypto policy US . Overcoming political opposition, addressing regulatory concerns, and building consensus in Congress will be the ultimate test for whether the U.S. decides to pursue a national Bitcoin strategic reserve in a meaningful way. The conversation has started, driven by key figures like Sigel from firms like VanEck Bitcoin , but the legislative journey is just beginning.

In South Korea, police detained a Russian national accused of attempting to rob $730,000 during a staged crypto deal at a hotel, while in the United States, a third suspect has surrendered in the kidnapping and torture case of an Italian tourist held for weeks in a Manhattan townhouse. Fake Crypto Deal Turns Violent: Russian National Arrested in South Korea for Attempted Hotel Robbery South Korean law enforcement has arrested a Russian national suspected of orchestrating a violent attempted robbery under the guise of a cryptocurrency transaction. The incident, which took place in a Seoul hotel room on May 21, involved the attempted theft of 1 billion won (approximately $730,000) from a group of local investors, authorities confirmed on May 27. According to a report by JoongAng Daily, the Gangseo Police Precinct arrested a man in his 20s in the port city of Busan. He now faces serious charges including assault and attempted robbery. Two additional suspects, believed to have been part of the coordinated operation, reportedly fled South Korea before police could prevent their departure. Investigators say the crime was meticulously premeditated. The three Russian nationals posed as legitimate participants in a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency deal and invited ten Korean investors to a hotel in the Gangseo District of Seoul. After splitting the group, the perpetrators brought two victims up to a hotel room while the others waited in the lobby. Once inside, the suspects ambushed the two men, assaulting them with a replica handgun and a telescopic baton. The attackers, wearing protective vests, tied the victims’ hands with cable ties in an apparent effort to subdue them and steal the cash brought for the supposed transaction. However, the plan unraveled when one of the victims managed to break free and alert others in the lobby. Police were soon dispatched to the scene, where they found one injured man bleeding and a trove of suspicious equipment in the hotel room. The police report detailed the items seized from the hotel room, including a realistic-looking fake firearm, multiple batons, bulletproof-style vests, cable ties, and a cash counter. Investigators believe the operation was not only carefully coordinated but also potentially part of a broader pattern of targeting crypto investors. Authorities quickly filed a motion on the morning of May 22 to prevent the suspects from fleeing the country. However, two had already left South Korea. ”We have requested assistance from Interpol to track down the suspects who fled overseas,” a police official told local media. Meanwhile, prosecutors are preparing to request a pretrial detention warrant for the captured suspect. Crypto Crime on the Rise This alarming case is part of a growing trend of crypto-related crimes involving violence, extortion, and even torture. On May 13, the family of Pierre Noizat, CEO of the French crypto exchange Paymium, was reportedly targeted in an attempted kidnapping plot. Authorities believe the attackers were after crypto credentials or holdings. Paymium CEO family kidnapping attempt (Source: Daily Star) The surge in crypto crimes has spurred a corresponding demand for enhanced personal security. Infinite Risks International, a private security firm, reported a notable increase in bodyguard and protection service requests from crypto founders, venture capitalists, and high-net-worth investors as of mid-May. While crypto itself remains a legal and transformative financial technology, its decentralized nature continues to attract bad actors seeking fast access to large, liquid assets. In response, industry leaders are calling for increased education, better vetting of P2P counterparties, and closer cooperation between international agencies. Until stronger safeguards are in place, the burden of due diligence will remain on individual investors, many of whom now find themselves in the crosshairs of criminal opportunists. A Global Problem Requiring Global Solutions As digital assets become more mainstream, the risk of physical violence accompanying crypto deals, especially large, in-person cash transactions, is growing. Authorities around the world are beginning to recognize that crypto crime is not merely cybercrime; it is often violent, organized, and transnational. Interpol’s involvement in tracking the two suspects abroad may mark a turning point for law enforcement cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime. For South Korea, this case adds to a growing list of incidents reinforcing the need for robust KYC procedures, real-time monitoring of large transfers, and secure transaction environments. Third Suspect Surrenders in Shocking NYC Crypto Kidnapping and Torture Case Meanwhile, in another disturbing case that has gripped both the crypto and law enforcement communities, a third suspect linked to the violent kidnapping and torture of an Italian tourist in Manhattan has surrendered to authorities. The suspect, 33-year-old William Duplessie, turned himself in to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on May 27 after several days of negotiations, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. Duplessie is now facing charges of kidnapping and false imprisonment of an associate for his alleged role in holding 28-year-old Italian national Michael Valentino Teofrasto hostage in a SoHo townhouse. The case is one of the most severe examples to date of physical violence tied to crypto extortion attempts. Michael Valentino Teofrasto around police (Source: MSN) According to a New York Times report , Duplessie and previously arrested suspect John Woeltz both had ties to a local crypto hedge fund. While the fund has not been named publicly, investigators believe the connection may have played a key role in the motive behind the crime. Teofrasto, who had traveled to New York as a tourist, was kidnapped and held against his will in a luxury townhome in the city’s upscale SoHo neighborhood. Over the course of several weeks, he endured brutal physical abuse from his captors, who were reportedly attempting to force him to hand over access to his crypto holdings. The suspects allegedly bound Teofrasto, stole his phone and passport, and subjected him to physical beatings—including electrocution with a Taser. In one of the most harrowing details, the captors reportedly submerged the victim’s feet in water while tasing him in an effort to force him to reveal private keys to his crypto wallets. He was also pistol-whipped and denied basic freedoms while being detained under false imprisonment. Despite the sustained torture, Teofrasto eventually managed to escape and flagged down a police officer on the street to report the incident. His testimony led to the swift arrest of John Woeltz, who was charged with kidnapping for ransom and three other felony charges. Woeltz remains in custody without bail and is scheduled to appear in court for a hearing on May 28. NYPD officials said Duplessie’s surrender was the result of multiple days of negotiations. While they did not disclose the specifics of the talks, law enforcement sources confirmed that the suspect had been under surveillance since Woeltz’s arrest. Authorities continue to investigate the case and are examining whether others tied to the hedge fund or the suspects may have been involved in the operation. It remains unclear if the stolen assets or wallet credentials were ever successfully accessed by the kidnappers. Security Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry The kidnapping has sent shockwaves through the crypto community. Industry leaders and cybersecurity experts are urging investors to avoid disclosing their crypto wealth publicly and to consider enhanced security measures when traveling or meeting with unknown parties. In an industry built on decentralization and anonymity, these incidents are raising new questions about how to protect digital wealth in the physical world. While the courts will now determine the fates of Woeltz and Duplessie, the broader message is clear: as crypto assets grow in value and visibility, so too do the threats against their holders. Law enforcement agencies around the world are being called to adapt, collaborate, and respond to a new form of digital-era organized crime—one that’s very real, and very dangerous.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-28 05:30:00

The budget-neutral plan will be funded through existing Federal Reserve and Treasury resources. Trump Media also confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin, despite initial denials from the company which slammed a report from the Financial Times. Additionally, Adam Back recently spoke about his long-term bullish thesis, and warned that selling Bitcoin is similar to gambling. Institutional demand continues to rise, which suggests that Bitcoin may increasingly become a core financial reserve for both governments and corporations. Bitcoin Act Gains Momentum At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced that President Donald Trump is officially backing the BITCOIN Act. This is a legislative proposal to have the US government acquire one million Bitcoin over the next five years. According to Lummis, Trump not only supports the bill but has also established a team in the White House to actively work on comprehensive digital asset legislation. The acquisitions outlined in the bill will be funded using existing resources from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to ensure that there is no additional tax burden on American citizens. This “budget-neutral” approach was previously pointed out by the Trump administration as a cornerstone of their digital asset strategy. Senator Lummis talked about the administration’s commitment to a structured rollout of digital asset legislation, beginning with stablecoins, followed by broader market structure reforms and the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. She said that the stablecoin bill has already passed through the Senate Banking Committee and is likely to be brought to the Senate floor for a vote shortly after the current congressional recess ends. Lummis also mentioned the bipartisan cooperation involved in advancing the bill, as well as the extensive negotiations with minority party lawmakers to ensure cross-party support. The momentum behind stablecoin legislation was further reinforced by David Sacks, Trump’s top crypto adviser, who recently stated that the GENIUS Act is poised to pass the Senate with bipartisan backing. The bill cleared a key procedural vote on May 19,and is viewed as the most comprehensive attempt yet to regulate dollar-pegged stablecoins at the federal level. (Source: US Senate ) Industry experts believe regulation like this could help boost the global role of the US dollar by leveraging blockchain-based assets. Currently, stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC make up over 85% of the $250 billion stablecoin market. Trump Media Confirms $2.5B Bitcoin Bet Trump’s support of crypto also became evident after Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social and partially owned by President Donald Trump, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. In a May 27 announcement , TMTG shared details about the funding structure, which includes a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds with a 0% coupon. The transaction is expected to close by May 29. Announcement from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes explained that the decision reflects the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a powerful symbol of financial freedom. Nunes added that holding Bitcoin will help the company guard against what he described as harassment and discrimination by financial institutions. The confirmation came a day after a Financial Times report suggested the deal was in motion, which TMTG initially dismissed with sharp criticism of the publication and its sources. Despite the strategic move into digital assets, TMTG’s stock dropped more than 12% after the announcement was made, which caused it to trade at approximately $23.60 at the time of writing. The investment is part of a trend of corporations adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. In May alone, several companies boosted their Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 4,020 BTC on May 26. Similarly, tech firm Semler Scientific disclosed a purchase of 455 BTC valued at over $50 million, while Japanese investment firm MetaPlanet acquired 1,004 BTC earlier in the month. Market analyst Jesse Myers recently pointed out the growing pace of institutional accumulation, and predicted that major entities could control half of all Bitcoin by 2045 if current trends continue. Myers argued that this surge in adoption stems from a wider exodus out of fiat-based financial instruments, as capital increasingly flows into hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. Adam Back Says Selling Bitcoin Is a Losing Bet The fact that Trump seems intent on holding on to the US government’s Bitcoin as well Trump Media’s stockpile may be a good thing. Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest pioneers, believes that selling Bitcoin is similar to “playing in a really bad house-rate casino.” In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back explained that the odds are heavily skewed against those trying to time the market. His insights stem from his early experience in the Bitcoin space, when the asset’s price was climbing exponentially despite extreme volatility. He believes that trying to sell during dips, hoping for a better re-entry, is generally a losing game because the long-term trajectory consistently trended upwards. Back’s comments shed some light on a key tension for Bitcoin investors: navigating the asset’s notorious volatility while still staying focused on the larger exponential trend. Bitcoin has undergone several severe corrections throughout its history, and often fell more than 80% during bear markets. Yet, those who held on have seen impressive gains. Over the past decade, Bitcoin delivered a staggering total return of more than 39,000%, which lends some credibility to Back’s point about the risk of mistiming exits. Average Bitcoin returns (Source: Curvo ) Despite concerns about diminishing returns as Bitcoin matures, Back argued that the current cycle could defy that theory. He pointed to growing interest from both corporations and governments as potential drivers of sustained upward momentum. Firms like Strategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin, sometimes through innovative financial instruments like convertible notes. This approach offers both direct and indirect exposure to the asset. Institutional and sovereign entities are also making strategic moves. Abu Dhabi, for example, made headlines with a $408.5 million investment in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, the political landscape is shifting in favor of Bitcoin as well. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve, and New Hampshire and Texas have taken similar steps at the state level. Back believes these kinds of developments point toward broader adoption and potentially another phase of exponential growth, albeit still marked by periods of high volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-28 05:31:50

On the backdrop, a key Bitcoin metric has quietly reached a level that has historically preceded major market turning points. While the data suggests widespread unrealized gains among holders, analysts urge restraint. UTXO Profitability Reaches Critical Level According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , 99% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are currently in profit. This has historically proven to be a critical threshold, previously linked to market euphoria. UTXOs, which represent unspent BTC from previous transactions, are a key metric for gauging unrealized profits across the network. When nearly all holders are sitting on gains, it often signals heightened bullish sentiment, a condition that can precede either sustained rallies or sharp corrections. While the 99% mark is typically seen as a sign of strength, CryptoQuant stated that the current macroeconomic uncertainty , particularly around the Trump administration’s potential policy direction, makes it difficult to conclude that true market euphoria has arrived. As such, investors appear hesitant to embrace risk fully. Hence, the report cautioned that if this metric begins to decline, it could indicate that unrealized profits are shrinking. That scenario could trigger increased profit-taking among earlier investors and force latecomers – those who bought near recent highs – to sell at a loss, potentially accelerating downside momentum. Short-Term Buyer Fatigue Glassnode also noted a concerning trend and flagged “signs of cooling momentum.” In its recent update , the platform observed that the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell by 25.1%, and net spot demand declined, suggesting potential short-term buyer fatigue. In derivatives markets, open interest and funding rates climbed, which indicated a growing speculative activity. Despite this, Glassnode explained that the Perpetual Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) trending lower points to stronger sell-side pressure and more caution among traders. Options data revealed a mixed picture: while the 25-Delta Skew remained stable, rising open interest and a widening volatility spread may reflect hedging or profit-taking. Liquidity conditions improved, supported by elevated unrealized profits and continued activity from short-term holders. Meanwhile, a slight uptick in the short-to-long-term holder (STH/LTH) supply ratio, coupled with a small dip in the Realized Profit-to-Loss ratio, signaled tempered enthusiasm over the weekend. On-chain fundamentals showed a mild decrease in active addresses, which demonstrated a slowdown in user activity following a period of intense engagement.

In a Fox Business interview on May 27, Sacks said, “Cryptocurrencies are the future financial system,” and emphasized the need to promote the industry. He pointed to big progress in the first 100 days, including reversing what he called years of anti-crypto policies and delivering on campaign promises. Recently, he accused Senator Elizabeth Warren of being an autopen in Biden’s era to stop innovation following her anti-crypto stance. This war inside the political arena came after Warren openly criticized Trump and Sacks for using crypto for their own interest.

He accused Warren of having a “pathological hatred” for crypto and wanting to drive the industry out of the U.S. His favorite win so far? Defunding the CFPB, a watchdog agency Warren helped create. He called it her “personal goon squad” used to pressure crypto companies. Sacks also praised upcoming crypto-friendly laws, such as the stablecoin bill and the Genius Act , which he says will establish pro-crypto rules that future regulators cannot easily undo. Warren Raises Ethics Concerns In response, Warren questioned Sacks’ ethics, pointing out that he advises on crypto policy while also running a venture capital firm that invests in crypto. Normally, that would be a conflict of interest, but the Trump administration gave him an ethics waiver, allowing him to help shape policies that could benefit his own investments.

The letter , shared publicly by Ripple’s ( XRP ) chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty on May 28, responds to a key question raised by commissioner Hester Peirce in her recent “New Paradigm” speech: At what point does a crypto asset separate from an investment contract and cease to be treated as a security? Ripple pointed to existing legal analysis, particularly the 2022 paper titled The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law. The paper argues that most fungible crypto assets traded on secondary markets are not securities, as they do not carry ongoing obligations between buyers and the original issuers. The company also cited the 2023 ruling in SEC vs. Ripple Labs, where the court found that XRP is not inherently a security , only some early institutional sales qualified as investment contracts. You might also like: Ripple CEO snubbed by Lummis: XRP FUD Fuels crypto drama In its letter, Ripple proposed a clear legal test. It suggests that a digital asset should be presumed separate from the investment contract unless two conditions are met. First, the issuer must have made material promises that remain unfulfilled, and second, the current holder has enforceable rights against the issuer. This would prevent regulators from targeting assets based solely on their origin and allow more legal certainty for market participants. “A sound safe harbor should operate within, not expand, the existing scope of federal securities law,” the letter emphasized, calling for clarity that protects good-faith actors without shielding bad ones. Ripple also criticized vague regulatory concepts like “sufficient decentralization,” calling instead for objective criteria like network maturity, public trading history, and a lack of unilateral control. The company maintained that new rules must be grounded in current law, not created through enforcement . The filing comes as Ripple and the SEC approach the final stages of a years-long legal battle. While a settlement proposal was denied by Judge Analisa Torres on May 15 due to procedural issues, both parties are expected to refile.

Trump said that assets would be accumulated through partner ventures such as American Bitcoin in partnership with Hut 8, and other crypto through the WLF DeFi platform, though he didn’t mention specific tokens. “In my opinion, DeFi is going to change so many aspects of the financial system and create the efficiencies that have been lacking [in traditional finance].” Speaking on banks and traditional finance, Trump Jr. said that they were “reluctant adapters” because they view a lot of these new technologies as a threat. “Every day when I see someone else adapting this or taking on a little bit [of Bitcoin], I think we’re at the point when those floodgates are going to open.” Once you create the regulatory framework to keep this activity in America and not ship the “new financial sector of America” to other places, it is critically important, he concluded.

We’ve seen a truly significant move recently, with ETH Open Interest soaring to an all-time record high. This wasn’t just random market noise; it followed a pretty interesting announcement from a company you might not typically expect to see making crypto headlines: SharpLink Gaming . Wait, SharpLink Gaming is Buying ETH? What’s the Big Deal? For those unfamiliar, SharpLink Gaming is a Nasdaq-listed online technology company. While their primary focus is gaming, they recently made a strategic move that caught the attention of the crypto world: they announced the establishment of a corporate Crypto Treasury , specifically including Ethereum (ETH) as part of their balance sheet. Why is this significant? It signals a growing trend of publicly traded companies looking to allocate a portion of their corporate funds into digital assets. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury has been a long-standing example, SharpLink’s decision to include ETH highlights the increasing confidence in Ethereum’s role and future within the digital economy. It’s another data point suggesting institutional adoption is expanding beyond just Bitcoin. How Did This News Cause ETH Open Interest to Skyrocket? Let’s break down what Open Interest (OI) means in the context of futures markets. OI represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. It’s a key metric traders and analysts watch because it can indicate the level of market activity, liquidity, and the potential strength behind a price trend. Following SharpLink’s announcement, the ETH Open Interest saw a dramatic surge. According to reports, including analysis shared by Cointelegraph citing CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Ethereum futures market activity picked up considerably. The most striking data point? OI increased by a staggering $3.5 billion in a single day, pushing the total to a record $36.1 billion! The connection here is clear: a corporate treasury announcement, especially from a publicly traded company, is often interpreted by the market as a bullish signal. Traders and institutions, anticipating potential positive price movement fueled by this adoption, tend to open new long positions in ETH Futures contracts. This influx of new positions directly contributes to the rise in Open Interest. Why Are Corporate Crypto Treasury Announcements So Impactful? The decision by companies like SharpLink Gaming to establish a Crypto Treasury and hold assets like Ethereum sends several powerful signals to the market: Validation: It validates cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets suitable for corporate balance sheets, not just speculative tools for individuals. Demand: It represents real-world demand for the underlying asset, potentially removing supply from exchanges and contributing to price stability or appreciation. Confidence: It shows increasing confidence from traditional businesses in the long-term value proposition and infrastructure of blockchain networks like Ethereum . Trend Setting: These early adopters can pave the way for more companies to follow suit, potentially creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and price support. SharpLink’s move is particularly interesting as they chose to include ETH, highlighting the growing recognition of Ethereum’s ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and its upcoming technical advancements. What Does This Record ETH Futures Activity Tell Us? A record high in ETH Open Interest is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects significant market participation and, likely, strong bullish sentiment driving the opening of new long positions in ETH Futures . More capital is flowing into the market, indicating conviction among participants. However, high OI, especially when fueled by rapid surges, can also indicate increased leverage in the system. This is where the insights from analysts like CryptoQuant’s Maartunn become crucial. Maartunn outlined that since April 28, there have been 10 leverage-driven Ethereum pump signals. While one triggered a short squeeze (forcing short sellers to buy back at higher prices), a significant eight of them actually led to a subsequent pullback. This suggests that while corporate news can trigger initial bullish enthusiasm and increase OI, the market structure, particularly the amount of leverage being used, makes Ethereum susceptible to volatility and potential corrections. A market heavily reliant on leverage can experience rapid price drops if positions are liquidated in masse during a downturn. Navigating the Current Ethereum Market: Opportunities and Risks The current landscape presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks for those involved with Ethereum : Opportunities: The SharpLink announcement and the subsequent OI surge could be indicative of broader institutional interest that could provide long-term support for ETH ‘s price. Increased market activity often leads to more trading opportunities for those who can effectively navigate volatility. Growing corporate adoption adds fundamental strength to the Ethereum ecosystem. Risks: The high level of ETH Open Interest , particularly with the noted prevalence of leverage signals leading to pullbacks, suggests the market could be fragile. A sharp reversal in sentiment or a cascade of liquidations could lead to a rapid and significant price correction. The market’s reaction might be overly reliant on bullish news, making it vulnerable to disappointment or negative external factors. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors: Monitor Leverage Metrics: Pay attention to funding rates on futures exchanges, which can indicate excessive leverage. Understand Liquidation Risks: Be aware that large OI can mean significant liquidation levels exist, which could act as magnets for price movements. Implement Risk Management: Use stop-losses and manage position sizes carefully, especially when volatility is high. Look Beyond the Hype: While corporate adoption is bullish long-term, short-term market movements driven by leverage can be unpredictable. Consider the fundamental value alongside market sentiment. A Compelling Summary: What Does It All Mean? The recent surge in ETH Open Interest to a record $36.1 billion, significantly boosted by news of SharpLink Gaming establishing a corporate Crypto Treasury with Ethereum , underscores the increasing institutional interest in the digital asset space. This development is a positive signal for Ethereum ‘s adoption trajectory and validates its growing importance. However, the context provided by market analysts regarding the prevalence of leverage-driven signals leading to pullbacks adds a layer of caution. While high OI can indicate bullish conviction, it also highlights the potential for increased volatility and liquidation risks within the ETH Futures market. Market participants should celebrate the adoption news but remain vigilant and employ sound risk management strategies in this dynamic environment.

Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-final-wave-starts-now-heres-what-to-expect/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-followed analyst on X, has drawn attention to a potentially significant development on XRP’s chart. In a recent post, he shared a weekly time frame analysis that highlights three distinct phases of price movement: two completed upward surges and a possible third, larger “final pump” on the horizon. THE FINAL #XRP WAVE STARTS NOW! pic.twitter.com/Z4twU14g1s — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 26, 2025 The chart, which spans from mid-2024 into mid-2025, outlines XRP’s price activity in three stages, with a potential double-digit target once the pattern is completed. The first marked increase, labeled Pump 1, occurred in July, shortly before the initial resolution of the XRP lawsuit . This was a small climb, and the asset quickly retraced those gains. Pump 2, which followed months later, was much larger, and the asset has preserved most of its gains since then. This surge began shortly after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential race, and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation date . Since then, XRP appears to have entered a consolidation range just below the $3 level. According to the chart, this is the prelude to what Steph labels the final pump, a projected parabolic rise targeting levels around $25. Price Consolidation Before Anticipated Move XRP currently sits in a sideways structure, suggesting market participants are accumulating before the next leg. This consolidation period, seen after Pump 2, spans several weeks and shows limited volatility in either direction. While some may see this consolidation as a sign of weakness, extended consolidation phases often represent a typical pause before a larger continuation move. The digital asset has shown notable resilience recently , and other analysts have also shared bullish predictions for the short and long term. If Steph’s prediction is realized, it would represent the most aggressive phase of the entire structure. Though no timeline was set, the weekly chart implies it could unfold in July. Another analyst recently stated that July could be an important month for XRP , as he foresees something big is on the horizon. Notably, he also pointed to an extended consolidation cycle, suggesting a breakout from this setup. Steph’s chart interpretation is consistent with historical market behavior during strong bullish trends, where initial pumps lead to temporary plateaus before momentum resumes. XRP is currently trading at $2.28, up almost 5.5% from last week. The suggestion that XRP could rise sharply from its current range has excited many in the community.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said it had reached a staff-level agreement with the Salvadoran government as part of the first review of a $1.4b extended loan program. While praising the country’s progress on fiscal reforms and macroeconomic stability, the IMF said it would work to “ensure” that the total amount of Bitcoin held by the government remains unchanged. The announcement, which follows months of negotiations, reflects a delicate balancing act between supporting El Salvador’s economic ambitions and placing limits on its headline-grabbing Bitcoin policy. The IMF noted that while risks from the country’s crypto adoption have diminished, maintaining stability requires tighter controls. As part of the terms, El Salvador also committed to withdrawing public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet, its state-run Bitcoin app, by the end of July. Despite IMF Oversight, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Wallet Keeps Growing The update follows comments from economy minister Maria Luisa Hayem, who reiterated in April that Bitcoin remains a government priority. Speaking at the Web Summit in Rio de Janeiro, she confirmed that the country continues to accumulate Bitcoin despite the IMF program’s guidelines. Since striking the deal in Dec. 2024 , El Salvador has added at least 20 Bitcoin to its treasury. As of May 2025, the country holds around 6,190 BTC , worth an estimated $675m with last BTC purchase made on 28 May. With Bitcoin prices soaring this year, the nation sits on unrealized gains of over $350m, according to government data. IMF Backs Limited Crypto Exposure as El Salvador Pledges Economic Reforms El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, a move that drew sharp criticism from multilateral lenders including the IMF. Talks over financial support stalled for years as the fund urged the country to reconsider its crypto policy. But the recent agreement signals a more pragmatic tone, with the IMF allowing limited crypto exposure while insisting on broader economic discipline. To secure the next $120m tranche of funding, the Salvadoran government has agreed to strengthen fiscal consolidation, raise bank liquidity requirements and implement civil service and pension reforms. The IMF said the deal remains subject to executive board approval and hinges on the country meeting prior agreed actions. While the Bitcoin cap may frustrate crypto advocates, the Salvadoran administration appears determined to continue its digital asset experiment within the limits of international oversight.

The feature is expected to expand to all eligible merchants by 2026, pending regulatory approvals. “Block has long been a champion of Bitcoin, focused on making it more accessible and usable in our everyday lives,” said Miles Suter, BTC product lead at Block. Suter helped oversee the setup of the new Square Bitcoin checkout, which he calls a “significant milestone” in making the crypto more accessible and usable. He joined Block in 2017, contributing to several of the company’s key milestones, including its Cash App’s Bitcoin integration. “Somebody’s got to be first,” he told CNBC, talking about the current Bitcoin payments feature. “And we feel like we have the right DNA to push things forward.” “We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast, and low-cost money system for everyone, and that’s exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers.” In April, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey has long maintained that Bitcoin’s utility in daily transactions is essential for its long-term success. Expanding the Bitcoin Ecosystem Apart from payments on Square, Block is expanding its Bitcoin ecosystem with products such as Cash App’s bitcoin buy, sell, and transfer features. Additionally, Block is expanding global access to Bitcoin through Bitkey, a self-custody BTC wallet, with the launch of new privacy and security features starting this month. Besides, Block is building Proto, its suite of bitcoin mining products and services, “to decentralize mining,” the release noted. Meanwhile, following the Bitcoin payments roll-out, Block Inc. shares climbed 5.81% , reaching an intraday high of $62.66, before settling at $62.17 on May 27.

Bo Hines, the executive director of the U.S. President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, recently offered a clear perspective on the government’s view and handling of its US government Bitcoin holdings. This declaration provides valuable insight into how digital assets are being perceived at high levels of power and what it could mean for future policy. Understanding the Statement on US Government Bitcoin Bo Hines, in comments reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, didn’t mince words when discussing the leading cryptocurrency. His remarks focused on two core points that carry considerable weight: Bitcoin as the “Golden Standard”: Hines explicitly referred to Bitcoin as “the golden standard.” This is a powerful endorsement, likening Bitcoin to a traditional, universally recognized store of value. It suggests a growing recognition within certain government circles of Bitcoin’s unique properties and its potential role in the broader financial landscape. Commitment Not to Sell: Perhaps even more impactful was the statement regarding the government’s current holdings. According to the report, Hines emphasized that the U.S. government is “not gonna sell any Bitcoin that we possibly have.” This indicates a strategic intent to retain, rather than liquidate, seized or acquired Bitcoin assets. These statements, coming from an executive director of a council advising the President on digital assets, signal a potentially evolving perspective on cryptocurrency within the executive branch. While not formal policy, it reflects the thinking and recommendations being developed at a high level. Why Call Bitcoin the “Bitcoin Golden Standard”? The comparison of Bitcoin to the “golden standard” is not new within the crypto community, but hearing it from a government official is noteworthy. What characteristics of Bitcoin might lead to this assessment? Scarcity: Like gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply (capped at 21 million coins). This inherent scarcity is a fundamental driver of its value proposition as a store of value. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, free from control by any single government or financial institution. This independence can be seen as a strength, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Durability and Immobility: Bitcoin, as a digital asset, is durable and easily transferable across borders without the physical limitations of commodities like gold. Recognition and Adoption: Bitcoin is the largest and most established cryptocurrency by market capitalization and network effect, giving it a level of recognition that other digital assets currently lack. This perspective suggests that the council sees Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but potentially as a long-term reserve asset or a foundational element in the digital economy, much like gold has been in the physical economy. Understanding Government Crypto Holdings It’s important to understand how the government crypto holdings discussed by Hines are typically acquired. The vast majority of Bitcoin held by the U.S. government comes from seizures related to criminal activities, such as those linked to dark web marketplaces, ransomware attacks, and fraud schemes. These holdings are managed by various agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and others. Historically, the U.S. government has, on occasion, sold portions of its seized Bitcoin holdings through auctions. However, Hines’ statement suggests a potential shift or clarification in strategy – at least from the advisory council’s viewpoint – indicating a preference for holding rather than immediate liquidation of current and possibly future acquisitions. The specific phrase “not gonna sell any Bitcoin that we possibly have” could be interpreted as a forward-looking intent based on the council’s current advice. The size of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings fluctuates as more assets are seized and, historically, some have been sold. However, these holdings are often substantial and represent a significant amount of Bitcoin outside of private hands. A commitment not to sell can remove a potential source of market supply pressure and signal confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The Role of the Digital Assets Council The President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets plays a crucial role in informing the executive branch on complex issues related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and other digital assets. Established to provide expert advice, the council helps shape potential approaches to regulation, innovation, and the strategic implications of digital assets for the U.S. economy and national security. Statements from figures within this council offer a window into the evolving understanding and strategic thinking regarding digital assets at the highest levels. While they are advisory and do not constitute official, binding policy, they are influential in shaping the discourse and potential future direction of US Bitcoin policy and broader crypto regulation. The council likely considers a range of factors when formulating advice, including economic competitiveness, technological innovation, consumer protection, financial stability, and national security concerns related to digital assets. Hines’ comments suggest that the perceived long-term value and strategic importance of Bitcoin are key considerations within this advisory process. What Does This Mean for US Bitcoin Policy and the Market? Bo Hines’ statement, while not a formal policy announcement, carries weight due to his position. It suggests: Potential for a Bullish Signal: A high-level advisor viewing Bitcoin as a “golden standard” and advocating against selling government holdings can be interpreted by the market as a positive signal, suggesting increasing legitimacy and confidence from official corners. Influence on Future Policy: The council’s advice informs the President and relevant agencies. A perspective favoring retention over liquidation could influence how seized assets are handled in the future and potentially shape broader policy approaches to digital assets. Recognition of Bitcoin’s Unique Position: The distinction of calling Bitcoin specifically the “golden standard” sets it apart from other digital assets in this context, reinforcing its unique status in the crypto ecosystem from the council’s viewpoint. Reducing Potential Market Pressure: If the government commits to not selling its substantial holdings, it removes a potential source of large sell-offs that could impact market prices. However, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. US Bitcoin policy is complex and involves multiple government bodies, including regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC, the Treasury Department, and Congress. Views and priorities can differ between these entities. Hines’ statement represents a perspective from an advisory body, not necessarily the unified, decided policy of the entire government. Actionable Insights for the Reader What can individuals interested in cryptocurrency take away from this? Stay Informed: Pay attention to statements from government officials and advisory bodies regarding digital assets. They provide clues about potential future regulatory and policy directions. Understand the Source: Differentiate between advisory opinions (like those from the council) and formal, binding regulations or laws passed by agencies or Congress. Consider Long-Term Trends: A high-level government advisor recognizing Bitcoin as a “golden standard” aligns with the long-term store-of-value narrative that many Bitcoin proponents hold. This kind of institutional acknowledgment can be a factor in assessing Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While regulatory clarity remains a key challenge for the crypto industry in the U.S., statements like these contribute to the ongoing dialogue and offer glimpses into how digital assets are being understood and potentially integrated into official thinking. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for US Bitcoin Policy Dialogue Bo Hines’ comments regarding the US government Bitcoin holdings and his characterization of Bitcoin as the “golden standard” represent a pivotal moment in the public discourse surrounding digital assets at the government level. The executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets articulating a stance against selling government crypto holdings underscores a potential shift in how these assets are viewed and managed. While this is an advisory perspective and not formal US Bitcoin policy , it provides significant insight into the evolving strategic thinking within the executive branch regarding the value and role of Bitcoin and other digital assets. As the landscape continues to develop, such high-level acknowledgments of Bitcoin’s perceived intrinsic value and the intention to hold significant government crypto holdings will likely play a role in shaping future regulatory and economic strategies.

Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the “Market Cap by Profit and Loss,” which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency’s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn’t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it’s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. “Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,” notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. “Whales” are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? More specifically, the whales have added around 1 million ETH (worth around $2.7 billion at the current exchange rate) to their holdings in this period.

The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the deal, El Salvador will need to fulfill its prior obligations around limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin ( BTC ), and it will have to cease its involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said. The planned payout, subject to IMF executive board approval, is part of a larger $1.4 billion, 40-month loan deal struck in December, which saw El Salvador agree to confine its Bitcoin ambitions. On March 3, the IMF reiterated its stance that El Salvador should stop accumulating Bitcoin and not pursue other Bitcoin-related activities. Despite the IMF’s request, El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has stated that his government will continue to acquire one BTC per day as part of the nation’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. El Salvador again defies IMF Shortly after the IMF’s May 27 announcement, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office posted to X that the country had once again purchased more Bitcoin. Source: The Bitcoin Office The country’s official Bitcoin tracker shows that El Salvador is continuing with Bitcoin-buying through the Bitcoin Office, which has accumulated 30 BTC in the past 30 days. Currently, El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve stands at 6,190.18 BTC. Related: How can Bukele still stack Bitcoin after IMF loan agreement? Last week, Bukele took to the social media platform X to reveal that the nation’s Bitcoin treasury is sitting at an unrealized profit of $386 million, a 132% gain on its total Bitcoin investment. In April, Rodrigo Valdes, director of the Western Hemisphere Department at the IMF, said that the country is complying with the IMF’s performance criteria. Author and intergovernmental blockchain adviser Anndy Lian suggested that the country could maintain technical compliance by purchasing Bitcoin through non-government entities.

Publicly listed companies holding Bitcoin have jumped to 113, with over 800,000 BTC. Major players like Trump Media, Blackstone, and DigiAsia are joining the treasury buying trend. Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions, spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong, according to a recent report by the Financial Times . This week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. 113 Publicly Listed Companies hold Bitcoin MicroStrategy, now renamed “Strategy,” holds 580,000 BTC and boasts a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, more than the current value of its Bitcoin reserves. As of now, 113 publicly listed companies hold Bitcoin, up from 89 in April, with a combined stash of over 800,000 BTC worth approximately $88 billion. “Favourable market conditions are drawing capital,” Aaron Chan of Flow Traders told FT. “Investors are trying to get in early on the next Strategy.” That momentum is converging with this week’s annual Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, a high-profile event drawing key players from finance, politics, and crypto. Among those capitalizing is Twenty One Capital , founded by Jack Mallers and backed by SoftBank, Tether, and Cantor Equity Partners. The venture expects to hold 42,000 BTC post-merger, valuing the firm at $14.4 billion. Meanwhile, Strive Asset Management, co-founded by former U.S. presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, aims to raise up to $1.5 billion to fund its own Bitcoin acquisitions. Bitcoin Treasuries Go Public Other firms are using mergers to fast-track listings. American Bitcoin, part-owned by Trump’s sons, is merging with Gryphon Mining, whose shares have surged 120%. KindlyMD, the acquisition partner of Nakamoto Holdings, has seen a 540% rise since their deal. Nakamoto CEO David Bailey said the goal is to “package Bitcoin” into forms accessible to institutional buyers. While the rally is creating momentum, analysts caution the copycat effect may hit limits. “The market needs to believe in the strategy,” said Patrick Bush of VanEck, highlighting the unique position of Strategy founder Michael Saylor. “His public visibility plays a key role.” Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy. On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy.

Calls for altcoin season mount “They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

At the heart of much debate is how existing securities laws apply to novel digital assets. Ripple, a company well-acquainted with this challenge, recently took a significant step in addressing one of the most fundamental questions facing the industry: When does a digital asset separate from the investment contract under which it might have initially been offered? This isn’t just academic; it’s central to achieving much-needed Crypto Legal Clarity . The Core Question: When Does a Digital Asset Stop Being an Investment Contract Crypto? This specific question was highlighted by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce in her insightful “New Paradigm” speech. She posed the idea that while an initial offering of digital assets might constitute an investment contract (and thus be considered a security under the Howey Test), the asset itself, or subsequent sales of that asset, might not. This distinction is absolutely crucial. Think of the Howey Test, which the SEC uses to determine if something is an investment contract. It involves: An investment of money. In a common enterprise. With an expectation of profits. Solely from the efforts of others. Many initial token sales seem to fit this description. However, as a digital asset’s network becomes decentralized, its utility grows, and its price is driven more by market forces and less by the efforts of the original promoters, does it retain the characteristics of an investment contract? This is the pivotal point Ripple is addressing. Ripple SEC Engagement: Seeking Digital Asset Regulation Answers Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty announced on X (formerly Twitter) that the company submitted an additional letter to the SEC Crypto Task Force . This action demonstrates Ripple’s commitment to engaging directly with regulators on these complex issues. The letter specifically responds to Commissioner Peirce’s question, aiming to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about how to appropriately regulate digital assets without stifling innovation. For Ripple, this isn’t a new fight. The company has been involved in a lengthy legal battle with the SEC regarding the regulatory status of its associated digital asset, XRP. While the courts have provided some clarity, particularly regarding secondary market sales not being unregistered securities transactions, the broader question of when an asset ‘detaches’ from its initial offering structure remains a grey area for many other projects. Ripple’s proactive engagement, even while navigating its own legal challenges, underscores the industry’s urgent need for clear rules of the road. They are essentially asking the SEC to provide guidance on a scenario that many digital assets might evolve into – moving from a potentially centralized initial phase to a more decentralized, utility-driven state. Why This Investment Contract Crypto Clarity Matters The lack of a clear framework for when a digital asset might cease to be considered part of an investment contract creates significant uncertainty for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. Here’s why this clarity is essential: Innovation: Projects are hesitant to build and launch in the U.S. if they fear their asset could be deemed an unregistered security indefinitely, regardless of its function or decentralization. Market Participation: Financial institutions and mainstream investors require regulatory certainty before fully engaging with digital asset markets. Consumer Protection: Clear rules benefit consumers by defining regulatory boundaries and responsibilities. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and potential pitfalls. Global Competitiveness: Other jurisdictions are developing clearer frameworks for digital assets. The U.S. risks falling behind if it cannot provide similar certainty. Ripple’s letter contributes to a vital conversation about finding a balanced approach to Digital Asset Regulation that protects investors while allowing technology to flourish. Challenges in Defining Digital Asset Separation While the concept of a digital asset separating from its initial investment contract seems logical in theory, defining the exact criteria and timing presents significant challenges: How do you measure ‘sufficient decentralization’? Is there a threshold for utility adoption? What about assets that maintain a degree of ongoing connection to their initial promoters? Regulators face the difficulty of creating rules flexible enough for diverse technologies but precise enough to be enforceable. The SEC’s historical approach has often been retrospective, bringing enforcement actions based on existing laws rather than issuing prospective rules tailored to crypto. This makes industry compliance difficult when the legal status of an asset can be subject to future interpretation. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Ripple’s engagement offers insights for various stakeholders: For Projects: Focus on developing genuine utility for your token. Work towards greater network decentralization over time. Engage with legal counsel experienced in digital asset law and monitor regulatory developments closely. Consider how your project’s structure might evolve away from reliance on your own efforts for value appreciation. For Investors: Understand that the regulatory status of any digital asset can be complex and subject to change or interpretation. Diversify your portfolio and stay informed about the regulatory environment. The outcome of debates like the one Ripple is engaging in can impact the accessibility and liquidity of certain assets. For Policymakers: The industry is actively seeking guidance. Engaging in constructive dialogue, as the SEC Crypto Task Force is doing, is crucial. Consider whether new legislation is necessary to provide the clarity that applying decades-old tests to novel technology cannot fully achieve. The conversation initiated by Commissioner Peirce and addressed by Ripple is a step towards building a regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique lifecycle and characteristics of digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Towards Crypto Legal Clarity Ripple’s submission to the SEC Crypto Task Force on the separation of a digital asset from an investment contract is a significant contribution to one of the most pressing legal questions in the U.S. crypto space. It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of digital assets that goes beyond their initial distribution method. Achieving clarity on this point is not just beneficial for companies like Ripple; it is fundamental to fostering responsible innovation, protecting investors effectively, and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the global digital asset landscape.

A recent statement from a top executive at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has reignited discussions about the future trajectory of digital assets, specifically focusing on Bitcoin potential compared to traditional safe havens like gold. This isn’t just another opinion; it’s a perspective from within the walls of an institution increasingly involved in the crypto space. What Did the BlackRock Exec Really Say About BlackRock Bitcoin? At the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas, Robert Mitchnick, Managing Director at BlackRock, shared a view that has resonated throughout the crypto community. According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Mitchnick stated unequivocally that “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold.” This simple yet powerful assertion from a representative of a firm that recently launched one of the most successful spot Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT) underscores a notable shift in how traditional finance views the premier cryptocurrency. Why is this particular statement significant? BlackRock manages trillions of dollars in assets. Their strategic decisions and public commentary often signal broader trends in institutional investment. Mitchnick’s role as a Managing Director suggests he is involved in key areas, likely including the firm’s digital asset initiatives. Therefore, his comparison isn’t merely speculative; it’s likely informed by internal analysis and market perspective from a firm deeply engaged with both traditional and digital asset classes. For years, gold has been the go-to asset for investors seeking a store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin emerged with a similar narrative, often dubbed “digital gold.” The debate about which asset serves this purpose better, and more importantly, which offers greater growth prospects, has been central to crypto discussions. Mitchnick’s comment directly addresses the growth potential, favoring Bitcoin. Why is the “Bitcoin vs Gold” Debate Heating Up? The comparison between Bitcoin vs Gold is fundamental to understanding Bitcoin’s investment thesis, especially for traditional investors. Both assets are viewed as scarce, decentralized stores of value outside the direct control of governments or central banks. However, their characteristics and market dynamics differ significantly, leading to varying perspectives on their future performance. Let’s look at some key points of comparison: Scarcity and Supply: Gold supply increases slowly through mining, with no absolute cap known. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, enforced by its protocol. This verifiable, absolute scarcity is a core argument for its long-term value potential. Divisibility and Portability: Bitcoin is highly divisible (down to 8 decimal places, called satoshis) and instantly portable across the globe with minimal cost (relatively, depending on network conditions). Gold is less divisible and costly to transport and store securely. Verifiability: The authenticity of Bitcoin can be cryptographically verified on the blockchain. Verifying gold often requires physical inspection and expertise. Market Size and Liquidity: The gold market is vastly larger and more mature than the Bitcoin market. However, Bitcoin’s market depth and liquidity have grown dramatically, particularly with the advent of spot ETFs. Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has been far more volatile than gold. This volatility presents both higher risk and potentially higher reward, contributing to the “higher upside” argument. Institutional Adoption: While institutions have held gold for centuries, their adoption of Bitcoin is a relatively new but accelerating trend. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a prime example of increasing institutional access and interest. Here’s a simplified comparison table: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Gold (XAU) Supply Cap Fixed (21 million) No fixed cap (mined) Nature Digital Physical Divisibility Highly divisible (Satoshi) Less divisible Portability Easy, Global Difficult, Costly Verification Cryptographic (Blockchain) Physical inspection Volatility High Low to Moderate Institutional Adoption Growing Rapidly Established Mitchnick’s comment suggests that despite gold’s long history, the unique digital properties and market dynamics of Bitcoin position it for potentially greater future appreciation, largely because it is starting from a smaller base and benefits from network effects and increasing digital integration. Exploring Bitcoin’s Potential: Is Skyrocketing Price Growth Possible? The idea of significant Bitcoin price potential is central to the investment thesis for many holders. Several factors contribute to the belief that Bitcoin’s price could see substantial future growth, perhaps even dwarfing gold’s historical returns. Supply Halvings: Approximately every four years, the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation is cut in half. This programmed supply shock, while demand either remains constant or increases, has historically preceded significant price rallies. Increasing Demand: Demand is growing from multiple fronts – individual retail investors, corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, and perhaps most significantly, large financial institutions offering Bitcoin products or investing directly. Institutionalization: The launch of easy-to-access investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs opens the door for a massive pool of capital that was previously hesitant or unable to invest in Bitcoin directly. This influx of institutional money is a powerful potential catalyst. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of potential inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty, the narrative of Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized store of value becomes more appealing to a wider audience. Network Effects: As more users, developers, and businesses adopt Bitcoin, its utility and value as a network increase, creating a positive feedback loop. Comparing this to gold, gold’s price movements are typically more tied to inflation fears, currency strength, and jewelry/industrial demand. While it serves its purpose as a stable store of value, the structural factors driving potential exponential growth in Bitcoin (like halvings and rapid technological adoption) are simply not present in the gold market. Mitchnick’s perspective aligns with the view that Bitcoin, being a younger, more dynamic asset class with unique supply dynamics and growing global digital adoption, has a longer runway for appreciation than the established, mature gold market. The percentage growth required for Bitcoin to reach a market capitalization comparable to gold’s is significantly higher, implying substantial price increases per coin if that convergence were to occur. How is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Shaping the Market? The trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption is arguably the most significant development in the crypto space over the past few years. What started with a few pioneering corporate treasuries has expanded dramatically, bringing legitimacy, liquidity, and new capital into the market. BlackRock itself is a prime example. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history by assets under management. This wasn’t just about offering a product; it represented BlackRock putting its significant weight and reputation behind making Bitcoin accessible to a vast network of financial advisors and their clients. Beyond ETFs, institutions are engaging in various ways: Direct Investment: Some corporations and investment funds are holding Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets. Custody Solutions: The development of robust, regulated custody solutions has made it safer and more feasible for institutions to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Derivatives Markets: Growth in Bitcoin futures and options markets provides institutions with tools for hedging and speculation. Lending and Borrowing: Institutional-grade platforms for Bitcoin lending and borrowing are emerging. Venture Capital: Significant VC funding continues to pour into companies building infrastructure and services in the crypto space. The impact of this institutional embrace is multifaceted. It increases market liquidity, potentially reduces long-term volatility (as institutional holders tend to be long-term players), builds credibility for the asset class, and integrates Bitcoin further into the global financial system. When executives from firms like BlackRock speak positively about Bitcoin, it reinforces this trend and can influence other institutions and traditional investors. What Does This Mean for the Overall Crypto Market Outlook? The positive commentary from a BlackRock executive about Bitcoin’s potential has broader implications for the entire crypto market outlook . Bitcoin often acts as the gateway asset for institutions and new investors entering the space. Increased confidence and investment in Bitcoin can have a halo effect on other cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset ecosystem. A positive outlook for Bitcoin suggests continued interest in the underlying technology (blockchain) and other digital assets. It validates the idea that digital assets are evolving from a niche interest to a recognized asset class with a place in diversified portfolios. However, the crypto market outlook is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and uncertain across different jurisdictions. Clarity is needed for broader institutional comfort. Market Volatility: While institutional money might temper volatility over time, the crypto market is known for sharp price swings driven by sentiment, news, and macroeconomic factors. Technological Risks: While Bitcoin’s protocol has proven robust, risks related to exchanges, custody providers, or potential future technological shifts exist. Global Economic Factors: The performance of crypto assets can be influenced by interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability, just like traditional assets. Despite these challenges, the increasing institutional validation, highlighted by comments like Mitchnick’s, points towards a future where digital assets play a more prominent role in global finance. The focus remains heavily on Bitcoin as the leading institutional-grade asset, but the infrastructure and understanding built around it benefit the wider market. Weighing the Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Investment Investing in Bitcoin, especially with the perspective of its high growth potential compared to assets like gold, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges. It’s crucial for any potential investor to understand both sides. Benefits: High Growth Potential: As highlighted by the BlackRock executive, the potential for significant price appreciation due to limited supply, increasing demand, and network effects is a major draw. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning it is not controlled by any single entity, offering a degree of autonomy from traditional financial systems. Store of Value: Its fixed supply and resistance to inflation make it an attractive potential store of value, particularly in uncertain economic times. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering financial inclusion and ease of transfer. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), providing a level of transparency not found in traditional finance. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods, leading to significant risk of loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent regulation globally creates legal and operational risks. Security Risks: While the network is secure, individual investors face risks from exchange hacks, phishing scams, and losing private keys. Complexity: Understanding the technology, market dynamics, and secure storage methods can be challenging for newcomers. Market Manipulation: Although decreasing with institutional involvement, the market can still be susceptible to manipulation. The decision to invest should weigh the potential for high returns against these considerable risks. The perspective from BlackRock emphasizes the upside, but prudent investors must consider the full picture. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape Given the evolving landscape and the insights from major financial players, what steps can individuals take? Educate Yourself: Understand how Bitcoin works, its history, market cycles, and the technology behind it. Don’t rely solely on headlines or single opinions. Define Your Goals and Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone. Assess if its volatility and long-term potential align with your personal financial goals and comfort level with risk. Start Small: If you decide to invest, consider starting with a small amount you are comfortable losing. Consider Your Investment Method: Decide whether direct ownership (managing your own keys) or using regulated products like ETFs (offering convenience and familiar structures) is better suited for you. Prioritize Security: If holding Bitcoin directly, learn about and use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication on exchanges. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and analysis on the crypto market, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Think Long-Term: Many investors view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Short-term price swings can be significant, but the long-term trend has historically been upward. Comments from figures like Robert Mitchnick provide valuable context from the institutional world, but individual research and a clear strategy are paramount. Conclusion Robert Mitchnick’s statement that Bitcoin offers greater price growth potential than gold is a powerful indicator of how perspectives on digital assets are shifting within traditional finance. Coming from a leader at BlackRock, a firm deeply embedded in both traditional markets and increasingly in the crypto space, the comment underscores a growing institutional belief in Bitcoin’s future. The debate between Bitcoin vs Gold as a store of value continues, but the focus is clearly moving towards which asset offers superior potential returns in the digital age. Bitcoin’s unique characteristics—fixed supply, digital nature, growing institutional adoption, and dynamic market cycles—position it differently from the mature gold market. While the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market outlook involves navigating significant volatility and regulatory hurdles, the increasing validation from major financial institutions suggests that digital assets are here to stay and are being seriously considered for their long-term growth prospects. Investors should view such comments as valuable insights, but always couple them with thorough personal research and a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved in this exciting, yet unpredictable, market.

This decision sees the firm add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, a trend gaining traction among forward-thinking companies seeking alternative store-of-value assets and growth opportunities in the digital economy. Why Are Companies Adding Bitcoin to Their Corporate Treasury? The decision by companies like Captor Capital to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury reserves isn’t merely speculative; it’s often a calculated strategic play. Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold cash and short-term, low-yield investments to manage liquidity and preserve capital. However, in the current economic climate characterized by inflation concerns and low interest rates, the purchasing power of fiat currency can erode over time. Adding Bitcoin to the corporate treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) is often cited as a defense against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as digital gold, a scarce asset that can retain value over the long term. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional assets. Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional financial markets and assets. Signal to Market: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and adaptability to investors and the market. While pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla made headlines with large Bitcoin acquisitions, the move by Captor Capital demonstrates that this strategy is being adopted by a broader range of firms, including those in diverse sectors like investment and potentially cannabis (given Captor Capital’s known interests). Captor Capital’s Specific Crypto Investment: What Happened? According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, Captor Capital announced it had acquired $500,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) for its treasury. This specific crypto investment represents a deliberate decision to allocate a portion of the company’s capital into the leading digital asset. Accompanying this acquisition, the firm also disclosed the issuance of $450,000 in unsecured convertible loan notes. These notes were issued to a European institutional investor. Convertible notes are a type of debt that can be converted into equity (shares) under certain conditions. Using such instruments can provide capital for acquisitions or operations while offering the investor potential upside linked to the company’s future performance, or in this context, potentially linked to future equity or other arrangements. This structure suggests a carefully planned financial manoeuvre, linking the strategic asset acquisition (Bitcoin) with a specific funding mechanism involving an institutional player. Understanding Institutional Adoption in Crypto The involvement of a European institutional investor in financing Captor Capital’s move is just as significant as the Bitcoin purchase itself. Institutional adoption refers to the increasing participation of large financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds in the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement is crucial because: It brings substantial capital into the market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It often leads to the development of regulated products and infrastructure (like futures, options, and custody solutions) that make crypto more accessible and palatable for other large players. Captor Capital, as an investment firm itself, making a direct treasury allocation and simultaneously engaging with an institutional investor for financing, exemplifies this trend. It shows growing confidence not just in Bitcoin as an asset, but also in the evolving financial structures around it that facilitate larger transactions and corporate involvement. Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While the potential benefits discussed earlier are attractive, holding Bitcoin in a corporate treasury is not without its challenges. Potential Benefits: Potential appreciation significantly boosting treasury value. Protection against long-term fiat devaluation. Enhanced appeal to investors interested in digital assets. Setting a precedent or leadership position in their sector regarding digital asset integration. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses in the treasury value. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction (often treated as intangible assets subject to impairment). Security Risks: Securely storing private keys requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies globally. Public Perception: Some stakeholders might view Bitcoin investment as risky or outside the company’s core business. Companies undertaking this strategy must carefully weigh these factors and implement strong risk management protocols. Actionable Insights from Captor Capital’s Move For investors and businesses watching the space, Captor Capital’s action provides several insights: Institutional Interest is Real: The involvement of a European institutional investor in the financing underscores that large financial players are actively participating, not just watching. Treasury Strategy is Evolving: Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate component for long-term treasury management, not just a speculative trading asset. Size Matters, But Trend is Key: While $500,000 might seem modest compared to billion-dollar corporate holdings, it signals intent and a shift in capital allocation strategy for a firm like Captor Capital. It adds to the growing number of companies engaging with the asset class. Financing Mechanisms are Developing: The use of convertible notes shows how traditional financial instruments are being adapted to facilitate crypto-related corporate activities. Monitoring such moves across different sectors and geographies provides valuable insight into the pace and nature of broader institutional adoption . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Acceptance Captor Capital’s decision to add Bitcoin to treasury reserves, supported by institutional financing, is more than just a news item; it’s another brick in the wall of institutional adoption for cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the increasing willingness of publicly traded companies and investment firms to hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset for their corporate treasury signifies a maturing market and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This crypto investment move by a Canadian firm, backed by European capital, illustrates the global nature of this evolving financial trend.

Major players are positioning early with Bitcoin trading just below its all-time high. However, smart money isn’t only focused on BTC. It’s rotating into assets that combine upside potential with real-world application. Two strong contenders gaining momentum are Worldcoin and Remittix , both offering fresh value compared to legacy options like XRP. Bitcoin price holds firm near record highs Source: Coinmarketcap The Bitcoin price is currently around $109,317 , which is within reach of its all-time high of $111,970.17. Traders are watching the $112,000 level for a confirmed breakout. With macro conditions improving and ETF activity rebounding, momentum could push BTC into new territory. Some analysts now expect a short-term climb toward $117,000 or even $120,000. Institutional flows continue to build. BTC is still seen as a digital reserve by hedge funds and high-net-worth portfolios. But many of those same players are now diversifying into faster-moving projects with room to run. XRP remains steady but eyes are shifting Source: Financemagnets XRP is holding support around $2.31. It’s stable, and sentiment is improving as the market anticipates further regulatory clarity. Some models project that XRP could reach $8 in 2025 . That would be a solid return, but some investors are now looking for assets with different use cases or more immediate upside. This shift is where rising projects come in, especially ones with traction in areas XRP hasn’t fully captured, like identity and fiat conversion. Worldcoin pushes higher with growing use case Worldcoin has gained significant attention over the last few weeks. The token is trading at $1.35, and some forecasts suggest a push toward $2.40 if volume continues to rise. But the appeal here is not just about price. The WLD ecosystem is built around solving one of crypto’s biggest gaps: identity. By offering a global digital identity layer, WLD aims to onboard users in underserved regions who need access to finance, not just speculation. With $135 million in recent funding and growing adoption across markets, WLD is emerging as more than just an altcoin and it’s a project with a real mission. This direction makes it a true rival to XRP, but with a newer and broader scope. Remittix keeps it simple and functional While bigger names dominate the news, Remittix is gaining quiet traction by focusing on real-world utility. It allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. There are no middle steps, wallet confusion or hidden FX charges. For businesses, Remittix offers a plug-and-play API to accept crypto and settle in fiat, across 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs. The simplicity of the process is what’s getting early investor interest. With $15.3 million raised and the token still in presale, RTX could find a strong foothold in the cross-border payments space. Final thoughts The Bitcoin price is moving with confidence, and that’s pulling capital back into the market. While BTC and XRP remain strong, the conversation is expanding. Investors are betting on projects that solve new problems, not just scale old ones. WLD is redefining digital identity. Remittix is streamlining how crypto becomes usable money. Both are becoming serious contenders for those seeking strong XRP alternatives in this next cycle.

Bitcoin vs. Gold: Not a Zero-Sum Game Mitchnick made it clear that comparing Bitcoin and gold doesn’t have to be a competition. Instead, he sees both as strong assets that serve a similar purpose, helping investors hedge against traditional financial risks. Meanwhile, he described them as “different angles on a similar theme,” highlighting that both are scarce, decentralized, and not controlled by governments.

It’s cheaper to store, easy to transfer globally, and works efficiently within a tech-driven financial ecosystem. Digital Advantages Give Bitcoin the Edge Mitchnick noted Bitcoin’s modern advantages. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved instantly across the world with nearly zero cost. These features make it highly attractive to both retail and institutional investors looking for quick and flexible alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets. That’s why he believes Bitcoin has greater upside potential and, surprisingly, less downside risk than many think. “Many investors are adding both to their portfolios,” he said, pointing out that allocation shifts like 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin or even 50-50 are becoming more common. Bitcoin Price Outlook Looking at the bitcoin price, it has dropped by almost 3% after reaching a new record high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at about $109,000, and its total market value is at $2.16 trillion. There’s some interesting data from CoinGlass . It shows that a short squeeze could be coming.

Nvidia wants to take a $5.5B write down on H20 units imports to China BREAKING: $NVDA NVIDIA SAYS THE US GOVERNMENT HAS BANNED THEM FROM SELLING THEIR H20 CHIPS TO CHINA FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS AS A RESULT, THEY EXPECT TO TAKE A $5.5B CHARGE TO FISCAL Q1 EARNINGS $NVDA -3.5% pic.twitter.com/iZo4cvccXJ — amit (@amitisinvesting) April 15, 2025 In a filing, Nvidia responded to the new restrictions, saying it’s prepared to take a $5.5 billion write-down on inventory tied to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations. Analysts at BNP Paribas argued that it was the biggest write-down in the history of the chip industry. The analysts believe that the potential impact of Nvidia’s write-down on future revenue will be hefty. David O’Connor, an analyst at BNB Paribas, acknowledged that the inventory write-off implies a $15 billion H20 revenue hit on a rolling 12-month basis. The H20 AI chips generated an estimated $12 billion to $15 billion in revenue in 2024. During President Joe Biden’s administration, the U.S. government issued concerns that AI chips from Nvidia and other semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices could be used to create supercomputers for adversaries’ military purposes. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the firm’s last quarterly earnings call in February that revenue from China had plummeted to half of pre-export control levels. He also warned that competition in China is growing, and for the second straight year, Nvidia listed Huawei as a competitor in its annual filing. According to LSEG, analysts expect Nvidia to post 66% revenue growth to $43.28 billion for the quarter ended in April. That level marks a sharp deceleration from a year ago when the company recorded more than 250% growth. The U.S.’s new export license requirements have triggered a lot of uncertainty surrounding projections for the rest of the year. The average analyst estimate predicts a 53% growth report in the current quarter, with a similar number expected for the full fiscal year ending in January. “While our thinking at the time was that this was at least partly expected by the management team, it became clear after the ban that the company had been getting indications that H20 would be OK and that they were materially surprised.” -Morgan Stanley analysts. The bank’s analysts on Tuesday acknowledged that potential issues that might hinder investors, like the impact of the U.S.’s ban on the sale of H20 chips to China, are well-telegraphed, and the path to a re-acceleration was clear. The analysts said they are not explicitly purchasing the stock for the quarter but are buying it for what they believe is coming. Nvidia introduces plan to export chips to the Middle East Huang mentioned earlier this month in Taiwan that Nvidia used to have a 95% market share of graphics processing units in China, but it’s been reduced to 50% under chip restrictions. The tech company said in a filing with the SEC in February it recorded $17.1 billion in annual sales to customers that had an address in China, including Hong Kong, the company’s fourth-largest market. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s CEO has argued that restricting the export of Nvidia’s chips to China will only motivate engineers there to invent their processors, bolstering the country’s AI semiconductor industry. Wedbush Securities analysts said Tuesday the impact of tighter export restrictions on China is softened by demand growth in the Middle East. Nvidia revealed a deal to supply chips to a Saudi Arabian startup earlier this month and reportedly is also involved in a deal allowing the UAE to import advanced American-made chips. Wedbush’s analysts said AI spending from Saudi Arabia and UAE could help fill the void left by China’s uncertainty in Nvidia’s future business.

The crypto community has taken notice, and for good reason: the very day SharpLink made its announcement, its stock shot up—up, up, and away—by an utterly insane 262%. Even with recent sharp increases in value, analysts are still recommending caution when it comes to Ethereum. A huge chunk of its market cap (around $123 billion) is positioned only 0–20% above the necessary breakeven point to convert the current holders into actual profit. That’s not a lot of room for the asset to play around with under the cover of seeming healthy market sentiment. In a declining price scenario, that covers at least 10% of the holders who would be pushed into a loss—they’re not gonna like that, and it seems at this point quite likely that at least 10% of the holders are gonna cover. Covering can be done in a variety of ways. COMPANIES ARE NOW PLANNING TO BUY $ETH Just now, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming announced a $𝟒𝟐𝟓,𝟎𝟎𝟎,𝟎𝟎𝟎 raise to buy Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming's stock price is up 𝟐𝟔𝟐% after this news I hope it becomes a success like MicroStrategy and sends ETH above… pic.twitter.com/9ryalm0Vum — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) May 27, 2025 Institutional Momentum Building for Ethereum? SharpLink has decided to buy Bitcoin, and its decision echoes that of MicroStrategy. The high-profile business of MicroStrategy made headlines in 2020 and beyond with its bold Bitcoin acquisition strategy. That campaign helped push BTC into a more mainstream financial conversation and played a key role in the asset being valued at all-time highs. Is Ethereum the next target? SharpLink’s initiative may be one of the largest public raises specifically aimed at purchasing ETH, and it could well set a precedent for more corporate treasuries to diversify into Ethereum as a long-term investment. In an environment where crypto is increasingly viewed as an inflation hedge and as a bulwark against the continued debasement of fiat currencies, the growing appeal of ETH is further enhanced by its burgeoning use case—from decentralized finance to NFTs to smart contracts. Should other publicly traded firms choose to emulate SharpLink—and there are already hints that some may—this could yield pressure on Ethereum’s price that lasts. Analysts and enthusiasts even wonder aloud whether, in this next market cycle, ETH might punch through resistance that is more psychological than real on its way to $10,000. ETH Price Gains vs. Market Fragility Even though there is now a lot of interest from institutions, Ethereum’s current standing is still weak. A recent look at the data puts most of ETH’s market cap in wallets that are just barely in the money. These wallets hold coins that are only 0-20% above acquisition prices. So, if the price were to correct even slightly—say, back toward the $2,300 price point—there would be a large number of holders who’d suddenly find themselves in the position of holding ETH with an acquisition price that’s above the current market price. The largest share of #ETH market cap – $123B – sits just 0–20% above cost basis. That cohort swelled from $2.3K to $2.5K, meaning even a modest price drop could flip a large chunk of supply into loss. Despite recent gains, $ETH remains in a fragile position. pic.twitter.com/5Ay5Jx5Qv5 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 The fragility poses risks, especially when sentiment is this bullish. SharpLink’s announcement has undoubtedly injected momentum into the ETH narrative but could also set unrealistic expectations. If Ethereum fails to deliver on short-term price gains, the fragility could lead to amplified disappointment among retail investors and institutions. Even so, Ethereum has taken a beating, just like many other cryptocurrencies, yet it has reasserted itself as a foundational layer for the .”decentralized web”—or what some might call the future of the internet. This is because Ethereum has scaled, allowing far more transactions to occur on its network than before, and it has upgraded from the “proof-of-work” format to the vastly more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” format. And these changes have occurred within a broader upgrade to the rules of the Ethereum network itself. Looking Ahead: A New Chapter for Ethereum? SharpLink Gaming’s $425 million influx is a lot more than a finance play. It signals an even bolder confidence in the future of Ethereum. Whether public companies make this a trend will be shown in time, but the implications for Ethereum as a public company are significant in several ways. If nothing else, in an era where public companies are cutting back and putting their own cash on their balance sheets, this is the clearest sign yet that Ethereum retains a compelling use case. Yet, investors and watchers of this space must proceed with great caution. An asset class can shift in fundamental quality in the blink of an eye, and dramatic price moves are not uncommon. If you’re bullish on crypto, you might take this morning’s announcement from SharpLink as more bullish news in an overall cautious market, one with a lot of uncertain player and price dynamics.

Token jumps 20% as protocol upgrade vote nears conclusion,https://crypto.news/will-cetus-price-recover-token-jumps-20-as-protocol-upgrade-vote-nears-conclusion/,"CETUS price continues to mount a recovery as investor optimism grows amid a decisive on-chain vote that could unlock $162 million in frozen funds and pave the way for full user reimbursement following the recent exploit. Cetus ( CETUS ) is up 20% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.15, as the token attempts to recover from the fallout on May 22. On that day, CETUS price plunged 30% intraday—from the peak of $0.25 to a low of $0.14—after CETUS DEX had suffered a security breach that siphoned approximately $223 million worth of assets. The price continued to slide in the days that followed, eventually hitting a post-fallout low of $0.12—marking a steep 52% drop from the May 22 peak. Since May 26, CETUS has shown signs of recovery, climbing to $0.17 before pulling back to its current level. The recent price action suggests a possible consolidation phase as the market digests the impact of the exploit. If CETUS can break through the local resistance at $0.17 with sustained momentum, the next significant hurdle lies around $0.19. This level marks the lower boundary of the consolidation range where CETUS was trading before the sharp breakout—and subsequent crash—on May 22. A successful move above $0.19 would open the path toward $0.23, a key resistance level where the price faced multiple rejections in May.

The Sui Foundation’s loan specifically covers the portion of the $223 million exploit that was bridged off the Sui network before validators froze the hacker’s wallets. Compensation to users is set to proceed regardless of the vote’s outcome, but full reimbursement hinges on its approval. At press time, over 32% of the necessary votes have been cast in favor—just 18.5% more is needed to meet the approval threshold. Trader sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with some even speculating that CETUS price could reclaim the $0.25 level, where it was trading before the breach. However, to reach that target, the price must first overcome two major resistance levels: $0.19, the former consolidation floor, and $0.23, a zone where the token faced repeated rejection earlier in May. IMO, this is a no-brainer. The majority of validators from @SuiNetwork have already voted YES — literally all who voted so far. The rest simply haven’t voted yet, but they will soon — and they’ll vote YES too.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading above $2,600, breaking its nearest key resistance level. Also, the second biggest crypto is still up 42% on a month-over-month basis. Zooming out, ETH’s price has been range trading between $2,225 and $2,500 since May 9th, leading some analysts to offer their respective Ethereum price predictions. As ETH’s price has remained relatively flat for years, other cryptos enter the conversation. The latest PI Network news suggests increasing token inflows to exchanges, which can hurt prices. Now, a PayFi-themed crypto is inching toward presale that can potentially spoil ETH’s or even Pi Network’s promised near-term ROI. Remittix Promises to End PayFi Drama with Quick and Cheap Cross-Border Payments Digitalization of payments, while considered a driving force for economic progress, isn’t exactly delivering on its promise. Per Piero Cipollone of the European Central Bank (ECB), the massive digitalization of payments has not translated to lower fees. Remittix , with its RTX token, enters the mix with a smart approach to cross-border payments—crypto-to-fiat settlements that aren’t just quick, they’re cost-efficient, with a flat fee. And since Remittix is built on the blockchain, the platform’s users enjoy security and transparency in every transaction. There’s the ERC 20-standard token, the RTX, which acts as the platform’s foundation. Holders can use their tokens not just for potential trading profit, but also in setting Remittix’s future direction and payment landscape. Remittix’s smart contract is built on the Ethereum chain and has been audited as ‘Very Safe’ by BlockSAFU. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Breaks Resistance at $2,600 Level Source: ETH continues to trade sideways Ethereum has made progress in its recent sideways trading after breaking its key $2,000 resistance level. Now that this barrier is clear, some pundits put their next Ethereum price prediction at $2,720. If this level breaks again, then traders can look for more gains in the next market sessions. A bullish movement for ETH can push it to another resistance zone, at $2,800, or even top $2,850. Also, on-chain data for Ethereum looks good, with smart contract deployment spiking again, then there’s news about its latest Pectra upgrade. Pi Network News Roundup: PI’s Price Dipped Below 50-Day EMA Source: PI on the verge of another price collapse As ETH gradually pushes up, PI is currently struggling with a few negative Pi Network news stories coming its way. PI is currently trading above $0.7382, -4.1% from the previous day’s close, and has crashed by nearly 32% in two weeks. PI dipped below its 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.7910, and has recently displayed a bearish flag pattern. If the bearish sentiment continues, this crypto may fall to $0.6584. PiScan data suggests that it may fall with investors and whales moving their tokens to exchanges. On-chain data suggests that addresses have moved $4.1 million tokens into OKX recently, and withdrawals at 2.2 million. There was also a net flow of 721k to Bitget and 2,176 to Pionex. Can Remittix Outperform ETH and Pi Network in the Next Few Months? ETH is an established crypto with a highly efficient chain for smart contracts, and Pi Network is still in its infancy stage. Although ETH can potentially rise to $2,700 in the short term, this only translates to just 4% in growth. In contrast, Remittix is heating up its presale with programmed price hikes at every stage. The RTX token is listed at $0.0781 and looks at $0.0811 in its next presale stage. With $15.4 million raised so far, and diminishing numbers of RTX tokens for sale before its next leg-up, now’s an opportunity for those looking to get in.

According to a May 28 press release from the regulator, ASIC alleges that Guo was involved in the mismanagement of customer funds and failed to maintain proper records during his time at Blockchain Global, the now-liquidated operator of ACX Exchange. The civil penalty proceedings have been brought in the Federal Court. ASIC claims Guo made false and misleading statements about the handling of ACX customer assets and breached his duties as a director by failing to ensure the company maintained adequate financial documentation. ACX allegedly misused the funds, which ultimately led to the platform’s collapse in late 2019, when users were unable to withdraw their assets. Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from 2016 to 2019, until its collapse. In February of 2022, the company was placed into liquidation, and subsequent court proceedings revealed that customer deposits were used to purchase crypto assets and were commingled into a single pooled fund, rather than being kept in segregated accounts. You might also like: ASIC sues Binance over allegedly failing to provide consumer protection for retail clients ASIC launched its investigation into Blockchain Global in January 2024, after court-appointed liquidators submitted a detailed report in November 2023 estimating that the company owed over 58 million Australian dollars to unsecured creditors, including more than 22 million Australian dollars claimed by former ACX customers. Guo was subject to interim travel restraint orders starting February 2024 but departed Australia in September after the orders expired. ASIC confirmed he has not returned since. The regulator is also considering potential criminal charges in relation to Guo’s alleged conduct, including the use of company funds for personal expenses such as mortgage payments. ASIC’s pursuit of Guo aligns with a broader regulatory trend in Australia toward more comprehensive oversight of digital asset platforms. In March, Australia’s Treasury department proposed fresh licensing requirements for digital asset platforms that hold customer funds, pushing them under the umbrella of traditional financial services law. Under the proposal, exchanges, custodians, and stablecoin issuers are expected to face new obligations, ranging from redemption safeguards to transparency rules on token listings. Meanwhile, in April, AUSTRAC, the country’s financial intelligence agency, warned that inactive crypto exchanges still listed on its register risk being deregistered, citing concerns that they could be exploited by criminals for money laundering and fraud.

Ever since it surpassed $64,000 for the first time in mid-April, it has continued climbing, recently hitting price levels around $68,000. And it’s not just the price itself that is impressive, but rather the number of influential participants in the ecosystem and how they’ve been behaving along with the price. Ostensibly, the price seems to be signaling powerfully in one direction: up. But you can never understand market dynamics purely through price. In this case, you do have to look under the hood. And what you’re finding underneath the Bitcoin hood tends to reinforce belief that this price uptick is undergirded as much by power dynamics in the ecosystem as it is by just plain old price action. Bitcoin Whales on the Rise Amid New Price Milestone Bitcoin whales, often seen as key market movers because of their large holdings, now number 1,455 entities, up from a contraction in late April. This renewed growth among the largest of Bitcoin holders reflects either a new accumulation phase or consolidation among holders of the original cryptocurrency. At the very least, a higher count of Bitcoin whales signals a ramped-up interest in the storied asset among some very wealthy or institutional players. After dipping in late April, the number of #Bitcoin whales (≥1k $BTC ) has resumed its climb – reaching 1,455 entities even as the price hit a new ATH: https://t.co/O9oN7mZlLk pic.twitter.com/2zebaS6vik — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 In the Bitcoin ecosystem, whales have a really big role. Their buy and sell decisions result in a liquidity influx or just as much in a liquidity drain, and are therefore pretty much the most direct influence on the market. The number of Bitcoin whales has been on the rise. This could signal that confidence remains strong among the biggest holders. Nonetheless, it’s critical to point out that a rise in the number of whale holders doesn’t equate to all whales stacking more Bitcoin. Reflecting developments in the whale segment, we could be seeing two things: 1. A count increase in actual whale wallets, which signals a favorable trend for the distribution of Bitcoin among major holders. 2. An increase in the number of wallets with at least 1,000 BTC, which could mean that some of the new wallets are simply picking up chunks of Bitcoin. Miners Respond to ATH with Increased Selling Activity Ever since the price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of miners selling their newly minted coins on exchanges. Recent data shows that daily inflows of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges have doubled—from an average of 25 BTC per day to around 50 BTC per day. This is an impressive, if not quite astonishing, acceleration, and it is one that has surely caught the eye of quite a few market observers as of late. After the ATH, miners have stepped up their sales on exchanges. Inflows have doubled from an average of 25BTC to 50BTC per day, while historical peaks reach around 100BTC. This shows that selling has indeed accelerated though we’re still a long way from peak volumes and the… pic.twitter.com/fTsGLyKovc — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 This increase in miner selling is a direct response to the market. Sometimes miners just sell to cover the basic operational costs that you would expect from any business—stuff like electricity and maintaining the actual hardware. But when the price of Bitcoin doubles, and you’re the one producing it, it becomes quite reasonable to take some profits on the way up. Even with the rising sales, the market has seemed capable of taking in this extra supply. This points to a very liquid market and a demand from buyers that seems ongoing and ready to absorb miner selling without causing much in the way of price disruption. There is a balance right now between how much miners are supplying and how much the market is able to take in. And that balance is crucial if we want to avoid having the price skyrocket in a bull run or crash under selling pressure when the network is collapsing for some reason. Miner Revenue Signals Strong Network Activity, But Room to Grow The generation of revenue for miners offers another glimpse into the health of the Bitcoin network and the dynamics of its market. At present, miners are bringing in about $50 million daily in Bitcoin rewards and, yes, fees. That number is a big one, a sign that mining is going on at a scale at which sufficient security is being delivered to the network. At present, miners are earning around $50M per day, while historical revenue peaks exceed $80M. This indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity: miners are already generating significant income, yet there’s still room to climb back to those previous highs. pic.twitter.com/OKFof2GalA — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 Miners have surpassed historical revenue highs of $80 million per day, suggesting that not only are we at a high point now, but there’s still room to grow before hitting the levels of past peaks. It makes you wonder just how far network activity and overall profitability can go. And is there more incentive for miners to hop on board or for the price of the assets themselves to appreciate? This interplay between miner earnings and market conditions often acts as a bellwether for Bitcoin’s broader ecosystem. Higher miner revenue can incentivize increased mining capacity and network security, but it also leads to higher sell pressure as miners convert rewards into fiat or other assets. The recent trends surrounding Bitcoin whales and miner selling provide us with a somewhat complicated view of the current Bitcoin market. Selling by miners has increased because they’re now taking advantage of the higher prices. They’re clearly not holding onto their Bitcoin in any significant amounts anymore, and they don’t seem to be too worried about the upcoming halving. Whales, on the other hand, seem confident in the future of Bitcoin. They’re not selling, and in fact, some of them might even be buying. The market seems capable of absorbing significant amounts of Bitcoin without too much fuss. The current evolution of Bitcoin provides a fascinating glimpse into its dynamic future. Watching the balance between whale accumulation, miner liquidation, and demand from the wider world will be vital to understanding just what the price action and overall network health will be across the next months. In these parts, it’s generally understood that our ecosystem is vibrant. Whale numbers are up, miner revenues (while solid) aren’t through the roof, and that means we’ve still got the appearance of a maturing, healthy Bitcoin.

Trump’s CFTC Nominee Holds Stakes in Crypto Funds and Prediction Markets Quintenz’s portfolio includes interests in three AH Capital funds, as well as equity in prediction markets firm Kalshi and derivatives brokerage Next Level Derivatives. Both firms fall squarely within CFTC’s regulatory scope, suggesting potential conflicts if he assumes the chairmanship. Quintenz’s ties to Kalshi are particularly notable, given the company’s recent legal clash with the CFTC over election markets. In a letter to the agency’s Designated Ethics Official, he pledged to recuse himself from any matters involving Kalshi for a year and a16z-related issues for two years. He also committed to resigning from all corporate roles and divesting conflicting assets within 90 days of Senate confirmation. Additionally, he will forfeit unvested equity options and seek ongoing ethics guidance, while retaining unpaid trustee duties for two family trusts. Thank you Coach / @SenTuberville !

Quintenz’s nomination signals a continued pivot by the Trump administration toward more crypto-friendly leadership at key financial agencies.

Mersinger emphasized the importance of offering these products under U.S. regulation, suggesting it would boost market integrity and benefit both the crypto industry and the wider economy. She also noted that the rising adoption of crypto assets in the U.S. signals their staying power. Perpetual futures are a form of derivatives allowing traders to speculate on crypto prices without expiration. Mersinger’s departure from the CFTC is timely, as she transitions to a new role at the Blockchain Association, where she aims to contribute to upcoming stablecoin and market structure legislation.

For those following the cryptocurrency space, particularly the segment focused on stablecoins, a significant development is unfolding in Washington D.C. A key piece of legislation aimed at establishing US stablecoin regulation is advancing through the U.S. Senate, potentially setting a major precedent for the future of digital finance in the country. What is the GENIUS Act and Why is it Significant? The bill at the center of this attention is known as the GENIUS Act. This proposed law recently cleared a crucial procedural hurdle, passing the cloture stage for floor consideration in the U.S. Senate on April 20th. Now, according to reports, it has entered the final stage of Senate deliberation. This is a big deal because, if passed, it would mark the first time in eight years that a piece of legislation has successfully navigated through the Senate Banking Committee. Its progress highlights a growing bipartisan focus on establishing a framework for US stablecoin regulation . Championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming known for her pro-crypto stance, the GENIUS Act aims to bring clarity and structure to the stablecoin market. Senator Lummis has been a vocal advocate for responsible innovation in the digital asset space, emphasizing the need for consumer protection and financial stability. Key Requirements of the GENIUS Act: Licensing, Reserves, and Disclosure So, what exactly does the GENIUS Act propose? The core components of this Stablecoin bill address some of the most critical aspects of stablecoin operation: Licensing Requirements: The bill mandates that entities wishing to issue stablecoins must obtain appropriate licenses. This moves away from a potentially unregulated environment towards one where issuers are subject to regulatory oversight. 100% Reserve Requirements: A cornerstone of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves that are 100% backed by high-quality, liquid assets. This provision aims to ensure that stablecoins maintain their peg to the underlying asset (like the U.S. dollar) and that users can redeem their stablecoins reliably, even during times of market stress. Disclosure Obligations: The GENIUS Act also requires issuers to disclose information about their reserves and operations. Transparency is key in building trust in financial instruments, and these disclosure rules are intended to provide users and regulators with a clear picture of how a stablecoin is backed and managed. These requirements are designed to mitigate risks associated with stablecoins, such as potential runs if reserves are insufficient or lack transparency, which could pose risks to financial stability. Navigating the Senate Crypto Bill: What Happens Next? With the Senate crypto bill now in its final deliberation phase, the focus shifts to potential floor votes and further negotiations. The legislative process can be complex, involving debates, potential amendments, and votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives before a bill can become law. The fact that it has reached this stage is a positive sign for proponents of stablecoin regulation, indicating momentum. The progress of the GENIUS Act is being closely watched by the entire cryptocurrency industry, financial institutions, and regulators alike. Its potential enactment could provide a much-needed federal framework for stablecoins, which currently operate under a patchwork of state and federal guidelines, or sometimes none at all. Potential Impact of Crypto Regulation US If the GENIUS Act is successfully enacted, it could serve as a benchmark for Crypto regulation US -wide, specifically for stablecoins. Here’s a look at some potential impacts: Increased Stability and Trust: Clear rules, especially regarding reserves and transparency, could enhance the stability and trustworthiness of stablecoins, potentially encouraging wider adoption by both retail users and institutions. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A federal framework would reduce the current uncertainty faced by stablecoin issuers and users, making it easier for businesses to build and operate using stablecoins. Potential for Innovation: While regulation adds constraints, clear rules can also foster innovation by providing a stable environment for development within defined boundaries. Challenges for Issuers: Meeting strict licensing, reserve, and disclosure requirements could be challenging or costly for some existing or prospective stablecoin issuers. Impact on Decentralized Stablecoins: The requirements of the bill might pose unique challenges for decentralized or algorithmic stablecoins that do not rely on traditional reserves in the same way as centralized, fiat-backed stablecoins. The debate around this bill highlights the broader conversation about how to integrate digital assets into the existing financial system safely and effectively. Actionable Insights for the Community What does the progress of this Stablecoin bill mean for you, whether you are a stablecoin user, issuer, or simply interested in the crypto space? Stay Informed: Follow the legislative process closely. Developments in the Senate and potentially the House will shape the future landscape. Understand the Risks: Even with potential regulation, understanding the specific mechanics and risks of any stablecoin you use remains crucial. Engage with Policy Discussions: If you are involved in the industry, consider engaging with policymakers or industry groups to voice perspectives on how regulation should be shaped. The final form of the GENIUS Act, if passed, will depend on the outcomes of the final deliberations and potential votes. However, its current progress signals a clear intent from some lawmakers to establish a formal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Clarity The advancement of the GENIUS Act through the U.S. Senate represents a significant step towards establishing comprehensive US stablecoin regulation . By proposing clear rules around licensing, 100% reserves, and disclosure, the bill aims to enhance stability, protect consumers, and provide clarity for the burgeoning stablecoin market. While the legislative journey is not yet complete, reaching the final stage of Senate deliberation is a critical milestone that underscores the growing importance of digital asset policy in the United States. The outcome of this process will likely have a lasting impact on the future growth and adoption of stablecoins within the U.S. financial system.

45192797,https://crypto.news/?p=14383643,1748418030,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/45192797.jpeg,Two crypto investors charged with kidnapping and torturing a man for his Bitcoin password,https://crypto.news/two-crypto-investors-charged-with-kidnapping-and-torturing-a-man-for-his-bitcoin-password/,"Police have apprehended two crypto investors who were allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torturing of an Italian man in a Manhattan townhouse. The victim claimed his captors forced him to reveal his Bitcoin account password. According to a recent report by AP News, 32-year-old William Duplessie has surrendered to the police over the alleged kidnapping of a man who claimed he was tortured for weeks in a posh New York townhouse by crypto investors seeking to extort his Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. Duplessie is the second alleged culprit to be apprehended by the police. He faces charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon. His accomplice, fellow crypto investor John Woeltz, was taken into custody four days earlier after the victim managed to escape their grasp. Duplessie is known online as the co-founder and head of sourcing at Pangea Blockchain Fund and an avid investor in blockchain firms. While Woeltz has described himself as a blockchain investor who spent time in Silicon Valley before becoming involved in the crypto mining sector in Kentucky. On May 23, a 28-year-old Italian man found by a traffic agent at the side of the road. Bloodied and barefoot, the victim claimed to have been beaten, drugged, shocked with electricity and threatened with death for nearly three weeks in an eight-bedroom townhouse located in Soho, Manhattan. According to the police, the victim was lured to the townhouse by Duplessie and Woeltz on May 6. The two crypto investors allegedly attempted to extort the man to give up his Bitcoin account password.

At one point, he said he was even dangled from the top of the stairs. Believing he would be killed soon if he did not comply to their demands, the victim agreed on Friday morning to reveal his Bitcoin account password to the captors. When the two men went to get the victim’s computer, the victim managed to escape from the home. He is currently hospitalized for his injuries that appeared consistent with the evidence authorities found in the Manhattan townhouse. In the past few weeks, there have been a series of violent crimes involving crypto investors and industry leaders. Most recently, on May 27, the French police detained more than 12 suspects for their alleged involvement in two Paris kidnapping attempts involving a crypto entrepreneur and a crypto exchange CEO.

This most recent event is much like previous disturbances in that it centers on an attempted cybersecurity extortion scheme. What sets it apart, however, is that the bad actors involved in this incident attempted to gain the upper hand by first doing something that no one in the crypto space should have to worry about: they released a bunch of personal, sensitive, and now totally useless documents that were supposed to be private. Instagram Account of Rapper Migos Hijacked to Spread Leaked Materials When hackers took over the official Instagram account of the late rapper group Migos, the attack served a more sinister and specific purpose. Using the Migos account—a high-profile target—the attackers shared images that included copies of Raj Gokal’s passport, personal family photographs, and other identifying materials that one would expect to be part of KYC verification. These were not just run-of-the-mill identity documents; they were the types of materials that a financial institution might expect a customer to produce in order to open an account. JUST IN: Hackers compromised rapper Migos’ Instagram account to leak Solana co-founder @rajgokal 's passport, ID, and family pictures. The materials appear to be KYC images, raising questions about whether the source may be linked to recent @coinbase data breach. The caption… pic.twitter.com/wKEVKP1dFi — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 27, 2025 The post indicated quite strongly, with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” that the breach was part of an extortion campaign. The demand—equal to about $2.7 million USD at today’s market rates—was said to have been turned down by Gokal, with the attackers then going public with the materials in order to up their pressure game. The posts were taken down not long after they had been put up, but they had been seen too widely by then to be effective. The choice of a celebrity account to hack into, likely for its huge audience and user engagement, signals that these guys wanted their act to be taken seriously and to make as big a splash as possible. Suspicions Point Toward Larger Data Breach, Possibly Tied to Coinbase The kind of documents—especially the seeming KYC materials—has raised queries concerning how the assailants acquired such delicate data. Some analysts are now speculating that the documents’ source could be tied to a recent data breach at Coinbase, although no formal link has been established. Identity verification for compliance reasons is mandatory for regulated exchanges and platforms, which also happen to be the very places where KYC information is stored. If a breach comes from any of these entities, then Gokal’s case is one of many—and it raises an important question about the safety of crypto wallet information. Adding to the worry, Gokal had tweeted only a few days prior to the Instagram incident that he had been the target of a series of hacking attempts. He reported that nefarious individuals had been trying to gain access to his accounts—Apple, Google, and social media ones, for instance—through a concerted and refined effort at social engineering. Attacks based on social engineering usually involve impersonation, phishing, or other forms of trickery aimed at fooling security systems. Instead of attacking a network or a computer, these hackers attack the people who work there, using methods that, by and large, have worked for con artists throughout history. And yes, after you hear about a few of these methods, you will feel a little paranoid. And you should! Industry Response and Broader Implications for Crypto Security The blockchain community has taken notice of the attack on Raj Gokal, and for good reason. It isn’t just a couple of hackers throwing a couple of code errors around, and it definitely isn’t a few angry crypto investors. This attack tells us that anyone can be threatened, including the founders of major crypto platforms. And if these folks can be threatened so easily, what does that say about the storage and protection of our digital assets in the era of Web3? Many security specialists have insisted that cryptocurrency founders and prominent figures in the space adopt far more rigorous security protocols. Among these experts’ suggestions are the following: 1. Use hardware authentication devices. 2. Create air-gapped backups. 3. Implement multi-layered access controls. For Solana, a blockchain famed for its speed and its expanding developer ecosystem, the incident is probably not going to have any direct technical fallout. But the event does cast in stark relief the fragile security of crypto’s most public personalities, and it raises some uncomfortable questions about the lengths to which they—and we—might have to go in order to keep our real and virtual selves safe. While the investigations rattle on, the eyes of the crypto community are on the situation. Will this breach prove to be an element of a larger compromise? Or is it an isolated attack? Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the cybercriminals have upped the ante. This is a reminder that digital sovereignty must come with not just digital responsibility, but also robust defenses.

Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive?,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-cements-its-haven-asset-reputation-is-the-means-of-exchange-narrative-still-alive/,"Bitcoin has always been compared to gold. As time went by, the safe haven reputation of Bitcoin only strengthened. However, Bitcoin was conceived as an alternative cash system, and Bitcoin enthusiasts still greet businesses that have started accepting bitcoins. What are the chances that Bitcoin will eventually become a regular means of exchange? Safe haven assets: Bitcoin and gold Gold has been recognized as a safe haven for a long time, meaning that it successfully preserves value in times of financial turbulence, serving as a strong hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as digital gold, is something new in this regard. Multiple investors and financial experts went so far as to call Bitcoin a better version of gold. Both assets are scarce and hard to produce. Gold is finite, and Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million, most of which is already in circulation and around three million are lost forever. As for the advantages of Bitcoin over gold, cryptocurrency is extremely easy to manage. Gold bars need special storage. Maintenance of gold bars is demanding and costly. More than that, gold needs space. Bitcoin is much more comfortable as you may always have it with you as long as you obtain a seed phrase of your wallet or private and public keys. Bitcoin can be stored in a trustless manner. For gold, you will probably have to trust professionals. Sending gold is way harder and more expensive than sending a Bitcoin transaction. Another characteristic that makes Bitcoin way different from gold is value dynamics. Bitcoin has an element of gambling to it, as its price is pretty volatile. However, as institutional investors and governments are joining the hunt for Bitcoin, the price stabilizes without losing its upward direction. Many say that this cycle will be different from the previous ones, meaning that major ups and downs of Bitcoin will probably become a thing of the past. Read more: 2025 is no longer about cycles — Bitcoin is reading something else entirely Gold has a long-term price appreciation, too, and does not have the volatility of Bitcoin. More than that, during the economic turmoil triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff policies, gold spiked immensely, not Bitcoin. It signals that investors trust gold more than Bitcoin. Gold slipped after Trump softened EU tariff threats — a reminder that its haven status now bends to politics. Meanwhile, $BTC held steady amid rising deficits, rating downgrades, and macro chaos (even touching new ATH's along the way) Is Bitcoin the new flight to safety? — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 26, 2025 One of the reasons behind gold’s strength is that its price doesn’t correlate with the stock market movements but rather grows slowly and intensifies when people expect hard times. Bitcoin is tied to stock prices more clearly. Finally, gold is familiar to most people and leans to more established regulations. Uncertainty in Bitcoin regulation is turning some of the potential investors away. Bitcoin as a means of exchange While some insist that Bitcoin is not good for payments but great as a savings currency, many in the crypto community argue that Bitcoin derives its value from being used as a means of exchange. In 2021, Tesla made a revolutionary step when it announced that its vehicles could be purchased for Bitcoin. However, soon after, the company withdrew its decision, citing the environmental impact of Bitcoin as the reason. In the U.S., many big and small businesses accept Bitcoin. Notable examples are Apple, Microsoft, Starbucks, PayPal, Netflix, and many others. The idea that you should not spend Bitcoin and only spend fiat is a fallacy made by state spooks to stop bitcoiners from using it as MoE. You can simply buy Bitcoin with your fiat and spend that Bitcoin when you need it. It does not matter for your wealth whether you spend fiat… — Sina 🗝️⚡ 21st Capital (@Sina_21st) May 22, 2025 However, despite various advantages, Bitcoin’s use as a means of exchange is limited by a relatively small share of merchants accepting BTC. According to Bitdegree, Bitcoin is accepted by 15,000 businesses around the world, of which over 2,000 are based in the U.S. On top of that, the network capacity of Bitcoin is too small for a means of exchange used by the masses. It can process only up to seven transactions per second. For comparison, Visa is capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second. It is accepted in over 46 million merchant locations. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin community was never going to get over it. For years, developers have been working on solutions to scale Bitcoin up for higher adoption as a means of exchange. The most well-known project aimed at solving Bitcoin’s scalability issues is Lightning Network. LN is a layer-2 protocol that enables fast and cheap transactions using off-chain transactions for this purpose. Surprisingly, even the name of the smallest denomination of Bitcoin became the battleground within the crypto community. Originally, the one hundred-millionth particle of Bitcoin was called Satoshi (or sats), after Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious creator of Bitcoin. A new proposal suggests that the name “bits” will fit better. Prepaid crypto debit cards are moving Bitcoin spending forward. They allow clients to hold BTC right on the banking card and spend it anywhere where the cards are accepted. Bitcoins are turned into fiat money automatically and exchanged. As prepaid cryptocurrency cards continue to occur and more businesses jump on the Bitcoin train, BTC will become an easier choice as a means of exchange. However, its role as capital or savings money will persist.

45192983,https://nulltx.com/?p=150015,1748418313,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Asia’s Strategic Leap: Real World Assets and Stablecoins Gain Institutional Momentum,https://nulltx.com/asias-strategic-leap-real-world-assets-and-stablecoins-gain-institutional-momentum/,"Asia is positioning itself decisively and quietly as a global leader in the adoption of real-world assets (RWA) and stablecoin infrastructure. The fintech giants of the region, our traditional financial institutions, and some of our publicly listed companies are building momentum fast across the region. By contrast, the Western regulatory environment remains largely tethered by caution and, to some extent, a fragmentation of policies. In contrast, we find Asia to be an increasingly reliable laboratory for next-generation finance. Tech Giants Pave the Road to Tokenization Some of the most influential tech firms in Asia are leading the charge. These are not just products in a pilot stage. They represent a new, much needed benchmark for stablecoin innovation. One of these firms, JD Technology, the digital arm of China’s JD.com, is working on a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin. It is conducting advanced testing in Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox. This sandbox is a feature of the open, stablecoin pathway that the Hong Kong authorities have created. They’re not alone. Several other key Asian jurisdictions are also working on their own pathways for stablecoins. At the same time, Ant Group—the fintech arm of Alibaba—continues to push its RWA ambitions via its “Two Chains and One Bridge” platform. The company most recently struck a collaboration with Langxin Group in which they will tokenize Langxin’s new energy assets. That partnership is meant to allow Langxin to do cross-border financing for its renewable energy projects, and it’s a potent example of how RWA tokenization can provide real-world benefits and serve to enhance capital efficiency. This signals a fundamental shift: Asia’s leading technology firms are embedding tokenization into the very core of their operations; no longer are they tinkering on the fringes of blockchain. They are preparing for a financial future in which on-chain(and) off-chain assets and programmable money serve as the standard infrastructure. Asia’s Big Bet on RWA & Stablecoins Asia is quietly becoming a powerhouse in RWA & stablecoin adoption. From tech giants to TradFi & listed companies, institutional interest in RWA and stablecoins is accelerating across the region. — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) May 26, 2025 Traditional Finance Steps Into the Arena The blockchain technology isn’t replacing the centralized financial system. Instead, it’s being used within that framework and is gaining a foothold in Asia’s institutional finance sector. Why? Because major players—whether in brokerage, asset management, or banking—are either deploying tokenized products or creating the infrastructure that will support such products. And they’re doing it at an impressive scale. Here’s a short list of some of the key institutions leading this charge: – HSBC: In May 2023, HSBC became the first bank to issue a letter of credit using blockchain technology. Leading securities brokers like Huaying Securities, Guotai Junan International, Futu Holdings, and Tiger Brokers are incorporating digital asset trading and custody capabilities into their platforms. At the same time, one of the largest asset managers in the region, China Asset Management, is now providing crypto ETF products offering traditional investors a regulated way to access digital assets. One of the most globally recognizable banking institutions in Asia, Standard Chartered, has also put in place the blockchain innovation. Through pilot programs and custodial offerings, it is allowing institutional clients to access tokenized securities and digital currencies within compliant frameworks. These advancements emphasize how the barriers separating conventional finance and digital assets are swiftly breaking down in Asia. Instead of attempting to rival blockchain, leading financial institutions are opting to welcome and integrate the technology into their business models to keep themselves pertinent in an evolving financial environment. Listed Corporations Bring RWAs to the Forefront There is now an added layer of credibility and scale to the ecosystem because public companies are building on-chain. These firms are not just investing in digital assets but are using the blockchain to tokenize their core business. For instance, GCL Energy Technology has converted into tokens its 82MW distributed solar power portfolio throughout the Hunan-Hubei area. The company is using these renewable infrastructure projects as collateral to create real world assets accessible to a worldwide pool of investors, which in turn is providing increased liquidity and a broadened base of financing. (As for GCL Energy Technology’s choice of projects for this strategy, the 82MW located in Hunan and Hubei seems to us a rather limited asset base to undertake such a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.) China Carbon Neutral is adopting a comparable tactic with carbon credits by converting them into verifiable on-chain assets that can be traded in green finance markets. Addentax, which is among the largest publicly traded BTC-holding firms in China, is sending a message of confidence in the larger digital asset ecosystem by taking a direct exposure route. These developments demonstrate that tokenization is no longer limited to test-and-learn projects. Instead, it is being driven by established and well-regarded corporations that operate under regulatory oversight, have audited financials, and possess the kind of scale and market influence that can affect global financial markets. Asia’s combined investment in real-world tools and stablecoin ecosystems is transforming the region into a vibrant hub of blockchain-powered finance. With backing from the public and private sectors and a regulatory setup that favors both innovation and oversight, Asia is moving beyond the blockchain buzzgraph and into something more concrete. The opportunities are enormous: as capital, commerce, and compliance flow on-chain, they may just help set the course toward the next-big-thing in global finance.

45193016,https://nulltx.com/?p=150014,1748418447,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana Leads in Capital Inflows Despite Declining Activity as Chain Competition Intensifies,https://nulltx.com/solana-leads-in-capital-inflows-despite-declining-activity-as-chain-competition-intensifies/,"May has been a month of mixed blessings for Solana . While the network saw a major inflow from centralized exchanges, to the tune of $1.1 billion—that’s the most since 2024; its on-chain transaction activity keep declining. Now, two key things here: 1. The inflow is a sign that investor interest is on the uptick, at least. 2. The fact that transaction activity on the chain is going down in spite of this inflow signals a divergence between investor interest and network utility that is rarely seen. BREAKING: @Solana saw an inflow of $1.1 billion from centralized exchanges in May alone, the largest monthly inflow since 2024. pic.twitter.com/Fh9eIZkBIx — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 27, 2025 And from where I’m sitting, that ain’t great. Solana Sees Historic Inflows Amid Transaction Decline In May, Solana drew in an astonishing $1.1 billion in capital from centralized exchanges, cementing its status as a go-to blockchain for institutions and retail investors. This figure represents the highest monthly inflow recorded since 2024 and occurs during a period when the entire crypto sector seems to be favoring high-throughput, low-fee chains. Even with this strong indication, Solana’s transaction volumes tell another tale. Per the data of OKX Explorer covering May 18 to 24, Solana carried out 2.37 billion transactions, down 8.24 percent week-over-week. This was the third week in a row of Solana having less “activity.” Even though this statement does not carry a good connotation, it does not make Solana’s numbers look bad at all. In fact, the number of raw transactions that Solana handles is vastly greater than those of competing chains. And even with these “bad” numbers, Solana is still a blockchain that you would want to be a part of. This divergence raises some big issues. Is it the case that users are becoming less active at the same time that capital is rushing into the ecosystem? We could be looking at something totally normal and healthy, with all this new money speculating on the ecosystem, in anticipation of upcoming applications or market catalysts—rather than something that’s representative of any sort of growth in everyday usage of Solana right now. On the flip side, if this new money is representative of actual new use cases for Solana, then where are all these new users of upcoming applications participating in Solana’s ongoing speculative economy? Competitors Catching Up as Solana’s Grip Weakens While Solana’s on-chain activity is decreasing, other blockchain networks are getting more active. The standout is clearly BNB Chain, which saw 53 million transactions last week—up 5.36 percent from the prior week. This was its third consecutive week of positive growth, with transaction activity rising 54 percent, then 2 percent, and now another 5 percent. BNB’s Chains steady climb should be interpreted as a rise in user engagement, which might be driven by DeFi applications, token launches, or the still-growing number of Binance-led initiatives. Polygon also had a strong showing, amassing 24.7 million transactions and vaulting 9.31 percent over the week. That comes on the heels of a three-week run totaling an 18 percent increase, putting Polygon atop the mid-tier performer ranking. Top 8 Chains by Weekly Total Txn OKX Explorer | May 18-24 Weekly Trends: @solana : 2.37B (-8.24% WoW) — Drop for 3 consecutive weeks; dominance erodes further. @fractal_bitcoin : 91.8M (-7.82% WoW ) — Volatility spikes after +2% rebound last week, but still holding a… pic.twitter.com/ACzNJYSYPb — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 27, 2025 Its low fees, along with its compatibility with Ethereum-based tools, keep developers and users piling into the ecosystem, with that flood largely dominated by the gaming and NFT sectors. At the same time, Base—the Ethereum Layer 2 created by Coinbase—had 59.3 million transactions but a 5.95 percent drop. This marked the halt of a five-week growth streak and may have signaled the beginning of a short-term correction. Base is still new, and this is a relatively calm period for it, which is tied closely to the destiny of Coinbase and what it decides to integrate and do in the future. Broader Ecosystem Faces Volatility and Fluctuation Other notable chains experienced similar conditions. Fractal Bitcoin, a volume-driven but not particularly “run-of-the-mill” platform, executed 91.8 million trades—a 7.82 percent drop after a minor rebound the prior week that hardly deserves mentioning. Even with that close-to-static status, Fractal Bitcoin retained its total-ahead-of-totals status versus Solana by remaining a stricter rule-following platform. Thus, among second-tier platforms, Fractal Bitcoin seems the most likely candidate for a kind of “pause that refreshed” scenario. Sui Network and Aptos, two younger Layer 1 blockchains, both continued to have some headwinds. Sui dropped another 2.87 percent in weekly transaction count, bringing its three-week decline to 9 percent. Aptos remained mostly flat at 26 million transactions, offering very little indication of renewed momentum after a brief stabilization phase. Tron also saw a setback hit it, with its 24.7 million weekly transactions coming in at an 8.05 percent drop. This netted out the week-before gains, and in the end, it highlighted the erratic nature of user activity on old, high-throughput chains. Even though transaction activity is down, inflows to Solana are at an all-time high. This must mean that there is still confidence in the Solana network, and confidence in it as a long-term vehicle for value. Solana is up against some stiff competition, though. The performance of not just Solana but all Layer 1 networks will be closely scrutinized in the coming weeks to see if they can maintain their upswell of interest and not just be faddish at the Layer 1 level while Layer 2 is winning the competitive race.

45193124,https://nulltx.com/?p=150013,1748418595,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Avalanche DEX Landscape: Stablecoins, AVAX, and New Tokens Dominate the Chain",https://nulltx.com/avalanche-dex-landscape-stablecoins-avax-and-new-tokens-dominate-the-chain/,"Avalanche builds more and more momentum as a living and colorful decentralized trading hub. Concentrated activity occurs in stablecoin swaps, Bitcoin markets, and AVAX-stablecoin pairs, now very much on public display. While on-chain volumes keep sliding nicely along, who should emerge as the dominant player in this developing ecosystem is becoming increasingly clear. A rush to not just make good tokens but also launch them in sensible and sensible-to-the-market ways is one new trend. Another is trading on the DEXs, which are clearly in competition with each other and now also with centralized trading venues. Stablecoins and AVAX Drive the Majority of Trading Volume About 85 percent of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Avalanche comes from three source types: swaps between stablecoins, Bitcoin trading pairs, and AVAX-stablecoin transactions. This concentration of trading activity is a good proxy for what it’s like to trade on Avalanche DEXes. It tells us what types of tokens we should expect to find with decent liquidity when using a DEX on Avalanche. Between AVAX-stablecoin pairs, AVAX-USDC is still the top in terms of volume and user engagement. However, two newer entrants to the stablecoin market, MXNB and AUSD, have been making strides in amassing market share. This seems to suggest that users are beginning to explore stablecoin alternatives with more frequency in a diversifying ecosystem. Swapping stablecoins is a large part of the DeFi experience on Avalanche. If you look inside any DeFi protocol built on Avalanche, you will find stablecoin swaps. Why? Because stablecoin swaps are the DeFi primitive with which you can build everything else—a bit like how in traditional finance, treasury bills serve as the foundation for more complex (and sometimes riskier) financial instruments. And what makes this swap experience particularly nice on Avalanche is that you can do it with very little slippage over very large amounts, which, as you will see, is very relevant to some not-so-simple strategies. Pharaoh and LFJ Dominate, While Uniswap Follows In terms of where DeFi users on Avalanche are trading, the answers aren’t too surprising. Pharaoh Exchange and LFJ are not only the chain’s top DEXs; they generate nearly all of the trading volume on it. Collectively, these two exchange platforms account for just about 85 percent of the volume on which DeFi users on Avalanche are trading. In fact, the top two DEXs on Avalanche are said to be responsible for about as much volume as can be found anywhere on the chain. LFJ, in particular, has the strong user base of BTC-relevant pairs. However, we see a more evenly distributed playing field now. Our near-term data indicates this volume distribution has been captured relatively evenly among Pharaoh, LFJ, and even Uniswap, which now captures approximately 10% of Avalanche’s total DEX volume. This shift in volume capture seems to indicate a more evenly distributed liquidity ecosystem for BTC-relevant pairs. Volume does now seem more evenly split. Our near-term data capture indicates this. When it comes to the liquidity of AVAX-stablecoin, Pharaoh and LFJ are in a dead heat, both offering deep pools and juicy incentives. They are, in fact, positioned in what seems to be an ongoing competition for mindshare and dominance of trading volume in what are, at this point, some of the most essential trading pairs on Avalanche. Token Launchpads See Explosive Growth as Ecosystem Expands Avalanche has experienced a notable increase in token launch activity. The number of new assets entering the market has seen an upsurge, with one of the launchpads, The Arena, witnessing a truly incredible day in May when it was hosting over 6,000 new token launches. This figure not only speaks to the ease of use and accessibility of Avalanche as a protocol upon which to build and launch new assets but also to the clear audience interest in community-based projects and experimental finance. 2/ Around 85% of DEX volumes on Avalanche are made up of the following pairs: Stablecoin Swaps, Bitcoin trading, and AVAX-Stablecoin swaps. pic.twitter.com/PSnbgMewKi — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 27, 2025 Although numerous tokens launched on Avalanche may not be valuable in the long term, the large number of launches and the sheer volume of tokens getting launched is an indicator of an expanding ecosystem. Fast and cheap transactions are great for many use cases, and Aleth’s proof-of-stake protocol is said to offer both. This makes Avalanche suitable for synthetic assets, stablecoins, and many other expansive use cases. As Avalanche moves forward, it continues to build its DeFi territory with a few core themes: the hegemony of stablecoin and AVAX-based trading, the two-horse race of LFJ and Pharaoh Exchange, and the crazy-fast launches of new tokens. With DEI, the newest stablecoin, rapidly gaining traction and a host of other projects joining the fun, Avalanche is in very good shape to hold onto its relevance in a multichain world. And whether you’re trading through old familiar pairs or using one of a handful of new tokens, it’s an economy that seems like it can’t help but fire on all cylinders.

A significant development is brewing in the digital asset space as Inscobee, a company listed on the South Korean stock exchange, has officially partnered with Parameta, a firm specializing in Web3 solutions. Their goal? To introduce a brand-new Korean won stablecoin . This collaboration represents Inscobee’s initial major foray into the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, signaling a potential shift in how traditional businesses engage with digital finance in the region. For the broader South Korea crypto market, this could be a pivotal moment, potentially paving the way for wider adoption and integration of stablecoins pegged to the national currency. What Exactly is a Korean Won Stablecoin? Before diving deeper into the partnership, let’s clarify what a Korean won stablecoin is. In simple terms, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a ‘stable’ asset like a fiat currency (like the US Dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won), a commodity (like gold), or even another cryptocurrency or basket of assets. A stablecoin pegged to the Korean Won aims to have its value consistently hover around 1 KRW. For instance, 1 Korean won stablecoin should theoretically always be worth approximately 1 South Korean Won. The primary purpose of a stablecoin is to combine the benefits of blockchain technology (transparency, efficiency, global accessibility) with the stability of traditional currencies. This makes them incredibly useful for: Trading: Providing a stable bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and fiat, allowing traders to lock in gains or avoid losses without cashing out to a bank account. Payments: Offering a potentially faster and cheaper way to send value globally compared to traditional remittance services. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): Serving as a stable base currency for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols on blockchain networks. Bridging Finance: Connecting traditional financial systems with the burgeoning world of digital assets. Who Are Inscobee and Parameta? Understanding the players involved is key to appreciating the significance of this announcement. Inscobee Parameta brings together two distinct entities: Inscobee: This is a publicly traded company in South Korea. Historically, their business has been in sectors outside of blockchain and crypto. Their decision to enter the stablecoin market signifies a strategic pivot or expansion, indicative of growing corporate interest in digital assets within the country. Parameta: Described as a Web3 enabler , Parameta likely possesses the technical expertise and blockchain infrastructure necessary to develop and manage a stablecoin. Web3 enablers specialize in building the tools, platforms, and protocols that allow businesses and individuals to participate in the decentralized web. The collaboration between Inscobee Parameta leverages Inscobee’s established corporate presence and potentially its financial backing or regulatory navigation capabilities, combined with Parameta’s technical prowess in Web3 and blockchain development. This blend of traditional business and cutting-edge technology is often seen as crucial for bringing digital assets into the mainstream. Why is This Stablecoin Launch a Major Step? The planned Stablecoin launch by Inscobee Parameta is noteworthy for several reasons: Inscobee’s Crypto Debut: As mentioned, this marks Inscobee’s initial significant move into the crypto sector. This isn’t just a small pilot; launching a stablecoin is a complex undertaking that signals serious intent. Corporate Adoption Trend: It reflects a broader trend of established, non-crypto native companies exploring blockchain technology and digital assets. This can lend legitimacy and attract more traditional users to the space. Political Context: The fact that Inscobee CEO Yoo In-soo has served on the digital asset committee of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) adds an interesting layer. While not directly tied to the technical launch, it suggests a level of engagement with digital asset policy discussions at a governmental level, which could be beneficial for navigating the regulatory landscape surrounding a Korean won stablecoin . Filling a Market Need: A well-regulated and widely accepted Korean won stablecoin could serve a significant purpose within the South Korea crypto ecosystem, providing a reliable on-ramp/off-ramp and a stable store of value within the domestic market. What Benefits Could This Korean Won Stablecoin Offer Users? If successfully launched and adopted, the Korean won stablecoin developed by Inscobee Parameta could bring several advantages: Reduced Volatility: Provides a stable asset on exchanges and platforms, shielding users from the wild price swings often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Easier Access to Crypto: Could simplify the process of moving value between traditional Korean Won and the crypto world. Potential for New Financial Products: Could facilitate the development of KRW-denominated DeFi applications and services. Improved Payments and Remittances: Depending on its design and integration, it could offer a faster and cheaper alternative for domestic and international transactions involving KRW. What Challenges Might Inscobee Parameta Face? Launching a stablecoin is not without its hurdles. Inscobee Parameta will likely need to navigate several challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory environment for stablecoins in South Korea crypto , like in many countries, is still evolving. Ensuring compliance with existing and future financial regulations will be paramount. Trust and Adoption: Building user trust and achieving widespread adoption requires demonstrating transparency, reliability, and sufficient reserves backing the stablecoin. Competition: While a major step, other entities or even central banks could explore similar initiatives (like a Central Bank Digital Currency – CBDC), creating a competitive landscape. Technical Implementation: Ensuring the stablecoin is built on a robust, secure, and scalable blockchain infrastructure is critical. This is where the expertise of the Web3 enabler , Parameta, will be crucial. Looking Ahead: The Impact on South Korea Crypto This planned Stablecoin launch could have a ripple effect on the entire South Korea crypto landscape. It signals increased institutional interest and could encourage other traditional companies to explore blockchain applications. As a Web3 enabler , Parameta’s involvement also highlights the growing importance of specialized firms that can bridge the gap between traditional business models and decentralized technologies. The success of this Korean won stablecoin will depend on various factors, including regulatory support, market acceptance, and the technical execution by Inscobee Parameta . However, the MOU itself is a significant indicator of the direction in which South Korea’s digital economy might be heading – towards greater integration of blockchain and digital assets into mainstream finance. Compelling Summary In summary, the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Inscobee and Parameta to develop a Korean won stablecoin is a landmark event. It signifies a major strategic move by publicly traded Inscobee into the crypto space, leveraging Parameta’s expertise as a Web3 enabler . This planned Stablecoin launch has the potential to introduce greater stability and accessibility within the South Korea crypto market, offering users a reliable digital asset pegged to the national currency. While challenges, particularly regulatory ones, lie ahead, this collaboration represents a significant step towards bridging traditional finance and the decentralized web in South Korea.

That said, the overall market capitalization of AI agents dipped slightly—a fact that doesn’t detract from the AI agent economy. As it turned out, our Virtuals ecosystem is leading the charge within the unfortunate dip of the overall AI agent economy. What does this mean for you? Well, the AI agent market is currently experiencing an 1.35% overall loss, but segues down into our Virtuals ecosystem show much stronger growth. Virtuals Ecosystem Defies Market Downturn The total market capitalization of the broader AI agent market decreased to $11.46 billion, which wasn’t great, but the Virtuals ecosystem that exists under it had an amazing day and climbed to a market cap of $2.64 billion, which is 5.52 percent more than it was worth when the previous 24 hours started. This growth was driven by $VIRTUAL, which rose 4.83 percent to reach a price of 2.3438 dollars. The token continues to provide the sector with a narrative anchor that it otherwise sorely lacks, consistently drawing the highest Echo across platforms and discussions. Echo is an engagement metric that we’ve created at The Block; it reflects influence and activity across platforms and discussions. This strong showing is delivered even while the market mood remains lackluster. Many sectors can barely keep incoming cash flows flowing, while Virtuals and its adjacent projects have seen fresh waves of interest. Part of the renewed excitement seems tied to mid-caps that investors consider recovery plays. Mid-Caps Make a Strong Comeback While $VIRTUAL was leading the charge in its own ecosystem, the broader AI agent market saw more and more activity among mid-cap tokens. These projects were making big strides, lifting sentiment, and in some instances, lifting mid-cap tokens toward the kind of parabolic runs that had been seen previously in the large caps. This was happening even as the large caps themselves were seeming to stall out. Top rising stars by growth in market cap over the past 24 hours are: AXR (@AlxVC_Axelr): increased by 57.65 percent SYMP (@Symp_AI): increased by 31.21 percent GPTWAI (@gptwai): increased by 27.91 percent HANA (@HanaPersona_): increased by 26.59 percent BIOS (@BasisOS): increased by 25.73 percent Virtuals Daily Update | May 27th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/TjVhyY3yfk — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 27, 2025 These increases imply that investors are now looking toward AI agent platforms in the growth stage of development, with solid technical fundamentals and robust development pipelines. AXR is in the lead by a huge margin—nearly 58 percent gains this year—reinforcing the momentum of whatever AXR’s ecosystem is up to. A big rally for both BIOS and HANA suggests that there’s also rising interest in them as well, for what HANA does, and for what BIOS does. Market participants have been shifting toward mid-caps. This may reflect an emerging strategy among them of looking past established names and into the agent economy to find undervalued or overlooked innovations. Mindshare Holds Steady Amid Narrative Consolidation Price action and market cap shifts are one thing, but when considering the emerging dominance of the Virtuals ecosystem, it’s also important to look at mindshare. This is a measure of presence and attention. And with that measure comes insight into the narratives around Virtuals. In the last 24 hours, Virtuals didn’t just have a presence and demand attention, it also eked out a gain in mindshare. This consistency at around the 39 percent figure implies that the Virtuals label is still at the forefront of any meaningful conversations happening in its sector. As it and the projects both around and within it gather traction—and even more importantly, the kind of community engagement that fosters real development—the Virtuals ecosystem looks to all the world like the epicenter of artificial intelligence agent development and deployment. The booming Echo of $VIRTUAL establishes it as both a market leader and a narrative touchstone. With fresh user and capital inflows into the space, Virtuals stands poised to benefit, not solely from its flagship tech, but from the far more diversified gains it’s likely to earn from a slew of affiliated projects and developer tools. The daily chapter on May 27th, 2023, finds the AI agent economy exhibiting resilience and strategic capital rotation. We are in the nascent stages of an emerging ecosystem—the Virtuals ecosystem—that appears already to be an engine of growth, is likely to be an engine of growth, and seems to be maintaining a lead in shaping the next phase of decentralized AI innovation.

Despite an overall bullish sentiment now pulsating through the crypto markets, Web3 gaming assets have had a hard time keeping up. Trading volumes have tanked, and a couple of recent scandals have raised some eyebrows. All in all, the week was a pretty stark reminder of how up and down the GameFi world is right now. Bitcoin Breaks Records, GameFi Barely Reacts The broader cryptocurrency landscape could hardly have been more favorable. Waves of optimism washed around the digital asset space in the wake of Bitcoin’s all-time high close to $112K. Yet GameFi—a sector long associated with the speculative altcoin cycles—barely stirred in response to the recent Bitcoin rally. Ecosystem tokens across the Web3 gaming space saw only a modest 4 percent uptick, while worries mounted that trading volumes had plummeted by 22 percent—a sign, perhaps, that the lack of retail and institutional enthusiasm for gaming tokens might continue to hold the ecosystem back, even as capital floods into the broader market. Even the CMC Altcoin Index, a barometer of altcoin sector performance, crept up just a single point, moving from 27 to 28. The lack of movement illustrates a larger stagnation within the altcoin ecosystem, with GameFi especially struggling. DeFiLlama reports that GameFi has fallen in sector narrative rankings from 13th to 14th, which indicates that interest and influence in GameFi has continued to wane. Guild of Guardians Defies the Trend with Triple-Digit Gains Although most of the GameFi sector stayed gloomy, Guild of Guardians (GOG) pulled off an unbelievable feat. The token shot up a staggering 286 percent over the week, easily leaving its peers in the dust and obviously being the top performer in the gaming category. The surge has once more brought attention to GOG’s gameplay model and future roadmap, though one has to question whether it can keep delivering. A handful of other undertakings also eluded the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere: MASK: up to 40 percent OL: up 27 percent VIRTUALS: increased by 17 percent. Week in GameFi: Web3 Gaming Misses the BTC Boost BTC breaks $112K! But GameFi stays lukewarm! GOG soars 286%! Trading volumes plunge 22%! Let’s unpack what went down in the Web3 gaming world this week. pic.twitter.com/EhP4dHNO8m — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 26, 2025 Nevertheless, some were not so fortunate. Steering gains, NEXPACE, which led the previous week, reversed course and dropped 21 percent as traders rotated capital into newer opportunities. This signals and suggests for investors that GameFi is not as stable as it may seem. A lead kind of capital you can control like Grayscale won’t guarantee a rise in GameFi tokens. And that may indicate for investors that GameFi is not as stable a sector as one might have thought. These stark reversals and single-project supremacy showcase GameFi’s present vulnerability — where victories are dispersed, and overall industry sentiment is still lackluster. Scandals and Slow Rebuilds Undermine Confidence GameFi also received unwelcome press this week with the arrest of Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of Blum, on charges stemming from large-scale financial fraud involving earlier ventures. Blum was quick to clarify that Smerkis does not work for them anymore, but the reputational hit is likely to stick. Whether potential investors or new users are thinking about the gaming aspect or the financial aspect of GameFi, news like this makes them question whether the whole thing is worth their time and money. In the meantime, platforms are busily restoring trust and engagement. WEMIX, a foremost GameFi project, took a significant step toward reactivating its user base and regaining momentum after a high-profile hack earlier this year by unveiling a new Mission System. In a different part of the Web3 world, BOXCAT announced not long ago that it would debut on Gate.io, giving an airdrop to holders of the exchange’s GT token—a modest but tokenomic effort to boost initial traction. These developments might not propel markets in overnight manners, but they do signal a rebuilding phase for GameFi. After the recent explosive growth and the speculative hype that accompanied it, many GameFi platforms seem to be returning to fundamentals. They are focusing on community engagement, platform security, and gradual ecosystem expansion. While Bitcoin’s command of the headlines and capital expressing itself in the GameFi domain, GameFi finds itself at a bit of a crossroads. The muted sector reaction to a record-breaking week in crypto amplifies the clarity of the situation: Challenges lie ahead, challenges that, if met successfully, lead to a destination called User Trust and Interest That is Not Just Hype. What the market wants to see now is proof that Web3 games can deliver actual lasting value. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-speaks-at-bitcoin-2025-conference-ai-will-change-company-structures-here-are-the-details/,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that artificial intelligence will bring about radical changes in company structures. Robinhood CEO: AI Will Transform Entrepreneurship, “One-Man Companies Like Satoshi” Are Coming According to Tenev, in the near future, “one-person companies” could become the norm thanks to artificial intelligence, just like Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Tenev likened this new AI-powered startup model to Nakamoto single-handedly creating Bitcoin. “We’re going to see more one-person companies. They’re going to be tokenized and traded on the blockchain, just like any other asset,” he said. “So it’s going to be possible to invest economically in a person or a project that that person is running.” “This is essentially like Bitcoin itself,” Tenev said, “Satoshi Nakamoto’s personal brand is powered by technology.” “Artificial intelligence will add more value with fewer resources” There have been suggestions for years that AI will simplify how companies operate. But Tenev focused on the opportunities it provides for entrepreneurs rather than its potential to replace the workforce. “One of the things that AI makes possible is that it produces more and more value with fewer and fewer resources,” he said. Bitcoin, which was founded with the technical document published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, quickly produced a global digital economy. This adventure, which began with the mining of the first block in 2009, has today turned into a trillion-dollar crypto asset industry. Blockchain technology is now being used not only in financial transactions but also in many areas such as supply chain tracking, tokenization of digital artworks, and in-game assets. For example, Walmart is using blockchain to increase traceability in its supply chain. Robinhood is a trading platform where users can buy and sell stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. The company has stepped up its crypto activities in recent years; its platform trades a variety of cryptocurrencies as well as memecoins. Tenev's statements strengthened expectations that artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies could combine to usher in a new era in entrepreneurship. *This is not investment advice.

Put-option trading on VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has spiked to its most cautious level in ten months amid fears that Nvidia’s results could ripple through the broader semiconductor sector. Currently, Nvidia accounts for about a fifth of SMH’s assets, meaning a drop in earnings or negative guidance could greatly affect the ETF and the larger semiconductor industry. Traders are monetizing premiums before Nvidia’s earnings announcement According to Trade Alert, roughly 2.4 put options have been traded daily for every call on the VanEck Semiconductor ETF over the last 10 days. By 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) Tuesday, about 105,000 put options had changed hands on the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, far outpacing 16,000 calls. Last week, one trader bought 50,000 put options to guard against SMH’s shares falling by 10%—below $220—before the month’s end. Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, commented on the ETF’s put buying, “The put buying in SMH ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reflects growing concern about potential volatility for the entire sector following the report.” He added that investors were selling options to profit from the surge in volatility expectations ahead of the chipmaker’s earning announcement. While there’s been a lot of defensive positioning in SMH, in Nvidia, traders are taking advantage of elevated implied volatility by monetizing rich premiums before earnings reveal. However, that means most of these investors don’t anticipate a major market swing after the chipmaker’s results. Analysts expect lower earnings for Nvidia, especially since its Chinese market was cut off Nvidia ranked second on Interactive Brokers’ list of the 25 most actively traded securities by client orders. However, it was one of just two stocks with net selling—a sign of investor caution despite great stock performance, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. So far, Nvidia shares are up about 0.7%, while SMH shares are up about 1.2%. However, investors believe Nvidia could see a slower growth rate than last year. Some even expect an EPS miss. In April, the US government imposed restrictions on the company’s chip exports to China. It stated that Nvidia will require export licenses for its H20 chips, targeting the Chinese market. Ideally, the export controls have interfered with Nvidia’s sale of H20 chips to China, leading to a $5.5 billion inventory write-down for the company so far, which could result in lower earnings. The Trump administration has only cited concerns that the firm’s technology may be utilized in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China or aid military operations . Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, criticized the new policies, claiming they only sabotaged American companies. Nevertheless, the chip manufacturer is working on a new product line for the Chinese market. According to sources familiar with the matter, the company will start producing its new chips in June. The firm will sell the new chips for cheaper prices, roughly between $6,500 and $8,000, especially since they’ll have simpler manufacturing requirements. However, till the chips hit the market, Nvidia was effectively foreclosed from the Chinese market.

For holders of Bitcoin, the original and most prominent cryptocurrency, protecting their holdings is a constant priority. This is where innovative approaches like Bitcoin Multisig come into play, offering enhanced layers of protection beyond standard single-signature wallets. A significant development in this space recently occurred with the announcement that Asigna, a platform focused on smart multisig vaults for Bitcoin and its layer-2 protocols, has successfully closed a substantial seed funding round. Understanding the Asigna Platform and its Importance At its core, the Asigna Platform is designed to provide a sophisticated, non-custodial solution for managing Bitcoin. Traditional Bitcoin wallets rely on a single private key to authorize transactions. If that key is compromised, lost, or stolen, the funds are at risk. Multisig, or multi-signature, wallets require multiple keys to authorize a transaction. For example, a 2-of-3 multisig wallet requires at least two out of three designated keys to sign off on a transaction. Asigna takes this concept further with its ‘smart’ multisig vault. While the specifics of their ‘smart’ features were not detailed in the initial announcement, this often implies additional capabilities built into the multisig script or associated tools. These could include: More flexible signing policies Time-locks or conditional spending rules Integration with identity or recovery mechanisms Enhanced scripting capabilities for complex use cases The platform is specifically built for Bitcoin and its growing ecosystem of layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Liquid. This focus is crucial as layer-2 solutions gain traction for faster and cheaper transactions, but still require secure management of the underlying Bitcoin. By offering a dedicated, smart multisig solution for these layers, Asigna aims to fill a critical gap in the infrastructure needed for Bitcoin’s continued adoption and scalability. Fueling Growth: The $3M Crypto Funding Round The announcement that Asigna has raised Crypto Funding to the tune of $3 million in a seed round signals strong investor confidence in their approach and the market need for advanced Bitcoin security solutions. The round was notably led by prominent firms in the digital asset investment space, including Hivemind Capital and Tykhe Block Ventures. They were joined by other significant participants such as Sats Ventures and Trust Machines, among others. The involvement of investors like Trust Machines is particularly noteworthy. Trust Machines is a company focused on building on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a strategic interest in foundational infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities and security. The participation of such focused investors suggests that they see Asigna’s technology as a key component in the future development and secure use of Bitcoin and its layer-2 ecosystem. While the press release did not disclose the specific intended use of the funds, seed funding typically supports key areas essential for a startup’s growth: Expanding the engineering and development team to build out the platform’s features. Investing in security audits and infrastructure to ensure the vault’s integrity. Developing marketing and sales efforts to reach potential users (individuals, businesses, institutions). Exploring integrations with more layer-2 protocols and ecosystem partners. This capital infusion provides Asigna with the resources needed to accelerate its development roadmap and bring its smart multisig technology to a wider audience. Boosting Bitcoin Security for a Decentralized Future The core value proposition of Asigna lies in enhancing Bitcoin Security . For many users, managing a single private key is a significant responsibility and risk. Losing the key means losing access to funds permanently. A single point of failure also makes users vulnerable to hacking or theft if their key is compromised. Multisig significantly mitigates these risks. By requiring multiple keys, held by different individuals or stored in different locations, it becomes much harder for a single point of failure to result in loss. This is particularly valuable for: Joint Accounts: Families or partners can require multiple signatures for spending. Business Treasuries: Companies can require multiple executives to approve transactions, preventing single-person fraud or errors. Inheritance Planning: Keys can be distributed among trusted parties to ensure funds can be accessed if the primary owner is incapacitated or deceased. Decentralized Organizations (DAOs): Community members can collectively manage funds through multisig voting mechanisms. Asigna’s focus on ‘smart’ multisig suggests they are building features that go beyond basic multi-signature requirements, potentially automating certain processes or adding conditional logic that further strengthens security and control for these complex use cases. Integrating this technology with layer-2 solutions means that as more value and activity shift to these faster networks, the underlying security infrastructure is already in place. The Power of Non-Custodial Control A defining characteristic of the Asigna Platform is its commitment to being Non-Custodial . This is a critical concept in the cryptocurrency space and directly relates to security and user control. A custodial service is one where a third party holds your private keys on your behalf. Examples include centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While convenient, this means you do not have direct control over your funds; you are trusting the custodian to keep your keys safe and allow you access when you request it. If the custodian is hacked, goes bankrupt, or freezes your account, your funds are at risk. In contrast, a Non-Custodial solution like Asigna ensures that the user retains control of their private keys at all times. Asigna provides the software and framework for setting up and managing the multisig vault, but they do not hold any of the keys required to spend the Bitcoin. This aligns with the core ethos of Bitcoin – empowering individuals with direct control over their financial assets without relying on intermediaries. The challenge with non-custodial solutions, especially multisig, has historically been complexity. Setting up and managing multiple keys, understanding the backup procedures, and coordinating signatures can be daunting for average users. Platforms like Asigna aim to simplify this process, making the benefits of non-custodial multisig more accessible while still preserving the user’s ultimate control over their keys and funds. This balance between security, control, and usability is key to driving broader adoption. What’s Next for Asigna? Navigating Challenges and Opportunities With the successful Crypto Funding round complete, Asigna is positioned to accelerate its development and market penetration. The capital infusion allows them to invest heavily in technology, talent, and user experience. Potential future developments could include expanding the range of supported layer-2 protocols, adding more advanced ‘smart’ features to the vaults, developing partnerships within the Bitcoin ecosystem, and enhancing the platform’s usability to onboard more users. However, challenges remain. Educating users about the importance and mechanics of multisig and non-custodial solutions is an ongoing effort. Ensuring the platform remains secure against sophisticated attacks is paramount. Furthermore, competition in the Bitcoin infrastructure space is growing, requiring Asigna to differentiate itself effectively. Despite these challenges, the opportunity is significant. As Bitcoin matures as an asset class, the demand for professional-grade, secure, and user-friendly management tools will only increase. Institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals are increasingly looking for robust ways to hold Bitcoin securely, and solutions like Asigna’s smart multisig vaults are directly addressing this need. The focus on layer-2 also positions them well for the future growth of the Bitcoin network’s transaction capacity and utility. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Bitcoin Security Asigna’s successful $3 million seed funding round marks a notable step forward for the infrastructure supporting Bitcoin Security and management. By focusing on a non-custodial, smart Bitcoin Multisig vault for the base layer and layer-2 protocols, the Asigna Platform is tackling critical needs for enhanced control and protection of digital assets. The significant Crypto Funding secured from reputable investors underscores the perceived value and potential of their solution in the market. As the platform develops, it holds the promise of making advanced, secure Bitcoin management more accessible, contributing to the overall maturity and safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem for individuals and institutions alike.

Over the past week, major exchanges have reported surges in futures trading volumes, highlighting the growing demand for platforms that blend leverage with decentralized security, a trend Mantix capitalizes on with its next-gen futures offering. As traders seek alternatives to centralized platforms, Mantix’s presale stands out in the news for raising significant capital and garnering attention from holders of top chains such as Solana and Ethereum. Experts have opined that $MTX, being in Stage 1 of its presale , is on its way to delivering profits of up to 100x by 2026. Innovative Features of Mantix’s Next-Gen Futures Platform Mantix delivers futures trading with leverage up to 1000× across multiple blockchains, a level of exposure typically reserved for centralized exchanges but now accessible on a fully decentralized framework. Its deep-liquidity pools, aggregated from both on-chain and off-chain sources, ensure tight spreads even during volatile markets, positioning Mantix as the best crypto to buy right now for futures traders seeking minimal slippage and maximal capital efficiency. Built on a hybrid infrastructure model, Mantix layers AI-powered order routing atop smart-contract settlement, reducing latency and enabling sophisticated order types (like iceberg and TWAP) directly on-chain. This technological leap differentiates it from legacy decentralized exchanges and underscores its role as a new DeFi project designed for professional-grade trading without sacrificing transparency or security. Presale Performance Highlights and Revenue-sharing Model Since its launch, Mantix’s presale has made significant progress in Stage 1, with tokens fixed at $0.02 the lowest price point for $MTX before public listing. It targets a $10 million soft cap and $30 million hard cap and analysts predict that early participants could see up to 100× returns by mid-2026, driven by robust market adoption and periodic token burns that will tighten supply over time. A standout feature is the revenue-sharing mechanism: instead of earning yields by risking funds in liquidity pools, $MTX holders receive a proportional share of trading fees, providing passive income as the platform grows. This model not only aligns incentives but also insulates investors from impermanent loss, cementing Mantix’s reputation as the best crypto to buy right now for yield-seeking participants in a new DeFi project landscape. Why Mantix Stands Out as a Long-term Investment Choice Mantix’s community-governance layer grants token holders voting rights on protocol upgrades, fee parameters and partnership integrations, fostering a truly decentralized roadmap. Unlike competitors that centralize decision-making, Mantix ensures stakeholders have a direct voice, enhancing trust and alignment with long-term objectives. Furthermore, the project’s commitment to transparency is evidenced by on-chain reporting of all revenue distributions, buybacks and burns, audited in real time. This level of visibility, combined with ultra-low fees and an expanding suite of AI-driven trading tools, positions Mantix as not just another altcoin but the premier new DeFi project for futures trading. With its capped supply of 1.2 billion tokens, regular buyback-and-burn events and a clear roadmap for cross-chain expansion, Mantix offers a balanced ecosystem where growth and token value are mutually reinforcing. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy right now, it delivers a compelling combination of high-leverage trading, passive income and community governance all wrapped in an innovative, secure platform that’s built for the next wave of on-chain markets.

Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-ready-for-3000-breakout-analysts-say-sideways-action-is-about-to-end/,"Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The regulator initiated civil penalty proceedings against Liang Allan Guo over his alleged involvement in the collapse of ACX Exchange. Blockchain Global’s crypto exchange platform ACX allowed investors to buy and sell digital currencies. However, in late 2019, customers lost access to their funds on the exchange, leading to its collapse. Per the company’s liquidator’s estimates, Blockchain Global owes more than A$20 million ($12.8 million) in unsecured creditor claims to ACX customers. Blockchain Global Head Breached Directors’ Duties Per ASIC’s allegations relate to Guo’s dealings with the ACX Exchange customer funds. Further, the regulator pointed out statements made about those dealings and obligations to keep proper books and records. Liquidator Andrew Yeo from Pitcher Partners was appointed to investigate where the customers’ funds and digital assets went. The ASIC started an investigation in January 2024. The probe came after liquidators submitted a detailed report outlining Guo’s potential breaches of the Corporations Act, the release read. The report noted that as of October 2023, Blockchain Global had A$58 million ($37.3 million), owing to unsecured creditors. Guo was then barred from leaving the country in February 2024. However, he left Australia in September after his travel restraint orders expired and hasn’t returned, the regulator said. Customer Funds Loaned to Related Business According to a previous local media report , liquidator Yeo said that customer funds were also being loaned to a related business, which specialised in arbitrage trading. The liquidator’s report found that the firm failed to properly maintain records of customer funds. Additionally, Guo had transferred more than $1.7 million from an account holding customer funds to invest in publicly listed shares. This was put in the name of Guo’s family trust for the benefit of Blockchain Global, Yeo added. “What we have been able to ascertain, however, is that those funds were mixed with other company funds and used for a series of other purposes,” the liquidator said at the time. Further, in October 2023, the lawyer acting for investors involved in the civil claim against Blockchain Global, drew comparisons between the collapse of Blockchain Global to the demise of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX The post ASIC Charges Former Blockchain Global Director Over Duty Breaches Linked to ACX Exchange appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|ASIC|Australia,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-28 08:02:35

According to the analyst, XRP has successfully broken above what he terms the “6M Resistance,” doing so just one day later than initially projected in a previous update. The breakout, illustrated on the semiannual chart, could signal the beginning of a significant new upward phase in XRP’s price trajectory . 6 Monthly Time Frame Update on #XRP : You can find the updated 6M chart below. XRP has broken the 6M Resistance, 1 day later than our previous 6-monthly update. The Resistances: $5.85, $18.22 within the 3rd Wave. Targets: $66.96, $77.70 Supports: $2.2222, $1.8815 (Not Financial… pic.twitter.com/AuKjVfW4PT — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 26, 2025 The chart includes data stretching from 2015 to a projected move into the late 2020s. In this technical setup, two critical trendlines define the structure: an upper resistance line (labelled “RESISTANCE, ULTIMATE”) and a lower support line (labelled “SUPPORT, ULTIMATE”). This long-term symmetrical triangle appears to have been resolved to the upside in 2025, with XRP currently priced around $2.34, based on the image captioned in the tweet. Elliott Wave Projection Suggests Substantial Growth Potential Dark Defender overlays an Elliott Wave count on the six-month chart, currently identifying that XRP may be entering Wave 3 of a broader five-wave structure. According to this count, XRP has already completed waves 1 and 2 and has now initiated the more aggressive third wave, often regarded in Elliott Wave Theory as the most impulsive and extended in terms of price movement. Within Wave 3, Dark Defender highlights two immediate resistance levels: $5.85 and $18.22, corresponding with Fibonacci extension levels of 261.8% and 361.8%, respectively. These figures suggest potential upside movement before the wave completes. Should this structure play out fully, the chart projects targets as high as $66.96 and $77.70, representing Fibonacci extensions of 476.4% and beyond. These levels are indicated within what the analyst labels as Wave 5. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support Zones and Risk Management Commentary The update also identifies key support zones at $2.2222 and $1.8815, aligning with the 161.8% Fibonacci extension from the earlier move. These zones, while not presented as definitive floors, are offered as structural support areas that may provide price stability in the case of pullbacks. Dark Defender explicitly includes a disclaimer on the chart, clarifying that the targets and projections are not intended as financial advice and are shared for informational purposes only. Community Sentiment Expresses Urgency for XRP Breakout The post received a wide range of reactions, including one from an X user named HIM2podcast, who stated: “3 digits forsure this year, it’s along over due. Xrp needs to start hitting big or people will lose confidence and move on, 7 long years, while everything else pumps. Our time has come.” The comment reflects a broader sentiment among XRP holders who have maintained their positions through extended periods of market stagnation, awaiting a breakout on the scale suggested in Dark Defender’s chart. Outlook and Context This update comes at a time when many long-term investors in XRP are demanding performance that reflects the scale of the token’s historical promise and utility. The analyst’s use of high-timeframe charts and multi-year structures indicates a belief in an eventual major breakout, contingent on the confirmation of this current move above the ultimate resistance line. If the pattern progresses according to the Elliott Wave roadmap shared, and XRP achieves the forecasted targets of $66.96 and potentially $77.70, the move would represent a significant revaluation of the asset. However, the speculative nature of such projections remains tied to broader market conditions, regulatory clarity, and investor confidence. Dark Defender concluded the post, stating only, “We will experience,” leaving interpretation open-ended while reinforcing conviction in the projected trajectory.

This acquisition is part of a strategic shift towards incorporating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. What is the KindlyMD Bitcoin Acquisition? KindlyMD recently revealed its purchase of 21 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $2.3 million. The acquisition was made at a weighted average price of $109,027 per BTC. This investment represents a notable step for a healthcare data company entering the cryptocurrency space. The funding for this KindlyMD Bitcoin purchase came from the gross proceeds of a recent exercise of outstanding warrants. This exercise generated $8,748,370 and resulted in the issuance of 1,437,362 shares of common stock. Utilizing a portion of these funds for a Bitcoin acquisition underscores a deliberate decision by KindlyMD’s leadership. Implementing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The acquisition is explicitly linked to KindlyMD’s intention to implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy . This approach involves holding Bitcoin as a significant asset on the company’s balance sheet, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, gold, or other reserve assets. A Bitcoin treasury strategy can serve several purposes for a corporation: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate value against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: Gaining exposure to the potential long-term price growth of Bitcoin. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking and adaptability in a digital economy. KindlyMD’s adoption of this strategy aligns it with a growing list of public and private companies exploring or already holding Bitcoin. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is on the Rise KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While still relatively nascent, companies across various sectors are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of a modern corporate treasury. The pioneers in this space, like MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of BTC, have paved the way and provided a framework for others to follow. Factors driving this trend include: Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The maturing infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin (custody solutions, regulated exchanges). Growing acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin as a store of value. The potential for significant returns compared to low-yield traditional investments. KindlyMD, as a healthcare data company, adds an interesting dimension to the narrative of Corporate Bitcoin adoption , demonstrating that this strategy isn’t limited to tech or finance sectors. A Healthcare Company Embraces Bitcoin It’s particularly noteworthy that a Healthcare company Bitcoin purchase is making headlines. The healthcare sector is often perceived as more conservative regarding financial strategies. KindlyMD’s decision highlights a potential shift, where companies focused on data and technology within healthcare might be more open to innovative financial approaches. While the primary business of KindlyMD remains healthcare data, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury suggests a belief in the digital asset’s long-term value and its potential role in a future digital economy that may intersect with healthcare data management and transactions. The question arises: will other healthcare or data-intensive companies follow suit? KindlyMD’s move could serve as a case study for how a Healthcare company Bitcoin strategy can be implemented and managed. The Role of Nakamoto Holdings in the Merger This strategic Bitcoin acquisition is closely tied to KindlyMD’s proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings . Nakamoto Holdings is described as a Bitcoin holding company founded by David Bailey. David Bailey is a well-known figure in the crypto space, particularly recognized for his role as a crypto advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump. His involvement and the nature of Nakamoto Holdings as a dedicated Bitcoin entity strongly suggest that the post-merger company will have a significant focus on Bitcoin, both operationally and strategically. The merger indicates a deliberate move by KindlyMD to align itself with a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This alignment likely provides expertise, resources, and a shared vision for a Bitcoin-centric future that KindlyMD might not have had independently. What Does This Mean for KindlyMD and the Market? For KindlyMD, this move solidifies its commitment to a digital asset future. It positions the company, post-merger with Nakamoto Holdings, as potentially one of the few publicly traded entities with significant exposure to both healthcare data and Bitcoin. For the broader market, this serves as another data point illustrating the increasing diversification of companies exploring or adopting Bitcoin for their balance sheets. While the 21 BTC purchase is modest compared to the holdings of major corporations, the fact that it’s a healthcare data company signals the expanding reach of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin treasury strategy are clear, companies adopting this approach also face challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the company’s balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Custody and Security: Securely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for holding digital assets can be complex. KindlyMD, especially through its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings , is likely preparing to navigate these challenges with expert guidance. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward KindlyMD’s acquisition of 21 BTC marks a significant strategic decision, positioning the healthcare data company at the intersection of traditional business and the digital asset economy. Fueled by proceeds from warrant exercises and anticipating a merger with Nakamoto Holdings , this move signals a firm commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy . As more companies explore Corporate Bitcoin adoption , KindlyMD’s example, particularly as a Healthcare company Bitcoin holder, provides a unique case study. It highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset and underscores the evolving financial strategies of businesses looking towards the future. This development is a testament to the growing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and its potential to integrate with diverse industries.

Users can now trade tokenized assets such as the S&P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and gold (PAXG) on its platform, alongside hundreds of cryptocurrencies. EnclaveX said the launch of its first RWAs provides a massive advantage for traders, as it makes these traditional assets available around the clock, 24/7, giving them the opportunity to react rapidly to real-world events that could have significant market impacts. The RWAs were announced on X by EnclaveX Chief Executive David Wells, who said they can be traded with leverage “whenever you want”, so traders can put themselves in a better position for when the markets open. Wells said the ability to trade at any time is critical for investors, because the existing markets that close after-hours and shut down completely at weekends create artificial delays between the moment news breaks and the market reaction. But with tokenization, EnclaveX and the broader crypto industry is able to fix this issue at last. RWAs are tokenized versions of traditional assets such as stocks and shares, government bonds, treasury bills and commodities. In fact, just about anything with value can be tokenized, including assets such as real estate, luxury artworks and even bottles of fine wine. When something is tokenized, it’s represented on the blockchain as a digital token, which means it can be traded in a peer-to-peer way without intermediaries and time restrictions. This means investors have the ability to react 24 hours a day, any day of the week, and can trade with much lower costs as RWAs don’t require intermediaries. “Traditional markets close but opportunities don't,” Wells said. “When Asian markets open while Wall Street sleeps, when geopolitical events happen over the weekend, when gold spikes overnight – traders have been locked out of reacting in real-time.” Created by a company known as Enclave Markets , the EnclaveX platform has emerged as one of the crypto industry’s fastest-growing futures exchanges, offering the advanced trading features found on better-known offerings such as dYdX and GMX, together with enhanced security features. What’s unique about its platform is that each trade occurs within a secure enclave, where they are obscured from prying eyes. That’s unlike the open orderbooks found on traditional DEX platforms. The use of secure enclaves eliminates a risk known as MEV or front-running attacks, which is where bots attempt to manipulate orderbooks, jumping the queue ahead of human traders to secure advantageous prices. The company explains that its secure enclaves use the same cryptography techniques found on Apple’s iPhones, backed by a network of independent attestors that run separate nodes to authenticate the blockchain’s state. EnclaveX says this setup makes its perps DEX the most secure platform of its kind. This is the only market where you know, cryptographically, that you can't be cheated. Not even the market operators can steal funds, front-run you, extract MEV, or divulge your positions. https://t.co/XvIqbnmVZA — Emin Gün Sirer🔺⚔️ (@el33th4xor) May 27, 2025 The launch of SPY, QQQ and PAXG assets on EnclaveX is just the beginning of its RWA journey. Earlier this month, at the Avalanche Summit London event, EnclaveX unveiled its RWA roadmap for the first time, saying that it intends to “bridge the gap” between crypto and traditional finance by launching a broad range of RWAs on its platform, including various stocks and shares and “TradFi assets”. At the same event, EnclaveX debuted a new strategy recommendation engine called Enclave Intelligence, which aims to help regular retail traders take advantage of the kinds of sophisticated trading strategies that were previously only accessible to hedge funds. With it, traders can select markets of interest to them, such as crypto or commodities, and access curated information derived from hundreds of filtered signals, in real-time. For instance, if a breaking news event occurs, or interest rates are adjusted, traders can instantly adapt their trading strategies with the help of intelligent algorithms.

Alongside Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are also showing key technical setups. Bitcoin Holds at $108K Amid Profit-Taking Pressure Bitcoin is consolidating above $108,900, supported by a trendline in place since early April. Despite positive developments—including Circle’s IPO plans and news of a proposed $2.5 billion Bitcoin allocation by Trump Media —BTC has been unable to reclaim the $110K level. Glassnode data shows whales holding over 10,000 BTC have started to reduce positions, signaling light profit-taking. While broader sentiment remains positive, analysts caution that a drop below $104,000 could trigger a deeper correction toward the mid-$90,000s. Still, persistent ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend by absorbing market supply. Market Eyes Nvidia and Fed Minutes for Direction Investor focus is now on Nvidia’s earnings report and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s performance in the AI sector has historically correlated with broader risk asset trends, including crypto. A strong report could boost market sentiment and reignite upward momentum. Meanwhile, traders await the Fed’s tone on inflation and interest rates. While earlier concerns were tied to proposed tariff policies , recent delays may limit the impact of hawkish language—unless unexpected commentary emerges. XRP Holds Strong as XRPFi Ecosystem Gains Traction XRP is holding above its 200-day simple moving average, maintaining a bullish posture. Renewed interest is building around the emerging XRPFi ecosystem, powered by Ripple’s EVM-compatible sidechain and DeFi protocols like Strobe Finance. Glassnode highlights that over $2.15 billion worth of dormant XRP is held in inactive wallets. If this idle capital flows into XRPFi applications, it could stimulate growth on the XRP Ledger and lift XRP prices in the coming weeks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Conference 2025: Winklevoss Twins Fuel $1M BTC Talk, Claim “Orange Is the New Gold” , Solana Aims for $220 If $180 Resistance Breaks Solana is gradually building upward momentum, recently testing the $187 level. According to analyst Pentoshi , SOL must convert the $180 resistance into support to target a move toward $220. The price action reflects growing confidence, but confirmation will require sustained trading above the breakout level, along with increasing user activity and on-chain adoption. Conclusion The crypto market stands at a key technical and macroeconomic crossroads. Bitcoin’s current consolidation, paired with influential external events like Nvidia’s earnings and the Fed minutes, could set the tone for short-term price direction. Meanwhile, assets like XRP and Solana show promising signs of breakout potential, supported by ecosystem growth and investor interest. As always, while long-term sentiment remains bullish, short-term volatility and policy risks should be carefully monitored. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ADA might hit $10 this year, while XRP is on track for a new ATH; Unilabs, a top ICO that blends AI and DeFi, could explode in value post-launch. Table of Contents Unilabs: Attracting the interest of Cardano and XRP whales Ripple: Targeting a new peak this cycle Cardano: Can it reach $10? Unilabs: The next big thing after ADA and XRP? Historically, ICOs have outperformed top altcoins, evidenced by the success of the ETH and BNB initial coin offerings. Unilabs, a novel AI-backed asset manager for digital assets, is set to follow in this path, driving massive demand and interest. On the radars of XRP and Cardano whales, UNIL is among the leading AI coins to buy now. As a presale token, it offers a low entry point and a strong chance at significant gains: $0.0051 in Stage 2 of the ICO. Amid high demand, early funding has surpassed $1.2 million, with some calling it the best crypto to invest in. Unilabs: Attracting the interest of Cardano and XRP whales Unilabs (UNIL) perfectly combines artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, and might be this year’s leading ICO. Aiming to follow in the footsteps of ETH and BNB, its value could explode post-launch, with the current price of $0.0051 in stage 2 of the presale presenting a great entry. On the question of its unique offering, UNIL will be the world’s first AI-backed asset manager for digital assets. As of Q2 2025, it has over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) spread across four high-profitability funds: AI, BTC, Mining and RWA Funds. The platform’s unique value proposition includes identifying high-performance investment funds across various crypto sectors early, across bullish narratives like DePIN, AI and RWAs. A powerful AI engine will be at its heart, scanning and analyzing thousands of blockchain projects in real-time around the clock. By identifying promising early-stage opportunities before they reach the mainstream, Unilabs is set to become a key player in DeFi. Ripple: Targeting a new peak this cycle XRP , like the rest of the crypto market, trades upward on the monthly chart, a 5% gain. It hovers above $2.2, preparing to retest its 30-day high of $2.65 amid rekindled interest and demand. According to experts, reclaiming this level could push the XRP price above $3, supported by the neutral RSI data and 200-SMA. The SEC settlement is another bullish catalyst, with crypto analyst Be1iev9r suggesting a bounce above $3.50. GalRockwood, another bull, predicts $8 this year, an optimistic XRP forecast. As it gathers steam for a bounce back, XRP is among the top DeFi tokens to buy now. You might also like: ETH prepares for price surge; Unilabs to offer more utility and profitability than DOGE Cardano: Can it reach $10? The Cardano price ( ADA ) is up 7% in the past month and could soar even higher. A retest of its monthly peak of $0.86 is expected in the coming days, which could fuel its rally above $1. At the same time, technical analysis signals a bounce in the price, supported by the Hull Moving Average (9) and neutral 14-day RSI data. In addition, Baddukes suggests ADA could hit $4.40 and $6.14 this year, which is ambitious but not impossible. Meanwhile, a more conservative ADA forecast is by Icewallowcrypto: $4 and higher this cycle. However, ADA whales have been stacking up Unilabs, a new AI coin, to make the most of this bull cycle. Significantly undervalued and with massive growth prospects, it is on experts’ lists as a promising option. Unilabs: The next big thing after ADA and XRP? As a presale token, it isn’t far-fetched to state that Unilabs has higher upside potential than Cardano and XRP. Currently in its early stages and with plenty of room to run, it could outperform major players, with experts forecasting a run similar to Ethereum after its launch.

45196202,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=736219,1748424052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45196202.jpeg,North Korea’s Lazarus Group steals over $5.2M from a crypto trader,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lazarus-group-begins-hacking-individuals/,"North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been linked to a cyberattack that stole more than $5.2 million from a crypto trader on May 24, according to blockchain investigator ZackXBT. The theft occurred through a sophisticated malware attack, with funds siphoned from several wallet types including multisig, externally owned accounts (EOAs), and exchange wallets. The incident, revealed on ZackXBT’s Telegram channel on Tuesday, insinuated that the group could be changing their focus from high-net-worth individuals and companies to intraday individual traders. After the heist, approximately 1,000 ETH was funneled into Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing service commonly used to obscure the origin of stolen digital assets. The stolen assets were then promptly liquidated on the open market. Addresses traced, Tornado Cash used to launder funds ZachXBT’s channel listed three Ethereum addresses tied to the heist. Along with minor token balances of QBX, Blocklords, Astra Protocol, and DAI totaling around $1,340, the principal address had more than 40 ETH, which is around $107,000 at current market values. It is thought that these funds were part of the malware attack’s profits. Last weekend, just nine transactions were processed using the second address, which seemed to be new. It sent more than 200 ETH to the main address. Finally, as of this publication, the other crypto address held around $2.7 million DAI, which was the majority of the stolen funds. This pattern of conduct is consistent with what was found in a recent study by TRM Labs, which details the worldwide web of Russian criminal organizations and Chinese over-the-counter brokers that North Korea uses to launder its illegal profits. The report alleges that Lazarus supplies the technical expertise, but their partners provide the channels to integrate stolen funds into markets legitimately. Money laundering continues in Q2 2025 In April, blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain reported that a wallet believed to be associated with Lazarus offloaded 40.78 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for $3.51 million. The Bitcoin, originally purchased in February 2023 for about $999,900 when WBTC traded at $24,521, was sold at $83,459 per coin for a profit of 251% over two years. Today, the Lazarus Group (North Korean hackers) sold 40.78 $WBTC ($3.51M) for a $2.51M profit (+251%)—after buying it 2 years ago. They spent 999.9K $USDT to acquire the $WBTC at ~$24,521 in Feb 2023, and sold it for 1,857 $ETH at ~$86,170 just 12 hours ago. The hackers then… pic.twitter.com/KYQmqnJnIC — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 3, 2025 The proceeds were converted into 1,847 ETH and later split among three wallets. The largest tranche of 1,865 ETH was traced to another wallet reportedly operated by the group. Instead of holding the converted ETH, Lazarus distributed 2,507 ETH across multiple addresses. DPRK-linked hackers were also connected to the infamous $1.5 billion hack on the Bybit crypto exchange. In the aftermath of the breach, the group allegedly laundered nearly 500,000 ETH, equivalent to about $1.39 billion, across multiple transactions within just ten days. 黑客已经把从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH ($13.9 亿) 全部清洗完了，整个过程历时 10 天。 ETH 价格在这个过程中下跌了 23% (从 $2,780 跌到现在的 $2,130)。 而黑客洗钱使用的主要通道 THORChain 也因黑客洗钱获得了 $59 亿的交易量跟 $550 万的手续费收入。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/osoKNzFhkG pic.twitter.com/QUWuMmV6zH — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 4, 2025 At least $605 million was funneled through the decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain in a single day. Yet, blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence estimates that wallets tied to Lazarus still hold approximately $1.1 billion in crypto reserves, including significant holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. Cybercrime funding nuclear ambitions United Nations investigators monitoring sanctions compliance believe that the proceeds from these cyberattacks are being funneled into North Korea’s weapons development programs. Between 2017 and 2023, the country reportedly used crypto-based revenue streams to improve its missile technology, increasing its capacity to strike targets far beyond the Korean peninsula. In a report published last December, Chainalysis confirmed that hackers connected to the regime stole over $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency in 2024 across 47 incidents. “ Hackers linked to North Korea have become notorious for their sophisticated and relentless tradecraft ,” the Chainalysis insight said, noting that these efforts are used to bypass international sanctions and fund the state’s illicit operations.

These cryptocurrencies are backed by bullish narratives, from Layer-1 to AI. Layer-1 tokens like SOL and TRON are strong bets heading into the next leg of the altseason. Also, UNIL is among the top DeFi tokens to invest in, which can be linked to its combination of AI and DeFi. As the world’s first AI-backed asset manager for digital assets, its outlook is bullish. It is even more promising due to its massive upside potential as a low-cap coin. Unilabs (UNIL): Helping Retail Investors Unlock Significant ROIs Unilabs (UNIL) surpassed $1.2 million in funding in its ongoing presale as whale demand skyrocketed, highlighting its potential and vibrant community. Fundamentally solid, it stands at the intersection between artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi). In addition, its growth prospects as a new and low-cap coin dwarf the Solana coin and the TRON coin—one of the best AI coins to buy now. Navigating uncharted waters, UNIL will be the world’s first AI-backed asset manager for digital assets, designed to reshape DeFi. As of the second quarter, this platform manages over $30 million in assets, distributed among its four primary investment vehicles: Artificial Intelligence, Real-World Assets, Mining and Bitcoin funds. At the platform’s core will be a powerful AI engine that continuously scans and analyzes thousands of blockchain projects in real-time. Aiming to offer a smarter, faster and more strategic way to invest in digital assets, Unilabs will evaluate key metrics like tokenomics, community growth, market momentum, developer activity and on-chain data. Hence, promising opportunities will be identified before exploding, allowing retail investors to maximize gains. Solana (SOL): A Top DeFi Token to Bet On Following a 15% rally in the monthly timeframe, the Solana coin is hot on the heels of its January all-time high—$294. A breakout above $200 will validate this thesis, placing it among the altcoins to watch. Trading above $170 amid rising whale activity, next on the bulls’ list might be a retest of its 30-day high of $187. Supported by bullish moving averages like the 200-EMA and 100-SMA, the Solana price could explode in the coming days or weeks. LosKruptos, a Solana bull, targets a big breakout above $200. Meanwhile, TheCurrencyA, another SOL analyst, hints at a significant price leap above $500, which might be a bold Solana price prediction. TRON (TRX): Experts Believe $1 is On The Cards Technical analysts suggest a bounce in the TRON price, notably the bullish 20-VWMA and Hull Moving Average (9). Set for a repeat of its remarkable performance in December 2024, when it recorded an all-time high of $0.44, the TRON coin is among the top DeFi tokens to buy now. Currently down by 35% from its previous high, TRX presents a good entry. Hence, whales have been stacking up, hoping to ride the coin’s next leg up. At the same time, optimistic TRON price predictions have been flying, hinting at its bullish outlook. BlakeInCrypto, a leading expert on X, suggests bulls could push the price above $1. FatRatKiller, another crypto trader and analyst on X, predicts a new high this cycle, citing blockchain adoption, market trends and partnerships as potential catalysts. While the TRON coin is considered one of the best altcoins to invest in this year, Unilabs, a new AI altcoin with a small market size, offers significantly greater returns. Whales are actively investing in utility-backed altcoins such as Solana, TRON and Unilabs. Unilabs (UNIL): More Promising and Pocket-Friendly Than Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) The UNIL token is significantly undervalued compared to the Solana coin and the TRON coin at $0.0051 in stage 2 of the ICO. In addition to being budget-friendly, its growth prospects as a low-cap token are staggering, driving whale interest. Poised to attract substantial traditional hedge fund investment, Unilabs is a new DeFi project to watch out for.

Among these are Solana, TRON, and Unilabs, all of which are currently enjoying robust support from cryptocurrency whales who see long-term value in their offerings. The Rising Star: Unilabs (UNIL) and Its AI-Driven DeFi Platform With a significant infusion of capital surpassing $1.2 million in its presale, Unilabs (UNIL) has quickly become a darling of the investor community. This platform is not only breaking new ground by being the first AI-backed asset manager in the digital space but also by its potential to drive substantial returns for retail investors. Unilabs leverages advanced AI to analyze and manage a diverse asset portfolio which includes cryptocurrencies, real-world assets, and even mining operations. The platform’s AI engine evaluates projects using complex metrics like market trends, developer activity, and community engagement to maximize investment efficacy. Unilabs: A Comparative Dive with Solana and TRON Compared to established tokens such as Solana and TRON, Unilabs might seem like a newcomer. However, its innovative approach and lower market cap present outsized growth opportunities, making it a particularly attractive option for those looking beyond the usual cryptocurrency giants. Solana (SOL): Gaining Momentum Amidst Technological Advances Following a recent rally that marked a 15% increase, Solana is demonstrating strong market resilience and potential for further growth. Analysts are bullish, with predictions of the coin breaching past high marks and setting new records in the upcoming months. Whales have been noticeably active in trading Solana, indicating a confidence in its foundational technology and its role in the DeFi sector. Its high-performance blockchain offers the speed and scalability that applications require, driving its adoption and enhancing its value proposition. TRON (TRX): Setting Sights on the Dollar Mark The TRON ecosystem continues to expand its capabilities and partnerships, making significant strides in blockchain and decentralized applications. With its price currently on the rebound, expert analysts like BlakeInCrypto are optimistic, suggesting milestones such as reaching the $1 mark are not only possible but likely in the near future. Supported by strong technical indicators and market sentiment, TRON could potentially outperform its previous highs, bolstered by continuous development and adoption across various sectors.

Unlike typical spikes fueled by short-term news, this attention is rooted in the project's unique approach to decentralized AI infrastructure. With its Bonus Round presale still open , Lightchain AI has already raised $20.8 million and continues gaining traction without the help of exchange listings or hype-driven volatility. Its architecture—tailored for intelligent workloads and privacy-first computation—offers something that Avalanche and Chainlink currently don’t: a purpose-built system aligned with future blockchain use cases. As rumors around its potential circulate faster in private circles and trading groups, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the quieter, more focused story of 2025. Why Trader Chatter Around Lightchain AI Is Drowning Out Flat Market Leaders Even as Chainlink and Avalanche hold steady on the charts, neither is igniting the kind of market-wide conversation that drives speculative energy. In contrast, Lightchain AI has sparked an organic wave of chatter among traders, influencers, and early-stage analysts alike. What makes this stand out is that it's not based on quick pump cycles—it’s driven by consistent engagement tied to real infrastructure development. With a focus on decentralized AI computation and transparent governance, Lightchain AI offers a fresh thesis in a space filled with legacy narratives. Its Bonus Round presale, set at $0.007, has already brought in $20.8 million. But more than funding numbers, it's the growing curiosity across forums and private groups that shows this isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan token. What Rising Speculation Signals as LINK and AVAX Stay Quiet on the Charts But the speculative energy typically comes before price action — and this time, Lightchain AI is the one sucking it in. LINK and AVAX remain quiet on the volume front; and their stories are currently paused, waiting for the next catalyst. Scalper traders are actively pickling Lightchain AI for lack of a better description, looking for early-stage projects with strong architecture. Its AI-first architecture - focused on real-time execution, modular node roles and privacy-preserving protocols - is a technical road-map that's truly unique. And instead of banking on brand, it’s collecting a track record of traction during its early-phase roll-out. With presale participation increasing, interest is becoming a momentum driver in its own right. The takeaway? Though the charts remain sideways for LINK and AVAX, attention is becoming a leading indicator for where capital could soon flow next. Could Viral Buzz Alone Push Lightchain AI Ahead of Stagnant Altcoins Hype isn’t always empty—and in the case of Lightchain AI, the growing buzz is paired with clear fundamentals. The project’s early appeal isn’t based on nostalgia or recycled market cycles. Instead, it’s about a blockchain intentionally crafted for AI-specific workloads, privacy standards, and decentralized participation. While Avalanche and Chainlink continue to serve their respective niches, neither has stirred the kind of excitement Lightchain AI is now commanding. Part of that comes from its Bonus Round access window, which has captured the interest of both retail and speculative buyers. But more importantly, it's the credibility behind the design—scalable infrastructure, developer incentives, and community governance—that's fueling word-of-mouth momentum. If early-stage chatter holds weight, Lightchain AI may move faster than expected while others idle.

Don’t Miss Out on This New Crypto for 5000% ROI,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-out-on-shiba-inu-shib-dont-miss-out-on-this-new-crypto-for-5000-roi/,"If you were one of the many who watched Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocket from fractions of a cent to a multi-billion-dollar market cap in 2021 without taking action, 2025 may offer a powerful second chance. SHIB is currently trading at $0.000015, holding steady with renewed interest—but it’s not the only dog in the fight anymore. A new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining momentum fast, drawing comparisons to early SHIB days thanks to its sub-$0.05 price and a revolutionary DeFi utility that sets it apart from typical meme tokens. A strong investor backing has emerged through acquisition by more than 11,500 buyers who have raised $9.3 million during its ongoing presale. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 5 token presale will earn 100% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. While SHIB still has potential for moderate gains, many investors are shifting focus to new altcoins with higher upside, and analysts are already whispering about a possible 5,000% ROI from MUTM as its presale accelerates. If you’re scouting the best crypto to buy now, this may be your shot at riding the next breakout. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates To Phase 5 The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $9.3 million total sales and attracted more than 11,500 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Resilient USD-Pegged Stablecoin Following Certik Audit Completion Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by auditable, open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. In this release, Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be your next big win. With $9.3M raised, 11,500+ investors, and a $0.03 presale price set to jump to $0.06, early buyers can earn 100% ROI. Backed by a Certik-audited dual lending model and a stablecoin launch, MUTM is a top DeFi pick.

Today, attention is squarely on the Asian FX market, which has seen currencies dip as the US Dollar stages a notable rebound. This shift highlights the ongoing sensitivity of global markets to central bank policies, economic data, and risk sentiment. For anyone tracking financial trends, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Why is Asian FX Dipping? Currencies across Asia have generally softened against the greenback. This dip isn’t happening in isolation. Several factors contribute to this trend: Stronger US Dollar: A primary driver is the renewed strength of the US Dollar . When the dollar gains, currencies in emerging and developed markets often face downward pressure as capital flows back towards dollar-denominated assets. Interest Rate Expectations: Market expectations about future interest rate paths in major economies, particularly the US, play a significant role. If the Federal Reserve is perceived as likely to keep rates higher for longer, it increases the appeal of holding dollars. Regional Economic Outlooks: While some Asian economies show resilience, others face domestic challenges or slower growth momentum compared to the US, impacting investor confidence in their currencies. Geopolitical Factors: Global uncertainties can sometimes lead investors towards safe-haven currencies like the US dollar, putting pressure on more growth-sensitive currencies in Asia. The Resurgence of the US Dollar The US Dollar has shown strength recently, reversing some of its earlier losses. This rebound is supported by several pillars: Solid Economic Data: Recent economic indicators from the US, such as employment figures or inflation readings, have sometimes come in stronger than anticipated, suggesting the US economy remains relatively robust. Federal Reserve Commentary: Statements from Federal Reserve officials often guide market expectations. Any hint of a cautious approach to rate cuts or emphasis on inflation control can bolster the dollar. Yield Differentials: Higher yields on US government bonds relative to those in other countries make dollar assets more attractive to international investors. The dollar’s strength has a direct impact on the Forex Market globally, influencing everything from major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY to the performance of emerging market currencies. Focus on Japan Bonds and the Yen The Japanese bond market, specifically Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), is under scrutiny. Upcoming bond sales are key events. The yields on these bonds are closely watched because they influence borrowing costs in Japan and affect the value of the Japanese Yen (JPY). The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) monetary policy, particularly its stance on yield curve control and interest rates, remains a critical factor. Any perceived shift in BoJ policy or significant movements in JGB yields can trigger volatility in the Yen and have spillover effects across the Forex Market . Investors are looking for clues on whether yields will continue to rise, which could support the Yen but potentially tighten financial conditions in Japan. Australian CPI Takes Center Stage Another major data point grabbing attention is the upcoming Australian CPI (Consumer Price Index) release. Inflation data is paramount for central banks when making decisions about interest rates. For the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the CPI reading will be a key input into their policy considerations. A higher-than-expected CPI could increase the likelihood of the RBA maintaining a hawkish stance or even considering further rate hikes, which would typically be positive for the Australian Dollar (AUD). Conversely, a soft CPI might lead to expectations of earlier rate cuts, potentially weighing on the AUD. The outcome of this data is a significant event for the Forex Market , particularly for pairs involving the AUD. Navigating the Current Forex Market Landscape The current Forex Market environment is characterized by sensitivity to data and central bank communication. Here are some aspects to consider: Challenges: Volatility is a constant challenge. Unexpected data releases or shifts in central bank rhetoric can cause rapid currency movements. Predicting the exact timing and magnitude of these shifts is difficult. Actionable Insights: Keep a close watch on key economic calendars for major releases like US inflation and jobs data, the Australian CPI , and statements from central bank officials (Fed, BoJ, RBA). Understand how different outcomes might impact currency pairs. Examples: The AUD/USD pair is directly impacted by the Australian CPI . USD/JPY is highly sensitive to US yields and BoJ policy related to Japan Bonds . Movements in the broader US Dollar index affect most Asian FX pairs like USD/KRW, USD/SGD, etc. Understanding these interconnections provides a clearer picture of the forces driving currency values globally. Summary: What to Watch For In summary, Asian FX is currently facing headwinds from a stronger US Dollar . The dollar’s rebound is fueled by solid US data and hawkish sentiment. Meanwhile, the Forex Market is keenly awaiting signals from Japan Bonds , specifically upcoming sales and BoJ policy implications, and the crucial Australian CPI data, which will shape expectations for RBA policy and the AUD’s trajectory. These elements are key drivers of short-term currency movements and reflect the ongoing recalibration of global monetary policy expectations.

The 27.4% decline from 37.22 million SOL in early March comes after a series of institutional and retail occasions pushing tokens off exchanges and into self-custody programs. Solana exchange outflows driven by institutional and ETF demand The decline in Solana exchange balances is due to numerous institutional innovations that have created demand for off-exchange custody. On March 20, the first batch of Solana futures ETFs was introduced. This was the beginning of institutional product exposures in SOL . Once the futures ETF launches, the biggest financial houses like Grayscale, Fidelity, and Franklin submitted applications for spot SOL ETFs. Bloomberg raised the chances of spot ETF application approval to 90% by 2025 and generated institutional investor anticipation. This regulatory progress has prompted institutions to move their SOL holdings to compliant custodians or cold wallet storage rather than keeping tokens on exchanges, according to analyst Murphy. The institutional preference for secure custody solutions has contributed to the overall reduction in exchange balances as professional investors prepare for potential ETF launches. Staking activity has also increased substantially, with approximately 64% of total circulating SOL currently staked across various protocols. The total value locked in protocols such as Raydium, Jito, and Marinade has surged. This attracted more SOL to be moved on-chain to participate in staking rewards. Additionally, specific whale movements have been tracked, including 374,000 SOL transferred from Binance to an unknown wallet on April 21, 2025, and 145,000 SOL moved from Kraken to three newly created addresses on May 2, 2025. DeFi and meme coin activity drives on-chain SOL demand The Solana network has experienced substantial growth in decentralized finance activity and meme coin trading. This has created additional demand for SOL to be moved off exchanges. Since April, the network’s total value locked has increased by 54%. Decentralized exchange trading volume on Solana jumped 90% in 30 days. Based on the data, meme coin trades accounted for more than 92% of total Solana DEX trading volume. Such activity requires the holder of SOL in self-custodied wallets to participate in on-chain trading, coin minting, airdrops, and other meme token usage. Meme coin popularity on the Solana blockchain has created a loop where SOL is taken out from centralized exchanges to participate in such on-chain activities. High transaction frequency and constant trade of meme tokens necessitate SOL to be readily available in individual wallets for trading and gas fee purposes. This on-chain activity trend differs from more traditional exchange-based trading because users have to have direct access to the blockchain in order to partake in the ecosystem of meme coins. Combined with DeFi growth and meme coin popularity, this has driven steady demand for SOL to be held in self-custody rather than on exchanges. Critical price resistance level at $176 could determine SOL’s trajectory Solana is at about $175 at the moment and according to URPD (Unrealized Profit/Loss Distribution) figures, SOL has reached the strongest resistance level of $176. It contains the highest agglomeration of accreted tokens. The current market movement places SOL 40.6% below its all-time high price of $293.31 recorded on January 19, 2025. The 24-hour range for the token is $174.20 to $178.90, and the 7-day range is $167.42 to $186.79. Source: Murphy X post Analysis indicates that once SOL crosses above $176, there would not be much locked-in positions above this level. However, the $162-$176 range contains huge built-up positions that become both support in downtrends and resistance in going higher. The mix of this reduced exchange offsetting this technical setup signifies that although short-term direction in price is ambiguous, structural change in SOL dissemination potentially might be capable of providing longer-term support for higher prices if resistance level is surpassed.

This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017. It starts out a couple of years before as the altcoin’s price makes lower peaks and then trends down for a retest. After this, there is a period of consolidation before the trend is broken and an upward rally begins. In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

45196416,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68759,1748424873,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s How Ripple’s RLUSD Could Become a U.S. Synthetic CBDC,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-ripples-rlusd-could-become-a-u-s-synthetic-cbdc/,"A recent tweet by digital asset analyst and researcher SMQKE presents a compelling perspective on how Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could serve as a U.S. synthetic central bank digital currency (CBDC). Unlike traditional CBDCs issued directly by a central bank, synthetic CBDCs are issued by private entities but are fully backed by central bank reserves. This model allows stablecoin issuers to offer digital money that mirrors the reliability of sovereign currency without the central bank necessarily issuing or managing a retail token directly. The synthetic CBDC concept outlined in the image emphasizes that, once a stablecoin reaches significant adoption, jurisdictions may opt to mitigate associated risks by requiring full reserve backing at the central bank level. This includes potentially granting stablecoin issuers direct or indirect access to central bank reserves. The text highlights the importance of integrating reserve-backed stablecoins into a legal and regulatory framework that supports due diligence, consumer protection, and transaction monitoring. Such a structure promotes financial stability and reduces the risk of destabilizing runs on the system. Remember, RLUSD can act as a “synthetic CBDC” for the United States. https://t.co/l2qPUTDk1U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 25, 2025 RLUSD’s Technical Architecture and Access to Reserve Systems SMQKE’s analysis identifies RLUSD as a prime example of a synthetic CBDC model due to its indirect access to central bank infrastructure. Although Ripple does not hold a Federal Reserve Master Account directly, it connects to critical infrastructure via Finastra, a financial technology firm with access to key Federal Reserve services, including FedNow and the Fed’s Liquidity Management Tool. This connection allows RLUSD to settle in central bank money, ensuring it remains within regulated financial pathways. This design leverages existing payment rails, such as the Fedwire Funds Service, FedACH, and FedNow, which the accompanying document confirms are already capable of handling wholesale CBDC-like operations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These systems provide central bank money settlement without requiring the issuance of a new form of digital currency by the government. As highlighted in the report, wholesale, non-token-based CBDC effectively exists today through these Master Account channels. Regulatory and Political Considerations The political climate in the United States further complicates the potential launch of a retail CBDC. As noted in SMQKE’s tweet and supported by the document, the issuance of a direct digital dollar appears unlikely in the near term, partly due to a ban on federal digital currency initiatives enacted during the presidency of Donald Trump. Moreover, the current consensus among policymakers and researchers, including those involved in the Hamilton Project, is that any move toward a digital dollar will require years of analysis and will likely result in coexistence with privately issued stablecoins. The most recent update from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in March 2024 confirms that the U.S. does not anticipate launching a retail CBDC in the immediate future. The document underscores that even if a digital dollar is eventually introduced, it will likely not replace stablecoins such as RLUSD. RLUSD as a Functional Bridge In light of the uncertain timeline for an official U.S. digital dollar, Ripple’s RLUSD presents a practical path forward. It is structured to operate within the current legal and regulatory environment while achieving the goals of a CBDC in financial stability, transaction efficiency, and central bank reserve backing. With indirect but regulated access to central bank payment systems and infrastructure, RLUSD aligns with the characteristics of a synthetic CBDC and may serve as a de facto blockchain-based dollar in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/bitcoin-btc-breakout-or-more-sideways-consolidation-price-analysis,"As every day passes, the potential Bitcoin breakout is awaited ever more keenly. $BTC hanging out above $108,000 since the beginning of the week is perhaps giving the impression that a breakout may not be far away. Are we in a final period of accumulation before the rocket boosters fire up, or could a significant rollover be about to take place? US Market Closure Boosts Bulls on Tuesday Reopening The US stock market was closed for the observance of Memorial Day on Monday, and this would have helped the market to digest the fallout over President Trump imposing, and then postponing 50% tariffs on Europe. Therefore, when markets opened on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq climbed steadily throughout the day. S&P 500 recommences strong rally Source: TradingView The S&P 500 is a sight to behold. The precipitous fall caused by the first few weeks of the Trump tariffs took the Index down 21% from the more than $6,100 high. However, an equally sharp rally since that bottom has taken the Index to within touching distance of $6,000, with a potential new all-time high just above that. Nasdaq bouncing back to all-time high Source: TradingView The Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped even further to more than 26%, but as can be seen in the 2-week chart above, the index was held up by the ascending trendline. Currently at $19,199, the $20,195 all-time high is also not far away. The 2-week Stochastic RSIs for both indices show that there is plenty of gas in the tank for upside price momentum. Global money supply winning against mainstream doomsayers Mainstream media is full of how the US and global economies are failing, and how the Trump tariffs will eventually result in another stock market crash, scaring off investors. Nevertheless, global money supply continues to tick up, and should keep doing so into Q4 of 2025 as major economies are obliged to service their debts. $BTC heads towards next breakout point Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the price is bouncing off of an ascending trendline and is heading towards a potential breakout of the above downtrend line. It will be important for the bulls to succeed in this breakout, given that a break down through the ascending trendline would likely take the price back at least to the major support at $106,600. $BTC 2-week chart bullish or bearish? Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for $BTC may even be taken as bearish at first glance. The current 2-week candle, just like the one before it, is failing to get above the resistance of the previous January all-time high at $109,300. That said, the MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart is signalling that the indicator lines are crossing up, and the first green histogram bar is being formed. It could be that the price dips back down to confirm the $104,000 horizontal support, but as long as this holds, the bullish upward trend is still in play. Of course, the price could also shoot skywards in these next 11 days if this last resistance can be surmounted. A catalyst for either direction could also play a role.

U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is making a major play for Canadian fans through new multi-year deals with Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts, even as the company deals with backlash over a recent incident that exposed sensitive customer data. The partnerships, announced in a blog post on Tuesday, will see Coinbase become the exclusive crypto exchange and wallet partner for both teams under the Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment umbrella. Fans can expect jersey patches on Argonauts uniforms, fieldside ads at BMO Field, and even a swanky new “Coinbase Lounge” at the stadium, the report reads. The company also plans to roll out digital games, contests, and crypto education campaigns targeting Canada’s estimated 5 million crypto holders, though details are yet to be revealed. “This collaboration marks an exciting step in our commitment to engaging with passionate global sports communities and expanding our presence in Canada. As the exclusive cryptocurrency exchange and wallet partner for both Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts, Coinbase will be integrated into the fan experience in meaningful ways.” Coinbase You might also like: UK wants more crypto user data just as trust in KYC takes new hit The deal comes as Coinbase works to rebuild trust following a recent data breach that exposed customer information including home addresses and ID documents.

The exchange has attempted to mitigate the fallout, offering a $20 million bounty for information leading to the hackers’ arrest and pledging to reimburse affected users, though concrete results from these efforts have yet to materialize.

In a major coordinated effort, the crypto exchange worked with U.S. authorities to stop a phishing operation that stole more than $20 million in crypto using fake versions of its own website. This was a polished, persistent setup with dozens of phishing domains targeting Coinbase users across the world. Phew! At the center of it all was Chirag Tomar, now convicted for running a scheme that tricked victims into handing over sensitive login info – and watching their funds disappear within minutes. But just as Coinbase celebrated the win, a few tough questions started circling. Let’s unpack it all. The Copy-Paste Scam That Fooled Everyone It started back in mid-2021. Victims were lured to lookalike websites like coinbasepro.com and other fake domains. These sites were designed to mirror the real thing almost perfectly. Once someone logged in, they’d usually get a phone call from someone pretending to be Coinbase support. From there, the scam kicked into full gear – phishing for 2FA codes, guiding victims to install remote access tools, and draining wallets before anyone knew what hit them. One person lost $240,000 in just a few minutes. Others had their entire holdings wiped out. “Crypto leaves a permanent, traceable trail,” said Paul Grewal , Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer. That transparency helped law enforcement follow the stolen funds, even as they were funneled through crypto wallets and spent on luxury goods in different countries. Eventually, it led them to Tomar. He was arrested at the Atlanta airport in December 2023 and sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Victory or Distraction? Coinbase’s Own Crisis Builds Coinbase may have helped close a case that’s been in the works for years, but the timing is complicated to say the least. Just a day before announcing the takedown, Coinbase was hit with a class-action lawsuit over a recent data breach – one that exposed user info and led to a $4.5 million fine from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The lawsuit claims the breach involved an insider threat and that Coinbase failed to warn users about the risk. The company allegedly refused a $20 million ransom before turning to law enforcement for help. A Breach in Public Trust This story is a reminder of two things: crypto’s transparency can be a powerful tool for justice – but trust remains fragile. The scam worked not because of technical flaws, but because people believed what they saw and heard. The websites looked legit. The fake support agents sounded convincing. And once users gave up control, the damage was instant. The lesson here? Be skeptical. Real support won’t ask for 2FA codes. Double-check URLs. Don’t let urgency cloud your judgment. This case may be closed, but the questions it raises about crypto security, trust, and transparency are far from over.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 09:37:27

In fact, El Salvador bought 30 more BTC in May alone. Analysts speculate El Salvador could still comply with IMF terms by routing purchases through third parties. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet is escalating its own Bitcoin strategy by raising $50 million via zero-interest bonds backed by Evo Fund to increase its holdings beyond 7,800 BTC. However, critics argue that investors are overvaluing firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, and suggest that direct Bitcoin purchases offer better value. Adding to Bitcoin’s mainstream momentum, Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. announced it will roll out Bitcoin payments via Square by 2026 using the Lightning Network, promising speed, lower fees, and greater merchant flexibility. El Salvador Under IMF Scrutiny The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on May 27 that it reached a staff-level agreement to disburse $120 million to El Salvador, contingent upon executive board approval. This payout follows an initial review of the $1.4 billion, 40-month loan agreement that was signed last year. However, the disbursement comes with certain conditions—particularly regarding El Salvador’s continued involvement with Bitcoin. The IMF explained that the government must cease operations related to the Chivo wallet by the end of July and must ensure that the amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged. Despite these terms, El Salvador appears to be maintaining its pro-Bitcoin stance . Just hours after the IMF announcement, the country's Bitcoin Office posted on X that it had once again to its Bitcoin holdings. According to the official Bitcoin tracker , El Salvador acquired 30 BTC over the past 30 days, bringing its national Bitcoin reserve to 6,190.18 BTC. This persistent acquisition strategy is in line with President Nayib Bukele’s ongoing plan to purchase one Bitcoin per day . The IMF reiterated earlier in March that El Salvador should halt Bitcoin accumulation and avoid launching new Bitcoin-related initiatives. Yet Bukele’s administration remains firm, and recently announced that the country's Bitcoin holdings are now at an unrealized profit of $386 million. This is a gain of 132% on the total investment. (Source: BitBo ) While the IMF continues to call for restraint, some analysts, including intergovernmental blockchain adviser Anndy Lian,proposed that El Salvador may still technically comply with IMF conditions by routing purchases through non-governmental entities. Meanwhile, IMF officials acknowledged that the country is currently in compliance with broader performance criteria, which only complicates the enforcement of Bitcoin-related conditions. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Holdings El Salvador is not alone in its BItcoin accumulation mission. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced a $50 million private placement of zero-interest bonds to help expand its Bitcoin holdings. The May 28 announcement revealed that the bonds, issued in $1.25 million increments, will not offer investors any periodic interest payments. Instead, profits—if any—will be realized solely through the bond’s redemption value at maturity. Part of Metaplanet’s announcement The sole investor in this round is Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm that served as Metaplanet’s principal backer in its Bitcoin acquisition initiatives. Evo Fund consistently subscribed to previous rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds and continues to support the firm’s crypto-focused capital deployment. The new bonds are unsecured and come with no guarantees or collateral, which implies that the level of trust between the two entities is quite impressive. Despite the size of the issuance, Metaplanet stated that the bonds are expected to have minimal impact on its 2025 financial results, though the company promised to disclose any relevant updates in the future. The decision to raise capital through this unconventional bond structure is part of a trend among firms seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. Metaplanet's move also follows its second-largest Bitcoin purchase to date, where it acquired 1,004 BTC worth over $100 million, bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC valued at more than $800 million. Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) The company’s aggressive accumulation strategy has greatly affected its market valuation. According to a report by 10x Research on May 27, Metaplanet’s stock is trading as if its Bitcoin holdings were worth five times their actual value. This fueled criticism from some financial circles, including veteran investor Jim Chanos , who argued at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York that investors are overpaying for Bitcoin exposure through companies like Metaplanet and Strategy. Chanos revealed that he is selling shares in these firms to buy Bitcoin directly, which suggests that direct exposure offers more accurate value and potentially higher returns than relying on corporate wrappers. Square to Roll Out Bitcoin Payments by 2026 In other Bitcoin-related news, Jack Dorsey’s Block, Inc. is set to bring Bitcoin payments to Square, its popular merchant payment platform. The company unveiled the plan during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, and showcased the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise booth. Bitcoin payments will be facilitated using the Lightning Network, allowing for fast and low-cost transactions. The rollout is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025, with full availability for all eligible Square sellers expected by 2026, pending regulatory clearance. The new feature will allow merchants to accept Bitcoin payments using existing Square hardware, with the option to either hold the received BTC or have it automatically converted into fiat currency in real-time. Jack Dorsey shared the update on X , and specifically pointed out the flexibility this offers to merchants. This initiative builds on Square’s current Bitcoin Conversions feature, which lets sellers convert a portion of their earnings into Bitcoin. According to Miles Suter, Block’s Bitcoin Product Lead, the goal is to give merchants more choice and economic empowerment when it comes to accepting payments. He described the integration as seamless for consumers, with payments made by simply scanning a QR code while Square and the Lightning Network handle the backend processing. In tandem with the Square announcement, Block revealed it is also enhancing the privacy and security of its Bitkey self-custody wallet. Bitkey launched in late 2023, and is receiving updates to improve accessibility and eliminate the need for traditional seed phrases, making self-custody much more user-friendly for the broader public. The benefits of Bitcoin payments were also pointed out by Dan Edwards, COO of the American fast food chain Stake n’ Shake . At the conference, Edwards said the company halved its payment processing fees since adopting Bitcoin as it it is faster than credit cards and significantly cheaper.

Render ( RENDER ) price declined 8% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $4.50 as the trading volume is surging over 150%. The drop appears to be caused by confusion surrounding the May 27 Coinbase announcement about the delisting of the RNDR token. However, the delisting affects the older Ethereum-based version of Render (RNDR), not the newer Solana-based RENDER. https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1927396045098488053 Coinbase announced it will suspend trading for RNDR alongside Helium Mobile ( MOBILE ), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse ( SYN ) on June 26. The reason cited was that these older tokens no longer meet listing standards due to the availability of updated versions. Following the delisting announcement, Render Network issued a reminder that users should upgrade to the Solana-based RENDER token, outlining instructions on how to do so. Nevertheless, many investors rushed to sell their RENDER tokens due to a misunderstanding about what was being removed. Great reminder to upgrade your RNDR, (ERC-20 token), to RENDER, (Solana based SPL token). To upgrade your RNDR to RENDER, go to https://t.co/iqBE6QEQII , and follow the instructions.

Most major exchanges auto-upgraded user holdings a while ago, but Coinbase lagged behind, leading to the recent confusion. As sell pressure mounted due to the FUD, many were grateful for the opportunity to buy the dip. One user encapsulated the sentiment sharply, stating : “So funny how many retards on X can’t comprehend what the Coinbase announcement means ( ERC-20) .

EOS price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. EOS/USD value has stepped down to a $0.766 low in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a decline toward the immediate support line of $0.753. On the other hand, a push by the buyers could create a strong rebound on the price chart. As a result, the EOS price might see a strong push toward $0.786. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent rejection around the $0.774 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and plunged the price near the immediate support channels around $0.766. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.725 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.76 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.76 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinion on EOS Vaulta announced that its current total value locked (TVL) has reached $261 million. The blockchain also claimed that its ecosystem is under expansion, with its all-time high TVL recorded at $299 million.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April. In May, EOS is changing hands at $0.72.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-28 09:40:00

Recent data confirms a notable trend: US spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting substantial capital, signaling growing confidence and interest from investors. What’s Driving the Latest Ethereum ETF Inflows? According to figures released by Farside Investors, US spot Ethereum ETFs collectively experienced a net inflow of $38.8 million on May 27th. This single-day performance is part of a larger, encouraging pattern – it marked the seventh consecutive trading day where these newly approved investment products saw more money come in than go out. This consistent positive flow suggests a building momentum following the initial regulatory steps towards their launch. While the total figures are still modest compared to the early days of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the trend itself is highly significant. Breaking Down the ETH ETF Performance While the total figure tells one story, looking at individual fund performance provides more detail on where the money is heading. On May 27th: BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in a substantial $32.5 million in net inflows. As one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock’s participation and early success in attracting funds are particularly noteworthy. Fidelity’s FETH followed, adding $3.4 million to its holdings. Fidelity is another major player whose involvement lends considerable credibility to the space. VanEck’s ETHV saw $2.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating interest beyond just the two largest funds. Other approved ETFs reported no change in their holdings on that specific day, which is not uncommon in the early stages of such products. This distribution highlights that while multiple issuers have received approval, initial investor capital appears to be concentrating in funds offered by established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. Why Are These Inflows Important for the Crypto ETF Market? The emergence and subsequent performance of US spot Ethereum ETFs represent a critical evolution in the broader Crypto ETF market . For years, investors seeking direct exposure to cryptocurrencies faced hurdles, including setting up crypto exchange accounts, managing private keys, and navigating varying regulatory landscapes. Spot ETFs change this. They offer a regulated, familiar investment vehicle that allows investors, particularly institutional ones, to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly holding the underlying asset. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for traditional finance participants. The positive inflows, even if not yet in the billions seen by Bitcoin ETFs, validate the market’s appetite for these products and pave the way for potentially larger capital allocations in the future once trading officially commences. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent inflows into ETH ETF products are a strong indicator of growing Institutional crypto adoption . Large firms, wealth managers, and institutional investors typically prefer regulated products like ETFs over direct crypto ownership due to compliance requirements, ease of management, and integration into existing financial systems. BlackRock and Fidelity attracting the bulk of early inflows underscores this point. These are firms catering to massive pools of institutional and high-net-worth capital. Their clients now have a straightforward way to add Ethereum exposure to diversified portfolios. While retail investors will also benefit from the accessibility, the primary significance of spot crypto ETFs often lies in unlocking institutional demand, which has the potential to bring substantial liquidity and stability to the market over time. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? While the approval of US spot Ethereum ETFs was a major milestone, the next crucial step is the commencement of trading. This requires approval of the S-1 registration statements from the SEC. The timing of this remains uncertain, though many analysts anticipate it could happen in the coming weeks or months. Once trading begins, the market will be watching closely to see if the positive inflow trend continues and accelerates. Factors that could influence future inflows include: Overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s price performance. The success of the ETFs in attracting both retail and institutional capital. Further regulatory clarity or developments. The current streak of inflows, even pre-trading, suggests a pent-up demand that is starting to materialize. This bodes well for the potential impact these products could have on the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader digital asset investment landscape. In Summary The recent data showing US spot Ethereum ETFs attracting $38.8 million in net inflows on May 27th, extending a streak to seven consecutive days, is a positive development for the crypto market. Led by significant contributions from BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, these inflows highlight growing interest and anticipation ahead of official trading commencement. This trend is a key indicator of increasing Institutional crypto adoption and represents a significant step forward for the Crypto ETF market , offering regulated access to Ethereum. As we await the final regulatory green light for trading, the sustained positive flow into these ETH ETF products signals a promising future for mainstream investment in Ethereum.

But according to top crypto analysts, that wait might be almost over, and what’s coming next could feel like a massive wave for altcoins. The Calm Before the Altcoin Storm? When markets are quiet, emotions tend to take over. Many investors are starting to believe that the altcoin run is already over, or worse, that a bear market is around the corner. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently reminded investors that most altcoins are still trading near their bottom levels. That might sound negative at first, but here’s the twist, bottoms often come right before major rallies. I don't understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner for #Altcoins . They are literally on the bottom. The BTC valuations have been declining massively. The money printer is about to get started. The final easy 12-24 months are coming. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 27, 2025 Van de Poppe believes that the next 12 to 24 months could offer the “final easy” gains for altcoin holders before the market shifts again. Momentum Is Building, Quietly If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ll notice Bitcoin has been grabbing most of the attention, both in headlines and in market dominance. As of now, bitcoin dominance has hit its peak of 64%, which suggests that the turnaround is near. Meanwhile, popular altcoins like Solana, ADA, and XRP have shown some movement but are still trading well below their all-time high price. Solana, for example, has risen nearly 15% in the last 30 days, now sitting around $173. But zoom out a bit, and it’s still down more than 30% from highs seen just a few months ago. XRP tells a similar story, small short-term gains, but still far from previous highs. Traders Predict a Shift Despite the growing bitcoin dominance, Crypto experts like Davinci Jeremie and other analysts are backing van de Poppe’s outlook. They believe the tide is turning, and once it starts, altcoins could explode in value. Yet, many altcoins remain underperformers, and market sentiment hasn’t shifted fully. Currently, Altcoin Season Index sits at just 25 . To begin the altcoin season, at least 50 altcoins need to outperform BTC’s performance. But if these traders are right, altcoins might soon get their moment to shine, and it could happen faster than most expect.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 09:46:59

Investors are getting bullish as excitement builds over a potential U.S. spot ETF approval. The market is responding with optimism, seeing the move as a major step toward broader institutional access and legitimacy for the token. Though XRP cleared the securities tag partially, a final court judgement is awaited; however, the pace SEC is going with XRP ETFs, it seems all is under control and approval is on the way. SEC Opens Door for XRP Spot ETF The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially started reviewing the WisdomTree XRP Trust, a proposed spot ETF that would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without owning the token directly. This would be the first U.S.-based spot XRP ETF, potentially laying the groundwork for other crypto ETFs in the future. Filed by Cboe BZX Exchange , the ETF aims to mirror the price of XRP via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. If approved, it would enable XRP trading through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for crypto wallets or private keys. Investor Protection at Play As part of the process, the SEC has published a notice under Release No. 34-103124 , calling for public feedback. The agency wants input on whether the product protects investors and how it plans to tackle market manipulation concerns. The Commission has 240 days to decide whether to approve or reject the application. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: XRP Price Prediction For May 28 , Ripple Pushes Back on ‘Security’ Tag Today, @Ripple submitted an additional letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force addressing a key question from Commissioner Peirce’s “New Paradigm” speech: When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract? We appreciate the continued engagement with the Task Force.… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 27, 2025 At the same time, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, fired back at the SEC’s broader crypto stance . In a recent letter to the agency’s crypto taskforce, he urged clearer rules, stating that XRP is not a security. He warned that vague regulatory terms like “decentralized” or “fully functional” only add confusion for both issuers and market participants. With the SEC’s clock ticking and public comment now open, all eyes are on how the Commission handles this groundbreaking application. For now, bullish sentiment is picking up, and XRP’s rally suggests that traders are betting big on a regulatory breakthrough. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In its May 27 letter , Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper , “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote: “[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘ securities ’ when transferred in secondary transactions.” In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.” Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure rule SEC’s “new paradigm” Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech . She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding: “Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.” Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding: “Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.” Ripple’s long fight with the SEC The SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket . This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple. The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020 , when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company . In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.” Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-28 09:59:06

Millions cling to that dream. But behind that hope is a mathematical wall—a $1 price would require Shiba Inu’s market cap to exceed $589 trillion, nearly six times the entire global economy. That’s not a strategy. That’s gambling. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is laying the foundations of real wealth, real technology, and real user empowerment. While others are waiting for miracles, BTC-S is shipping infrastructure, enabling mobile mining, and rewarding everyday users for contributing to the ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris Is Redefining What Mining Looks Like Mining has always been seen as exclusive. Expensive. Complex. Reserved for tech pros with rooms full of gear. Bitcoin Solaris is changing that narrative completely. Using its dual-layer blockchain powered by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), BTC-S enables fast, low-energy, and highly scalable mining from devices that users already own. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, people can mine BTC-S on: Smartphones (Android/iOS) Laptops or desktop computers GPU/ASIC rigs (optional for advanced users) No overheating. No complex setup. No power bills draining your wallet. Just one tap to start, and your mining session is underway. The app automatically adjusts to your device’s capacity, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency. This is mining built for the 21st century, and it’s why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from serious builders, not just speculators. Presale Details: A Launch That’s Gaining Real Traction Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 5 of its presale, with momentum accelerating fast: Current Price: $5 Next Phase: $6 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 11% Unlike speculative coins banking on hype, BTC-S is offering early access to a functioning ecosystem. The presale lasts only 90 days, with the official launch set for July 31, 2025. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and more than 11,000+ unique users have joined in. The estimated 1,900% return isn’t just numbers—it’s backed by a working product, upcoming app release, real token distribution, and transparent smart contract audits. Influencers Are Already Talking One of the most notable early deep dives into Bitcoin Solaris comes from Crypto Dex World , who provided a thorough breakdown of why BTC-S stands out. From mobile mining to energy efficiency and the Nova app’s intuitive design, the review emphasizes that Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a moment—it’s a movement. Follow updates on X , or join the growing community on Telegram . The future isn’t just being debated—it’s being built. Referral Program: Double Rewards, Double Growth To encourage community growth during the presale, Bitcoin Solaris introduced a Double Rewards Referral Program. Here’s how it works: Referrer: Earns 5% commission in BTC-S for every presale purchase made through their link. Referred: Gets a 5% bonus on their purchase amount—more tokens for the same price. Getting started is simple: Log in at bitcoinsolaris.com Copy your unique referral link Share it across crypto communities, social media, or with friends and investors Unlike typical referral programs, both sides benefit equally. It’s not just about driving traffic—it’s about growing together. Conclusion: Hype Fades. Infrastructure Pays. Shiba Inu isn’t the enemy—but the hype around whether it can ever reach $1 is a distraction from real opportunities. The numbers don’t lie, and wishful thinking won’t rewrite economic law. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is building quietly, delivering steadily, and growing daily. From its mobile-first mining experience to its transparent presale and rewarding community programs, BTC-S is setting the stage for sustainable crypto growth. If you’re tired of watching and ready to build—this is your window.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks explained that although he could not guarantee federal purchases of Bitcoin, the executive order permits an acquisition, if done in a manner “that does not increase the national debt or require new taxes.” Crypto Czar says US government can buy Bitcoin According to Sacks, the executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve only allowed the US to use Bitcoin held by the government from criminal or civil asset forfeitures. Yet, the order’s language also authorizes future purchases contingent upon compliance with federal budgeting constraints. “ If it can be done in a budget-neutral way, specifically, if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs ,” Sacks explained. Cabinet secretaries like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could greenlight such acquisitions should they find unused funds from existing federal programs. “ I can’t promise anything ,” Sacks said, “ but there is a pathway to doing that… if they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization ready .” AI, Bitcoin, and energy When asked about what the Trump administration has planned for AI and cryptocurrency in the next 100 days, Sacks told the Winklevoss twins that one of the President’s primary agendas is to improve America’s energy sector. Drawing a parallel between AI’s dependence on GPU-powered data centers and Bitcoin mining’s reliance on ASIC machines, he stressed that the West needs a domestic energy expansion. “ You need electricity to power GPUs for AI data centers. And you need it for Bitcoin ASICs to generate hash power ,” he said. “ We need a lot more power to basically fuel this future of AI and crypto. ” Sacks praised the administration’s energy stance, citing Trump’s push to expand US oil and gas production under the slogan “drill, baby, drill.” “ Beyond ‘drill, baby, drill,’ we need to build, baby, build ,” he continued, “ it just needs to be a lot easier in the United States .” US crypto-focused executive actions On President Trump’s first full day in office, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of Silk Road. Two days later, the administration issued an executive order prohibiting the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), formally ended Operation Choke Point 2.0, and launched the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. By March, Trump had signed the order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, treating Bitcoin as a national reserve asset for the first time in US history. Additionally, the White House hosted the inaugural Digital Assets Summit, the first time the crypto industry was formally acknowledged at such a level. Crypto Czar David Sacks at Bitcoin 2025:“At the end of the day, we see that blockchain, Bitcoin, crypto, this is the financial system of the future.”""We want this innovation happening in the United States."" $BTC $XRP $HBAR pic.twitter.com/ZzshYR17ZH — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) May 28, 2025 The crypto czar hysterically talked about the administration’s choice to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Sacks referred to the agency as “Elizabeth Warren’s personal goon squad to terrorize crypto companies.” “ Under the Biden administration, and as we all kno,w Elizabeth Warren had the auto pen all this innovation was being driven offshore. It was being driven to other countries and that’s not the American way. We want this financial revolution happening in the United States. We want to be leading in this.

Camino Network is a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain tailored for travel - an industry where payments are slow, integrations are painful, and fees drain billions every year. Instead of just promising real-world use cases, Camino is the use case: its infrastructure is already being used by over 230 travel brands for bookings, ticketing, payments, loyalty, and cross-border operations. From Lufthansa to SIXT to Miles & More, industry giants are not just using Camino - they’re helping govern it. Built by Chain4Travel and launched in 2023, Camino is the foundation for TravelFi - a new era of borderless, transparent, and efficient travel services powered by blockchain. A strong partner in this ecosystem, Monerium launched its EURe stablecoin on Camino, further enhancing the platform's utility and trust. Built for the Real World Traditional travel operations bleed ~3% on payment fees alone. Camino Network cuts that to near-zero - and adds instant finality, smart contract automation, and decentralized data access. This isn’t experimental. Camino has already: Processed 2M+ live transactions Onboarded 100+ validators Connected 230+ businesses with blockchain infrastructure Gone live with real-world assets like tickets and bookings Camino isn’t about NFTs or memecoins. It’s about replacing decades-old travel rails with Web3-native efficiency. The Ecosystem: Powered by CAM At the heart of Camino Network is the $CAM token - used for everything from paying transaction fees to rewarding network participants. Gas & Settlement - All transactions on Camino are paid in CAM Validator Rewards - CAM secures the network through Proof-of-Stake & Authority (PoSA) Governance - Validators and CAM holders shape the future of TravelFi As the token went public in Q4 2024, it will fuel the expansion of tokenized travel products across the ecosystem. Use Cases Taking Off Camino is already hosting live products and travel apps that solve long-standing pain points. A few examples: Lufthansa - Tokenizing sustainable airline fuel (SAF) credits and distributing flights via Camino Messenger Sleap.io - The first fully Web3-powered online travel agency Freshcells - Building dynamic, blockchain-native trip configurators Hoteltrader - Reinventing hotel inventory distribution Camino Messenger - A decentralized communication protocol for B2B travel And more coming - all running on a live chain with real-world usage. Tech Stack & Standards Camino is built on EVM-compatible architecture with: Integrated KYC/KYB Smart contract tooling for travel-specific apps Interoperability with major wallets and developer tools Auditability and compliance features designed for enterprise The result: a blockchain that feels like Web2 - but with Web3 transparency, speed, and cost-efficiency. Why Camino Matters Most blockchains build tech and wait for adoption. Camino started with adoption and built the tech around it. It’s the first L1 where: Validators are actual enterprises, not just node operators RWAs are standard, not speculative Use cases are live, not theoretical Camino isn’t for traders. It’s for builders - and for the 1.3 billion people who fly, stay, rent, and book every year. What’s Next? Q4 2024 - Public listing of the CAM token 2025 - Scaling to 500+ connected businesses Continued launch of tokenized services across loyalty, identity, payments, and carbon tracking Deepening validator governance and ecosystem funding This isn’t a pitch. It’s a roadmap already in motion - and backed by names that already move the travel economy. Fun Fact When AWS went down in 2024 and froze travel apps worldwide, Camino kept processing. Why? No third-party hosting. Every transaction and booking was fully on-chain - and unstoppable. Camino Network isn’t promising to change the world someday. It’s already changing how the world moves. Welcome to the Layer 1 where planes, hotels, and tickets live on-chain.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-28 10:02:45

Will BTC Purchases Stop This Time?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-statements-about-el-salvador-and-bitcoin-came-from-imf-will-btc-purchases-stop-this-time/,"El Salvador, which has accepted Bitcoin as legal currency and signed a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in recent months. In exchange for the loan, the IMF wanted to impose a series of restrictions on El Salvador, such as reducing its BTC purchases. However, during this process, El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoin despite the IMF's pressure to restrict it. While El Salvador continues to purchase BTC, a new statement came from the IMF. The IMF announced that the initial review of the $1.4 billion loan agreement has been completed and that it has agreed to pay $120 million to the country in the first phase. The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the agreement, El Salvador will be required to fulfill its previous obligations to limit government interference in Bitcoin. The IMF also said it would work to ensure that the amount of Bitcoin held by the government of El Salvador remains unchanged. “On Bitcoin, the IMF will continue efforts to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held in all government wallets remains unchanged.” This stance contradicts President Nayib Bukele’s statements about increasing the country’s Bitcoin holdings. The IMF also reiterated its stance that El Salvador should stop accumulating Bitcoin and not engage in any other Bitcoin-related activities. Bitcoin Purchases Continue Despite IMF! Shortly after the IMF’s announcement on May 27, El Salvador once again shared that it was purchasing Bitcoin. El Salvador's Bitcoin Office reported that the country has once again purchased more Bitcoin from account X. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves currently stand at 6,190.18 BTC, with data showing the country amassing 30 BTC in the last 30 days.

Last month, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) quietly published Guidelines 02/2025 on the processing of personal data through blockchain technologies. Buried in paragraph 63 is a line that jolted the entire web3 stack: “When deletion has not been taken into account by design, this may require deleting the whole blockchain.” That one clause converts GDPR from the world’s privacy gold standard into a kill-switch for every permissionless network. Yes, that includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and the hundreds that settle trillions of dollars a year. You might also like: The moment for mass adoption is here, and crypto’s still not ready | Opinion The reality is worse than it seems because deleting every node is the only surefire way to “forget” a transaction. The guideline effectively makes permissionless networks non-compliant by default. Public consultation comes to a close on June 9—after that, the text hardens into Europe’s enforcement playbook. After that, Europe’s future is set. GDPR was never written for tamper-proof ledgers The 2018 GDPR authors assumed that data lives on centrally controlled servers where a single operator can erase it. Fast-forward to modern-day public blockchains; the opposite is true. Blockchains are distributed, immutable, and borderless. Public chains rely on thousands of independent nodes that jointly guarantee history. Since rewriting a block would destroy that integrity, Article 17’s “right to be forgotten” collides head-first with the very feature that makes blockchains trustworthy. Techniques such as salted hashes, zero-knowledge proofs, and off-chain data pointers already minimize or obfuscate personal information—the new draft barely acknowledges them. Instead, it assumes that a single “data controller” can be identified, which is another notion that undermines decentralization and permissionless network integrity. Sovereign-cloud ambitions are at risk For two years, Brussels has promised a sovereign cloud—digital autonomy on European terms. The Commission’s latest policy goals are explicit. By 2030, three-quarters of EU businesses should run on cloud-edge technology; 10,000 climate-neutral edge nodes must be live, and the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act vows to triple the EU’s data-centre capacity within seven years. All of this is framed as digital sovereignty. The problem is, sovereignty requires independence. Today, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud still hold roughly 70% of Europe’s cloud market. Members of the European Parliament warn that without an indigenous backbone, EU data remains one United States subpoena away from offshore exposure. The only architecture that can realistically break that grip is a decentralized cloud in which infrastructure providers are coordinated by blockchain incentives, while data stays inside European data centres. If the EDPB renders those ledgers illegal by design, Brussels will hard-wire the very dependency it claims to end. Paragraph 63 would kneecap Europe’s builders By threatening whole-chain deletion whenever a single record cannot be erased, the draft injects existential risk into every European web3 project and ices any future venture funding. Its bias toward permissioned ledgers nudges developers back to the centralized silos policymakers say they oppose. Labeling volunteer validators “data controllers” would saddle hobbyists with corporate-grade liability, shrink node participation, and weaken network security. Treating every peer-to-peer link as a regulated international transfer risks splintering global consensus behind national borders. Requiring human overrides for smart contracts breaks composability and undermines everything from decentralized finance to on-chain Environmental Social and Governance reporting, which big energy companies have already piloted. A joint call-to-action from the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) and Web3Privacy Now warns that the draft guidelines “fundamentally threaten the existence of public blockchains” across Europe. What more evidence does the EU need to see that including this paragraph will kneecap its own builders? Privacy-by-design beats prohibition A cleaner path preserves both privacy and decentralization. Destroying an encryption key or proving in zero-knowledge that the key is irretrievable satisfies the intent of Article 17 without dismantling a ledger. The guidelines should recognize cryptographic deletion alongside physical erasure, state that a 32-byte on-chain hash is not personal data, and treat validators as processors rather than “controllers.” Brussels has already shown through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation that bespoke rules for frontier tech can be crafted without blanket bans. Striking the kill-switch sentence, codifying key-to-dust deletion, and clarifying validator status would align GDPR with technical reality, all while keeping Europe’s sovereign-cloud strategy alive. The public-comment portal closes in less than a month, and unless paragraph 63 is rebalanced, Europe risks spending the next decade paying U.S. hyperscalers to host ‘sovereign’ data. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will build on auditable, privacy-preserving rails beyond Brussels’ reach. With time fast running out, builders, investors, and policymakers should hit that comment portal now, before Europe locks itself out of its own digital future.

However, recent market patterns, slowing transaction throughput, and rising competition have analysts and investors asking a hard question: Is Ethereum still the most promising vehicle for life-changing returns? According to a growing chorus of experts analyzing 2025 crypto forecasts, a shift is already happening. While Ethereum continues consolidating above $2,500, many analysts are now turning their attention to Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—a next-generation project they claim may offer superior ROI potential, greater accessibility, and unmatched scalability. Ethereum’s 2025 Outlook: Strong, but Capped? Ethereum has recently stabilized, defending support above $2,500 after struggling to break out from the $2,700 zone. While technical indicators such as a slight MACD bullish crossover and RSI nearing 50 suggest strength may return, the lack of strong volume is a concern. Even bullish price forecasts hover around $6,000–$7,500 by 2025. Yes, Ethereum remains vital to DeFi and Web3. But investors seeking exponential upside, especially those priced out of ETH’s current levels, are starting to look elsewhere. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: A New Wealth Blueprint Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is designed for one thing: to become the next-generation alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering real wealth-building potential without the high entry barriers or technical complexity. While Ethereum evolves slowly through layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin Solaris launches with a dual-consensus architecture that blends Proof-of-Work (PoW) for base-layer security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for fast, energy-efficient smart contract execution. The result? A chain capable of 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality—blazing past Ethereum and Ripple. Unlike Ethereum’s gas-fee woes, BTC-S boasts 99.95% lower energy consumption than Bitcoin and no bottlenecks. Plus, it’s designed to support mining from common devices like smartphones and laptops, removing technical hurdles and empowering everyday users. It’s no surprise, then, that top influencers are paying attention. Crypto Legends praised Bitcoin Solaris as “the next evolution of Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Crypto Dex World praised Bitcoin Solaris as ‘a must-have project for serious investors’. Your Smartphone Just Became a Crypto Powerhouse—Start with BTC-S Not Just Technology—A Movement Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just promising speed or DeFi compatibility. It’s building a movement for fair access. The upcoming Solaris Nova app, though not yet available, is being developed to allow mining on mobile and desktop devices, inviting first-time investors into a world that was once only accessible to crypto elites. Security is also a core pillar. Bitcoin Solaris has successfully passed two independent audits—one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins —along with a KYC certification via Freshcoins , giving early participants confidence in the project’s legitimacy and transparency. Why Analysts See BTC-S as the Better Play for 2025 Lower entry price and higher upside potential compared to ETH Built-in scalability from day one—no reliance on rollups or upgrades More inclusive mining is designed for non-technical users Fixed 21M supply like Bitcoin, enabling long-term value retention Immediate Solana compatibility, with 1:1 token migration to the Bitcoin Solaris native chain once live The Clock Is Ticking Bitcoin Solaris is in Phase 5 of its presale, with a current price of $5. The next price increase takes it to $6, and the launch is set for $20. With over 11,000 unique users and $1.2M+ already raised, the momentum is undeniable. And with only weeks left until the July 31, 2025, cutoff, this is one of the shortest, most high-impact presales on record. Final Thoughts Ethereum will always have a place in the crypto ecosystem, but its growth curve may already be priced in. For those seeking outsized returns in 2025 and beyond, Bitcoin Solaris offers a clean slate: strong tech, low energy use, real accessibility, and an explosive upside. The future of wealth building may not lie in chasing legacy tokens but in pivoting early to the next breakout chain.

Telegram is expected to raise at least $1.5 billion in a bond issue on May 28, with support from existing backers like BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported . As part of the sale, Telegram is offering investors five-year bonds at a 9% yield, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter. Telegram plans to use the proceeds to buy back remaining debt from bonds issued in 2021, which are due to mature in March 2026. Discounts for potential Telegram IPO Apart from existing Telegram bondholders like BlackRock and Mubadala, the sale is also expected to bring new investors, including the US hedge fund firm Citadel. The WSJ report came weeks after Bloomberg first reported on Telegram's bond sale in late April, with sources claiming that the company was holding investor meetings about a bond sale worth about $2 billion to refinance its debut debt offering from 2021. According to the Financial Times, Telegram’s new bond offering will allow investors to buy shares in a potential initial public offering at a 20% discount, mirroring the terms of previous bond sales.

Next week, the platform will delist 11 spot trading pairs but it’s not the obscure tokens catching headlines. It’s the delisting of USDT/USDC , a staple stablecoin-to-stablecoin pair many traders rely on, that’s turning heads. Why now? That’s the question echoing across the market – especially as OKX ramps up its U.S. expansion with licenses in 47 states and a new San Jose headquarters. The timing is too sharp to ignore. OKX Pulls the Plug on Major Trading Pairs Alongside USDT/USDC, the delisting list includes lesser-known names: ZERO/USDT and ZERO/USD PRQ/USDT and PRQ/USD IQ/USDT and IQ/USD ARTY/USDT and ARTY/USD SAMO/USDT and SAMO/USD OKX says the decision comes from a “regular review process to maintain healthy trading markets,” but gave no further insight. However, a separate statement cited two drivers: internal market monitoring and user feedback. These trading pairs have shown signs of increased volatility, lower liquidity, or poor market performance. The move reflects a commitment to “user protection and market integrity.” The community’s left reading between the lines. USDT/USDC has long served as a quick liquidity bridge between stablecoins – so it’s not a typical delisting candidate due to low volume or volatility. U.S. Expansion Meets Internal Reshuffling OKX’s U.S. strategy has been aggressive in 2025, capped by the hiring of former Barclays and Hidden Road exec Roshan Robert to lead regional operations. But behind the curtain, there’s been a shake-up. Legal transitions are underway. Global General Counsel Melissa Muehlfeld, who rose through the OKcoin ranks, has exited. It follows a string of senior departures after OKX’s $500 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year. The firm’s newly appointed CLO is Linda Lacewell – former NYDFS superintendent – now tasked with overhauling legal and compliance from the inside out. Proof-of-Reserves Hints at a Deeper Shift Just weeks before the delisting announcement, OKX’s April 7 snapshot revealed a 3.62% drop in USDT holdings (≈$295M) and an 8.04% drop in USDC (≈$100M). Coincidence? Possibly. But the realignment of reserves, paired with the removal of a core stablecoin pair, raises bigger questions about OKX’s evolving priorities – especially in a U.S. market under renewed regulatory scrutiny. What Traders Should Know Now All open orders tied to the affected pairs will be automatically canceled during the delisting window. Funds will still be accessible under the “Untradable” section, but OKX urges users to withdraw or convert assets before the cutoff. So it’s clear – even the most familiar trading pairs aren’t immune to a reset!",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 11:33:13

Despite the recent bounce, the token remains capped by strong resistance zones, and its short-term structure still reflects high CETUS price volatility as traders assess whether the rally can continue or stall below key levels. The broader trend remains indecisive, but technical indicators are offering early signs of renewed momentum. That said, bulls will need a sustained break above the $0.172 resistance to re-establish control in the near term. What’s Happening With CETUS’s Price? CETUS price forecast (Source: TradingView) The CETUS price action over the last 72 hours has been defined by a sharp rebound from the $0.130 support base. As shown on the 30-minute and 4-hour charts, the token has broken above its falling wedge structure, rallying more than 25% from recent lows. However, the rally paused near the $0.172 supply zone, which is aligned with the upper Bollinger Band and 50-EMA on the 4-hour chart.

Again. And when the high priest of Bitcoin speaks, the market listens – whether you agree or not. This time, the MicroStrategy founder has slammed the idea of publishing on-chain proof-of-reserves, calling it a ‘bad idea’ and a ‘security threat.’ His advice? Hold your own crypto. Don’t just trust the system – be the system. Meanwhile, in a bold move that’s sure to keep crypto X buzzing, President Donald Trump’s media company just announced a $2.5B plan to create a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Once a skeptic, Trump has fully embraced crypto’s political and economic momentum. This latest move makes it official: under his leadership, Bitcoin isn’t just tolerated – it’s being woven into the fabric of American enterprise. With Bitcoin grabbing headlines again and institutional moves piling up, a new crypto project is riding the momentum in an unexpected way. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – a crypto project that’s handing out free Bitcoin through airdrops, and it all works through a self-custody wallet ( Best Wallet ) that even Saylor would approve of. Big Bets and Bigger Warnings Trump Media’s decision to establish a corporate Bitcoin treasury is a bold one. The company plans to raise $2.5B , aiming to buy and hold Bitcoin in what they’re calling a strategic asset reserve. For traditional investors, this might sound like madness. For crypto die-hards, it’s just Tuesday. But Saylor isn’t cheering from the sidelines. In fact, he’s raising a red flag. According to the man himself, sharing proof-of-reserves on-chain is a mistake because it makes your holdings too easy to trace. Instead, he insists the best way to protect your Bitcoin is to hold it yourself. Cold storage, baby. Not your keys, not your coins. This sets up an interesting clash of philosophies: public transparency vs. total privacy. And if you’re leaning toward the Saylor camp, there’s a project that walks the talk. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bullish by Nature, Bitcoin by Design BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is part meme, part mission, and entirely bullish. Its tagline could easily be ‘Come for the memes, stay for the Bitcoin airdrops.’ Designed to ride Bitcoin’s explosive path to $1M, it’s the first meme-powered, community-driven token that actually pays you in real Bitcoin, not promises, not points – real $BTC. Every time Bitcoin hits a major price milestone – like $150K, or $200K – $BTCBULL holders get rewarded. Better still, $BTCBULL supply gets burned at each milestone like $125K, $175K, and $225K, making your tokens scarcer and more valuable. No staking, no mining, just hold and earn. Here’s the kicker: airdrops only go to holders who bought $BTCBULL via Best Wallet and keep them there. If you’re not using Best Wallet, no airdrops. Period. But with Best Wallet’s multi-chain integration, you don’t need to mess with BRC-20 tokens or complicated Bitcoin wallets. You buy on ETH, hold in Best Wallet, and the Bitcoin rewards show up. It’s crypto, simplified – and Saylor would be proud. BTC Bull Token has already raised over $6.4M in its presale, showing that the market is hungry for a meme coin that actually delivers. In a space full of bark, this bull has horns. Why BTC Bull Token Might Be the Smartest Move Right Now At just $0.002535 per token, $BTCBULL is dirt cheap – but price predictions say it won’t stay that way. In our BTC Bull Price Prediction , we estimate the token could hit $0.0302 to $0.06467 by the end of 2025. That’s a +1,090% to +2,453% increase from today’s price. Even the low-end 2026 prediction of $0.0125 still gives early buyers a potential +393% gain. Let’s say you grab $1Kworth of $BTCBULL today and get around 394,400 tokens. With a 10% APY, you’d grow that stash to about 433,840 tokens in one year. At the current price, that’s $1,1K. But if $BTCBULL hits $0.0302 in 2025? That’s $13,100. At the higher forecast of $0.06467, you’d be sitting on $28,060. And you didn’t even lift a finger – you just held your tokens in Best Wallet and let Bitcoin do the heavy lifting. This isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a smarter, simpler way to ride the bull run – and it could be the most profitable crypto decision you make this cycle. Saylor Says Self-Custody, Trump Bets on Bitcoin – BTC Bull Token Delivers Both When Michael Saylor says ‘ hold your own crypto ,’ he’s not just tossing out a slogan – he’s laying down a strategy. And as President Trump’s media empire puts $2.5B behind Bitcoin, the signal is clear: this bull market is heating up fast. $BTCBULL sits at the crossroads of Saylor’s self-custody mantra and Trump’s Bitcoin bet – delivering real $BTC rewards, meme-powered hype, and milestone-driven value. If there’s one new crypto that could explode next, this is it. But don’t forget that crypto investing carries risk.

The discussions, which have been ongoing for several years, were confirmed by Schwab in an interview with the Financial Times . He said he visited Lagarde in Frankfurt in early April to discuss the WEF leadership transition. The plan, according to Schwab, involved him remaining chair until she was ready to assume the role, ideally no later than early 2027. Living arrangements prepared for Lagarde in Switzerland Klaus Schwab told FT that logistical arrangements had already been made for Lagarde to take on her new position at the WEF. An apartment at Villa Mundi, a WEF-owned property overlooking Lake Geneva, had reportedly been reserved for her. He explained that this was to give Lagarde a working space as she picked up a greater responsibility within the Geneva-based organization. In April, accusations from a whistleblower claimed that Schwab and his family had privately used parts of the Villa Mundi complex. The former WEF chairman denied the claim and insisted that the apartment in question was intended for Lagarde, not himself. ECB responds to Lagarde’s rumored exit Speaking on the news about her exit, an ECB representative said Lagarde “has always been fully committed to deliver on her mission and is determined to complete her term,” insinuating that she could sit on the central bank seat until the last day of her tenure. Two individuals familiar with the discussions said there was a mutual understanding between Lagarde and Schwab on a timeline. According to one of them, Lagarde agreed to assume the WEF position only if she could first succeed in reducing inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. Still, the same source noted that Lagarde was “hesitant” during the talks about Schwab wanting her to depart the ECB early. Should Lagarde step down before her term concludes, she would become only the second ECB president to exit prematurely, following Wim Duisenberg, who resigned in 2003 after being accused of fraud, leading to the collapse of French bank Crédit Lyonnais. Schwab exits WEF Schwab officially stepped down as chair of the WEF board in May against the backdrop of several misconduct allegations made by an anonymous whistleblower. He was originally expected to leave in January 2027, but was pushed out earlier than planned. The 87-year-old German engineer had been cleared of separate allegations just weeks prior, but the latest claims suggested that he and his family received inappropriate financial benefits from the Forum, accusations he strongly denies. “ My fear is that if this continues and hangs over the organisation without a solution, Christine Lagarde will not take up the position as chair, ” he said in the FT interview. “ I don’t want to lose her. I want to make sure what has been built here is not destroyed .” Lagarde’s ECB tenure could end in inflation crisis Lagarde has guided the central bank through the global economic fallout of COVID-19, followed by an inflation surge driven by pandemic-related supply shocks and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Under her watch, the ECB implemented several interest rate hikes to curb price growth. Inflation in the euro area has since slowed, with the latest data showing a year-on-year increase of 2.2%, close to the ECB’s target. Though near-term inflation expectations among consumers ticked slightly higher to 3.1% this month, longer-term projections are more stable. ECB staff see inflation aligning with the bank’s 2% goal sometime next year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Amidst the uncertainty, Telegram-based Toncoin seems ready to lead the next leg up. TON appears on the brink of a massive breakout on its daily chart, and the latest optimistic news could fuel the anticipated rally. Notably, the messaging app is reportedly preparing to raise $1.5 billion via a 5-year bond sale. Wu Blockchain @WuBlockchain · Follow Telegram plans to issue $1.5B in five-year bonds at 9% interest to repay 2021 debt. Investors include BlackRock, Mubadala, and newcomer Citadel. Bonds can convert to equity at a discount if Telegram goes public. wsj.com/finance/telegr… 12:30 PM · May 28, 2025 40 Reply Copy link Read 20 replies Wall Street Journal confirmed that leading giants, including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, will participate in the deal. The massive institutional support confirms unwavering investor confidence in Telegram despite the legal woes facing its founder, Pavel Durov . These updates come as Toncoin braces for a massive breakout from a symmetrical triangle setup. The altcoin looks to overcome the hurdle at $3.60 to target $4.14, beyond which bulls will aim for $5.13 – a 68% increase from TON’s market price of $3.05. Telegram’s $1.5B bond issuance attracts top giants Telegram is a leading messaging app with close to 1 billion international users. It has pivoted into crypto over the past few years. Durov even endorsed one of the controversial play-to-earn games, Hamster Kombat. Now, the platform plans a 5-year bond issuance to raise $1.5 billion. The deal has grabbed attention as it has attracted top-tier financial backers, including BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel. Meanwhile, the offering includes a 9% yield while allowing investors to convert debts into equity at discounts upon Telegram IPO success. While Telegram may not go public soon, the latest clause signals long-term goals for corporate expansion. The messaging platform will use proceeds from the bond issuance to refinance its debt, especially as bonds issued in 2021 mature in March 2026. The firm previously used cash to buy back around $400M of those bonds, and the new round will help it clear the remaining debts. Moreover, the fundraising comes as Telegram founder Pavel Durov deals with preliminary charges. French authorities allege his failure to cooperate during investigations into illegal content on the messaging platform, including pornography. While Duron remains free on bail, French authorities prohibit him from leaving the country without consent. TON rides on ecosystem momentum The Open Network native token trades at $3.05 after a swift 2% jump, according to Coinmarketcap . The increasing daily trading volume signals revived trader interest in Toncoin, possibly as optimistic ecosystem developments prevail. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a symmetrical triangle formation of TON’s price chart, signaling imminent breakouts. Source – Ali on X Overpowering the $3.40 – $3.60 range could catalyze bullish continuation, with $4.14 as the initial target. Extended upsides amid promising broad market sentiment could stretch Toncoin’s uptrends to Fibonacci 0.786 ($5.13). That would mean a 68% increase from TON’s current price of $3.05. However, stability above $3.0 remains crucial for the upsurge. A breakdown below $2.29 foothold could drive the alt to $2.60 and the March low of $2.28.

These disclosures, revealed in a recent ethics filing, have raised questions about how his background might influence the future of crypto regulation in the US. As the Senate prepares to vote on his confirmation, many are wondering how Quintenz’s ties to the crypto world will impact the CFTC’s direction under Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Deep Crypto Roots: A Close Link to the Industry Brian Quintenz previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and now leads crypto policy globally at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). He holds stakes in three a16z investment funds: CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund, giving him direct involvement in the crypto market. He’s also a board member of Kalshi, a decentralized prediction market platform that recently resolved a legal dispute with the CFTC over election betting. Additionally, Quintenz owns stock and unvested options in Kalshi and Next Level Derivatives, a financial services and lending brokerage firm. These interests overlap closely with two of the CFTC’s main regulatory focus areas: crypto assets and prediction markets. Addressing Conflicts of Interest To handle concerns about potential conflicts, Quintenz sent a letter on May 21 to John Einstman, the CFTC’s Ethics Official. In it, he pledged to resign from Andreessen Horowitz if confirmed as chair, sell off conflicting assets within 90 days, and recuse himself from any matters involving a16z for two years and Kalshi for one year. He will give up unvested stock options but will keep unpaid trustee roles in two family trusts. Some observers question whether this fully resolves all conflict concerns. CFTC in Transition Quintenz’s nomination comes at a turbulent time for the CFTC. Commissioners Kristin Johnson, Summer Mersinger, and Christy Goldsmith Romero have all announced plans to step down by mid-2025. Romero has called the prospect of four open commissioner seats “not a great situation.” With Trump’s administration pushing a crypto-friendly approach, these changes could reshape the CFTC’s regulatory path – and Quintenz’s leadership will be a key factor in that shift. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? Quintenz’s appointment suggests a possible move toward friendlier crypto regulations at the CFTC, but his deep financial ties to crypto firms raise questions about impartiality and regulatory capture. His commitment to divest and recuse is important, but the crypto community and lawmakers will be watching closely to see how these promises play out in practice.

The bonds are worth a combined value of $50 million. According to the company’s recent announcement , the Japanese investment firm has decided to issue the 16th series of ordinary bonds to the venture capital firm EVO FUND. With a combined total value of $50 million, this is the largest ordinary bond issuance made by the Tokyo-based company so far. Following the same pattern as previous bond issuances, the company declared that it would use the funds to purchase more Bitcoin ( BTC ). As of May 19, the investment firm holds 7,800 BTC which brings the company’s total Bitcoin investments to $846.9 million based on current market prices. Metaplanet chief executive Simon Gerovich had declared that the company aims to amass 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. After its latest purchase of 1,004 BTC on May 19, Metaplanet has reached 78% of that target, making it one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in Asia.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April. In May, TRX is trading near $0.24.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-28 11:45:00

K33 cites rising competition from over 70 firms adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Strategy still leads the pack with 580,250 BTC, worth over $63 billion. Strategy, the Bitcoin-focused firm formerly known as MicroStrategy, appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a new report from K33 Research . The company, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, remains the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, but its recent purchase cadence has cooled compared to the frenzied buying seen last November. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33: MSTR Premium Shrinks as Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million. MSTR shares, once trading at a hefty premium to the company’s net Bitcoin asset value, have seen that margin shrink. Last week, the premium fell from 185% to 163%, marking lows not seen since early April. According to Lunde, such compression pressures Strategy to dial back aggressive ATM offerings, lest dilution undermine investor confidence. Meanwhile, more than 70 companies have now adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, with firms like Twenty One, Nakamoto, Metaplanet, and Trump Media joining the ranks. Trump Media alone launched its treasury push with a $2.5 billion private placement backed by roughly 50 institutions. As the field widens, Lunde suggests traders are spreading bets beyond MSTR, diminishing some of its dominance in equity-based Bitcoin exposure. PRESS RELEASE: K33 secures financing of SEK 60 million to buy bitcoin and launch its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. Read the press release here: https://t.co/zRPFCWag5P pic.twitter.com/qAha0lpKnt — K33 (@K33HQ) May 28, 2025 Despite this, Strategy’s stash now totals 580,250 BTC, valued at $63.3 billion—accounting for over 2.75% of Bitcoin’s capped 21 million supply. With BTC trading near record highs, demand for Bitcoin treasury firms remains strong. Still, Lunde cautions that most new entrants are niche players, unlikely to disrupt bitcoin’s broader momentum. “Signs of euphoria are still subdued in spot and derivatives markets,” he said. “Aside from MSTR, most treasury stocks reflect limited segments of the BTC ecosystem.” Strategy Could Become Top Publicly Traded Company in World Meanwhile, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $111,000, gives it a unique edge. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” he said.

On May 23, 21Shares filed the19b-4 form to list the 21Shares Sui ( SUI ) spot ETF on Nasdaq , officially kicking off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s review process. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody and BitGo will serve as custodians for the fund. 21Shares submitted its initial S-1 registration statement to the SEC on April 30. Both filings are required for the ETF to launch—S-1 registers the fund itself, while 19b-4 seeks approval to list it on the exchange. The SEC must issue a decision on the application by Jan.18 next year, though it can delay the process multiple times within a 240-day window. 21Shares already offers a 21Shares Sui Staking ETP (ASUI) in Europe, trading on the Euronext Paris and Amsterdam exchanges. The ETP offers a 1.52% staking yield and is currently listed with over $168 million in assets under management.

This 19b-4 filing positions 21Shares alongside Canary Capital, which is also seeking approval for a spot Sui ETF. Canary Capital registered a Sui trust in Delaware on March 7 and submitted its S-1 filing shortly after, followed by a 19b-4 filing through Cboe BZX on April 8 to list the Canary Sui ETF. If approved, these filings would bring multiple Sui ETFs to the U.S. market for the first time. Each proposal is now under separate SEC review, with timelines subject to extensions under the agency’s 240-day window. Despite the news, SUI price dropped nearly 8% on May 23, the day of the filing, and continued to retrace in the following days, hitting a local low of $3.40 on May 25. It’s now attempting a recovery, currently trading at $3.70, with the price hovering at the EMA 20, which is acting as dynamic resistance.

Daan Struyven, Goldman’s co-head of global commodities research, outlined the prediction in a new discussion with the energy-focused strategy firm Veriten. Gold is currently priced at $3,310.74 per troy ounce. Struyven notes that gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) have certain similarities that are attractive to investors in the current environment. “Supply is very limited. The vast majority of the available gold supply has already been mined, and Bitcoin supply, by design, is limited, and I think this limited supply gives some confidence to investors who are worried about runaway inflation which may be caused by a potentially aggressive increase in money supply.” Bitcoin has booked higher returns than gold over the past few years, but is also more volatile and sensitive to drawdowns, Struyven explains. The top crypto asset is more positively correlated with tech equities. Because of that correlation, the Goldman Sachs analyst argues that gold is more effective as a safe-haven asset than BTC in terms of hedging against equity downside. “Both Bitcoin and equities tend to do well when risk sentiment is positive.” BTC is trading at $109,078 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 late last week. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2.5% in the past week and 16% in the past month. ?

As of now, ETH is trading near $2,641 and has already tried three times this month to break past $2,700, but each time it’s fallen back. Ethereum In a Fragile State A new report from Glassnode shows why this situation is so tricky. Nearly 38% of Ethereum’s total value, about $123 billion worth, is sitting just a little above what people paid for it. Thus data suggests that a small price drop could easily push this group into losses, and when that happens, panic selling might follow. The largest share of #ETH market cap – $123B – sits just 0–20% above cost basis. That cohort swelled from $2.3K to $2.5K, meaning even a modest price drop could flip a large chunk of supply into loss. Despite recent gains, $ETH remains in a fragile position. pic.twitter.com/5Ay5Jx5Qv5 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 Meanwhile, Glassnode calls ETH’s current position “fragile,” and for good reason. Investors who are barely in profit are usually the first to sell when fear kicks in. On top of that, data shows that more ETH is being moved to exchanges. When people send coins to exchanges, it often means they’re getting ready to sell. It’s the first big spike of the month, and it’s making some investors even more nervous. Whales Are Buying, But Is It Enough? Despite these challenges, there’s still a glimmer of hope. Ethereum whales holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have been busy scooping up more coins lately. In the last few weeks, they’ve added over 1 million ETH, worth around $2.7 billion. This suggests some investors are still confident in Ethereum’s long-term future. ETH Facing Heavy Resistance Even with whale support, Ethereum is struggling to push higher. The price has failed to break above $2,700 multiple times this month. One of the big reasons is the massive supply of ETH, about 1.67 million coins were bought between $2,635 and $2,712. For now, Ethereum’s price is hovering around $2,648 . If the price manages to hold above $2,496, it might be able to build up enough strength for another push higher.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 11:45:53

The price of Toncoin ( TON ) soared by more than 6% on Wednesday as reports emerged that asset management giant BlackRock is considering joining Telegram ‘s $1.5 billion bond offering. Telegram is set to price the five-year bond at 9% yield, the Wall Street Journal has learned , citing people familiar with the matter, with proceeds going toward buying back older debt. The messaging app has already locked in support from big players like Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, and now market chatter suggests BlackRock — already a Telegram bondholder — could deepen its involvement.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently reached record highs of over $ 110,000. According to CoinDesk data, the cryptocurrency has gained over 16% this year, drawing strength from the macroeconomic factors and persistent inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, ether has dropped 20% this year despite its parent blockchain, Ethereum, maintaining its pole position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization markets. The performance gap, however, may be closed in the near term as the following indicator shows a growing bullish bias for ether. Options indicate bullish sentiment for ether Options listed on Deribit show a stronger bullish positioning for ether relative to bitcoin. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market, while a put option provides protection against price drops. As of writing, both BTC and ETH's 25-delta risk reversals, a measure of sentiment derived by examining the difference in implied volatility (demand) between calls and puts, were positive, reflecting a bias towards call options. However, ETH risk reversals were more expensive than BTC. In other words, traders were relatively more bullish on ether compared to bitcoin. CME futures open interest The notional open interest in CME bitcoin futures, which represents the dollar value of the number of active contracts, has risen by roughly 70% to over $17 billion since the early April crash, according to data source Velo. The growth, however, has stalled above $17 billion over the past seven days. The CME is considered a proxy for institutional activity. Meanwhile, ether's open interest has jumped 186% to $3.15 billion since the early April crash. The growth has accelerated over the past two weeks. The diverging trends show institutions are increasingly leaning toward ether. Futures premiums and perpetual funding rates The bias for ETH is also evident from the relative richness of premiums in ether futures. As of the time of writing, one-month Ether futures boasted an annualized premium of 10.5%, the highest since January, according to Velo. Meanwhile, bitcoin futures premium was 8.74%. Elevated premiums indicate optimism and strong buying interest, often signaling a bullish trend. Therefore, the relative richness of ether futures premium suggests traders are more bullish on ETH compared to BTC. After all, ether is still 84% short of record highs reached during the 2021 bull run. There is also a possibility that the BTC's basis may have been held lower by cash and carry arbitrage (non-directional) traders. A similar divergence is observed on offshore exchanges, where annualized funding rates, representing the cost of holding long positions in ETH perpetual futures, has neared the 8% mark. Meanwhile, BTC's funding rates hold below 5%.",Markets|Ether|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-28 11:47:44

As volatility cools following the vertical spike, traders are assessing whether Huma Finance can stabilize near support or face further pressure amid a broader crypto pullback. Despite earlier euphoria, recent breakdowns suggest the move may have been more speculative than sustained, and technical indicators are beginning to reflect that sentiment shift. The question now dominating traders’ minds is: Why is the Huma Finance price going down today, and what are the chances of recovery from current levels? What’s Happening With HUMA’s Price? HUMA price forecast (Source: TradingView) After a near-vertical rally toward $0.12, Huma Finance price action has reversed sharply. The 30-minute chart shows multiple failed breakout attempts above the $0.058–$0.060 band, each followed by a swift selloff.

KernelDAO, a protocol focused on restaking opportunities, has announced a notable Crypto partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This collaboration introduces the USD1 stablecoin as a new asset available for restaking within the KernelDAO ecosystem. Understanding the KernelDAO and WLFI Collaboration The core of this announcement, shared via KernelDAO’s official communication channels, centers on expanding the types of assets users can leverage for yield generation through restaking. By integrating USD1, a stablecoin associated with the WLFI project, KernelDAO aims to offer its users more diverse options for earning passive income. Let’s break down the key players involved: KernelDAO (KERNEL): Positioned as a prominent BNB restaking protocol, KernelDAO allows users to stake various assets to secure multiple networks or protocols simultaneously, earning multiple layers of rewards. Its focus is primarily within the BNB Chain ecosystem. World Liberty Financial (WLFI): This project operates within the DeFi landscape and is notable for its reported links to the Trump family. WLFI is the issuer behind the USD1 stablecoin. USD1: A stablecoin intended to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the US Dollar. Stablecoins are crucial in DeFi for providing stability amidst volatile crypto markets. The partnership means that holders of the USD1 stablecoin can now deposit their USD1 into KernelDAO’s platform to participate in restaking activities, potentially earning yields that were previously unavailable to them. Why is Adding USD1 Restaking Important? The inclusion of USD1 as a restakeable asset is more than just adding another token. It signifies several potential benefits and strategic moves within the BNB Chain DeFi space: Expanded Yield Opportunities: For holders of USD1, this partnership creates a new avenue to earn yield on an asset typically used for stability or trading. Restaking can often provide more attractive yields compared to traditional single-asset staking or lending. Increased Utility for USD1: Making USD1 restakeable enhances its utility within the broader DeFi ecosystem, potentially increasing its adoption and demand beyond simple holding or trading. Growth for KernelDAO: By supporting USD1, KernelDAO broadens its user base to include WLFI participants and USD1 holders. This can lead to increased total value locked (TVL) on the platform and strengthen KernelDAO’s position as a leading BNB restaking protocol. Strengthening the BNB Chain Ecosystem: Cross-protocol collaborations like this foster innovation and interconnectedness within the BNB Chain, making the ecosystem more robust and attractive to users and developers. Exploring the Mechanics of USD1 Restaking on KernelDAO For users interested in participating, the process typically involves depositing USD1 tokens into specific restaking vaults or pools provided by KernelDAO. These deposited assets are then utilized by KernelDAO to secure other protocols or generate yield through various strategies, with the rewards being distributed back to the stakers. While specific details on the yield mechanisms and associated risks would reside within KernelDAO’s documentation, the general principle of restaking applies: users gain exposure to multiple reward streams by staking a single asset. It’s crucial for potential participants to understand the specific risks associated with restaking, including smart contract risks, slashing risks (though less common with stablecoins used for securing other protocols), and the risks associated with the underlying protocols being secured. What Does the WLFI Link Mean for the Partnership? The association of WLFI with the Trump family has garnered attention. In the context of this partnership, it primarily highlights the origin and backing of the USD1 stablecoin. While the political link is notable, the functional aspect of the partnership for DeFi users lies in the technical integration that allows USD1 to be used for restaking on KernelDAO. Users should focus on the technical stability of USD1 and the security and performance of the KernelDAO protocol when evaluating the opportunity. How Can You Start with USD1 Restaking? If you hold USD1 and wish to explore restaking on KernelDAO, here are the general steps you would likely follow: Acquire USD1 tokens if you don’t already hold them. Visit the official KernelDAO platform. Connect your compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to the platform. Navigate to the restaking section and locate the pool or vault designated for USD1. Approve the KernelDAO contract to interact with your USD1 tokens. Deposit the desired amount of USD1 into the restaking pool. Monitor your staked position and earned rewards via the KernelDAO dashboard. Always ensure you are interacting with the official KernelDAO website and understand the terms and conditions of the restaking agreement. Looking Ahead: The Future of KernelDAO and WLFI This KernelDAO and WLFI collaboration could be a stepping stone for further integrations. As the restaking narrative gains momentum in the broader crypto market, particularly on chains like BNB Chain, partnerships that add diverse assets like stablecoins are key to attracting a wider audience. The success of USD1 restaking on KernelDAO will likely influence future decisions regarding supported assets and partnership strategies for both protocols. The addition of USD1 to the KernelDAO platform marks a concrete step in expanding the restaking landscape on BNB Chain. This Crypto partnership between KernelDAO and WLFI provides USD1 holders with new potential yield opportunities and strengthens KernelDAO’s offering as a versatile BNB restaking hub. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, such collaborations play a vital role in creating more interconnected and rewarding experiences for users.

SEC’s review of WisdomTree’s XRP ETF may spark investor interest as approval odds jump to 84% on Polymarket. XRP price is forming a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong bullish momentum following an upward breakout. Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher? XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40 From a technical perspective, XRP ( XRP ) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern. In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls seeing the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up. However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80. Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90. “$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance. Above that resistance, we will eventually get to a new all-time high.” XRP/USD daily chart.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially started reviewing the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application by the WisdomTree XRP Trust, which may provide investors with exposure to XRP. 🔥 NEW: The SEC is officially reviewing WisdomTree’s proposed spot $XRP ETF, and is now accepting public comments. pic.twitter.com/3B4UwJ6n4s — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 28, 2025 The notice published by the SEC on May 27 initiates a 21-day public comment period and a 240-day review timeline, reflecting a structured evaluation of investor protection and market manipulation risks. The product would track the price of XRP through the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate, giving investors indirect exposure without needing to hold the asset directly. The betting odds for an XRP ETF approval by Dec. 31 now stand at 84% on Polymarket . Over the past month, the probability of approval has swung by 21% in favor of the YES side, from around 63% on April 22. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket. Source: Polymarket Bloomberg senior ETF analysts predicted an 85% chance of spot XRP ETF approval after the change in leadership at the SEC. Approval of these funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially driving prices toward $3-$8. Some analysts predict XRP price to go as high as $50 if major players like BlackRock step in. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Despite the dip, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes XRP may be setting up for a breakout, citing a potential bull flag pattern. But how realistic is this rally—and what should investors really expect? XRP Price Movement: A Quick Recap At the start of May, XRP stood at $2.1920. After a minor 3.88% correction early in the month, XRP surged 21.47% to a monthly high of $2.63 on May 12. However, by May 17, XRP had lost nearly 9% from that peak, dragged down by mounting sell pressure. As of writing, XRP is trading at $2.3024, down 13.28% from its monthly high. What Is a Bull Flag—and Why Does It Matter? According to EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP’s chart now shows a classic bull flag pattern. This technical pattern typically appears after a strong upward movement and signals a possible continuation of the rally. “We’re seeing consolidation within a parallel range—a textbook flag structure,” he explained in a post on X. While patterns aren’t guarantees, they often inform short- to mid-term price targets when confirmed with volume and market momentum. XRP Price Targets: Three Methods, One Big Range To calculate the potential upside, the analyst applied three methods: 1. Logarithmic Chart Projection Log charts show percentage change, not just price movement. Using this method, XRP could reach $18 . 2. Non-Logarithmic Chart Projection Using a standard linear scale (common in traditional stock charts), the target is more conservative: $5.50 . 3. Averaged Midpoint Target Taking the average of both: a neutral estimate of $11.75 . Due to market volatility and thin liquidity, the analyst cautions that targets may overshoot or undershoot by 15–20%. Adjusted Targets: Base Target +15% +20% $18.00 $20.70 $21.60 $11.75 $13.51 $14.10 $5.50 $6.33 $6.60 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘XRP is An American Coin Cleared by SEC’, Says Analyst , Community Sentiment and What to Watch Next EGRAG encouraged the XRP community to stay focused and patient, suggesting he sees conviction in the technical setup. However, other experts urge caution. Analysts like Benjamin Cowen have previously warned that many altcoins continue to lose ground to Bitcoin in ALT/BTC pairs. Key indicators to watch include: XRP breaking out above the flag resistance with strong volume Bitcoin dominance staying flat or declining Broader altcoin recovery, especially from coins like ADA, DOGE, and SOL Should You Buy XRP Now? While the bull flag pattern is promising, investors should weigh risk factors: Market liquidity is still low External events like the upcoming FOMC meeting may introduce volatility Past breakouts have sometimes failed when retail interest didn’t follow through If you’re bullish on XRP, now may be a good time to watch closely rather than rush in.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/financial-giant-grayscale-prepares-to-enter-the-ai-focused-crypto-sector-here-are-the-details/,"Grayscale Research has announced the creation of a new AI Crypto Sector, marking a major update to digital asset classification as decentralized AI begins to gain traction in the crypto ecosystem. Grayscale Launches New AI Crypto Segment Amid Growing Interest in Decentralized AI The move reflects the rapid rise of blockchain-based AI projects and the growing demand for diversified exposure in this emerging market. The AI Crypto Sector will be the sixth category in Grayscale’s proprietary Crypto Sectors framework, which groups digital assets by their primary use case, much like the GICS system does for public equities. The new sector will include 20 crypto tokens with a total market value of $21 billion, up from just $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The largest component of the sector by market value is Bittensor (TAO), a decentralized AI development platform. “AI may be the most important technology of the 21st century. However, centralized control over its development has raised critical questions about access, transparency, and trust,” Grayscale wrote in its announcement. While AI has traditionally been dominated by large tech companies, the emergence of blockchain infrastructure now offers a path toward open and decentralized AI development. Projects in this space aim to democratize access to data, computing power, and model ownership by leveraging public blockchains, creating transparent, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible ecosystems. Grayscale's new sector includes three sub-sectors: AI Platforms: Basic blockchain networks designed to build and host AI applications. Examples include Bittensor and Near, the latter of which brands itself as “the blockchain for AI.” AI Tools and Resources: AI model development frameworks such as Grass (data collection) and Akash (decentralized computing marketplace). AI Applications and Agents: Applications that interface directly with users or solve specific AI-related problems. These include Virtuals, ElizaOS, and Story Protocol, which addresses the impact of generative AI on intellectual property. *This is not investment advice.

A promising new player focused on streamlining Crypto Payments , named Velocity, has just announced a significant milestone: the successful closure of a $10 million pre-seed funding round. This substantial investment, spearheaded by Activant Capital, signals strong confidence in Velocity’s vision to bridge the gap between the burgeoning crypto economy and the established banking system. In an era where digital assets are becoming increasingly mainstream, the need for robust, integrated, and user-friendly Crypto Payment Solutions is more critical than ever. Velocity aims to tackle this challenge head-on by developing a platform designed to seamlessly integrate crypto wallets and custody services directly into the existing banking infrastructure. Their ambitious goal is not just to offer another payment option but to fundamentally upgrade how financial transactions involving digital assets are handled, making them as simple and secure as traditional payments. Why This $10M Pre-Seed Fintech Funding Round Matters A $10 million pre-seed round is remarkably large for this early stage of a company’s development. This indicates a high level of investor confidence, not just in Velocity’s team and technology but also in the perceived market demand for their specific approach to Crypto Payment Solutions . Here’s why this funding is significant: Validation of Vision: Securing such a large amount at the pre-seed stage validates Velocity’s core idea – that integrating crypto directly into banking is a necessary and valuable step for the future of finance. Accelerated Development: The capital infusion allows Velocity to rapidly build out its platform, bringing its integrated crypto wallet and custody services closer to reality much faster than a smaller funding round would permit. Talent Acquisition: A key use of the funds is expanding the workforce. Building a strong team of engineers, product developers, and business strategists is crucial for executing on their complex integration goals. Market Positioning: This funding immediately positions Velocity as a significant player in the competitive landscape of companies building infrastructure for Web3 Payments and crypto-friendly financial services. Understanding the Need for Integrated Crypto Payment Solutions Current methods for using crypto in daily transactions or for businesses accepting crypto often involve multiple steps, different platforms, and potential friction. Users might have funds in a Crypto Wallet that are difficult to spend directly with traditional merchants or integrate into their existing financial workflows. Businesses face challenges with volatility, transaction speed, fees, and regulatory compliance when accepting crypto payments. Velocity’s approach of integrating Crypto Wallets and custody services directly into banking aims to solve these problems. Imagine being able to view your crypto holdings alongside your traditional bank accounts, or a business being able to accept crypto payments that settle directly into their bank account in their preferred currency, all managed within their existing banking interface. This level of integration could: Increase ease of use for consumers and businesses. Reduce friction and complexity in transactions. Potentially lower transaction costs compared to some traditional methods or current crypto off-ramps. Improve security and trust through regulated banking environments (where applicable). Facilitate broader adoption of Web3 Payments by making them more accessible. Velocity’s Platform: Bridging Traditional Finance and Web3 Payments At the heart of Velocity’s strategy is the creation of a platform that acts as a bridge. It’s not just about enabling transactions; it’s about creating a cohesive financial experience. By integrating Crypto Wallets and custody services, they are essentially giving banks and financial institutions the tools they need to offer crypto services directly to their customers. This integration involves complex technical and regulatory challenges. Key aspects likely include: API Integrations: Building robust APIs that allow banks’ existing systems to communicate with crypto infrastructure. Custody Solutions: Providing secure and compliant ways for institutions to hold digital assets on behalf of their clients. Compliance Tools: Incorporating KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures that meet banking standards for crypto transactions. Transaction Processing: Developing efficient systems for processing Crypto Payments and potentially enabling instant settlements or conversions. This level of integration is crucial for moving Web3 Payments beyond early adopters and into the mainstream financial system. The Broader Context: Fintech Funding and the Future of Finance Velocity’s successful funding round occurs within a dynamic landscape of Fintech Funding . While the overall funding environment has seen fluctuations, investment in companies building essential infrastructure for the future of finance, particularly those bridging traditional systems with digital assets, remains strong. Investors are looking for solutions that solve real-world problems and have the potential for wide adoption. The focus on integrating Crypto Wallets and custody services directly into banking reflects a growing understanding that mass adoption of crypto requires making it accessible and manageable within familiar financial interfaces. This trend is likely to continue, driving further innovation and investment in the space of Crypto Payment Solutions . What’s Next for Velocity? With the $10 million in hand, Velocity’s immediate priorities include: Expanding their engineering and product teams. Accelerating the development and testing of their core integration platform. Building partnerships with banks and financial institutions interested in offering integrated crypto services. Potentially piloting their solution with early partners. Their success will depend on their ability to navigate complex technical challenges, build trust with traditional financial institutions, and adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding Crypto Payments and digital assets. Challenges and Opportunities in the Crypto Payment Solutions Space While the opportunity is vast, Velocity and similar companies face significant hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The rules governing crypto and its integration with traditional finance are still developing globally. Security Risks: Integrating systems requires robust security measures to protect against hacks and fraud. Adoption by Institutions: Banks can be slow to adopt new technologies, especially those involving novel asset classes like crypto. Competition: The space for Web3 Payments and crypto infrastructure is becoming increasingly crowded. However, the demand for better Crypto Payment Solutions is undeniable. As more individuals and businesses hold digital assets and look for ways to use them seamlessly, the need for platforms like Velocity’s will only grow. Their focus on deep integration with existing banking infrastructure could be a key differentiator. Conclusion: A Step Towards Seamless Crypto Payments Velocity’s impressive $10 million pre-seed funding round is more than just a financial headline; it’s a strong indicator of the market’s belief in the future of integrated Crypto Payments . By focusing on bringing Crypto Wallets and custody services directly into the banking fold, Velocity is taking a crucial step towards making digital assets a more accessible and functional part of the global financial system. This funding will empower them to accelerate their mission, potentially paving the way for a future where managing and spending crypto is as simple as using your debit card today.

The company has been shifting employees into Starship work for months. SpaceX is also pouring funds into its Starship launch and test center in Boca Chica, Texas, and has similar expansion plans for Florida. Starship, which stands about 400 feet tall when stacked for flight, is still experimental, yet it now sits at the center of SpaceX’s roadmap. SpaceX now faces immediate pressure to prove the rocket can do what Elon Musk and other leaders have promised. The company is already running late on a version of Starship that National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials want to use for a moon landing now scheduled for 2027. Starship has been struggling with recent failures This year, Starship experienced two back-to-back test failures. Both flights ended in explosions, sending debris toward the Atlantic and Caribbean, forcing temporary airline detours. SpaceX plans another test on Tuesday evening. In a statement on Friday, it said engineers had “conducted extensive testing” to understand the last failure and had made changes for the next attempt, adding that progress with Starship “won’t always come in leaps.” “It’s definitely been a rough start of the year for Starship,” Shana Diez, one of SpaceX’s engineering vice presidents, wrote on X after the second explosion. It’s definitely been a rough start of the year for Starship. Really causes me to reflect on how many tens of thousands (or more) things have to go right in a rocket launch to result in success and how even one thing being slightly out of place or out of order results in total… — Shana Diez (@ShanaDiez) March 18, 2025 A single fault can doom a launch, she said, and when the cost and time of each attempt are added up, “the overall problem can feel quite daunting.” Some employees were recently moved to a project known inside the company as Starfall. That effort links Starship to a U.S. military plan to move heavy cargo around the planet in less than an hour. Generals and industry planners have long studied whether rockets could rush supplies to distant bases faster than any plane or ship. SpaceX said in a court filing last year that it hopes to fly a demonstration for the Air Force during which Starship would land more than 66,000 pounds of government freight and receive about $149 million to keep developing the concept. The idea is demonstrated in an animation SpaceX released in 2017. That video showed passengers boarding a Starship in New York City and landing in Shanghai 39 minutes later. Executives have rarely discussed point-to-point service since, but the cargo version remains alive under the Starfall banner. Landing SpaceX rockets on Mars remains Musk’s main goal Musk has been pushing the company to launch a spacecraft for a mission to Mars as soon as next year. Reaching that date means beating several engineering hurdles, including the need to fill Starship’s tanks while it is already in orbit. Unlike most rockets, which get loaded with fuel while on Earth, SpaceX will have to find a way to fuel up Starships while they are in orbit. Moving thousands of tons of fuel into space has never been attempted. The fluids must stay at extremely low temperatures or they boil off, and engineers must safeguard valves, pumps, and seals designed to work in zero gravity. In a recent White House budget outline, the administration aligned its priorities with NASA and proposed adding $1 billion for Mars-focused missions while trimming many other projects. At this point, it looks like both the government and SpaceX have aligned goals. Starship departs for Mars at the end of next year, carrying Optimus. If those landings go well, then human landings may start as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely. https://t.co/JRBB95sgNN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2025 Musk founded SpaceX more than twenty years ago with the stated goal of making humankind a multiplanet species. He also leads Tesla and other firms, and in March, he posted on X that he hopes to load Tesla’s humanoid robot onto a Starship heading to Mars in 2026. “Starship departs for Mars at the end of next year, carrying Optimus,” he wrote.

This open standard lets every AI-Agent in Web3 tailor its behavior based on real-time on-chain signals, much like a universal USB-C port powers any device. Today marks a significant step toward making intelligent, context-aware predictive AI a reality in crypto. A New Paradigm for AI-Agent Personalization Traditional AI agents in decentralized apps have had to rely on static data or generic heuristics. These conventional AI agents provided identical recommendations to all. Personalization was missing. Prediction MCP changes this by enabling personalization: Anticipating User Actions: Instantly analyzes wallet histories to predict what users will do next, whether it’s trading, lending, or gaming. Customizing Interactions: Enables AI-Agents to generate content, offers, and recommendations uniquely tailored to each wallet’s behavior profile. Plug-and-Play Across Chains: From Ethereum and BSC to Solana, MCP works seamlessly wherever the application lives. By standardizing the flow of contextual data, MCP slashes development overhead and lets teams focus on groundbreaking features instead of wiring together bespoke prediction pipelines. Innovation in Action Early tests with the protocol have already shown transformative results: DeFAI Platforms: Lenders can dynamically adjust interest rates based on borrower reliability scores, reducing default risk and increasing approval rates. GameFAI Worlds: In-game economies adapt to each player’s style, reward structures, difficulty levels, and even story branches shift to match their risk appetite. Personalized Trading Dashboards: Users see token recommendations and portfolio insights that reflect their unique on-chain footprint rather than generic market trends. These proof points hint at a future where every decentralized application is not just reactive, but predictive, anticipating needs and desires before users even articulate them. Why Prediction MCP May Be the Next Big Thing in Crypto AI The intersection of AI and blockchain has long promised smarter financial tools, but until now, few protocols have delivered seamless, standardized context sharing. Prediction MCP fills this gap by: Catalyzing Ecosystem Growth: As more AI-Agents adopt MCP, developers can build interoperable apps that learn from and contribute to a shared prediction layer. Amplifying ROI: Projects using MCP see lower user acquisition costs and higher engagement by reaching users with the right offers at the right moment. Driving Mainstream Adoption: By making sophisticated personalization accessible, MCP paves the way for consumer-friendly Web3 experiences that rival centralized alternatives. In short, if AI-Agents are the engine of tomorrow’s decentralized apps, Prediction MCP is the high-octane fuel that will power their trajectory.

45200997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759844,1748433651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45200997.jpeg,Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-explode-bessent-250-billion-deregulation/,"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signalled that the long-debated overhaul of banks’ supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) is imminent—a policy pivot that could reverberate through Bitcoin markets—telling television interviewers that regulators are “very close to moving” on the rule and that the adjustment could compress Treasury yields by “tens of basis points.” Rocket Fuel For Bitcoin Although the proposal must still clear the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, the direction of travel is clear: exempting, or partially exempting, US Treasuries from the SLR will let large banks recycle balance-sheet capacity into fresh purchases of government debt. The SLR, introduced after the 2008–2009 crisis, forces even risk-free assets such as Treasuries to carry a capital charge; a global systemically important bank must fund five cents of equity for every dollar of total assets, including central-bank reserves. Bessent’s plan would lift that burden for sovereign bonds, a step the industry has lobbied for since the temporary pandemic waiver expired in March 2021. Kevin Fromer, chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, calls the current leverage-based stack “outdated and at odds with financial stability and economic growth,” describing relief as necessary “to better serve US taxpayers, capital markets, consumers, businesses, and the economy.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters A Massive Week: Key Events To Watch While officials frame the move as a micro-prudential calibration, the macro-liquidity impulse is substantial. Market commentator Furkan Yildirim tells his 103,000 subscribers that US banks collectively hold about $5 trillion in Treasuries; eliminating the five-percent capital haircut would liberate roughly $250 billion of tier-one capital—fifty times the Federal Reserve’s current monthly quantitative-tightening pace of $5 billion. “This is a liquidity injection by regulatory pen stroke,” he says, adding that the step “lowers yields without the Fed printing money,” a mix that historically pushes investors further out the risk curve. The market is already trading on that expectation. Benchmark ten-year yields slid below 3.95 percent after Bessent’s remarks and after President Trump deferred a threatened 50 percent tariff on EU goods until 9 July. Yildirim argues that “every basis-point drop in the ten-year is basically a marketing campaign for Bitcoin,” because “liquidity doesn’t disappear—it just looks for a new home.” He stresses that the Treasury’s willingness to change bank-capital rules, rather than rely on the central bank, “tells you how cornered policymakers feel by deficits, debt service and political optics.” Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? Not everyone is convinced the rule change will work as intended. Critics such as Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Advisory note that banks’ appetite for duration risk has not fully recovered since the 2023 regional-bank failures; if dealers fail to absorb the incremental Treasury supply, the Federal Reserve could be forced back into the market. The Bank Policy Institute, while welcoming SLR relief, argues that it must be paired with a broader rethink of post-crisis overlays such as the GSIB surcharge and the stress-test regime to unlock balance-sheet capacity on a lasting basis. Bitcoin, however, responds reflexively to dollar-liquidity metrics. Lower Treasury yields diminish the allure of money-market funds paying north of five percent, releasing capital that has been parked in cash-equivalent vehicles since 2022. On-chain data highlighted by Yildirim show over-the-counter (OTC) desk inventories sliding to 115,000 BTC, evidence that large buyers are sourcing coins directly; when that stock is depleted, desks must restock from public exchanges, a dynamic that tightens float and historically amplifies upside moves. Ultimately the SLR reprieve is no panacea for America’s fiscal arithmetic, but it removes a near-term balance-sheet choke point and lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. As Yildirim puts it, “A deregulation that stabilises sovereign funding while nudging investors into risk assets is, almost by definition, a tailwind for Bitcoin.” In that sense the rule change functions like shadow quantitative easing, arriving at a moment when the Federal Reserve is hamstrung by sticky inflation and political constraints—one more structural catalyst for Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $108,790.

DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity TRON: Empowering Creators and Decentralizing the Internet TRON (TRX) is a digital platform aiming to revolutionize how we share and consume online content. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it was built to give full ownership rights back to digital content creators. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large share of the profits, TRON allows creators to earn more by connecting them directly with their audience. Users can reward creators without the need for middlemen, ensuring that those who make content get the rewards they deserve. TRON's technology supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, much like Ethereum, but with some unique advantages. Anyone can build apps on the TRON network, share content freely, and enjoy low transaction fees. This makes it an attractive option for developers and creators alike. In the current market, where decentralization and user empowerment are growing trends, TRX stands out by focusing on giving control back to the people. With its transparent public ledger and commitment to a free and open internet, TRON could be a strong contender among cryptocurrencies today. Litecoin: The Silver Lining in Cryptocurrency's Evolution Litecoin (LTC) is making a name for itself as a fast and user-friendly digital currency. Launched in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, it's designed to improve on Bitcoin's weaknesses. Litecoin processes transactions in just 2.5 minutes, compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes. With a larger supply of 84 million coins, it aims to make cryptocurrency more accessible. Using the Scrypt algorithm, it prevents mining centralization, keeping the network secure and decentralized. Often called ""the silver to Bitcoin's gold,"" Litecoin is geared toward everyday use and small transactions. The coin continues to innovate, introducing the MimbleWimble (MWEB) upgrade in May 2022 to enhance privacy and scalability. In a market dominated by Bitcoin, Litecoin stands out with lower fees and quicker transactions. As digital currencies gain mainstream attention, Litecoin's focus on speed and usability makes it appealing. Its commitment to improvement and user experience gives it a unique place in the current market. For those looking for alternatives to the major players, Litecoin offers a promising option in the evolving world of digital finance. Conclusion Though TRX and LTC are solid, XYZVerse's unique sports meme appeal and ambitious growth aim make it a standout in the current bull run.

Referencing the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Ripple’s involvement in international standards, the influencer stated, “75% of cross-border payments will run on ISO 20022 by 2027,” suggesting XRP is fundamentally built for this transition. He added that this transformation represents “how legacy finance gets replaced in plain sight,” by encouraging observers to reconsider XRP’s potential value against the backdrop of global flows worth over $150 trillion. THE G20 CONFIRMED IT 75% of cross-border payments will run on ISO 20022 by 2027 Ripple built for this. $XRP powers it This is how legacy finance gets replaced in plain sight You think $3 #XRP is the top?

This aligns with the timeline for achieving substantial implementation of ISO 20022 standards across global financial systems. According to the BIS report, the shift to ISO 20022 is not just a technical upgrade, but a coordinated effort to improve interoperability, speed, and transparency in cross-border payments. This transition is significant given the G20’s ambition to modernize international payments. With 75% of cross-border transactions expected to operate on ISO 20022 by 2027, the focus on data harmonisation and interoperability underscores the urgency and scale of the shift underway. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Position within the ISO 20022 Framework Ripple’s payment system is ISO 20022 compliant , and according to the document shared by X Finance Bull, it is the first distributed ledger technology (DLT) company to be included in the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Ripple states this step is aimed at helping customers meet the demands of the new interoperable payment landscape, further validating its alignment with international objectives. ISO 20022 is becoming the global standard for financial messaging, replacing legacy formats across SWIFT and other systems. SWIFT has announced plans to migrate to the new standard by November . Ripple’s integration into the ISO framework positions it to contribute directly to the development of messaging standards and ensure its XRP-powered systems work seamlessly. X Finance Bull emphasized the connection, noting that XRP was built for this. The comment reflects a broader sentiment in the XRP community that the asset is positioned for utility rather than speculation, and its integration into Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions distinguishes it.

This is the first time the company has admitted to buying any crypto since it said in March that it was planning to do so. In March, GameStop made it public that it would be raising funds via a $1.4 billion convertible notes offering. That money has now been partly used for this crypto purchase. The speculation around this started earlier this year when GameStop began hinting at exploring alternatives outside its core retail business. GameStop’s stock reacts to crypto pivot as financial concerns remain Before GameStop confirmed anything, its stock had already been moving. Rumors in February caused a surge of about 18%. The March announcement drove the price up by another 12%. On May 27, GameStop shares closed at $35 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market session the next morning. Over the last month, the stock is up around 30%, and about 10% higher for the year. However, the Bitcoin buy comes while the core retail business is shrinking. The latest quarterly report shows a 28% drop in revenue year-on-year. That kind of decline doesn’t align well with the current hype surrounding the stock. GameStop’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is sitting above 100x, which is way out of line for a retail company. The valuation gap has raised a lot of eyebrows. Only one analyst is still tracking GameStop on Barchart. That analyst currently has a “Strong Sell” rating on the stock, placing a target of $13.50. If that plays out, GameStop could drop over 60% from where it stands now.

Similarly , globally, more than 30% of first-time crypto buyers buy meme coins to learn about wallets, tokenomics, and on-chain interactions before they can progress to the other top digital currencies. Over 94% of meme coin holders invest in established assets eventually Gemini’s study also found that around 30% of new crypto users in Australia first held meme coins, followed by 28% in the UK, 23% in Singapore, 22% in Italy, and 19% in France. Still, over 94% of meme coin buyers ultimately invest in top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum , suggesting that meme coins serve as an on-ramp to the broader crypto-asset market. Analysts have suggested that long-term investment stability could generally be achieved through mature digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, while meme coins are a good gateway asset today, it’s important to pivot to more sustainable assets. DeFi commentator Ignas even commented recently, “Technically innovative launches are getting hype again…It’s not just your Degen monkey brain blindly aping into meme coins or simping for a new Celeb Coin – your analytical & research skills can be put to action again.” Meanwhile, Justin Sun, founder of Tron Blockchain and Huobi Global advisor, believes investors are drawn to meme coins because of the asset’s ability to command their attention. He argued that today’s economy revolves around attention—and memes are powerful attention magnets. He even stated, “If you get attention from everybody, you can actually control the universe.” Investors lean toward institutional ETFs for their crypto holdings In addition to the growing interest in meme coins, there has been an increase in the use of institutional infrastructure. About 39% of US crypto investors hold crypto through ETFs, up from 37% in 2024. Of the 39%, 25% hold their crypto through an exchange wallet and an ETF, while only 14% solely use an ETF. Spot crypto ETFs are an investor favorite, receiving hundreds of billions in inflows and fueling Bitcoin price surges. This May, the 11 US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a net inflow of $5.77 billion, the highest since November 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the most monthly inflows, with Bitcoin’s spot price surpassing $110000. BlackRock even increased its Bitcoin spot ETF holdings by 25%. As of March 31, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holdings were at 2,123,592 shares, worth $994 million, an increase of about 25% compared to 1,691,143 shares held as of the end of last year. The asset manager is still planning to diversify its investment into the digital asset market away from its bond-oriented portfolio. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the company’s interest in increasing its investments could help propel BTC prices further.

With warrants that could potentially take the total raise to $1.5 billion, Strive is emerging as a formidable new player in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space — one that's not just going to hold BTC, but try to beat it. Within Strive's Alpha-Generating Strategy Unlike most corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, which merely involve the buying and holding of BTC as a reserve asset, Strive CEO Matt Cole has outlined a more complex, multi-dimensional strategy. The company's strategy includes: Strive will buy firms trading below their net cash value, freeing up discounted cash to be redeployed into Bitcoin. In partnership with 117 Partners LLC, Strive is targeting Mt. Gox exchange claims with the mission to buy up to 75,000 BTC at deep discounts to spot prices. The firm will be buying the lowest tranches of structured BTC credit vehicles, contributing to yield potential. Cole discusses that such ”alpha-generating” strategies require a new paradigm of valuation, as they are designed to deliver returns above and beyond Bitcoin's performance itself — an ambition that sets Strive apart from incumbents. Who's Behind Strive? The $750 million was raised through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) round by leading institutional investors and Strive's management. The deal was priced at a 121% premium to Asset Entities' (ASST) pre-merger announcement closing price, and, noteworthy, it has no debt financing—preserving future leverage ability. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as sole placement agent and financial advisor, and legal counsel was provided by Davis Polk, DLA Piper, and Bevilacqua PLLC. Strive vs. MicroStrategy and Tesla: A New Model Emerges Company BTC Treasury Strategy BTC Holdings (approx.) Key Differentiator Strive Alpha-driven, discounted acquisitions Target: up to 75,000+ Outperformance focus and novel assets MicroStrategy Buy and hold, leverage, equity raises 568,840 Largest holder and “infinite money glitch” Tesla Buy and hold, smaller allocation ~10,500 Diversification and less aggressive While MicroStrategy (recently renamed simply ”Strategy”) has become the name most synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation—having invested over $39 billion to amass 568,840 BTC — its strategy has been largely one of leveraged beta to Bitcoin's price. Tesla, meanwhile, holds a smaller, diversified position. Strive's approach is quite different: by acquiring distressed and discounted assets, it hopes to gain exposure to Bitcoin at below market value, with the intention of beating BTC's own performance. Were it to be successful, it would place Strive near the top of corporate Bitcoin holders, alongside or even ahead of the likes of MicroStrategy and Tesla in both ambition and strategy. Expert Commentary: Market Impact and Risks Treasury management experts note that Strive's strategy is ushering in a new era of institutional crypto adoption. By integrating traditional corporate finance approaches with innovative crypto asset transactions, Strive could be setting an example for the future of treasury management. As quoted by one treasury consultant: ”Strive's willingness to purchase discounted and distressed Bitcoin holdings represents a shift from passive hodling to active yield generation. If they execute it correctly, it could redefine how digital asset reserves are managed by corporations.” However, experts also caution that these approaches are not without unique risks — legal, operational, and market. The success of buying Mt. Gox claims, for example, is dependent on regulatory approval and creditor repayment timing. In addition, while institutional demand for crypto is increasing, volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain acute concerns. Potential Market Impact Strive’s aggressive accumulation and innovative strategies could: Increase competition for discounted BTC assets, especially as more companies seek to emulate this model. Add upward pressure to Bitcoin prices if large claims are settled and converted to spot BTC. Spur further institutional adoption, as treasury teams look for ways to generate yield and hedge against fiat currency risks The bottom line Strive’s $750 million raise marks a bold new chapter in corporate Bitcoin treasury management. By seeking alpha through discounted and distressed crypto assets, the firm is not just joining the ranks of institutional BTC holders — it’s aiming to set the pace. As the market watches Strive’s next moves, the outcome could reshape both treasury management and the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-28 12:16:11

The application, filed by Cboe BZX Exchange, is under consideration by the SEC, and the assessment is being made of whether the proposed product meets the necessary standards for market integrity and investor protection. This review, detailed in Release No. 34-103124 , initiates a 240-day window for the regulator to approve or reject the filing and opens the door for public comments. The ETF would track XRP’s price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate, allowing investors to gain exposure through standard brokerage accounts and eliminating the need for private keys or self-custody solutions. This development could signal a shift to altcoins expanding beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Other spot XRP ETF application Several other firms are also pursuing spot XRP ETFs, though most remain in the early stages. Companies like 21Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Franklin Templeton have yet to advance past initial filings or submit the required 19b-4 forms. Franklin Templeton’s application, also filed via Cboe BZX, has seen one of the recent developments. As reported by Finbold, the SEC has extended its decision deadline to June 17, 2025, to allow more time for evaluation under Section 19(b)(2). Meanwhile, betting markets reflect growing confidence in a 2025 approval. According to Polymarket , there’s an 83% probability the U.S. will greenlight an XRP ETF by year’s end.

However, the Brazilian fund has had little effect on XRP’s price due to the limited size of the local financial market.

With this acquisition, GameStop joins the ranks of industry leaders like Strategy, Tesla, and Block, marking a significant shift in its corporate strategy. The announcement comes at a time when Bitcoin continues to assert itself as digital gold, drawing increasing interest from institutions, corporations, and investors alike. For GameStop — once the iconic face of the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy — this leap into Bitcoin marks not just a financial investment but a clear statement about its ambitions for the future. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 From Meme Stock Legend to Bitcoin Holder GameStop’s adoption of Bitcoin marks a significant shift in its corporate trajectory. Once seen as a struggling brick-and-mortar retailer, GameStop shot to international fame in early 2021 when retail traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum engineered a historic short squeeze, propelling the company’s stock price and turning it into a symbol of grassroots financial rebellion. Since that time, GameStop has worked to reinvent itself, exploring digital initiatives such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, and online commerce. The addition of 4,710 BTC to its balance sheet signals that the company is now betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value and global relevance. For GameStop, this isn’t merely a speculative move — it’s a calculated effort to align with the forces reshaping the future of finance and technology. Joining a Growing Corporate Trend With this purchase, GameStop joins a growing list of prominent companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Strategy , under the leadership of Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, has famously acquired over 200,000 BTC, establishing itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Tesla made headlines in 2021 with its own high-profile Bitcoin acquisition, while fintech giant Block (formerly Square) has consistently positioned Bitcoin at the center of its long-term vision. By stepping into this elite circle, GameStop signals confidence in Bitcoin’s role as more than just a volatile asset — it sees Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and a hedge against inflation and currency risk. As macroeconomic uncertainty continues to swirl globally, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it increasingly appealing for companies seeking to diversify their balance sheets and future-proof their financial strategies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor and Market Impact For investors, GameStop’s announcement introduces a compelling new narrative around the company’s trajectory. While GameStop has faced challenges maintaining profitability in a rapidly shifting retail environment, its bold entrance into the world of digital assets suggests a willingness to explore unconventional growth strategies. This move could reinvigorate investor interest, particularly among those eager to see GameStop push beyond its past as a brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop’s move simultaneously boosts Bitcoin’s credibility as a viable asset for corporate treasuries. Each new public company that adopts Bitcoin adds momentum to its growing mainstream acceptance. GameStop’s decision could encourage other mid-cap and emerging companies to explore Bitcoin as a financial option, especially those looking to connect with younger, tech-savvy audiences. A Bold Bet on the Digital Future At its heart, GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction — it’s a statement about where the company believes the future is headed. As Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and command global attention, GameStop’s bold step positions it at the crossroads of gaming, finance, and technology. Whether this move ultimately proves to be a masterstroke or a risky gamble remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: GameStop is no longer just the poster child of the meme stock era — it is now an active participant in the sweeping transformation of global finance. By joining the Bitcoin bandwagon, GameStop has once again captured the world’s attention, this time with a move that could redefine its place in the digital age.

With $11.2m raised and no competitors, Bitcoin Pepe is accelerating toward a Tier-1 exchange debut on May 31 that could reshape how Bitcoin works for retail. BPEP is the first meme ICO that’s setting up Bitcoin’s next growth phase, one that isn’t just institutional but grassroots, creator-driven, and performance-ready. With just 5 days to go, the window is closing on what might be the first truly viral Layer 2 ecosystem on BTC. With new partnerships being announced every day and energy accelerating toward launch, make sure to check the official Bitcoin Pepe for the latest updates. Bitcoin’s missing piece: Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 fixes what BTC left behind Bitcoin Pepe is developing PEP-20, a new token standard that makes it possible to issue, trade, and interact with meme assets natively on Bitcoin. Ethereum has ERC-20, but Bitcoin never had a native way to scale tokens—until now. The potential ripple effect is huge. Low-cost meme creation invites the same kind of explosion we saw on Solana: an open field of creators, culture, and rapid liquidity formation. It’s about unlocking new utility on top of it, at a moment when Bitcoin’s price makes traditional entry increasingly out of reach for most. This is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, and it’s not just symbolic. It’s about building an open architecture where memes and microassets can finally live on the world’s oldest chain. BTC maximalists stay for the trust, degens stay for the gains, and creators stay for the tools. BPEP price outlook: Why Bitcoin Pepe could outpace the market Bitcoin Pepe is building on one of crypto’s strongest narratives: retail investors want high-upside exposure on the most trusted chain. With Bitcoin’s price breaking above $110K and institutions buying in, BPEP offers a low-barrier, high-energy entry point that BTC itself simply doesn’t. Interest in Bitcoin Pepe is intensifying as it prepares for its May 31 listing. Major partnerships, high-level exchange rumors, and a perfect macro setup are all feeding into what could be the biggest meme-layer launch on any chain this year. Top-tier platforms such as OKX and Bybit are reportedly preparing to list BPEP, paving the way for significant volume. Meanwhile, the team is expanding fast, aligning with Web3 gaming ( Crypto Hunters and GETE Network ), DeFi ( Plena Finance and Catamoto ), fair launch platforms ( Super Meme ), and content-first networks ( BETV ). These are to anchor BPEP in real utility and culture, two ingredients needed to scale. The momentum is also social. Influencers on X and YouTube have already picked up the scent. And if Bitcoin continues climbing toward a new ATH—as macro signals increasingly suggest—then tokens tied to its upside, like BPEP, could surge. The big question is whether this becomes the Solana moment for Bitcoin, a layer with real throughput, meme velocity, and network reach. When Solana’s token economy exploded, its value increased by 1000 times because it facilitated large-scale activity. Bitcoin Pepe is doing exactly that, but on the most credible chain in the world. Solana on Bitcoin launches in less than 5 days Bitcoin is winning over institutions, but retail is priced out and is hunting for the next breakout opportunity. At $110K, BTC won’t deliver 100x. But with over $11.2m raised and a current price of only $0.0359, Bitcoin Pepe might. It’s a layer 2 engineered to activate retail, creators, and builders on Bitcoin itself —something BTC has never offered. While institutions are accumulating Bitcoin for the long term, Bitcoin Pepe is paving the way for those who missed the initial surge but are determined not to miss this one. Long story short, Bitcoin Pepe is how retail comes back in.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 12:23:52

Within hours, the company's shares increased by 400%, catapulting the sports betting tech firm to crypto stardom. But behind the headline flash is a story of strategic innovation, industry alignment, and a bold bet on the digital asset future. A New Type of Corporate Treasury SharpLink's move is more than a news headline maker — it's a return to fundamentals in the manner in which companies treat their balance sheets. CEO Rob Phythian stated in a statement, ”We believe Ethereum's ecosystem offers both the liquidity and programmability to support our long-term vision.” The company has begun to transition much of its cash reserves into Ethereum (ETH), joining the ranks of the first publicly traded companies to formally adopt an ETH-denominated policy of the treasury. This is not just about having a risky asset. SharpLink board minutes reveal a plan to leverage Ethereum's DeFi protocols to earn yields, hedge, and even use for working payments. The company considers ETH not only a store of value but also an operational working capital asset—much like the way MicroStrategy famously leveraged Bitcoin to turbocharge its own treasury. Consensys Joins the Board: Strategic Alignment The intrigue was compounded when blockchain giant Consensys, the company behind MetaMask and a force behind the development of Ethereum, joined SharpLink's board. Consensys possesses deep technical acumen and a close relationship with the underlying breakthroughs of Ethereum. ”This partnership is not simply about investment,” said a representative for Consensys. ”It's about injecting Ethereum-native thinking into the DNA of an innovation-focused company.” Insiders forecast Consensys will help guide SharpLink along on-chain treasury management, smart contract integrations, and even tokenization strategies in the future. The move is part of an emerging trend: crypto veterans are calling for influence in traditional industries as Ethereum's institutional appeal grows. Following MicroStrategy — But with Ether SharpLink's playbook tracks MicroStrategy's legendary Bitcoin pivot, except for one twist. While MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor took on the role of Bitcoin evangelist, SharpLink is betting on Ethereum's more utility and network effects. Company Treasury Asset Strategy Highlights Stock Reaction MicroStrategy Bitcoin (BTC) Buy-and-hold, leverage, advocacy +1,000%+ SharpLink Ethereum (ETH) DeFi integration, board expansion +400% The difference? Ethereum programmability allows SharpLink to do more than just hold. The company can stake ETH, earn yield, and potentially use smart contracts for payroll, vendor payments, and more. This kind of flexibility can set the new standard for how tech companies manage digital assets. On-Chain Treasury Moves and Tax Implications Blockchain sleuths have already pinpointed SharpLink's treasury wallet accumulating ETH, with inflows via large exchanges and DeFi protocols. SharpLink is experimenting with staking and liquidity pools, which can boost returns but exposes the company to smart contract risk, say analysts. Tax professionals are watching closely. Unlike Bitcoin, which is more likely to be considered a non-yielding asset, ETH staking rewards might be considered income, triggering different tax obligations. ”SharpLink will need to meticulously track its on-chain activity,” says crypto tax attorney Lisa Tran. ”The IRS is watching very closely what kind of reporting businesses are doing on staking and DeFi yields.” Altseason Signal? Ether's Price Target and Forecast SharpLink's flagship ETH treasury move has fueled speculation of a wider ”altseason”—a period during which alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Some experts interpret this as evidence that Ethereum is growing as an organizational reserve asset, especially with ETH 2.0 upgrades and institutional adoption gaining momentum. While it's too early to call a new trend, Ether bulls are eyeing price levels above $10,000 on the strength of expanding demand from corporations and decentralized applications. ”SharpLink's move is potentially the trigger that can initiate another wave of corporate ETH adoption,” says market analyst Rahul Patel. ”If others were to follow, we might witness a sea change in treasury management practices.”.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-28 12:26:05

The announcement, made via the company’s official X account on May 28, positions the gaming retailer as one of the more prominent public holders of Bitcoin, joining the ranks of MicroStrategy and Tesla. With Bitcoin trading around $108,800 at the time, GameStop’s holdings are valued at roughly $512 million. However, the company didn’t reveal the exact purchase price in its SEC filing. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 Backed by $1.5B in Convertible Notes GameStop was able to buy Bitcoin because, back in April, it raised $1.5 billion by selling a special kind of IOU to investors. These IOUs don’t pay any interest and are due to be paid back in 2030. Investors were so interested that GameStop even raised an extra $200 million. The company clearly said in official filings that this money would be used to buy Bitcoin. This big crypto move shows that GameStop is trying to branch out from its struggling video game business. The company had already tried its hand at NFTs and launched its crypto wallet before. While the news boosted positive vibes around Bitcoin and slightly pushed its price up, no one knows yet if GameStop plans to keep buying more BTC or if this was just a one-time splash to try something new with its cash. Crypto Community Reacts GameStop’s entry into crypto has been welcomed by many in the digital asset space, with some seeing it as a bullish signal for broader corporate adoption. Crypto user Tommy T calls GameStop’s 4,710 BTC buy more than just a purchase; it’s a power move. Once mocked as “dumb money,” retail investors are now outsmarting hedge funds. He says the game is changing, and retail isn’t just playing, it’s rewriting the rules. Still, skeptics remain cautious, waiting to see how the company integrates Bitcoin into its future roadmap amid ongoing retail challenges. CEO in Legal Scoop? Additionally, GameStop’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, is currently facing a lawsuit over $47.2 million he earned from trading Bed Bath & Beyond shares just before the company went bankrupt. The case claims that Cohen and his firm, RC Ventures, may have made “short-swing” trades, which could force them to return those profits. Either way, GameStop’s $512M Bitcoin buy cements its commitment to digital innovation and could be a peak moment in its ongoing reinvention.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 12:27:06

Reports are circulating that Telegram, the popular messaging platform with hundreds of millions of users, is looking to make a significant financial move. We’re talking about a potential Telegram bond deal aimed at raising a staggering $1.5 billion. This isn’t just any fundraising round; the rumored interest from global financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel suggests a major step for Telegram and potentially for the broader acceptance of digital economy platforms. What is the Telegram Bond Deal and Why Now? So, what exactly is a bond deal in this context? Think of it like Telegram taking out a massive loan from investors. These investors buy ‘bonds’ (essentially IOUs) from Telegram, and in return, Telegram promises to pay them back the principal amount on a future date, usually with regular interest payments along the way. It’s a common way for large companies to raise significant capital without selling off equity (like stocks). The news of this potential Telegram bond deal first surfaced via Unfolded on X, citing reports from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). A $1.5 billion target is ambitious and signals Telegram’s need or desire for substantial funds. But why now? Telegram has been rapidly expanding its user base and, more importantly for the crypto world, developing its associated blockchain project, The Open Network (TON). Scaling infrastructure, funding development teams, launching new features, and potentially navigating complex regulatory landscapes all require significant capital. A bond deal offers a structured way to access that funding. Who are the Key Players in this Telegram Fundraising? One of the most intriguing aspects of this reported Telegram fundraising effort is the list of potential investors being mentioned. The names circulating include: BlackRock: The world’s largest asset manager, with trillions under management. Their involvement would be a huge vote of confidence and a significant signal to the traditional finance world. Mubadala Investment Company: A sovereign wealth fund from Abu Dhabi, managing vast sums on behalf of the government. Sovereign wealth funds investing directly in tech/crypto-adjacent companies is a notable trend. Citadel: A major hedge fund and financial services company founded by Ken Griffin. Known for its market-making activities and sophisticated trading strategies. While reports indicate these firms are ‘expected’ to back the deal, the final list of participants and the exact terms of the bonds would be disclosed upon completion. However, the mere mention of such prominent names underscores the scale and potential impact of this Telegram fundraising . It suggests that Telegram is presenting a compelling investment case that appeals to large, sophisticated institutional investors. How Does This Institutional Investment Impact Crypto? The potential participation of firms like BlackRock and Citadel in a deal related to Telegram, a platform increasingly intertwined with the TON blockchain, is highly significant for the crypto space. This kind of institutional investment serves several purposes: Validation: It provides a layer of legitimacy and validation for platforms operating in or adjacent to the digital asset space. When traditional finance giants put significant capital into such ventures, it signals increasing acceptance and confidence in their long-term viability. Capital Inflow: Direct investment from these firms injects substantial capital into the ecosystem, which can fuel development, innovation, and expansion. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: Deals like this act as bridges between traditional finance (TradFi) and the crypto world, potentially paving the way for more collaboration and investment in the future. While this specific bond deal is for Telegram as a company, its close relationship with TON means that success for Telegram often translates to positive developments for the TON ecosystem. Increased funding for Telegram could directly or indirectly benefit the blockchain project, leading to more resources for developers, better infrastructure, and wider adoption, further attracting institutional investment into the broader crypto landscape. Exploring the Potential of Telegram Investment From an investor’s perspective, why would they consider this Telegram investment ? Telegram boasts a massive global user base, offering significant network effects and potential for monetization beyond its current model. Its foray into the blockchain space with TON opens up new avenues for growth, including payments, decentralized applications, and digital identity. A bond deal offers a potentially less volatile investment than equity or direct crypto exposure, providing fixed returns over a set period. For Telegram, the benefits of this Telegram investment are clear: access to substantial, non-dilutive capital. This allows them to fund ambitious projects, compete with other tech giants, and accelerate the development and adoption of TON without giving up ownership stakes in the core company. The funds could be used for: Further developing the TON blockchain infrastructure. Supporting developers building applications on TON. Expanding Telegram’s core messaging features and infrastructure. Potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships. Working towards wider integration of crypto/Web3 features within the Telegram app. However, challenges exist. Telegram operates globally and faces varying regulatory environments. Executing large-scale projects efficiently requires strong management. And while a bond is less volatile than equity, there are still risks related to the company’s ability to generate sufficient revenue to service the debt. What Does This Mean for Crypto Fundraising Going Forward? This reported $1.5 billion bond deal could set a precedent for crypto fundraising . Historically, crypto projects have relied heavily on token sales (ICOs, IEOs, etc.) or venture capital equity rounds. A large-scale bond issuance by a company deeply connected to a major blockchain project suggests a maturation of fundraising methods available to entities in this space. Here’s how this could influence future crypto fundraising : Diversification of Funding: More projects might explore debt financing as an alternative or complement to equity and token sales, especially as they grow and establish revenue models. Appeal to Traditional Investors: Bond deals are familiar instruments for traditional finance. Offering bonds can make crypto-adjacent investments more accessible and appealing to a wider pool of institutional investors who might be hesitant about direct token exposure or early-stage equity. Focus on Sustainable Models: Securing debt requires a credible business plan and revenue projections to assure bondholders of repayment. This could push crypto entities towards developing more sustainable, revenue-generating models rather than relying solely on speculative token value. This development highlights a growing trend where established tech platforms are leveraging their user base and infrastructure to build Web3 ecosystems, attracting significant capital from both traditional finance and crypto-native investors. It signals a potential shift in how large-scale projects in the digital asset space will be funded in the future. Key Takeaways from Telegram’s Reported Bond Deal Let’s quickly recap the essential points: Telegram is reportedly seeking to raise $1.5 billion through a bond issuance. Prominent investors like BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel are rumored to be interested. This represents a significant Telegram fundraising effort and potentially one of the largest debt raises by a company closely tied to a major blockchain project (TON). The potential institutional investment signals growing confidence from traditional finance in the digital economy space. The funds could fuel Telegram’s expansion and the development of the TON ecosystem. This move could influence future crypto fundraising strategies, potentially popularizing debt financing. In Conclusion: A Bold Move with Broad Implications Telegram’s reported pursuit of a $1.5 billion bond deal is a bold strategic move. If successful, it would provide the platform with substantial resources to accelerate its growth and further integrate its operations with the promising TON blockchain ecosystem. The rumored interest from top-tier global investors like BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel is a powerful indicator of the increasing convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset world. This isn’t just news for Telegram users or TON enthusiasts; it’s a development with potentially wide-ranging implications for how large tech and crypto-adjacent projects are funded, validated, and integrated into the global financial landscape going forward. It underscores the growing maturity and scale of the opportunities emerging at the intersection of social platforms, technology, and decentralized networks.

Management's plan to classify Bitcoin as cash or short-term investments violates GAAP and raises legal and accounting red flags. Shares remain extremely overvalued relative to peers, with user growth and monetization failing to justify the current market cap. Absent a massive Bitcoin rally, I see no upside for shareholders and maintain a 'strong sell' rating on DJT. May 27th was not a very good day for shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ), the company that owns right-wing platform Truth Social. After news broke that management had decided to issue additional stock and convertible notes, shares of the business closed down 10.4%. Even though this transaction will bring a significant amount of liquidity to the company, it doesn't do anything to address its underlying problems. The objective is to use this cash to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). This could work out well in the event that Bitcoin prices rise. But anybody who follows my work closely knows how bearish I am about that cryptocurrency. There are some other issues as well. For starters, management seems to be interested in classifying these Bitcoin holdings on the company's books in a way that currently violates accounting standards and would be at odds with the law. This is problematic in and of itself. On top of this, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group remain significantly overvalued as-is and are likely to fall further from where they are right now. For context, since I originally rated the company a ‘strong sell’ in April 2024, the stock has plummeted by 52.1%. That comes at a time when the S&P 500 is up 12.9%. Absent any scenario where Bitcoin prices skyrocket, I see this as just more noise and more evidence that management doesn't really have a solid strategy to grow the company and create lasting shareholder value. Due to these factors, I have no choice but to maintain the company as a ‘strong sell’. A big… and questionable… announcement Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plummeted 10.4% on May 27th after management announced that it struck a deal to raise about $2.5 billion from a group of 50 institutional investors. This investment will take two forms. The largest chunk of the money, $1.5 billion, will come from the issuance of additional stock at a price of $25.72 per share. This implies 58.32 million shares, which on their own would dilute existing shareholders by 20.9%. On top of this, the firm is issuing another $1 billion of 0% convertible notes. These are senior secured notes that will be backed by the Bitcoin holdings that the company has on its books. There is the opportunity for the notes to be converted at a 35% premium to the price that the shares are being sold for. That would mean an effective price of $34.72 per share. If that comes to pass, it would mean further dilution because of the issuance of 28.80 million shares. For those who are bullish about Bitcoin, and who are also bullish about Trump Media & Technology Group, this development will be perceived in a positive light. In essence, management will use the proceeds from this transaction to create what it calls a Bitcoin treasury. This follows a previously announced special acquisition fund that I wrote about in the past. According to the press release, Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes said that, ‘We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms, and will create synergies for our subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+. It's a big step forward in the Company’s plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles’. This transaction really just signals to me that management doesn't really have a cohesive strategy for how to grow the business. The entire objective of the company at this point in time should be to grow its user base and improve monetization. This would result in network effects that could make this into a lasting firm. In my previous article about the company, I specifically mentioned that it seemed as though management was just looking to latch on to anything that might stick, with the hopes that it would turn out well. This sentiment was expressed after the company struck a deal with Crypto.com to speculate in cryptocurrency using ETFs on its Truth.Fi platform. That followed another strategy that involved its own Truth+ streaming operations that have since been launched on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and elsewhere. Obviously, if Bitcoin prices rise from here, there could be a positive outcome for shareholders. However, the company does face some other issues as well that are worth mentioning. The first thing that came to my mind was that the business seems intent on violating current accounting standards. In its press release, the company said that it will place Bitcoin on the company's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This is a big problem because Bitcoin is not, by definition, any of those things. According to current accounting standards in the US, cash includes currency that a company has, as well as things such as demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. It can include other types of deposit-related accounts also. It also doesn't meet the definition of a cash equivalent. You see, cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that have specific characteristics to them. For starters, they are ‘readily convertible to known amounts of cash’ and ‘so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates’. An example here would be a three-month U.S. Treasury bill. Even when you have an investment that has a short time remaining to it, if the original maturity was longer, such as three years, it still would not meet the definition of cash equivalent. Some might argue that Bitcoin would meet the cash equivalents definition because it is readily convertible to cash and because it's not really tied to interest rates. However, the highly volatile nature of it violates part of this rule. As such, it certainly wouldn't pass the muster of this test. When it comes to short-term investments, it doesn't meet that standard either . To meet the standard, it must be readily marketable, meaning that it can be sold on the public market quickly and without any meaningful loss from said sale. It must be intended to be converted into cash within a single year or within the company’s operating cycle. And it must meet the definition of a financial instrument, which has historically been a debt security, an equity security, or some sort of held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity investment. But in order to meet the definition of a financial instrument, it has to give the owner a contractual claim to cash or some other financial asset. Bitcoin does none of that. The proper designation under GAAP regarding Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies has been as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Specific examples here outside of cryptocurrency would be goodwill or trademarks. Each year, these must be tested for impairment. This also means that, should there be a plunge in Bitcoin and a subsequent increase in it, the value of Bitcoin on the company's books could end up being significantly understated. Indefinite lived intangible assets can be written down, or impaired, when their prices drop. But they cannot be adjusted upwards. So this is something investors should pay attention to. It's also worth noting that, under the Howey Test, Bitcoin is not considered a security because it fails two of those four prongs. While it does meet the first prong of involving an investment of money, and it also meets the prong of there being an expectation of buyers having a profit from it, it's not an investment in a common enterprise since there is no issuing entity, and it doesn't involve the efforts of others since it is a decentralized faux asset. The SEC and CFTC typically both recognize Bitcoin as a commodity , not an investment. So at the end of the day, the company is going to have difficulty classifying its investment in the way that it hopes to classify it. I suppose that if management puts the Bitcoin into some other structured entity like an ETF or trust, it might be able to include it under the short-term investments category. But that would only be applicable if the investment is intended to be liquidated in a year or less. In that case, any swings in valuation could be measured at fair value and record it as unrealized gains or losses, until such time that the firm finally cashes out of it and realizes said gains or losses. Shares remain insanely overvalued In my previous article about Trump Media & Technology Group, I also decided to value the company by looking at the implied enterprise value divided by the daily active users that the company has. Since then, I have seen an updated estimate that pegs the number of daily active users for the company at 2 million. That's above the 1.9 million estimate that I used in March of this year. Management doesn't report these figures, so we have to use these third-party estimates. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In that analysis, which you can see updated in the table above, the company is compared to other social platforms that are publicly traded. I have also included Twitter on the list since we know its ultimate value at the time that it was sold. If the company were to trade at the same enterprise value per daily active user as these other firms, you would be looking at a downside of between 50.5% and 63.7%. This is even after factoring in this new equity raise, but without factoring in the conversion of the $1 billion of convertible notes. Frankly, I doubt that those notes will ever get converted, given the share price appreciation that would be needed to make that possible. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In the event that Trump Media & Technology Group was achieving attractive growth, and showed evidence that it could generate significant revenue, profits, and cash flows, per user, then perhaps there could be some potential for the company. But in the chart below, you can see that the firm continues to lose significant amounts of cash and, in the most recent quarter alone, it generated revenue of only $821,200. That's enough revenue to buy two of the average homes in the US. It's nowhere near enough to justify an implied market capitalization, following this offering, of $6.43 billion. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Takeaway Based on all the data currently available, it seems to me as though the market reacted appropriately in response to this latest announcement by the management team at Trump Media & Technology Group. Unless you expect Bitcoin prices to skyrocket, I really don't see a way in which this benefits shareholders. The company remains drastically overpriced, and I believe that management's plans on how to classify the Bitcoin it intends to purchase are at odds with GAAP and U.S. law. This only furthers my view that the company deserves a ‘strong sell’ rating.",BTC-USD|DJT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-28 13:30:26

It is the first US spot XRP ETF proposal that would allow investors to invest in XRP. The SEC will also consider whether the XRP ETF proposal offers adequate investor protection and has methods to prevent market manipulation. SEC begins reviewing the WisdomTree XRP ETF proposal Earlier, Cboe BZX Exchange submitted this application. If approved, it will be the first spot XRP ETF in the United States, potentially paving the way for similar products related to other cryptocurrencies and expanding the ecosystem. The proposed ETF aims to track XRP’s market price using the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. This would greatly benefit investors, enabling them to access XRP through regular brokerage accounts without needing private keys or self-storage. The SEC gave crypto investors new hope for these benefits with their recent Release No. 34-103124 announcement. The notice from the commission says it will begin a thorough review of the application. The Commission has 240 days to determine whether to grant or deny the request. To get the review process for the proposal started, the agency began asking the public to give its input on whether or not the ETF’s approach is adequate to address potential market manipulation and to protect investors. This week, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, participated in this evaluation. Alderoty wrote a letter to the regulator’s crypto group outlining his opinion that XRP shouldn’t be classified as a security on its own. Commissioner Hester Maria Peirce raised a crucial question concerning his opinion in her “New Paradigm” speech. She asked, “When does a digital asset become separate from an investment contract?” Alderoty submitted another letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force responding to the question, claiming that rules must be clear not just for issuers but also for all market players who might unknowingly be labeled as securities exchanges, brokers, dealers, or issuers. He further stated that relying too much on unclear terms like fully functional or decentralized only causes more confusion instead of providing clarity. SEC’s recent action has sparked hope among other ETF firms In the wake of Trump’s pro-crypto position, companies in the US like Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have filed applications with the SEC. The watchdog acknowledged a few XRP spot ETF filings, suggesting it is processing their submissions. However, the SEC later delayed its review process—a move anticipated by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who projected a decision might come by October. After the regulator gave the green light for WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Bitwise are optimistic that they are next in line for approval. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs —the company responsible for developing and promoting XRP—has agreed to settle its legal dispute with the SEC. The settlement ends the legal battle over whether XRP is a financial security. Ripple had agreed to a fine of $50 million, down from the $125 million penalty proposed in August. Min Jung, a research analyst for Presto Research, said that with the settlement, an XRP ETF is likely to get the green light. If any new spot ETFs were to be approved after Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP or Solana could be suitable candidates. However, Jung also noted that the demand for spot XRP ETFs remain unknown.

In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust: “At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.” The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins . Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.” Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini report Ensuring stablecoins remain stable The FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets: “We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“ Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime. Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transaction Crypto custody rules incoming The FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services , as outlined in a separate discussion paper . The rules are designed to ensure that user assets are secure and can be accessed at any time: “The FCA's proposals would require firms providing crypto custody services, who have responsibility for keeping consumers’ crypto safe, to ensure they are effectively secured and can be easily accessed at any time.“ Proposed measures also aim to reduce both the likelihood and impact of crypto firms failing, both in the crypto custody and stablecoin sectors. The ongoing efforts also follow the recent revelation by UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves of plans for a “comprehensive regulatory regime ” aimed at making the country a crypto leader.

In March, the White House did just that, though it has yet to be codified into law by Congress. The Bitcoin Reserve Act treats the world’s first blockchain-based cryptocurrency as a digital gold-style reserve asset, using coins seized from criminal cases. Back says the $1 million prediction is the minimum target if the stars align. Source: Adam Back US states have started laying the groundwork. New Hampshire broke the ice on May 6 by signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Later in the month, Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, backed by Governor Greg Abbott . Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine , Back gave a 2025 price target of “a few hundred thousand” dollars, citing renewed retail demand once roughly $16 billion in FTX bankruptcy repayments re-enter the market. He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally. 2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end target Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices. Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins. Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route “The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, agreed with Kendrick’s $200,000 year-end target. Markus Thielen added that Bitcoin has historically moved in $16,000 price increments, placing its next key resistance around $122,000. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, also recently set his year-end target at $200,000 in a media interview . 3.

Cathie Wood’s $1.5-million Bitcoin target Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, set her bull case forecast for Bitcoin at $1.5 million by 2030 , which would require a compound annual growth rate of 58% over the next five years. In a YouTube video published in February, she cited rising institutional interest as the key driver. Wood and ARK Invest are known for placing high-conviction bets on disruptive technologies, including early investments in Tesla and Bitcoin. Wood also highlights stablecoins as a key player in rising blockchain-based economies.

On May 28 at ETHPrague, Fabian and Miyaguchi took the audience back to 2018 and 2019 when United Nations Children’s Fund first began working with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency through the creation of its CryptoFund. Fabian, who had previously worked in startups and other technological projects before working with UNICEF , recalled how it took a while for him to convince the organization that the technology was going to bring about a revolutionary shift in the way it would receive and distribute donations across the globe. “And it was, remember it was 2018. So if you think about who was out there in space, that was a particular moment,” said Fabian. “All of these misunderstandings about what the thing is made it take a lot longer than it should have, and I think they still stop governments from adopting certain types of blockchains,” he continued. To explain how the blockchain and crypto worked, he used the analogy of a motorcycle being used to deliver vaccines to remote areas and compared it to how crypto was essentially a vehicle or a medium used to store and circulate funds. “It’s just another thing like a motorcycle, so it’s an intangible version of motorcycle and it was like that type of learning and that type of work figuring out that a smart contract isn’t a contract getting the lawyers to relax on that,” said Fabian. Another metaphor he used to describe cryptocurrency was the fungus growing on trees, whereas governments and organizations like the UN were the trees that were “very hard to move.” You might also like: UNDP wants to explore crypto’s potential for human development in 2025 “You can’t force the trees to change the way they do it. You have to do it subtly and then it has to be organic in the same way that the trees work, but it’s not exactly the trees. It’s another, it’s another part of the ecosystem,” he said. President of Ethereum ( ETH ) Foundation, Aya Miyaguchi, said that she met Christopher Fabian in Japan when they happened to be in Osaka for DevCon. After talking to Fabian for awhile, she realized that he had a deep understanding of the crypto space and how it can be utilized to help UNICEF and other organizations. Because his vision aligned with what she believed Ethereum could do in the long-term future, she decided to bridge a collaboration with the UN agency through Chris and his team. “I think I made the decision to work with UNICEF. Just because of the name of UNICEF, of course it strategically helps to work the UN for for our purpose. But at the same time it was, it had to be the right team because we’re not gonna be the one to drive in a ship inside the organization,” said Miyaguchi. Ultimately, UNICEF launched its CryptoFund in October 2019, calling it a “new financial vehicle allowing UNICEF to receive, hold, and disburse cryptocurrency,” which was a first for the UN. Initially, the UNICEF CryptoFund provided funding for eight emerging technology companies in the form of 125 ETH. However, it has since moved on to bigger projects, such as Fabian’s own venture, Giga , a company designed to bring Internet and technology to underserved populations.

The organization behind The Open Network (TON) blockchain recently announced the appointment of Nikola Plecas, a veteran with extensive experience at global payments giant Visa, as its new Vice President of Payments. This strategic addition underscores TON’s serious ambitions in the burgeoning field of crypto payments and integrating blockchain technology into everyday transactions. Who is Nikola Plecas and Why Does This Hire Matter for the TON Foundation ? Nikola Plecas joins the TON Foundation after a distinguished career at Visa, where he held the position of Senior Director. Visa is, of course, one of the world’s leading digital payment networks, processing billions of transactions annually across countless merchants and financial institutions globally. Plecas’s background within such a large, complex, and highly regulated environment brings a wealth of knowledge and practical experience that is often scarce in the relatively young blockchain industry. His tenure at Visa likely involved navigating intricate payment systems, managing large-scale partnerships, understanding global compliance frameworks, and driving adoption in diverse markets. These are precisely the areas where blockchain projects aiming for mass adoption, especially in payments, face significant hurdles. Hiring a seasoned Visa executive like Plecas is a clear signal that the TON Foundation is not just building technology but is focused on building a usable, scalable, and compliant payment ecosystem that can compete on a global stage. For the TON Foundation , this hire represents several key advantages: Credibility and Experience: Bringing in talent from a globally recognized financial institution like Visa adds significant credibility to TON’s payment initiatives. Navigating Regulation: Plecas’s experience in a highly regulated environment will be invaluable in steering TON’s payment products through the complex and ever-evolving landscape of financial regulations worldwide. Scaling Infrastructure: Building payment systems that can handle millions or billions of transactions requires deep expertise in infrastructure design and scaling, something Plecas would have gained at Visa. Partnership Building: His background likely includes forging and managing relationships with banks, merchants, and technology providers – crucial for expanding a payment network. Boosting Global Crypto Payments : What’s the Strategy? As the new Vice President of Payments, Nikola Plecas is tasked with leading the TON Foundation ‘s global payments strategy. This is a broad mandate that will likely involve several critical areas: The primary goal is undoubtedly to make paying with TON-based assets as easy and widespread as using traditional currencies or payment methods. This involves addressing key challenges currently hindering mainstream crypto payments : User Experience: Simplifying the process of sending and receiving crypto payments for both consumers and merchants. This includes wallet integration, transaction speed, and fee management. Merchant Adoption: Building tools and incentives for businesses to accept TON-based payments. This might involve payment gateways, point-of-sale solutions, and integration with existing business systems. Stablecoin Integration: While TON supports various tokens, leveraging stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies will be crucial for payments to mitigate volatility risks for merchants and consumers. Cross-Border Transactions: Capitalizing on blockchain’s inherent ability to facilitate faster and cheaper international payments compared to traditional remittance services. Plecas will also be responsible for managing key partnerships. This could range from collaborating with fintech companies and payment processors to integrating with e-commerce platforms and potentially even traditional financial institutions willing to explore blockchain integration. Overseeing compliance will be another major pillar of his role, ensuring that TON’s payment solutions adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and other relevant financial regulations across different jurisdictions. Bridging the Gap: Integrating Traditional Finance with Blockchain Payments The appointment of a former Visa executive highlights the TON Foundation ‘s commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the world of decentralized blockchain payments . This integration is essential for mass adoption but comes with its own set of complexities. Traditional payment systems, like those operated by Visa, are built on decades of established infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and consumer trust. They offer stability, widespread acceptance, and robust consumer protection mechanisms. However, they can also be slow, expensive, and lack transparency, especially for cross-border transactions. Blockchain payments , on the other hand, offer speed, lower costs, transparency, and immutability. Yet, they often face challenges related to volatility (for non-stablecoin assets), regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues (though TON aims to address this), and a steep learning curve for average users. Plecas’s task is to leverage the strengths of blockchain while incorporating the best practices from traditional finance, particularly in areas like risk management, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance. This hybrid approach is likely the most viable path to bringing blockchain payments into the mainstream. It requires understanding the nuances of both worlds and building systems that are not only technologically advanced but also safe, reliable, and easy for anyone to use, regardless of their technical expertise. Consider the key differences and areas for integration: Feature Traditional Payments (e.g., Visa) Blockchain Payments (e.g., TON) Integration Goal (with Plecas’s expertise) Transaction Speed Can be slow (especially cross-border) Generally faster (near-instant on TON) Maintain blockchain speed, add necessary checks without significant delay Cost Transaction fees, interchange fees, cross-border markups Low transaction fees Keep costs low while building sustainable business models Regulation Highly regulated, established frameworks Evolving and fragmented regulation Build compliant solutions that fit within existing or emerging frameworks Scalability Massive, proven scale Scalability is a key focus area for L1 blockchains like TON Leverage Visa’s understanding of scaling infrastructure to ensure TON can handle mass adoption Consumer Protection Chargebacks, fraud protection Immutability means transactions are final; protection requires different mechanisms Develop robust fraud detection and dispute resolution mechanisms suitable for blockchain User Adoption Near-universal Growing, but still niche compared to TradFi Simplify user experience, build trust, leverage partnerships for wider reach This table illustrates the significant challenges and opportunities. Plecas’s role will be crucial in navigating these differences and finding the optimal path for TON. The Visa Executive Perspective: What Specific Skills Does This Bring to TON? A Visa executive doesn’t just bring knowledge of payment systems; they bring a specific mindset and skill set honed in a high-stakes, global financial environment. These include: Operational Excellence: Running payment networks requires incredible reliability and efficiency. Plecas understands the operational demands of processing transactions at scale. Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating financial risks, including fraud, credit risk, and compliance risk, is paramount in payments. Network Effects: Visa’s success is built on network effects – the more users and merchants join, the more valuable the network becomes. Plecas will understand how to build and leverage such effects within the TON ecosystem, potentially integrating with platforms like Telegram to accelerate adoption. Enterprise Sales and Partnerships: Working with large banks, corporations, and technology partners is different from grassroots crypto adoption. Plecas will have the experience to forge these crucial enterprise-level relationships. Global Market Nuances: Understanding the diverse regulatory and market landscapes across different countries is vital for building a truly global payment solution. This type of expertise is invaluable for a blockchain project moving beyond early adopters and aiming for mass market penetration. It signifies a maturing of the industry, where practical, real-world business acumen is just as important as technological innovation. The Road Ahead for TON Foundation Payments The hiring of Nikola Plecas is a strong indicator that the TON Foundation is prioritizing payments as a key use case for its blockchain. With the vast potential user base on platforms like Telegram, integrating seamless and reliable payment solutions could drive significant adoption and utility for the TON ecosystem. What should observers and participants in the TON community watch for? Key indicators of progress under Plecas’s leadership might include: Announcements of new partnerships with payment processors, fintech companies, or major merchants. Development and rollout of user-friendly payment applications or integrations within existing platforms (e.g., Telegram). Updates on compliance frameworks and efforts to work with regulators in key markets. Increased transaction volume and user activity related to payments on the TON network. While challenges remain, including the unpredictable nature of crypto regulation and the inherent volatility of crypto assets (unless stablecoins are used), the strategic direction is clear. The TON Foundation is leveraging top-tier traditional finance expertise to build a robust and compliant payment infrastructure on its blockchain. In conclusion, the addition of Nikola Plecas, a seasoned Visa executive , as VP of Payments is a landmark moment for the TON Foundation . It underscores a serious commitment to developing real-world crypto payments solutions and bridging the gap with traditional finance. His experience in navigating complex payment systems, managing partnerships, and ensuring compliance will be critical assets as TON aims to build a scalable and globally adopted blockchain payments network. This hire positions TON as a significant player to watch in the evolving landscape where decentralized technology meets mainstream financial services.

Coin Bureau sees this move as significant because it unlocks a $16 billion market, and Dubai’s millionaires and billionaires will now interact with XRP and the XRPL, boosting the reach of the asset and ecosystem. Tokenization Enables New Investment Opportunities This initiative represents a major advancement in Dubai’s ongoing efforts to modernize its property sector. Through blockchain-based tokenization, the Dubai Land Department is enabling institutional and retail investors to hold fractional stakes in luxury properties. The program is designed to make real estate investments more accessible and transparent, with title deed ownership recorded immutably on the XRPL. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is a massive and important market, and XRP is leading the charge to dominate this market. Why XRP Ledger Was Chosen The XRPL was chosen over other blockchain platforms due to its performance capabilities, including fast settlement times, minimal transaction costs, and scalability. These qualities are particularly important in real estate, where the speed and cost of transactions can significantly affect investor participation and operational efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The XRPL’s energy-efficient design also aligns with broader sustainability goals adopted by many governments, including Dubai’s. XRP has proven itself through its many use cases and offers seamless institutional compatibility, making it the perfect asset to support an easily expandable RWA tokenization. A Market Filled With High-Net-Worth Individuals Dubai’s move is not just about technological efficiency, it is also a targeted approach to attract global investment. Coin Bureau noted that the city currently hosts 81,200 millionaires, among them 237 centimillionaires and 20 billionaires. Tokenized real estate offers a modern vehicle for high-net-worth individuals to diversify their holdings while maintaining exposure to one of the world’s most dynamic property markets. More Legal Clarity for XRP The government’s proactive role in this transition further enhances the credibility of the initiative, giving XRP clarity in Dubai. By leading the project through official channels, including licensing and regulatory frameworks, Dubai is reducing the operational risks commonly associated with decentralized platforms. It also increases investor confidence by ensuring that digital property titles are legally recognized and enforceable. Recent developments, such as the launch of the first-ever spot XRP ETF in Brazil , show that people are eager to engage with the asset and its ecosystem. If the U.S. does not provide full legal clarity soon, it may lag behind other countries that are advancing crypto usage and regulation.

However, the pullback appears to be yet another higher low, which keeps up the possibility of a breakout. In the past few days, institutions have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, while others have been raising funds to buy more, such as Statergy. With the bullish momentum refueling, the Bitcoin cohorts have again become active. The Bitcoin cohorts refer to groups within the network that are used to understand the trend patterns and economic behaviors related to BTC transactions. Woefully, the spending by the older BTC holders has hit a high. The Aggregate volume of 1-year to 5-year cohorts has surged above $4 billion, suggesting the older coins are on the move. The rise has been seen for the first time since February 2025, while the 3-year to 5-year cohort contributed $2.16 billion out of $4 billion, which is their second-largest outflow. While 2-3 cohorts and 1-2 years contribute $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively. In recent times, the change in their positions has always triggered interim BTC peaks, be it in Q4 2024 or in February or May 2025. Now the question arises whether this is a bearish signal for Bitcoin. Seeing 1y to 5y BTC moving isn’t a red flag yet, as most of this appears to be institutional accumulation, but not actual dumping. The exchange netflows are negative, while ETF inflows sharply rise, indicating they could be buying. However, if these tokens hit the exchanges, one can expect a sharp move. Hence, the Bitcoin (BTC) price movement is required to be closely monitored for the next few days.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 13:43:41

The cryptocurrency exchange will serve as the exclusive crypto exchange and wallet partner for both teams. The announcement comes despite facing challenges from a recent data breach that exposed sensitive information of nearly 70,000 customers and could cost up to $400 million in remediation. Coinbase targets Canadian sports fans through MLSE deal Coinbase has recognized a significant opportunity in the sports industry in Canada. According to recent data the exchange cited, 1.4 million Toronto FC and Argonauts supporters have engaged in active cryptocurrency trading in the previous 12 months, and 1.7 million of them are cryptocurrency owners. It expects to gain direct access to these communities through collaboration with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment on a number of sports channels. As a result of the partnership, Coinbase is now both teams’ sole cryptocurrency exchange and wallet partner. The new lounge at Toronto’s BMO Field, fieldside LED signs for both teams’ home games, and jersey patches on Toronto Argonauts uniforms will all prominently display the exchange. About five million people in Canada own crypto, making up about 13% of the country’s total population. Because of this, the nation is a desirable market for Coinbase’s growth initiatives. The collaboration expands on Coinbase’s prior achievement as the 111th Grey Cup’s first cryptocurrency partner and the Canadian Football League. Multi-sport branding strategy spans CFL and MLS partnerships The focus of Coinbase’s Canadian expansion is on high-profile branding opportunities on Major League Soccer and the Canadian Football League platforms. Beyond physical branding, Coinbase plans digital activations across both teams’ social media platforms. This includes interactive games and contests designed to educate Canadian audiences about cryptocurrency. The company is also developing immersive fan experiences such as promotional nights and in-game activations. This Canadian sports initiative aligns with Coinbase’s broader athletic partnerships, which include relationships with the NBA, Aston Martin Aramco Formula One racing, and esports partnerships with Riot Games. The Toronto-focused partnerships are the latest steps in what Coinbase describes as bringing sports on-chain while connecting with established Canadian institutions. Financial implications of data breach still on the horizon Coinbase’s move into Canada comes on the heels of the exchange being in serious financial and reputational peril following a massive data breach that began in late December 2024 and was announced in May 2025. The breach exposed sensitive financial information and personal information of nearly 70,000 customers. This includes phone numbers, addresses, email, and masked Social Security numbers. The stolen data also included masked banking account numbers, government identification photos such as driver’s licenses and passports, account balances, and transaction records. Coinbase declined to pay the requested $20 million ransom to the attackers. Instead, it offered a $20 million reward for information pointing towards the arrest and conviction of the attackers. The firm is also working with law enforcement officials, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, who have begun an investigation into the hack. Coinbase has committed to refunding those customers who were tricked into sending money to attackers as a direct result of the hack.

But in the past few weeks, things have slowed down for Strategy. Why is this happening? Is Strategy starting to lose money? Let’s dive in. Recent Purchases Show a Slower Pace According to K33’s Vetle Lunde, Strategy’s recent purchases are smaller than before. Between May 19 and May 25, the company bought 4,020 bitcoins for about $427 million. They used money from selling new MSTR shares but raised only $348.7 million this time, much less than the $705.7 million they raised the week before. Just a few months ago, they were raising over $2 billion each week to buy Bitcoin! Why Is Strategy Slowing Down? This slowdown has a few reasons. First, the price gap between MSTR’s stock and the actual value of its bitcoin holdings has gotten smaller. That means investors aren’t paying as much extra for MSTR shares anymore, making it harder for the company to raise big sums of money. Second, more companies are now jumping into the Bitcoin game. Over 70 firms, including big names like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, have started using their treasuries to hold Bitcoin. Just this week, Trump Media and Technology Group also announced it’s holding Bitcoin in its treasury, backed by $2.5 billion from investors. All this new competition is giving people more choices, so MSTR doesn’t have the same edge it once did. Strategy Still Holds a Big Bitcoin Pile Even with the slowdown, Strategy still holds an impressive 580,250 BTC, worth over $63 billion at today’s prices. That’s about 2.75% of all Bitcoin out there! Meanwhile, on May 22, the company shared that it plans to sell its 10% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock for just $0.001 per share. This new sales agreement is expected to bring in a total of $2.1 billion over time through its ATM program. However, the company has recorded a massive $15 billion profit as Bitcoin reaches its highest price ever.

Tom Lee Says the “Banana Zone” Is Coming,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-150k-tom-lee-says-the-banana-zone-is-coming/,"The post Bitcoin to $150K? Tom Lee Says the “Banana Zone” Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is trading near $108,914.72 ( check live ), and the excitement is building. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has made a bold prediction – he believes Bitcoin is heading toward $150,000 in this market cycle. Lee says Bitcoin is about to enter a “banana zone” – a phase of rapid price growth that could reshape the crypto market in 2025. So, what’s behind this bold forecast? Let’s break it down. What Is the “Banana Zone”? Lee’s outlook is based on an analysis shared by Julien Bittel , head of macro research at Global Macro Investor. Bittel’s chart tracks four major Bitcoin market cycles since 2011. Each cycle included two correction phases before entering a fast-growth period – what they call the “banana zone.” According to the chart, the current cycle began in 2022 and is now going through its first correction. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for a major rally. This theory is already gaining traction. On May 22, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 after the U.S. and China agreed to a 30-day trade war truce. Although the price later dropped to $78,000 due to institutional sell-offs, Lee sees that as part of the natural cycle and a setup for bigger gains ahead. Tom Lee’s Bold Forecast: $150K Is in Sight Speaking to CNBC earlier this year, Lee said he expects Bitcoin to pull back to $50,000–$60,000 before continuing its climb. He believes BTC could hit $150,000 in this market cycle. He also thinks Bitcoin could eventually rival gold as a top store of value, especially with growing interest from institutions. Adding more fuel to the fire, analyst Nick Hellmann recently predicted that Bitcoin could break $244,00, reminding his followers that he previously called the $100K mark correctly. Michael Saylor Embraces Bitcoin for Everyday Use At the Bitcoin 2025 conference, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor made waves again. He met with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who handed him the new Gemini Bitcoin Credit Card. Saylor posted a photo of the moment on X, captioned: “Bitcoin is money. Everything else is credit.” The credit card offers Bitcoin rewards on fiat purchases, aiming to make BTC part of everyday spending. Tyler Winklevoss even mentioned that the card includes a “ whale limit ” – a nod to MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings Crypto’s Next Chapter: Are We There Yet? From bullish predictions to new tools for BTC adoption, momentum is building fast. With growing institutional interest, a more supportive U.S. government, and signs of a broader trend shift, Bitcoin could be heading into one of its biggest years yet. If the “banana zone” theory plays out, BTC may not just hit $150K – it could change the way we think about money in 2025.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 13:48:01

GameStop officially confirms first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment , acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account. The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin ( BTC ) or when the purchases were made in the announcement , while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing. The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March. At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. Source: GameStop The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies . Rep. Steil wants restraint on crypto bill additions Republican Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph on May 27 that he wants lawmakers to stop adding what he considers are non-relevant clauses into two key crypto bills, claiming that doing so is slowing the implementation of a regulatory framework for the industry. “Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Stable Coin and Market Structure legislation will unlock the golden age of digital assets. pic.twitter.com/lSbX5p2Wqt — Bryan Steil (@RepBryanSteil) May 27, 2025 “We have to restrain ourselves from that instinct and attempt by our colleagues — both sides of the aisle,” he added. Crypto backers in Congress hope to pass stablecoin and market structure bills before a month-long August recess, which was hampered by Democrats who pulled support for the stablecoin bill earlier in May over concerns about President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Steil argued the concerns related to Trump aren’t relevant to the bills, and the “text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market.” Trump Media Group reverses stance, confirms $2.5 billion Bitcoin capital raise Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company that owns US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and is partially owned by the president, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after denying earlier reports of the deal. According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said: “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions."" TMTG spokespeople responded to the initial report from the Financial Times, published a day before the announcement, with derision. “Apparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” TMTG representatives told the FT on May 26.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-28 13:48:45

The company announced the issuance of $50 million in zero-interest bonds. With this funding, the company plans to increase its Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. Metaplanet Issues $50 Million in Bonds to Increase Bitcoin Purchases This bond issuance is Metaplanet's 16th bond sale to date, according to the company's announcement in Japan on May 28, 2025. The bonds were all purchased by Cayman Islands-based investment firm Evo Fund, which has participated in Metaplanet’s previous bond sales and is one of the main institutional partners supporting the company’s long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Following the bond issuance news, Metaplanet shares rose by 9.5% on the Japanese stock exchange. According to Yahoo Finance data, this increase reflects the company’s confidence in its BTC-focused strategy among investors. Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin since April 2024 and aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Last week, the company announced that it had purchased an additional 1,004 BTC for approximately $104 million. With this latest purchase, the firm’s total BTC holdings reached 7,800. Metaplanet’s new funding move comes as Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs. Last week, BTC rose to $111,889 on exchanges like Coinbase. At press time, BTC was trading sideways at $108,870. In the crypto markets, Metaplanet is often compared to US software company MicroStrategy for its aggressive BTC investment model. The company is the public company holding the most BTC in Asia and ranks 11th globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. *This is not investment advice.

A recent development in Southeast Asia highlights this risk, as authorities in Vietnam have taken significant action against a massive crypto scam . This case involves the arrest of individuals linked to a fraudulent operation known as Matrix Chain, which allegedly swindled hundreds of millions from thousands of people. What Happened with the Matrix Chain Scam? Vietnamese police recently announced the arrest of five suspects believed to be key players behind the Matrix Chain scam . This operation is accused of running a sophisticated pyramid scheme that targeted a vast number of individuals. The scale of the alleged fraud is staggering: Number of Victims: More than 185,000 investors were reportedly defrauded. Amount Lost: The total estimated loss is a massive 394.2 million USDT (Tether), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Location: The arrests and the operation were centered in Vietnam, underscoring the growing challenges of regulating digital assets in the region. The suspects allegedly lured victims with enticing promises of high returns, a common tactic in such schemes. They leveraged a multi-level marketing (MLM) structure, where participants were encouraged to recruit new members to earn commissions, perpetuating the fraudulent cycle. Investors were sold tokens associated with the Matrix Chain project, which have turned out to be essentially worthless. How Did This Pyramid Scheme Operate? Understanding how a pyramid scheme like Matrix Chain works is crucial to recognizing and avoiding similar traps. Here’s a breakdown of the typical mechanics: At its core, a pyramid scheme doesn’t rely on a legitimate business or product generating revenue. Instead, it depends on money from new recruits to pay off earlier investors. The Matrix Chain operation reportedly followed this classic model, adapted for the crypto space: False Promises: Potential investors were promised unrealistically high and consistent returns on their investment, often with little to no risk described. Worthless Asset: Participants were required to buy the scheme’s native token (the ‘worthless tokens’ mentioned), which had no real value or utility outside the scheme itself. Its price was artificially inflated by the inflow of new money. MLM Recruitment: The crucial element was the multi-level marketing component. Investors were incentivized to recruit friends, family, and acquaintances. A portion of the new recruits’ investment would go up the chain to those who recruited them, creating a pyramid structure. Collapse: Pyramid schemes are inherently unsustainable. They require an ever-increasing number of new investors. When recruitment slows down, the scheme can no longer pay existing members, leading to its inevitable collapse. Most participants, especially those at the lower levels, lose their entire investment. The use of cryptocurrency in this context adds layers of complexity, including cross-border transactions and the perceived legitimacy that digital assets can sometimes lend to fraudulent projects. Why Are Crypto Scams So Prevalent in Places Like Vietnam? The case of Matrix Chain in Vietnam crypto landscape is not isolated. Crypto-related fraud is a global issue, but certain factors can make some regions particularly vulnerable. Challenges include: High Adoption & Enthusiasm: Vietnam has shown significant interest in cryptocurrencies, leading to a large pool of potential investors, some of whom may be new to the space. Lack of Clear Regulation: While progress is being made, a comprehensive regulatory framework specifically for cryptocurrencies can sometimes lag behind adoption, creating loopholes for scammers. Technical Complexity: The technical nature of crypto can be intimidating, making it harder for average investors to perform thorough due diligence on projects. Information Asymmetry: Scammers often exploit a lack of accessible, reliable information about how legitimate crypto projects work versus fraudulent ones. Ease of Cross-Border Operations: Cryptocurrencies facilitate quick, pseudonymous transactions across borders, making it easier for scammers to operate and harder for law enforcement to track funds. The arrests in Vietnam demonstrate that authorities are actively working to combat these issues, but the challenge remains significant given the rapid evolution of the crypto space. Spotting the Red Flags: How to Avoid Crypto Scams Protecting yourself from falling victim to schemes like the Matrix Chain scam requires vigilance and education. Here are actionable insights on how to avoid crypto scams : Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If a project guarantees high returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and returns are never guaranteed. Research the Team: Who is behind the project? Are their identities public? Do they have relevant experience? Are they verifiable? Anonymous teams are a major red flag. Understand the Technology and Use Case: Can you clearly explain what the project does and why its token has value? If the explanation is vague or overly complex without clear purpose, be cautious. Check for a Working Product: Does the project have a live product, a testnet, or at least a detailed roadmap? Schemes often have only flashy marketing materials. Analyze the Whitepaper: A legitimate project will have a detailed whitepaper outlining its technology, goals, and tokenomics. Read it carefully and look for inconsistencies or poorly defined concepts. Beware of Pressure Tactics: Scammers often create urgency, telling you to invest immediately or miss out on a limited-time opportunity. Verify Registration and Compliance: Check if the project or the associated company is registered with relevant financial authorities in their operating jurisdictions. Look for Community Sentiment (with caution): While hype can be manipulated, a lack of genuine discussion or an overly positive, cult-like community can be suspicious. Look for critical analysis and questions being addressed. Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases: Legitimate projects will never ask for this information. Be Skeptical of MLM Structures: If your returns are primarily based on recruiting new investors rather than the performance of the underlying asset or business, it’s likely a pyramid scheme. Education is your best defense in the crypto market. Take the time to understand the basics before investing. The Impact on Victims and the Market The human cost of the Matrix Chain fraud is immense. Over 185,000 individuals, many likely ordinary people investing their savings, have suffered significant financial losses. Beyond the immediate victims, such large-scale frauds can: Erode Trust: They damage public trust in the legitimate cryptocurrency industry and blockchain technology. Attract Negative Attention: They draw scrutiny from regulators and governments, potentially leading to stricter rules that could impact legitimate innovation. Cause Market Volatility: While the amount lost in this specific scam might not drastically impact the global crypto market cap, the sentiment fallout from major fraud cases can contribute to negative market cycles. The successful police action in Vietnam, while bringing some justice, highlights the ongoing battle against illicit activities in the digital asset space. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant in the Face of Crypto Scams The arrests linked to the $394M Matrix Chain crypto scam in Vietnam serve as a stark reminder of the risks present in the digital asset world. While innovation continues to drive the industry forward, the threat of fraudulent schemes, particularly those masquerading as legitimate investment opportunities or leveraging pyramid scheme models, remains significant. The actions taken by Vietnamese authorities are a positive step towards protecting investors and cleaning up the Vietnam crypto market, but the responsibility also lies with individuals to perform thorough research and recognize the warning signs. By understanding the tactics used by scammers, conducting due diligence, and being skeptical of promises that sound too good to be true, you can significantly reduce your risk and better avoid crypto scams .

Mid-Term Outlook (June 5 – June 14): If $3.00 breaks with volume, next resistance is $3.50 . Beyond that, $3.87–$4.00 becomes the macro breakout target.

Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost. Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made. Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy , which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Moreover, on the regulatory front, the return of a US President Donald Trump administration signals a friendlier stance toward crypto, with talk of rolling back SEC overreach and possibly supporting US-based mining . Across the Atlantic, the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation has gone into effect in the EU, offering clearer guidelines and reducing regulatory uncertainty for retail investors and miners alike. Then there's the price. Bitcoin finally broke the long-anticipated $100,000 resistance level in early 2025, following a post-halving supply shock and increased ETF-driven demand. As institutions pour in and supply tightens, more individuals are re-evaluating how to get involved. Whatever your motivation, one thing’s certain: You want to mine from the comfort of your home. This article will explain four realistic ways to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025, what gear you’ll need, how much it might cost, and what kind of returns you can expect. Did you know? Bitcoin mining has developed into a sizable industry, with revenues growing by over 6,700% from 2021 to 2025. Option 1: Lottery mining – Low power, high risk, rare rewards If you’re working with a limited budget but still want to try Bitcoin mining, lottery mining offers an interesting — if highly unpredictable — way. In July 2024, a solo miner using just three TH/s of hash power — roughly what you’d get from two small USB devices — successfully mined an entire Bitcoin block. The reward was 3.192 BTC, worth over $200,000 at the time. Statistically, that kind of result should take thousands of years. But with some luck and help from the Solo CKPool platform, it actually happened. These wins are extremely rare, but they do happen. And that’s what keeps some people interested. Most lottery miners use small, low-power devices like the Bitaxe HEX, an open-source miner built with actual Antminer chips. It runs at around three TH/s, costs about $600 and pairs easily with a Raspberry Pi. Another popular option is the GekkoScience R909, a USB miner running at 1.5 TH/s and a favorite among hobbyists. These devices aren’t built for steady income. They’re closer to digital slot machines, but ones that still contribute to securing the Bitcoin network . So why do people do it? Three main reasons: Running an independent node supports the health and resilience of the Bitcoin network. It’s a good way to get familiar with how mining works . A single successful block can be worth a lot, and it’s all yours if it happens. For most, it’s not about making money. It’s about the challenge and the curiosity, like building a custom PC or restoring a vintage radio. And yes, it also looks great plugged in on a shelf, blinking quietly under a glowing Bitcoin lamp. Next up: ASICs, the heavy-duty hardware of serious miners. Did you know? Solo CKPool is designed for independent miners who want to submit their shares directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional mining pools, if you’re successful here, the entire reward goes to you (minus a small pool fee). There’s no revenue sharing, no splitting blocks. Option 2: ASIC mining – Solo mining with real hardware If lottery mining is like buying a single ticket and hoping for a lucky break, solo mining with an ASIC is showing up with a small stack. Your chances improve, but it’s still a long shot. ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — are purpose-built for Bitcoin mining. In 2025, high-end models like the Antminer S21 Hydro deliver impressive performances, reaching around 400 terahashes per second with improved energy efficiency over previous generations. Let’s look at the numbers. The Bitcoin network currently runs at around 500 exahashes per second. With one S21 Hydro, you’d control roughly 0.00008% of the total hashrate . That gives you odds of about one in 8.6 billion of finding a block on any given day. It's still extremely unlikely, but it's far better than what you’d get with low-power USB miners. To meaningfully improve your chances, you’d need to scale up. Running 20 ASICs could put you past eight petahashes per second, enough, in theory, to find a block about once a year. But that setup requires significant capital, proper ventilation or immersion cooling and a reliable energy supply. Even then, outcomes are unpredictable. The Bitcoin network might find several blocks in an hour or none at all. Still, some miners go this route. The appeal is simple: If you do find a block on your own, you keep the entire reward , currently over three BTC, plus transaction fees . There is no need to split the payout with anyone else. But for most people, even those with top-tier ASICs, solo mining remains a high-risk approach with uncertain rewards. Did you know? The cost of the latest mining equipment has significantly decreased, with prices around $16 per terahash in 2025, compared to $80 per terahash in 2022, enhancing mining efficiency. That’s why many home miners eventually turn to a more consistent and scalable model: Joining a mining pool. Option 3: Pool mining – Strength in numbers If solo mining is a long shot, pool mining is the practical alternative. It’s how most home miners approach Bitcoin mining in 2025 – and with good reason. By joining a mining pool , you combine your hashrate with thousands of other participants. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is split based on each miner’s contribution. You’re no longer chasing a rare solo win, but earning smaller, steady payouts. It’s more predictable, less risky and not so dependent on luck. For example, if you’re running an Antminer S21 Hydro at 400 TH/s, that hash power earns you a proportional share of the pool’s rewards. You’ll likely see consistent daily income tied directly to your contribution. The largest pools today — Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool — handle thousands of blocks every month. Many offer FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) models, where you’re paid for every valid share you submit, regardless of whether a block is found that day. Others use PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), which only pays out when a block is discovered, but can result in slightly higher returns over time. The choice depends on how much payout fluctuation you're comfortable with. Setting things up is straightforward: Create an account with your chosen pool. Point your ASIC miner to the pool’s server. Add your Bitcoin payout address. Monitor your stats from the pool’s web dashboard. The returns won’t be massive, but they’ll be consistent, and for many miners, that’s exactly the goal. But what if you want to skip the hardware, the setup and the electricity costs altogether? What if you want exposure to mining without running a machine? That’s where cloud mining comes in. Option 4: Cloud mining – Mining without the machines Cloud mining lets you rent hash power from a remote provider, who runs the hardware on your behalf. You don’t have to manage equipment, deal with heat or noise, or worry about electricity costs. You simply buy a contract, and if all goes well, you will receive a portion of the mining rewards. On paper, it sounds straightforward. You select a provider, choose how much hash power you want to rent, and pay either upfront or through a subscription. The provider takes care of the infrastructure, including maintenance and cooling. In return, you earn a share of the Bitcoin mined, proportional to your rented power. But there are trade-offs – and risks. Cloud mining has gained a mixed reputation. Over the years, the space has been flooded with questionable operators, unrealistic return promises and outright scams. Many contracts turn out to be unprofitable once you factor in service fees, maintenance costs and the increasing difficulty of mining . You're effectively trusting a third party to operate machines you'll never see. That said, there are a few reputable providers. Platforms like NiceHash, BitDeer and ECOS have remained active in the space and offer flexible, transparent options. Some let you choose specific coins or pools. Still, even with these more established names, margins tend to be very thin, especially during bear markets or when global hashrates spike. Cloud mining may be worth considering if: You have limited access to cheap electricity or space for equipment. You’re looking for a low-effort way to get exposure to mining. You view it more as a speculative bet than a reliable income stream. However, if your goal is consistent returns or hands-on experience, then running your own gear or just buying and holding Bitcoin is likely a better use of resources. The bottom line There’s no single right way to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025. It comes down to what you’re after. Lottery mining is fun and cheap, but the odds are long. Going solo with an ASIC gives you full control and full risk. Mining pools are the go-to for steady, reliable payouts. Cloud mining offers convenience but not much certainty. If you're in it for the learning, the experience, or to slowly stack sats over time, there’s a setup that’ll fit. Just know what you’re getting into and why you’re doing it.",Mine bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-28 14:00:00

Experts weigh DOGE’s near-term ceiling against YETIO’s play-to-earn roadmap, deflationary tokenomics, and a headline 5,000% upside projection by Q4. Dogecoin’s Stalling Momentum As of 28 May 2025, at the first minute, Dogecoin (DOGE) changed hands at $0.2285 , about 27% higher than it opened the month, yet still pinned under the stubborn $0.25 barrier. Finance Magnates maps three near-term targets—$0.40, $0.45 and $0.61—while MiTrade notes a whale that just added 38 million DOGE is eyeing $0.65. Chain data reinforce the mood: new addresses jumped 102% and active wallets 111% this week. Still, even a tripling for Dogecoin price to $0.61 falls far short of the 50x wins meme-coin hunters crave. Why DOGE Money Is Drifting Toward YETIO? That appetite for higher beta now funnels into Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Stage 4 of its five-step presale prices tokens at $0.041. The live dashboard shows 245,089,720 YETIO sold, raising roughly $4.32 million, and a steeper price increase is confirmed for the final stage. Stage 1 buyers are already up more than 240% (theoretically)—one reason DOGE capital is rotating into the presale’s programmed mark-ups. Tokenomics Forged for Scarcity The supply is hard-capped at 1 billion tokens. Half is allocated to presale; 15% funds play-to-earn (P2E) rewards, another 15% fuels user incentives, 5% seeds liquidity, and the remainder splits between team, advisers and scheduled burns. Project documents also mention SOLIDProof-led smart contract and liquidity-pool audits and a buy-back-and-burn on every in-game marketplace trade—recurring deflation once gameplay begins. Play-to-Earn Utility: YetiGo Kart Racer Utility, not just memes, underpins the pitch. The studio is building Yeti Go, an Unreal Engine 5 combat-kart racer where YETIO is fuel, entry ticket and prize. Players stake tokens for “expedition passes,” earn upgrade kits in elimination races and mint limited-edition kart skins that pay resale royalties. Closed-alpha testing is live, and a public beta is pencilled in for Q3 2025, giving holders a tangible catalyst months before year-end. Early footage available on the official site as well as YouTube shows 60-fps play and cross-platform leagues, where rare-skin owners can vote on new tracks—an Illuvium-style governance hook. Yeti Go isn’t just a game, it’s a full-blown sensory thrill ride. Developed alongside the powerhouse studio responsible for genre-defining titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it brings blockbuster polish to every pixel. But what really sets it apart? The sound. Crafted by audio legends who’ve collaborated with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, the soundtrack injects emotion and adrenaline straight into your gameplay. $100k Giveaway Ignites FOMO Marketing keeps the fire hot. Yeti Ouro’s $100,000 raffle will award $20,000 in YETIO to five winners, and a 25% purchase bonus kicks in for buys above $500. Telegram and X influencers with multi-million followings are amplifying the offer, driving daily presale inflows. Mapping the 5,000% Scenario Could YETIO really print a 5,000% move by Q4? From today’s $0.041 base, the maths points to about $2.05. That still values the project at just under $2 billion fully diluted—smaller than Axie Infinity’s 2021 peak and barely six per cent of DOGE’s present cap. Burns are expected to leave roughly 500 million tokens circulating, so every $1 million in net daily demand could, on paper, push the price two per cent. Sequential triggers—the Stage 5 markup, Yeti Go’s beta launch, the first centralized exchange listing, and the raffle draw—could stack into a single four-month window. Miss those dates, though, and the curve flattens fast; 50× dreams require flawless execution. Game Plan for DOGE Loyalists For long-time DOGE believers chasing bigger multiples, a measured rotation helps. Shifting 5–10% of a DOGE stack into YETIO captures asymmetric upside while capping risk if the game slips. One template: claim presale tokens at launch, stake half for in-game yields, keep the rest liquid for the exchange pop, run a stop on DOGE below $0.20 and funnel any break-above-$0.30 profits into YETIO. The mix preserves exposure to the brand that started meme finance while giving holders a credible shot at that eye-catching 50x headline.

The target of this action is Allan Guo, a former executive of the now-defunct crypto exchange, ACX. This development highlights the increasing scrutiny faced by individuals involved in the management of digital asset platforms, particularly following instances of platform failure or collapse. The core of ASIC’s case revolves around allegations of serious breaches of duties during the challenging period leading up to ACX’s demise in 2019. What are the Allegations Against Allan Guo? ASIC’s lawsuit against Allan Guo lays out a series of accusations painting a picture of alleged mismanagement and a failure to uphold the standards expected of an executive. These allegations strike at the heart of corporate governance and the responsibility owed to users of a financial platform, even one operating in the then-nascent crypto space. According to reports, ASIC claims Guo: Mismanaged customer funds: This is a critical allegation in the world of finance, suggesting funds entrusted by users were not handled appropriately or kept separate from operational funds. Misrepresented transactions: This implies a lack of transparency or potentially misleading communication regarding the nature or status of transactions occurring on the ACX platform. Failed to keep proper records: Maintaining accurate and comprehensive records is fundamental for any financial operation, crucial for transparency, audits, and regulatory compliance. A failure here suggests a significant lapse in operational control and oversight. These points collectively form the basis of ASIC’s claim that Guo breached his duties as an executive during a period when the exchange was clearly facing significant difficulties, ultimately leading to its collapse. The focus is on his conduct and decisions during this critical time. Understanding the Context: The ACX Collapse The lawsuit against Allan Guo is directly linked to the events surrounding the collapse of the ACX crypto exchange in 2019. At the time, ACX was one of the notable cryptocurrency trading platforms operating in Australia. Its failure left many users unable to access their funds and created uncertainty within the local crypto community. The collapse of a crypto exchange is a stark reminder of the risks involved in this space, particularly concerning the security and accessibility of user assets held by third-party platforms. Regulatory bodies like ASIC often step in to investigate such failures to understand what went wrong and whether any laws or duties were breached by those in charge. This particular crypto exchange lawsuit underscores the long reach of regulators, even years after an event occurs, especially when customer funds are impacted. Why is This Important for Australia Crypto Regulation? This legal action by ASIC against a former ACX executive is highly significant for the evolving landscape of Australia crypto regulation . It sends a clear message that regulators are willing and able to pursue individuals for alleged misconduct within the crypto sector, even under existing corporate laws that may not have been specifically designed for digital assets. For a long time, the crypto space was often perceived as being outside the direct purview of traditional financial regulation. However, cases like this demonstrate a clear intent by bodies like ASIC to apply existing legal frameworks where applicable, focusing on fundamental principles of corporate duty, fund management, and transparency. This lawsuit serves as a precedent and a warning. It highlights that executives and operators of crypto platforms in Australia cannot operate without accountability. It reinforces the idea that managing customer funds and maintaining proper operational standards are not optional, regardless of the asset class being dealt with. As Australia continues to develop its specific regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, actions like these by ASIC provide practical examples of how existing laws are being applied and interpreted in the digital asset context. What are the Implications for the Industry? The proceedings against Allan Guo have several potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency industry, both in Australia and potentially internationally: Increased Executive Accountability: This case emphasizes that individuals in leadership positions at crypto companies can be held personally liable for their actions or inactions, particularly when those actions lead to significant harm, such as the loss of customer funds. Focus on Corporate Governance: The allegations highlight the critical importance of robust corporate governance, proper record-keeping, and transparent financial practices within crypto exchanges and related businesses. Regulatory Scrutiny: The lawsuit signals continued and potentially increasing regulatory scrutiny on crypto platforms. Exchanges operating in Australia should view this as a clear indicator that compliance and consumer protection are high priorities for ASIC. User Confidence: While the lawsuit relates to a past event, the fact that regulatory action is being taken can, in the long run, help build greater confidence among potential users by demonstrating that there are mechanisms for accountability when things go wrong. Legal Precedent: The outcome of this case could potentially set legal precedents for how executive duties and corporate laws apply to cryptocurrency businesses in Australia. For anyone involved in the Australian crypto market, whether as an operator or a user, this case is a crucial development to follow. It underscores the maturation of the market, where the focus is shifting from just technological innovation to also include robust regulatory compliance and corporate responsibility. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Operators For users, this case reinforces the importance of doing thorough due diligence before choosing a crypto exchange. Consider factors like: The regulatory environment the exchange operates within. The exchange’s history and track record. Their stated policies on fund security and segregation. The transparency of their operations. For operators and executives within the crypto space, the message is clear: prioritize compliance, maintain meticulous records, ensure transparent handling of customer funds, and understand your legal duties. Proactive measures to strengthen corporate governance are essential in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Concluding Thoughts ASIC’s civil penalty proceedings against former ACX executive Allan Guo mark a significant moment in the ongoing story of crypto regulation in Australia. By pursuing allegations of mismanagement and breach of duties related to the 2019 collapse of the ACX exchange, ASIC is clearly demonstrating its intent to hold individuals accountable for their conduct within the digital asset sector. This crypto exchange lawsuit serves as a potent reminder that operating in the crypto space does not exempt businesses or their leadership from fundamental corporate responsibilities and the watchful eye of financial regulators. As the industry continues to grow and integrate with the traditional financial system, expect to see continued efforts by regulators worldwide to ensure compliance, protect consumers, and establish clear lines of accountability.

The proposal comes after the presentation of a roadmap in Brussels meant to steer the European Union away from Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports in the coming years. Natural gas should power crypto mining in the Far East, minister says Natural gas, of which Russia has surplus quantities since it started losing European markets, can be utilized to power cryptocurrency mining operations, according to Aleksey Chekunkov, head of Russia’s Ministry for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic. Quoted by the Tass news agency, Chekunkov insisted mining farms should not tap into the electricity distributed to businesses and households. Speaking to reporters in the city of Khabarovsk, administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District, the minister elaborated: “You can mine using your own resources, using gas. We have a lot of gas that we used to sell to Europe. Now it’s in the ground. Please, install power plants and mine.” The expanding crypto mining industry, which Moscow legalized and regulated last year, has been blamed for energy shortages in a number of Russian regions, including Russia’s “ mining capital ,” Irkutsk Oblast. A ban on mining in parts of the country, which began as a seasonal measure during the cold winter months, has grown into a permanent prohibition in about a dozen territories, including the Russian republics in the Caucasus and the occupied lands of Ukraine. On June 4, a government commission will consider proposals to introduce a year-round mining ban in another five regions facing power deficits – Transbaikal, Buryatia, northern Karelia, the Penza region, and parts of Khakassia. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Minister of Energy Evgeny Grabchak revealed last week that the federal government may ask crypto miners to move to the north of the country. The idea is to utilize currently idle generation capacities and transmission infrastructure, including at depleted oil fields. Europe speeds up plan to end dependence on Russian energy The proposal to power Bitcoin mining farms with excess natural gas in Russia comes after the recent adoption of a roadmap in Brussels to completely eliminate the EU’s dependency on Russian energy within a couple of years. The document was presented on May 6, around the third anniversary of the approval of a plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels. The latter was published just two weeks after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022. War-related sanctions have led to a significant reduction in energy imports from the Russian Federation over the course of the past three years, Euronews noted in a report this week. The broadcaster detailed: “Oil fell from 27% in 2022 to 3% in 2025, gas fell from 45% to 19% in the same period and coal, which at the time accounted for 50% of EU consumption, stopped entering the EU altogether.” However, the European Commission admitted that “despite the significant progress achieved under the REPowerEU plan , and via 16 sanction packages introduced since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU saw a rebound in Russian gas imports in 2024.” Its new REPowerEU roadmap now pushes for a “coordinated, secure and gradual phase out of Russian gas, oil and nuclear energy imports.” It sets a clear target – to end Russian gas imports to the European Union by 2027 and requires member states to submit national plans to reach the goal. Last year, 10 EU countries imported 52 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas, three bought 13 million tonnes of oil and seven member states acquired 2,800 tonnes of enriched uranium and nuclear fuel, the Commission’s stats show. Russian energy exports to the EU returned €23 billion to Moscow in 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ripple ( XRP ) coin dropped to 0.000021 against Bitcoin ( BTC ), down by 37% from its highest point this year. XRP has lagged behind Bitcoin, which has surged to a record high, bolstered by strong fundamentals. Demand for Bitcoin continues rising, with spot ETFs recording inflows for the past seven consecutive weeks. They have now accumulated $44.91 billion in inflows, bringing total assets to $132 billion. Companies are also continuing to buy Bitcoin. Strategy now holds over 580,250 BTC, while GameStop just bought 4,710 BTC . Trump Media is raising $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. Other firms accumulating BTC include Semler Scientific and the Blockchain Group. You might also like: Ethereum price stalls as whales sell $530M coins: can it surge to $4,000? XRP, however, has also experienced notable catalysts this year. The most significant was the resolution of the SEC vs Ripple case , which removed one of the network’s biggest hurdles since 2020. The end of the lawsuit enables Ripple Labs to enter into more agreements with U.S. companies as it continues its push to compete with Swift. In a recent statement, CEO Brad Gariinghouse said the company made more deals in the six weeks following the ruling than in the prior six months. Ripple Labs also acquired Hidden Road in a deal that positions it as one of the largest prime brokers. It hopes to move the $10 billion that Hidden Road handles daily onto the XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, the Ripple USD stablecoin is slowly gaining market share, with its market cap rising to nearly $310 million. Ripple Labs aims for the stablecoin to become a major player in the payments space. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows the XRP/BTC pair topped at 0.00003410 before falling to 0.000021, its lowest level since February. The pair has formed a rounded top, a common bearish continuation pattern. XRP is also nearing the formation of a death cross, as the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages approach a crossover. The weighted moving averages have already completed the death cross, a bearish signal that could lead to further downside. Additionally, XRP is nearing the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.

The integration brings tokenized funds like Apollo’s ACRED and BlackRock’s BUIDL onto Solana’s ( SOL ) high-speed network through a partnership with Securitize and Wormhole Queries. This move marks a shift from simple asset tokenization to full composability, enabling these RWAs to be used in lending protocols, vaults, and other DeFi applications. The first application, Drift Institutional, is expected to integrate RedStone’s ( RED ) feeds, setting the stage for broader institutional access to Solana-native DeFi. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak, in a note to crypto.news. Securitize, which collaborates with asset managers including BlackRock and Apollo, has over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. Its head of credit and DeFi, Reid Simon, called the integration a step toward seamless TradFi-DeFi interoperability.

With RedStone’s oracles now feeding secure, attested data from Wormhole Queries, developers can begin building DeFi products tied to off-chain assets with stable yields. The move follows RedStone’s earlier RWA integration on Polygon with Morpho, where an ACRED-backed vault went live. The Solana rollout could accelerate similar launches, expanding access from institutional desks to retail users. The integration is also seen as a case study for how oracle networks and tokenization standards can make RWAs more than a narrative — enabling real, yield-driven use cases in DeFi.

After a significant run-up, the Bitcoin price is now consolidating, hovering above the psychological $100,000 mark. This period of sideways movement often precedes a larger move, making it a critical time for investors and traders to understand the underlying dynamics. Understanding the Current BTC Price Action Consolidation is a market phase where the asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure. For BTC price , this period above $100,000 suggests that despite reaching a major milestone, the market is taking a breath, digesting recent gains, and perhaps accumulating energy for the next directional move. This is a stark contrast to rapid parabolic rises or sharp corrections, pointing towards a more mature market structure developing around these higher price levels. Several factors contribute to this consolidation: Profit-Taking: Some investors who bought at lower prices are likely taking profits. New Entrants: Buyers are stepping in at the $100,000+ level, seeing it as a potential new floor. Market Uncertainty: Global macroeconomic factors and regulatory news can cause hesitation. Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) often play a significant role during consolidation phases, either accumulating or distributing. Observing how long this consolidation phase lasts and the volume associated with it can offer clues about the market’s conviction for the next move. Identifying Key Bitcoin Support Levels In any market, identifying reliable support levels is crucial for understanding where price declines might pause or reverse. According to analysis highlighted by Cointelegraph and insights from analysts like Keith Alan, a significant Bitcoin support level is potentially forming around the $94,000 area. This level isn’t arbitrary; it aligns closely with a key technical indicator: the 21-week moving average. The 21-week moving average is often watched by long-term investors and traders as it can represent a dynamic support or resistance line over medium-term trends. A retest of this level, should a correction occur from the current consolidation range, would be a key test for the bullish structure. Holding this level would reinforce its significance as a strong floor, potentially providing a springboard for future price appreciation. Why is $94,000 important? Alignment with 21-Week MA: This technical indicator is a widely followed benchmark for trend health. Previous Price Action: Often, round numbers or previous resistance levels can turn into support. Psychological Importance: While not a round number like $100K, $94K represents a notable dip that might attract buyers looking for a discount. While $94,000 is a prominent level, traders should also be aware of potential minor support zones within the current consolidation range, which could offer temporary bounces even if the price heads towards the 21-week MA. Navigating Bitcoin Resistance Levels Just as support levels indicate potential floors, resistance levels highlight areas where selling pressure is expected to be strong, potentially capping upward price movement. For the current market structure, the analysis points to the $112,000 level as holding the highest concentration of selling pressure. This means that as the Bitcoin price approaches this mark, a significant number of market participants are likely placing sell orders, either to take profits or enter short positions. Breaking through a strong resistance level like $112,000 typically requires substantial buying volume and market conviction. A failed attempt to break resistance can lead to a price pullback, potentially back towards the consolidation range or even towards the identified support levels. Key Resistance Points: $112,000: Identified as a major hurdle due to high selling pressure. Above $112,000: Subsequent resistance could be found at historical highs or based on Fibonacci extension levels. Psychological Levels: Round numbers above $112K (e.g., $120K, $125K) can also act as minor resistance. Successfully clearing the $112,000 resistance would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a move towards new all-time highs. The Influence of BTC Whales on Market Dynamics The actions of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’, have a disproportionate impact on the cryptocurrency market due to their sheer volume of assets. The observation that whales are increasing their holdings during this consolidation phase is a noteworthy point from the Cointelegraph report. This accumulation could be interpreted as a bullish sign, suggesting that these large players anticipate higher prices in the future and are using the current sideways movement to build their positions without causing significant price spikes. However, whale activity is a double-edged sword. While accumulation can signal confidence, whales can also quickly sell large portions of their holdings, leading to sharp price drops. Furthermore, leveraged trades by large entities, like those mentioned regarding James Wynn, can amplify market movements. High leverage means even small price changes can lead to liquidations, which can cascade and trigger larger volatility events. Understanding whale behavior is a key component of effective Bitcoin market analysis . On-chain data analysis tools often track the movements of wallets holding significant amounts of BTC, providing insights into whether these large players are primarily in accumulation or distribution mode. Actionable Insights from Bitcoin Market Analysis Given the current market structure and the factors at play, what are the actionable insights for those involved in the Bitcoin market? Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the $100,000 consolidation range, the $94,000 potential support, and the $112,000 resistance. Price action around these levels will be highly informative. Understand Consolidation: Recognize that consolidation can resolve in either direction. It’s a period of indecision before a potential breakout or breakdown. Consider Whale Activity: While not a guaranteed predictor, whale accumulation during consolidation can be a positive sign. However, remain cautious of potential volatility from large trades. Use Risk Management: Given the potential for sharp moves out of consolidation, employing strategies like stop-loss orders is crucial to protect capital. Stay Informed: Keep up with fundamental news, macroeconomic trends, and technical analysis updates that could influence the market. This period requires patience and careful observation rather than impulsive trading based on minor price fluctuations within the range. Challenges and Considerations Despite the potential for identifying clear support and resistance, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Unexpected news events, shifts in global sentiment, or large liquidation cascades triggered by leveraged positions can cause rapid deviations from expected price movements. Therefore, relying solely on technical levels without considering the broader market context and risk management principles is not advisable. Conclusion: What’s Next for Bitcoin? The current phase of consolidation above $100,000 is a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin price . The presence of significant potential support around $94,000, near the 21-week moving average, offers a key level to watch should a pullback occur. Conversely, the $112,000 level represents a major resistance hurdle that needs to be overcome for the uptrend to continue with conviction. The backdrop of whale accumulation adds an intriguing layer to the Bitcoin market analysis , potentially signaling underlying strength, but the risk of volatility from large players and leveraged positions remains. Ultimately, the resolution of this consolidation phase will likely dictate Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Whether it’s a bullish breakout above $112,000 or a retest of the crucial $94,000 support, staying informed and prepared for volatility is key in this exciting market.

Top XRP Experts Think So appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a world where symbols often speak louder than words, a recent post by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praising the “Skull of Satoshi” has sparked an unexpected reaction. While Ripple’s gesture of donating the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community seemed like a peace offering, analyst Ashley PROSPER saw something darker. Her response hints at a deeper concern around Bitcoin’s long-term security, government actions, and rising unease. A Symbol of Unity — Or a Sign of Trouble? In a recent tweet post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse talked about the famous Skull of Satoshi, a sculpture that started as a symbol of criticism toward Bitcoin’s energy usage. But over time, it has become a sign of Bitcoin’s endurance. Garlinghouse said that as blockchain technology matures, it’s time for different crypto communities — like BTC, XRP, and others — to work together.

Tariffs and geopolitical concerns remain top of investors’ minds, a scenario that has stocks looking to knit together another winning streak. Ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings release after the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 56 points higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26%. Stocks traded largely unchanged from Tuesday levels, as investor sentiment was influenced by trade dynamics, U.S. economic data, and the global geopolitical outlook. Adding to the caution is the market’s close attention to what the global chipmaker reveals in its upcoming earnings report. Wall Street is expected to use Nvidia’s results and guidance as a gauge for the current tariff landscape and to assess how Big Tech is preparing for potential economic impacts. If Nvidia delivers better-than-expected numbers, the broader market could respond with a sharp upside move.

Keep reading to see how Remittix (RTX), XRP, and Stellar (XLM) compare, and why the new token might be doing a better job than the rest. Source: XRP vs XLM on CoinMarketCap Remittix’s PayFi advances crypto-to-fiat payments worldwide Remittix (RTX) is new, but it’s doing something old players haven’t nailed. It lets people send crypto straight into traditional banks, with the receiver needing no wallet. The recipient gets fiat money, not tokens. RTX supports over 30 fiat currencies and more than 50 crypto pairs. It doesn’t charge foreign exchange fees. Small businesses can also use it to accept crypto payments online. They get fiat in their accounts without fuss. This system is called PayFi; basically, it’s short for payments through finance tools built on blockchain. The $RTX token can also be used for staking and voting. Staking earns rewards, but only if you hold at least $10,000. The $RTX token isn’t needed to make payments, which weakens its long-term price unless the team adds more reasons to keep it. As of now, Remittix has raised over $15.4 million in its presale. It is currently available at $0.0781, and is expected to hit exchanges around $0.085. If the platform keeps growing and adds more use for the token, some expect the price to reach $0.5 in a few years. XRP is popular, but legal risks and overhype may hold it back XRP makes headlines all the time. “XRP news” is everywhere, from court battles with the SEC to rumors of ETF approval. Ripple, the company behind XRP, keeps pushing for Wall Street attention. The idea is simple: let banks and institutions use XRP to move money across borders faster and cheaper. Source: Dark Defender on X Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, says XRP ETFs will help big investors join the game. Firms like Bitwise and Grayscale have applied for ETFs, but the SEC hasn’t approved any yet. Traders are watching October 2025 as the key month. Experts believe XRP could hit $5 soon if a few conditions are met. That includes ETF approval and strong technical support near $2.70, but this isn’t guaranteed. The price has already dropped from $2.65 due to a court ruling in May. If it breaks support at $2.26, it could fall toward $1.39. Another problem is that most XRP was bought during the last big rally. Glassnode data shows that over 70% of the realized market cap came from buyers at the peak. This means many people will panic and sell if prices drop. XLM has tech power, but struggles with attention and momentum Stellar’s XLM has strong tools. It processes transactions fast, supports asset tokenization, and is backed by IBM and MoneyGram . It focuses on regulation and compliance. But while that works for institutions, it’s not exciting for most everyday users. As of late May 2025, XLM trades at around $0.28. Analysts like Ali warn that dropping below $0.27 could send it down to $0.23, with volume and investor interest also dropping. Unlike XRP news’ common theme, XLM isn’t involved in big legal fights. But it faces another challenge in visibility. XRP has hype that Stellar lacks. It’s seen as XRP’s quieter cousin. XLM is growing slowly, with new smart contracts and partnerships raking in. Even with strong network features, XLM hasn’t pulled in many retail users or developers. Source: Master Kenobi on X Final thoughts: Remittix could be the better bet Both XRP and XLM have strong tech and past success. But they carry baggage: XRP has lawsuits and hype-driven investors, while XLM has good partners but weak retail interest. Remittix may not be as popular, but its PayFi tools give it a real-world edge. It works for people and businesses, making RTX the best PayFi token for investors.

The company revealed that the Starship reached space during the test flight but lost control. The company revealed that the Starship Flight 9 lost control because of a leak. Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched its ninth Starship Flight 9 on Tuesday from Starbase, Texas. The firm said the Starship rocket reached space but spun out of control. Elon Musk stated on X that the Starship flight lost control due to a leak that caused a pressure loss in the main tank. SpaceX says Starship initially performed well Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight! Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review. Launch cadence for… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 28, 2025 SpaceX said the Super Heavy booster for the flight made the first-ever re-flight in the company’s Starship program. The firm explained that the booster had been used on the seventh flight test at the beginning of this year. According to SpaceX, the Super Heavy booster managed to perform a full-duration ascent burn with all thirty-three of its Raptor engines and disengaged from the Starship’s upper stage. While separating, the booster conducted the first flip, followed by a boostback burn. The Elon Musk-led firm said the Super Heavy showed its ability to fly at a higher attack angle during its descent to Earth. The company explained that improving the amount of atmospheric drag on the flight vehicle and experiencing a higher angle of attack could lead to a slower descent pace. The firm added that the slower descent speed would require less propellant for the first landing burn. SpaceX stated that retrieving data on how the Super Heavy booster controlled its flight at that higher angle of attack would hugely contribute to better performance on future boosters. SpaceX stated that after a successful stage separation, the upper stage of the Starship lit its six Raptor Engines and conducted a full-duration ascent burn. The firm revealed that the engines used on the Starship had mitigations in place, which were learned from the eighth flight test in March. SpaceX mentioned that the key improvements executed on the engines included additional preload on joint keys and a brand-new nitrogen purging system. The company added that it also mitigated the propellant drain system on all the engines. Elon-led SpaceX reveals ninth flight errors The company said the payload bay door of the Starship failed to open, preventing the deployment of the planned Starlink simulator satellites. SpaceX confirmed that the flight experienced a subsequent attitude control error, which led to the bypassing of the engine relight. The firm added that the attitude control error also prevented the Starship from reaching its intended reentry position. SpaceX added that the Starship went through a saving process meant to vent the remaining pressure. The firm stated that venting the remaining pressure could have placed the Starship in the safest state for reentry. The Elon-led company revealed that it lost contact with the Starship after approximately 46 minutes into the ninth flight. The firm said the ninth flight test marked a great milestone for the firm. SpaceX added that it would be reviewing data from the ninth test flight. SpaceX also said that the ninth test flight would help it improve the reliability of its Starship. The firm said findings from the data review would be used to implement new improvements in the next Starship. The Elon-led firm revealed it had begun preparations for the next flight test. The company stated that it had learned lessons from the ninth flight test, which marked progress towards achieving Starship’s objective of ensuring life became multi-planetary. Elon Musk said the ninth flight improved greatly from the previous attempts. Musk added that the next three Starship test flights would be faster.

In a recent post on X, JackTheRippler shared a chart forecasting that XRP could surge dramatically, reaching between $28 and $30 by October 2025. His message was clear and emphatic: XRP is going to pump without any warning. This assertion has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and new entrants in the crypto space, reigniting debates about XRP’s long-term potential and its readiness to break free from years of regulatory headwinds and price stagnation. But what’s fueling this sudden wave of optimism, and how realistic is this bullish projection? #XRP IS GOING TO PUMP WITHOUT ANY WARNING! pic.twitter.com/Nd6UVBqYv9 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 28, 2025 Decoding the Bullish Sentiment Around XRP JackTheRippler’s forecast isn’t appearing in a vacuum. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP has been gradually building, especially with recent developments around the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. The legal clarity has enabled Ripple to ramp up its operations, focusing on regions with crypto-friendly regulatory frameworks. At the same time, institutional interest in Ripple’s payment solutions — particularly its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service — has been expanding across global corridors, including Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. These developments position XRP not just as a speculative asset but as a key player in the evolving global payments infrastructure. The Road to $28–$30: Can XRP Realistically Hit These Targets? JackTheRippler’s price target of $28–$30 is undeniably ambitious. At current valuations, such a surge would represent an astronomical increase, placing XRP’s market cap into territory usually reserved for the very top echelon of global assets. For context, XRP has historically hovered in the $0.50 to $1.50 range over the past few years, even during periods of heightened market activity. However, the crypto markets are no strangers to explosive, seemingly unpredictable rallies. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have repeatedly defied expectations, posting massive gains during bullish cycles that were once thought impossible. For XRP, several catalysts could propel it toward JackTheRippler’s bold target: the mass adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions, deeper institutional integration, increased regulatory clarity, and the possibility of major partnerships or even central bank digital currency (CBDC) collaborations built on the XRP Ledger. Importantly, the phrase “without warning” underscores the often volatile and sudden nature of crypto market movements. Although fundamentals are important, the crypto market has repeatedly demonstrated that sentiment, hype, and speculation can propel prices to astonishing heights, particularly when limited supply meets rapid demand growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Dynamics Within the XRP community, JackTheRippler’s prediction has sparked both excitement and caution. His supporters highlight his proven track record of accurate analysis, citing his technical charts that frequently identify crucial resistance and breakout points. Skeptics, however, caution that such dramatic targets should be taken with a grain of salt, emphasizing the importance of measured, long-term investment strategies over hype-fueled chasing. Regardless of where one stands, it’s clear that XRP is entering a phase of renewed attention. Investors are closely monitoring macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Ripple’s business moves, as these factors could impact XRP’s future performance. With Bitcoin’s next halving cycle already setting the stage for a broader crypto bull run, XRP could well be poised to ride the wave, potentially validating JackTheRippler’s bold claim that the pump will come swiftly and without warning. JackTheRippler’s latest bullish call on XRP has injected fresh energy into the market, with his prediction of a $28–$30 price target by October 2025 igniting both enthusiasm and debate. While such projections are certainly ambitious, they reflect the persistent belief among XRP advocates that the asset’s true potential has yet to be unlocked. As Ripple continues to expand its global reach and XRP gains further utility in cross-border payments, a sudden and dramatic price surge remains a possibility. Whether or not XRP hits JackTheRippler’s lofty target, one thing is certain: in the fast-moving world of crypto, transformative moments often arrive when least expected — and XRP investors are watching closely.

In a month when Bitcoin breaks ATHs, altcoins are mooning, and meme coins dominate social media feeds, investors are racing to find the next big cat—or snake. SNEK ($SNEK), SPX6900 ($SPX), Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE), and one roaring new contender are leading the pack for May 2025. But while the others wait for listings and influencers, one project has already raised over $150,000, hit Stage 6 of its presale, and no surprise—it’s a cat. The Best 1000x Cryptos are crawling out of their lairs and preparing for massive runs. With Troller Cat ($TCAT) already in motion and others gaining traction, there’s little time to play it safe. Each presale stage inches up the price, and the next jump this Friday means a 19.95% increase. Let’s break down the coins that are turning heads—and wallets—in May. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Troller Cat isn’t just a meme coin—a full-blown trolling movement. A chaotic feline force clawing through meme history, blockchain tech, and gaming utility to rewrite the rulebook on what a crypto presale should be. Launched on May 2, 2025, this Ethereum-based token is in Stage 6 of its 26-stage presale, priced at just $0.00001458. After growing 191.8% from Stage 1, it’s still early. With over 800 holders, $150,000+ raised, and a listing price of $0.0005309, the math speaks for itself. Buyers are looking at a 3541.29% ROI from this stage to listing if they get in now. A $25,000 investment? It could be worth over $900,000 if projections hold. That’s not just moon math—that’s early retirement math. Troller Cat’s Game Center, staking system with 69% APY, and meme-fueled brand make it more than hype. It’s building an entire trolling economy where players earn, holders stake, and pranksters become legends. Every stage of its presale is themed after an iconic troll—from the Trojan Horse to Rickrolling—creating an experience as entertaining as it is lucrative. The Deflationary Model Behind Troller Cat What separates this whiskered wonder from typical meme fluff is its deflationary engine. The Game Center generates real ad revenue, which is used to buy back and burn $TCAT from the market. So every video ad watched, every in-game placement seen, and every banner click doesn’t just power gameplay—it slashes supply. Each burned coin tightens the leash on availability, naturally pushing the price upward. No endless minting. No inflation trap. Just smart economics wrapped in chaos, tuned for longevity. Add locked liquidity for 2 years, a referral program offering 10% bonuses on $25+ contributions, and fully KYC/audit-approved tokenomics, and you’re looking at the Best 1000x Crypto of the year—paws down. 2. SNEK ($SNEK) SNEK slithered into the spotlight without a roar—but with enough stealth and bite to earn profound community respect. It avoided the influencer blitz and focused on organic growth, community memes, and slow-but-steady price movement. That patience paid off. SNEK is now one of the most talked-about meme tokens of Q2 2025. Why This Coin Made It to the List: SNEK is the sleeper. It doesn’t need celebrity tweets or elaborate staking. It has trust, stability, and a loyal cult following. If the Best 1000x Cryptos include surprise hits, SNEK deserves its place. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) SPX6900 is everything the name implies—wild, intense, and unapologetically meme-worthy. Born from gym culture, absurd gains, and a deep love for the 6,900-calorie bulk meme, SPX exploded onto the scene with high-octane branding and community memes built like Arnold in his prime. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Meme coins tied to a strong subculture—like gym bros and lifters—can gain traction fast. SPX6900 blends strength aesthetics with actual functionality, making it one of the Best 1000x Cryptos to watch this May. 4. Bone ShibaSwap ($BONE) Part of the greater Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone has been around—but its time may finally be arriving. As the Shibarium Layer 2 gains traction, Bone’s role as the gas token has renewed investor attention. It’s got utility, volume, and severe exchange exposure. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Bone isn’t new, but it’s newly powerful. As the ecosystem around it grows, Bone becomes essential. That’s why it’s one of the most credible Best 1000x Cryptos—especially for those who missed Shiba Inu’s original wave. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best Meme Coins to Invest in May 2025 are Troller Cat, SNEK, SPX6900, and Bone ShibaSwap. Each brings something different—unpredictability, subculture appeal, ecosystem utility—but only one is currently in presale, and it’s already catching fire. Troller Cat ($TCAT) is roaring through Stage 6, where a small move now could become generational wealth later. With a 3541.29% ROI ahead, price rising on Friday, and $25,000 turning into nearly $1 million by launch, the moment is now. Plus, with staking rewards at 69% APY, a deflationary gaming economy, and full audit/KYC approvals, this isn’t just a meme. It’s a movement. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach. For More Information: Website: https://www.trollercat.com/ Buy Now: https://www.trollercat.com/buy-now/ X: https://x.com/trollercat_ FAQs What is the current price of Troller Cat in Stage 6? $0.00001458, with a listing price set at $0.0005309. What makes SPX6900 different from other meme coins? It combines meme culture with gym-based NFT rewards and real-life brand tie-ins. Is SNEK a good long-term investment? SNEK’s strength is its organic growth and community loyalty, making it a strong long-term hold. What role does Bone play in the Shiba Inu ecosystem? Bone is the gas token for Shibarium and will be used in governance and dApps. When does Troller Cat’s staking go live? Staking is already live during presale with a 69% APY. Rewards unlock two months after launch. Glossary of Terms Presale – A stage before official listing where early buyers can get in at lower prices.

This collaboration aims to bring green agricultural assets onchain, offering innovative ways for farmers to finance their activities, and enable global investors to engage in sustainable value creation. Dimitra uses blockchain and artificial intelligence to help smallholder farmers boost productivity and build more resilient agricultural systems. MANTRA brings a secure, regulation-friendly blockchain designed for tokenizing real-world assets, across real estate, commodities, and agriculture. Together, they will unlock new pathways to connect high-impact farming projects with investors seeking transparent, asset-backed opportunities that deliver both returns and positive change. The first phase of the partnership will focus on cacao production in the Amazon region of Brazil and carbon credit projects in Mexico. In Brazil, Dimitra is working with smallholder farmers to improve cacao yields through the Connected Cacao platform, designed to provide tools for soil analysis, crop monitoring, AI technical assistance and regenerative best practices. Cacao is a high-demand crop, especially among chocolate producers. Tokenizing cacao-based RWAs can open new paths for financing infrastructure, traceability and farmer incentives, making the entire value chain more profitable and transparent. In Mexico, Dimitra and MANTRA will leverage Dimitra’s carbon monitoring tools to support a forest conservation project covering over 20,000 hectares, with the potential to generate nearly one million carbon credits in the next ten years. These efforts will produce 100% traceable carbon credits, making it easier to verify, trade and invest. As the global demand for carbon credits continues to rise, tokenization of carbon projects offers a path to broader access and greater impact. While the initial projects will focus on Brazil and Mexico, this partnership will establish a framework for tokenizing agricultural projects worldwide. Dimitra’s portfolio includes dozens of agricultural projects in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Many of these projects are economically sound, but struggle to attract funding. With MANTRA’s infrastructure, these initiatives can be turned into investable opportunities that appeal to a growing number of people and institutions looking to make a real impact with real returns. “This partnership is about unlocking new value from the real economy,” said Jon Trask, CEO of Dimitra. “Through MANTRA’s platform, we’ll be able to turn powerful, regenerative agricultural projects into accessible investment opportunities, benefiting both farmers and investors.” “Tokenizing agriculture isn’t just about innovation, it’s about finding solutions to real-world issues long associated with food supply – at scale – and for long-term impact,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA. “Dimitra is solving real-world problems, with a focus on traceability and transparency – and we’re proud to help bring those to a wider audience. MANTRA Chain was built to support projects like these.” The partnership follows a string of strong developments from MANTRA, which continues to build momentum in the real-world asset space. Earlier this year, MANTRA was awarded the first DeFi license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to operate as a Virtual Asset Exchange, as well as provide Broker-Dealer and Management and Investment Services. It also launched the RWAccelerator – a start-up program for builders and startups supported by Google Cloud. About Dimitra Dimitra is a leading AI and blockchain-based platform for AgTech driving productive, intelligent and inclusive farming. Dimitra empowers farmers to make their processes smarter through actionable data-driven insights. Now working with farmers and co-ops across 35 countries, Dimitra’s AI-driven solutions equip farmers, agribusinesses, and governments with cutting-edge technology to combat deforestation, increase yields, reduce costs, and mitigate risks. Dimitra ensures seamless access to precision agriculture, supply chain transparency, carbon credit generation, and regulatory compliance. About Mantra MANTRA is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain for real-world assets, capable of adherence to real-world regulatory requirements. As a permissionless chain, MANTRA Chain empowers developers and institutions to seamlessly participate in the evolving RWA tokenization space by offering advanced technology modules, compliance mechanisms, and cross-chain interoperability. MANTRA holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), to operate as a Virtual Asset Exchange, as well as provide Broker-Dealer and Management and Investment Services.

The department is calling the earlier guidance a deviation from established legal standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Employee Benefits Security Administration issued Compliance Assistance Release No. 2025-01, which formally withdraws the 2022 release that instructed fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before considering crypto offerings. The department now says that language was inconsistent with ERISA and represented a shift from its historically neutral approach to investment types. “The Biden administration’s Department of Labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” You might also like: Vietnam busts $400m crypto scam running fake exchange Crypto regulation in retirement plans The 2022 guidance had warned that offering crypto in retirement plans could trigger regulatory scrutiny, and that fiduciaries should expect to be questioned on whether such options aligned with their duties of prudence and loyalty. It came amid broader concerns about the volatility and nascency of digital assets. The Labor Department said it is reaffirming its “neutral stance” and will not take a position for or against fiduciaries who determine that cryptocurrency is appropriate for a plan’s investment menu. Investment decisions, the department said, remain “context specific,” echoing the U.S. Supreme Court’s standard in Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer . The withdrawal does not guarantee regulatory approval of crypto in retirement plans, but it signals a return to evaluating all investment options under the same fiduciary lens, without singling out any particular asset class for heightened scrutiny.

While Solana has built a strong reputation as a blockchain leader, analysts are now focusing on Ruvi AI, a rising star with a projected 100x growth potential by Q4 2025. Here’s why Ruvi AI is generating so much buzz and attracting attention, even from Solana’s loyal investors. Solana’s Established Strengths Solana is synonymous with speed and scalability, handling thousands of transactions per second at extremely low costs. It serves as the backbone for many DeFi, NFT, and dApp projects, thanks to its reliable infrastructure and developer-friendly ecosystem. For investors, Solana is a safe bet for steady returns. It’s proven, stable, and well-backed by major institutions. However, Solana’s maturity means that it may not offer the massive growth potential that emerging tokens like Ruvi AI promise. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart Ruvi AI stands out as a unique project combining blockchain innovation with the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary focus is on delivering practical, real-world solutions in industries like: Healthcare, with AI-powered diagnostics. Logistics, by optimizing supply chains. Finance, enhancing fraud detection. This emphasis on utility gives Ruvi AI staying power in the market, making it more than just another speculative cryptocurrency. Record-Breaking Start Ruvi AI’s presale exceeded all expectations, selling 125 million tokens and raising $1.4 million. With a low entry price of $0.015 per token, it provides an affordable opportunity for investors to get in early on a project that could revolutionize multiple industries. How an 100x ROI Is Possible Analysts predict Ruvi AI will reach $1 by Q4 2025, an incredible 100x return for early adopters. To put this in perspective, a $750 investment at $0.015 per token would buy 50,000 tokens. If the price hits $1, that $750 would grow into $70,000. For investors accustomed to Solana’s steady but more modest growth, these numbers make Ruvi AI a standout contender. Why Solana Investors Are Taking Notice Solana investors, often focused on reliability, are keeping an eye on Ruvi AI due to its groundbreaking applications combined with explosive growth potential. The token’s use cases in AI-driven healthcare, logistics, and finance highlight its ability to resolve real-world challenges, setting it apart from purely speculative crypto projects. Furthermore, investors can take advantage of Ruvi AI’s tiered bonus structure during the presale, which amplifies growth potential significantly: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus):Total Tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus).Value at $0.07: $4,900.Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus):Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus).Value at $0.07: $15,680.Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus):Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation).Value at $0.07: $89,600.Value at $1: $1,280,000. These bonuses reward early participation and make Ruvi AI even more attractive to investors seeking maximum returns. The Bottom Line Solana’s position as a trusted blockchain leader remains secure, delivering steady, reliable growth for its investors. However, the 88x projected ROI for Ruvi AI presents an opportunity that’s impossible to ignore for those who are willing to take a calculated risk. Ruvi AI’s combination of record-breaking presale, groundbreaking applications, low entry price, and tiered bonuses positions it as one of the most compelling crypto investments of the year. For investors ready to explore a high-growth opportunity, Ruvi AI’s potential could be a game-changer. Don’t miss your chance to get in early and watch your investment grow.

In a twist, an anonymous trader profited $5.6M in three days by consistently taking the opposite side of his trades. The Adventures of Wynn Earlier this month, he entered a long BTC position with roughly $390 million. The bet initially had a liquidation price of $96,600 and a margin of just south of $10 million. In the following days, Wynn increased the position to a whopping $1.25 billion with 40x leverage. At one point, the trader was at the crest of the wave, standing at the staggering $87 million in unrealized profit due to BTC’s price rally above $110,000. However, towards the end of last week, the asset’s valuation (and the entire cryptocurrency market) retraced following Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs of 50% on the European Union, effective from June 1. Logically, the downtrend wiped out a significant chunk of Wynn’s gains. He then flipped bearish on the asset, opening a short position of 1,038 BTC at $107,711 with a liquidation price of $149,100. Eventually, the trader called it quits , closing all contracts with a profit of $25 million. The whale’s actions were praised by many X users, with some calling him a “legend.” Others, though, have not been so kind, wishing to see him in the red. Wynn prepared a special post for those stating: For all my haters out there who so very much loved to see my portfolio swing down by $60,000,000. Just know, now you get to see it swing BACK UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. I repeat HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. Money that haters like you can’t even dream of having because… pic.twitter.com/VnFo6i5bhT — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 27, 2025 The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that just a few hours after announcing the profit, the trader “was back in the casino” and continued to long BTC with 40x leverage. “The portion size reaches 684 BTC ($75.34M), and the liquidation price is $103,120,” the entity stated on May 26. Subsequently, Wynn increased his long position to 5,676 BTC, with a liquidation price of $108,010. Besides interacting with BTC, Wynn is known as a proponent of PEPE and opened several positions involving the asset. Back in the day, he spent $182,000 to purchase 7.2 trillion tokens. He sold 6.76 trillion PEPE for almost $34 million and left 443.7 billion PEPE (worth over $6 million at current rates). Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had been actively trading the meme coin on Hyperquid lately, making four profitable trades that netted $25.4 million. The platform later estimated that the whale deposited 240 billion PEPE into Binance, raising the question of whether he was preparing to cash out. Shortly after, the entity disclosed that it seemed like Wynn had sold the stash to fund his long BTC position and informed that he deposited the remainder of his PEPE holdings into the exchange. Betting Against Wynn and Big Loss The whale executed his whopping long and short positions on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, and these trades were visible to other market participants. Lookonchain revealed the case of one savvy trader who bet against Wynn’s actions and, in just three days, made $5.6 million. Specifically, they shorted BTC every time Wynn went long and vice versa. On May 24, trader 0x2258 opened a short position in BTC and ETH and closed it the following day, realizing a profit of $1.36 million. Then, Wynn opened a BTC short position, while the other trader went long on BTC and ETH, only to make a profit of $2.54 million on May 26. Finally, the unknown industry participant opened short positions on the two cryptocurrencies, generating a profit of $1.7 million ( at least on paper). Some speculated that the mysterious trader might be Wynn operating from another account to hedge his bets. However, the whale rejected the rumors, saying : “Not happy with this post at all. Whoever trader 0x2258 is, it is not me and have no clue who it is . I only trade on one HL account and that’s public. Don’t start spreading fake news with zero proof.” The most recent Lookonchain update, though, paints a painful picture for the whale. It reads that it took him 70 days to build the aforementioned $87 million portfolio (at its peak) but only five days to lose almost all of it. James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) has wiped out almost all his profits on #Hyperliquid . It took him 70 days to go from 0 to $87M+ in profit, and only 5 days to lose almost all the $87M+ in profit. https://t.co/IUTpCuzoSB pic.twitter.com/n2p3nftZ3G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 28, 2025 The post Crypto Whale James Wynn’s $87M Portfolio Wiped Out in 5 Days: A Detailed Recap appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|PEPE,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-28 15:35:19

US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his push for his meme coin have attracted investor attention to the space. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a meme coin, is expected to gain momentum from this push for meme coins. More companies get into BTC for diversification TMTG said it will raise the funds by selling $1.5 billion worth of stock and $1 billion in convertible notes. The bitcoin investment is a part of the company’s long-term strategy to diversify its revenue streams and align with the growing trend of corporate crypto holdings. This massive investment comes at a time when a number of companies are turning to Bitcoin and other digital assets in an effort to hedge against inflation and traditional market volatility. Enterprise software firm Strategy has so far bought $40.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy’s shares have surged as Bitcoin’s value jumped in the last couple of years. Videogame retailer GameStop also revealed that it bought $513 million worth of bitcoin. Trump Media’s move is also consistent with Donald Trump’s increasingly visible engagement in the alternative investment space. In 2025, Trump launched the Trump coin, a meme coin that capitalized on his political brand. Although initially dismissed as a novelty, the token saw significant speculative activity, especially among Trump’s base and crypto enthusiasts. How Bitcoin Pepe is poised to become the next big thing Bitcoin Pepe has already raised $11.9 million, two days before its CEX (centralized exchange) listing. The cryptocurrency is a meme-driven layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin network that aims to combine the best of Bitcoin’s settlement guarantees with Solana’s lightning-fast scalability. BPEP has garnered attention for its innovative approach to combining meme culture with Bitcoin’s robust security. At its core, Bitcoin Pepe introduces the PEP-20 token standard, aiming to bring the efficiency and speed of platforms like Solana to the Bitcoin network. This fusion allows for rapid, retail-friendly trading experiences while leveraging Bitcoin’s unparalleled security. The project’s strength lies not only in its technological innovation but also in its strategic partnerships. Bitcoin Pepe has also collaborated with platforms like Super Meme and Catamo to facilitate safe and fair meme coin launches, while integrations with Plena Finance and GETE Network expand Bitcoin Pepe’s utility in the DeFi and gaming sectors. Bitcoin Pepe’s explosive returns With the token price currently at $0.0377, Bitcoin Pepe has already provided cumulative gains of more than 79% to its early investors who bought at $0.0210. With Bitcoin Pepe’s price jumping 5.2% and 4.9% respectively in the previous two stages, the meme coin is set for more gains as it comes closer to its listing. Investors looking for the next crypto that has the potential to be a multi-bagger and missed out on previous crypto assets are said to be eyeing Bitcoin Pepe. As more companies buy into Bitcoin to diversify their financial assets, Bitcoin Pepe, an emerging meme coin, is gearing up to become the next big hit in the cryptocurrency world.

Berachain ( BERA ) price dropped to $2.689, down 70% from its highest level this year. This steep decline has reduced its market cap from over $920 million in March to $339 million. Activity on Berachain’s network continues to decline. According to Nansen data, it had only 104,000 active addresses over the past seven days, trailing behind other top chains like Sui ( SUI ) and Base. Berachain’s transactions fell more than 40% in the last seven days to 4.245 million, making it the worst-performing chain tracked by Nansen. Fees on the network also dropped 37% to $5,200 over the same period.

Berachain stablecoin supply has dropped | Source: DeFi Llama Worse, Berachain has had outflows of US dollars into its ecosystem for all days since March 27. The total value locked in its platform has dropped by 50% in the last 30 days to $2.92 billion. These figures indicate that Berachain is rapidly losing traction, marking one of the steepest downfalls in the crypto industry this year. BERA price technical analysis Berachain price chart | Source: crypto.news Berachain has been in a strong downtrend since hitting its post-airdrop high of $9.1823 on March 2. The eight-hour chart shows that BERA price is hovering near its all-time low of $2.70, forming a double-bottom pattern. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. However, BERA remains below its 50-period and 100-period moving averages. While the double-bottom pattern may suggest a potential relief rally, a drop below $2.7021 would invalidate the bullish case and could open the door to further downside, potentially targeting the psychological level of $2.50.

This forecast is not just ambitious — it’s a statement that Solana could redefine the layer-1 blockchain landscape in the years ahead. But what’s behind this bold call, and is it realistic? What’s Behind Standard Chartered’s Prediction? The bank’s digital asset research team, led by Geoffrey Kendrick, has crafted a valuation model that goes beyond mere speculation. They see Solana as a blockchain currently undervalued relative to its application revenue, especially when compared to Ethereum and Cardano. While Solana’s recent boom has been fueled largely by memecoin trading a sector known for its volatility, Standard Chartered believes the network’s real potential lies in its technological edge and upcoming upgrades. Solana’s claim to fame has always been its blazing fast transaction speeds and incredibly low fees. These features have made it a magnet for high-frequency trading and memecoin activity, pushing the network to handle transaction volumes that few others can match. Yet, this heavy reliance on memecoins has been a double-edged sword. The bank warns that as memecoin hype fades, Solana must diversify its use cases to sustain growth. That’s where the upcoming network upgrades come into play. The much-anticipated Firedancer validator client, developed in partnership with Jump Crypto, promises to revolutionize Solana’s throughput, potentially enabling over a million transactions per second. Alongside this, doubling the block space and refining the consensus algorithm are expected to dramatically boost scalability and reliability. T hese technical improvements could pave the way for new applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), consumer apps, and even decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) — areas where Solana has yet to fully unlock its potential. Are $275–$500 for Solana Realistic? Comparing Solana’s forecast to Ethereum and Cardano reveals an intriguing picture. Ethereum, the undisputed leader in smart contracts, is projected to reach between $3,500 and $5,300 by 2025, and potentially soar to $10,900 by 2029. Cardano’s outlook is more conservative, with targets ranging from $1.21 to $3.07 in 2025 and up to $10.25 by 2030. Solana’s forecast, while aggressive, reflects confidence in its unique value proposition — speed, cost-efficiency, and a growing ecosystem. On-chain data lends some support to this optimism. Solana has maintained over 10 million active addresses for several months, hitting a record 11.12 million in March 2025. Network fee revenue surged to $25.7 million in Q1 2025, a staggering 320% year-over-year increase. Total value locked (TVL) on Solana climbed 54% since April, reaching $9.4 billion — second only to Ethereum among layer-1 blockchains. These figures suggest a vibrant and expanding user base, though skeptics caution that many addresses hold minimal balances, and much of the activity is driven by low-value transactions. Despite these successes, the path to $500 per SOL won’t be easy. The heavy dependence on memecoin trading raises questions about sustainability, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty remains. Even Standard Chartered tempers its enthusiasm by predicting that Solana will underperform Ethereum in the near term, with the ETH/SOL price ratio expected to rise before Solana’s broader utility takes hold. Ultimately, the bank’s forecast hinges on Solana’s ability to transition from a memecoin powerhouse to a foundational blockchain supporting diverse, high-value applications. If the Firedancer upgrade and other network improvements deliver as promised, and if institutional and developer interest continues to grow, the $275 and $500 price targets could move from bold predictions to plausible outcomes. For investors and enthusiasts, the coming years will be a critical test of Solana’s resilience and innovation. Watching how the network evolves, how its user base deepens, and how revenue streams diversify will be key to understanding whether this ambitious forecast can become reality.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-28 15:40:18

This statement follows Ripple’s gift of the skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community. Garlinghouse said , “ I hope this gesture continues to remind folks that we (BTC, XRP, and other crypto communities) have more in common than we think.” Special guest at Bitcoin 2025 – the Skull of Satoshi, donated by @Ripple to the Bitcoin community. The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 For a long time, Garlinghouse has viewed XRP as a competitor of Bitcoin. His excuse for not overtaking BTC was the SEC case, especially under Biden’s administration. Early this year, he was against the SBR, citing that other crypto coins should also be considered. He said, “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking.” Luckily for him, Trump has considered XRP a digital stockpile. However, BTC is at the very front with a market cap of over $2 trillion, while XRP is at the fourth position with a market cap of over $130 billion. Garlinghous asserts he owns the three big crypto assets, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the BTC conference has quickly become one of the year’s defining events for the crypto industry. It hosted over 30,000 attendees, 300 exhibitors, and a packed lineup of speakers. Garlinghouse calls for attention to blockchain energy usage Garlinghouse said, “ The Skull of Satoshi was originally built to call attention to blockchain energy usage, and today it’s a symbol and reminder of Bitcoin’s incredible staying power to many around the world (including me!).” The statement sounds sarcastic because, in recent years, Bitcoin has used around 57.09 billion kWh per year. This is comparable to electricity usage in countries like Argentina or the Netherlands. On the other hand, XRP uses 474,000 kWh, a fraction of the energy used by Bitcoin. Compared to Bitcoin, XRP’s energy consumption is 100,000 times smaller than Bitcoin’s per transaction. Meanwhile, BTQ and Quandela have agreed to look into how photonic quantum computing can be used for BTQ’s Quantum Sampling Proof-of-Work (QSPoW). It is an alternative to Bitcoin’s standard safe mining model that uses less energy. Users question XRP’s decentralized nature The public nature of the payments firm has raised an interlinked question of Ripple’s centralized leadership and XRP’s supposed decentralized model. A user asked on X why Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is the face of XRP, given XRP’s claim to being a decentralized crypto asset. “I don’t see the same arrangement with BTC,” they said. Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, David Schwartz, jumped in right away to calm people down and give a full explanation. Schwartz brought up the fact that Garlinghouse is the CEO of the company Ripple. But “XRP has no issuer,” adding that all XRP tokens were made when the XRP Ledger first came out. The CTO of the payments company also talked about decentralization, which is one of the most important ideas in the crypto world. Schwartz also said that people worried about XRP Ledger’s decentralized model should focus less on meanings and more on what they want from decentralization.

Norwegian digital asset company K33 became the latest firm to join the Bitcoin (BTC) train. On Wednesday, May 28, the company announced it secured 60 million Swedish krona, worth about $5.6 million, for its Bitcoin treasury. To fund the acquisition, the Oslo-headquartered company, which is listed on Nasdaq First North in Stockholm, issued 150.56 million new shares worth 15 million SEK. K33 also issued 301.12 million free warrants valued at 45 million SEK. According to the company, the capital comes from insiders and aligned investors, including Klein Group and Modiola AS. Free warrants are zero-interest instruments that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. If converted before March 2026, investors are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

Volume Explodes to $1.5 Billion,https://cryptonews.com/news/pepe-price-prediction-is-the-next-shiba-moment-here-volume-explodes-to-1-5-billion/,"Pepe (PEPE) has emerged as the standout performer among the top meme coins, posting impressive monthly gains of 54.7% as trader interest hits a fever pitch. Between May 21 and 23, PEPE’s trading volume skyrocketed past $2 billion, peaking at $2.8 billion in a single 24-hour window. That figure represents over half of the token’s circulating supply, underscoring the explosive demand currently driving this meme coin’s momentum. The market’s overall recovery has favored meme coins as bulls have managed to trigger a strong short squeeze on mid-sized assets in this category like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Popcat (POPCAT). Data from Coinglass shows that open interest in PEPE futures has been surging since March 10, moving from around $166 million back then to a yearly record of $700 million just 6 days ago. Meanwhile, this year’s daily trading volumes have not yet reached the record set on November 13, back when $5.3 billion worth of PEPE exchange hands in a single day. For now, the 2025 peak in trading volumes stands at $3.73 billion. All of this bullish activity confirms a bullish Pepe price prediction . However, how high can this meme coin go and can it hold on to these gains? Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Rise by 90% If This Bullish Pattern is Confirmed After a breakout from its descending wedge earlier this quarter, PEPE has entered a consolidation phase just above the key $0.000013 support level. This range-bound movement appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup that echoes the consolidation zone seen before its last surge in early May. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is holding at 57.84 — well within neutral territory — suggesting there’s still room for upward momentum before overbought conditions kick in. Meanwhile, volume remains steady, showing sustained interest, while the MACD histogram hovers near the baseline, hinting at a potential momentum reversal to the upside. If PEPE can hold this level and break through the resistance zone around $0.000022, the path toward retesting the previous high of $0.00002836 becomes far more likely. A measured move based on the depth of the previous rally projects a 90% upside from current levels — aligning with a PEPE price prediction of approximately $0.00002680 to $0.00002900 in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, as this meme coin continues to outperform its peers, Pepe-linked crypto presales like MIND of Pepe (MIND) may deliver significant gains once they are listed on exchanges. New AI Agent Goes Live Providing Market Insights MIND of Pepe (MIND) is an AI agent that combines the power of artificial intelligence and a viral meme like Pepe the Frog to captivate mass audiences across social media platforms like X. Since its presale event was launched in January, this AI token has raised nearly $11 million. The agent is already live on X and has started to collect insightful information that it will pass on exclusively to $MIND holders. As its influence grows, MIND of Pepe will also be able to launch and promote its own meme coins and $MIND holders will get privileged access to their presale events to reap the highest returns. To buy $MIND and profit as the agent’s popularity increases, head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL for this token or use a bank card to invest. The post PEPE Price Prediction: Is the Next Shiba Moment Here?

But the price remains over 30% below its$3.40 Q1 2025’s peak, and moving broadly sideways for over a week. Also, network activity declining persistently from late 2024’s high highlights investors’ confidence declining, and raises strong concerns about XRP crypto’s ability to advance higher. As a result, analysts across the crypto community are warning that the XRP price could be at risk of falling unless investors rapidly increase. Another major concern is that Institutional demand for XRP investment products appears to be waning, and even XRP crypto’s derivatives data leans bearish. The extended consolidation points to a major worry among investors that in the coming days, the XRP price is likely to drop from the current levels. Keep reading to know more. Why XRP Price Has A Strong Bearish Vibe Than Ever In Q2? A Monday CoinShares report shared grave news for XRP investors that demand is waning, as CoinShares XRP ETP posted $37.2 million outflows, which has broken an 80-week inflow streak. This brought its MTD flows to $28.6 million. The exact reason for these outflows remains unclear, but these outflows aligned with the latest XRP ETF’s approval got delayed by the SEC. This indicates a decreased institutional appetite for XRP investment products. Thus, it is a strong bearish catalyst for the upcoming XRP price action. XRP/USD 1.D. COINBASE | Source: TradingView The decreasing investors’ confidence is not only visible in Coinshares data but has been long visible in its active address metric, too. This metric had a positive correlation with XRP price, but the decline in active addresses often has a bearish impact on the asset, potentially leading to price declines. Without A Catalyst XRP Price Fall Is Imminent Moreover, in derivatives data, the XRP’s open interest has fallen, which clearly means traders are closing their contracts, adding to the low activity and increasing the odds of a downtrend. As there is insufficient capital and enthusiasm to drive prices northwards. Source: Santiment Also, XRP funding rates have been sideways since Q1 2025, reflecting a lack of strong directional bias, as a balance between long and short positions sends an asset price into a consolidation stage, and this is what we are witnessing in XRP for such a long time now. At present market needs a clear catalyst for a breakout and a strong directional bias among market participants. Without renewed interest, XRP price could slide back into a downward trend. Additionally, the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit still remains a major storyline for XRP’s price success in the long term. Although this lawsuit news has built a lot of uncertainty for the Ripple market, despite that, market participants believe that a clear resolution now could release a fresh momentum and could become a stepping stone for XRP ETFs to pass the SEC.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-28 15:46:26

Its entry into these exchanges has opened access to a global user base. Inspired by the Breaking Bad universe, DON combines pop culture with blockchain appeal. Market participants are watching closely as DON sets its sights on a potential 2000% rise ahead of a possible Binance listing. Salamanca (DON) Listed on Gate.io and Gains Meme Community Backing Salamanca (DON) is now listed on Gate.io and MEXC, two of the most active centralized exchanges. Gate.io’s high volume market made it the best place to start. Also listed on PancakeSwap so early adopters can get decentralized access. Trade $DON now on Gate.io: https://www.gate.io/zh/trade/DON_USDT Built on Binance Smart Chain, DON is a meme token wrapped in cultural storytelling. It’s about the Salamanca family from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. The branding is for anime fans, meme enthusiasts, and crypto users looking for unique projects with viral potential. The price is below $0.01, so new and experienced traders can get in. The community thinks DON is more than a trend. It’s a “cultural IP coin” that combines internet culture with speculative digital assets. Daily volume is increasing, and visibility is growing; DON is now a topic on crypto forums. SHIB’s 2021 Rally Sets a Precedent for DON’s Projected Growth In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) exploded. From August 2020 to October 2021, SHIB went up 85,000,000%. In April 2021, SHIB went from $0.000000060 to $0.00000362 in 19 days. This changed the meme coin narrative. SHIB’s growth brought in millions of new users. Retail and institutional attention turned to meme-based tokens, creating new demand. Salamanca (DON) has many of the same traits: strong community backing, a low market cap, and a brand. It is also an early stage and an existing exchange listing like SHIB’s early days. Market watchers are pointing to the similarities in momentum. DON could do the same if the patterns hold and the market conditions are right. Reports are already calling for a 2000% price target, and the speculation is getting wild. Potential Binance Listing and Price Outlook for 2025 Salamanca (DON) is generating much buzz in trading circles as one of the top BSC-based meme coins for 2025. That’s mainly because a listing on Binance is expected, and when Binance adds a new token, it often signals that a project is on the right track. DON is already available on Gate.io, MEXC, and PancakeSwap, so liquidity and global reach are already in place. Adding Binance to the mix would put it firmly in place across all major market segments. DON’s unique blend of entertainment culture and blockchain is driving interest, drawing in investors from all sectors. If that listing goes ahead and market sentiment aligns with forecasts, DON could rise 20 times from its current level.

The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase on Memorial Day but fell back in the red on Tuesday after briefly crossing $110,000. BTC is trading around $109,050, with the price marginally down over the past 24 hours. Analysts believe BTC risks a pullback to $100,000 if it fails to reclaim $110,000 and falls out of its bullish channel. However, they also state that the broader outlook around the asset remains positive. US May Buy More Bitcoin White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks suggested the US may be open to buying more Bitcoin to expand its reserves if it can be done in a budget-neutral way. Sacks discussed the Trump administration’s aggressive push to reshape US crypto policy, including years of perceived hostility towards digital assets. Speaking with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Sacks highlighted the Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin actions, including the establishment of a Strategic Digital Asset Reserve, and indicated the reserve could be expanded, stating, “If it can be done in a budget-neutral way—specifically if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs.” President Trump signed an executive order that stated the reserve would be funded by Bitcoin held by the US Department of the Treasury, forfeited during civil and criminal proceedings. However, Sacks believes the executive order allows the US government to purchase more Bitcoin. “So if we can convince Howard Lutnick, who's Commerce Secretary, or Scott Besson, who's the Treasury Secretary, to buy some, and they can figure out how to fund it—without a new tax or adding to the debt, maybe by finding the money from some other program that's not using it—then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Rally Could Liquidate $7B In Short Positions Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $110,000 on Tuesday after the US equities market opened strongly, and the Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. BTC’s momentum aligns with favorable macroeconomic conditions, with the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shifting to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI tracks the stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When it moves into looser territory, it indicates easier access to capital and reduced market stress. For assets like Bitcoin, such movements typically align with price rallies as capital flows into risk and speculative assets. According to the Econometrics newsletter, liquidity has returned to the market, creating a favorable macroeconomic environment for assets like Bitcoin. “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.” Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Firm Despite Monumental Rally Unlike previous market cycles, long-term Bitcoin holders are in no hurry to sell. On-chain data has revealed a lack of selling despite substantial profit potential. This indicates a conviction among long-term investors that the price will continue to push higher. Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts stated that the LTH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator is one of the most obvious indicators of this resilience. “While MVRV and NUPL measure the potential for profit-taking, LTH-SOPR captures when that potential is realized—when long-term holders actually move coins to lock in gains or cut losses. At previous tops, the signal has been clear: LTH-SOPR hit 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in Q1 2024. Today, it sits at 2.1. Bitcoin has rallied over 47% from the lows and reached new all-time highs—yet long-term holder selling remains muted.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin's (BTC) price action has been subdued this week as it struggles to reclaim $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase on the memorable day holiday but declined on Tuesday after briefly crossing $110,000. Analysts believe BTC faces the risk of a pullback and a drop to $100,000 if it fails to reclaim $110,000. Additionally, Bitfinex analysts have warned that more liquidations could follow if BTC drops below $108,000. Total crypto liquidations hit $211 million on Tuesday, of which $131 million were long positions, compared to a little over $79 million in short positions. Bitunix analysts have interpreted this imbalance as evidence of a long-side wipeout during BTC’s recent drop to $108,000 and have cautioned investors against entering overly aggressive long positions while BTC trades near this level. “Short-term attention should be paid to the effect of support at $108,500–$109,000, and it is not recommended to chase higher. Analysts advise observing whether the $110,800–$112,000 pressure band is effectively broken before considering further positions.” The analysts stated that a drop below this level could trigger more liquidations and lead to a price breakdown. “A drop below $108,000 could trigger a new round of liquidations. Traders are advised to exercise strict risk control as the market could weaken again if capital inflows do not resume.” BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday (May 17), settling at $103,235. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. Source: TradingView However, price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to renewed trade war concerns. As a result, BTC dropped nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. BTC registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.46% to $108,951 after briefly crossing $110,000. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $107,843. A decline from current levels could see the price test the $100,000 support level.

ChatGPT Weighs In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-to-a-new-all-time-high-or-mutuum-finance-mutm-to-1-first-chatgpt-weighs-in/,"Ripple (XRP) is once again under the spotlight, with the crypto market heating up in 2025. XRP has shown strong momentum after the recent wave of institutional interest and renewed optimism around a potential spot XRP ETF approval. XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and its partnerships with major financial institutions keep it positioned as a long-term blue-chip crypto. However, some investors are shifting their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi altcoin which many believe could reach $1 before XRP revisits its peak. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available at $0.03 per token in phase 5 of its presale. The project has already raised over $9.4 million and has attracted more than 11,300 holders. Phase 6 prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035 and holders joining at this stage stand a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. XRP Eyes New Highs Amid Bullish Momentum Ripple’s XRP is currently sitting at around $2.32, a near approximate 0.86% decline in the last 24 hours. XRP has continued to be resilient despite the slight decline, trading above major support levels. Analysts are bullish on the direction of XRP, with some even going on record to say that it is possible for it to hit $3.95 on the short term on the back of positive technical indicators and high trading volumes. Looking ahead, predictions see XRP hitting $7 in July 2025 if it continues its 2017 trend, provided there are favorable market conditions and regulation. While XRP is fighting for its place in the changing crypto universe, other new coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also finding favor among investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance Presale The project maintains an increasing momentum since it has raised over $9.4 million in investments and now boasts over 11,300 investors. The $0.03 Phase 5 token price provides investors with a limited window considering an upcoming 16.67% price hike. Investors who enter during the phase 5 of the presale period can achieve 100% ROI because the token has established a listing price of $0.06. With the growth of the decentralized marketplace, Mutuum Finance is leading the way with its novel lending model and favorable market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System By using Mutuum Finance, individuals can access more assets and enjoy greater amounts of transparency and control through the P2C and P2P methods they include. To earn passive income in P2C, users add stablecoins to pools held by smart contracts which constantly adjusts rates to give users more benefits while lowering the interest paid on loans. Through P2P, lending can be completed without middlemen, allowing for total freedom in rules and paperwork. This approach helps people borrow easily, quickly and transparently. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin will soon be launched on Ethereum and it will be fully pegged to the US-Dollar. This system’s structure is designed to avoid the difficulties that similar systems face with algorithmic stability. Because of open-source smart contracts and a successful Certik audit, Mutuum Finance ensures all its financial transactions are reliable. Using innovative lending services and solid infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is preparing for what’s next in decentralized finance. Ripple (XRP) is pushing toward a potential ETF boost and $3.95 target, backed by institutional adoption and global payment use. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now in Phase 5 at $0.03, is gaining major traction. With over $9.4M raised and 11,300+ holders, it could hit $0.06 at launch, offering 100% ROI—and some speculate a run to $1 is possible with its unique dual-lending DeFi model and audited stablecoin.

45208155,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68808,1748448010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Is Dogecoin (DOGE) a Match for Ruvi AI’s Projected 13,200% Return on Investment?",https://timestabloid.com/is-dogecoin-doge-a-match-for-ruvi-ais-projected-13200-return/,"For years, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captured the hearts of the crypto community. Fueled by memes, endorsements, and a loyal fan base, it remains one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies. But is its hype-driven growth enough to rival Ruvi AI , a new entrant offering a staggering 13,200% return on investment (ROI) ? With analysts predicting that Ruvi AI’s token could reach $2 by the end of 2025, this utility-focused project might be hard for speculative tokens like Dogecoin to match. The Hype Engine of Dogecoin Dogecoin started as a joke but rose to prominence through dedicated community support and social media buzz. With low transaction fees and a simple use case in tipping, its popularity has persisted over the years. Regularly touted by influential figures, Dogecoin thrives on its vibrant community, but its dependence on hype raises long-term sustainability questions. DOGE has value for short-term gains, but its limited functionality makes it less appealing for forward-thinking investors. Ruvi AI’s Utility-Driven Edge Ruvi AI, on the other hand, flips the script by focusing on solving real-world problems. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain, Ruvi AI introduces groundbreaking applications in several vital industries: Healthcare: Enhancing diagnostics and securely storing patient records using blockchain-backed AI solutions. Logistics: Streamlining supply chains with predictive analytics and decentralized data management. Finance: Using AI for fraud detection, reducing financial crime risks while bolstering transaction security. This purposeful innovation has drawn significant attention during Ruvi AI’s record-breaking presale , which raised $1.4 million and sold 125 million tokens . At an entry price of just $0.015 per token , its ROI potential is unparalleled. Analysts project that its token value could reach $2 by Q1 2026, offering 13,200% growth for early backers without taking in count all the bonuses. Tiered Investment Options for Potentially Massive Returns Ruvi AI’s presale accommodates various investment tiers, backed by attractive bonuses, making it a prime opportunity for both casual and serious investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 ( 50,000 base + 20,000 bonus ). Value at $0.07: $4,900 . Value at $1: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 ( 140,000 base + 84,000 bonus ). Value at $0.07: $15,680 . Value at $1: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 ( double the base allocation ). Value at $0.07: $89,600 . Value at $1: $1,280,000 . These bonus incentives not only reward early adopters but amplify the potential returns as Ruvi AI grows in value. Utility vs. Hype The contrast between Ruvi AI and Dogecoin boils down to their core drivers: Dogecoin relies on community loyalty and sentiment, making its value volatile and less predictable. While it’s a fun and accessible entry point for many, its lack of substantial utility limits its ability to sustain long-term growth. Ruvi AI , by targeting tangible industry pain points, ensures lasting demand. Its innovative applications go beyond mere speculation, positioning it to attract institutional interest and adoption over time. For investors, this distinction is critical. Ruvi AI represents a shift toward utility-focused cryptos that provide both immediate accessibility and far-reaching potential. The Verdict – Why Ruvi AI Stands Out While Dogecoin offers excitement and short-term entertainment, Ruvi AI delivers a vision for the future powered by cutting-edge technology. Its real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and finance set it apart as more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a groundbreaking project reshaping how blockchain and AI interact with everyday challenges. Ruvi AI’s presale is a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure at a low entry price before its projected growth kicks in. With tiered incentives and an ambitious roadmap, Ruvi AI offers unmatched ROI potential, making it a strong contender to outperform speculative tokens like Dogecoin by 2025.

45208110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=759995,1748448015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45208110.jpeg,Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-flashes-buy-signal-key-indicator-hints-at-rebound/,"Dogecoin is currently trading around critical levels, consolidating just below the key $0.25 resistance zone. After a period of relative calm, momentum is beginning to build as bullish sentiment returns to the altcoin market. With Bitcoin holding near all-time highs and Ethereum pushing higher, analysts are calling for the start of a long-awaited altseason—and Dogecoin is showing early signs of participation. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Price action has remained constructive, with DOGE defending higher lows and gradually tightening within a key range. Now, traders are closely watching for a breakout above the $0.25 level, which could unlock the next phase of upside. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal worth noting: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on Dogecoin’s hourly chart. Historically, this pattern has preceded short-term rebounds and local trend reversals, especially when confirmed near key support zones. As sentiment improves and capital begins rotating into high-beta altcoins, Dogecoin appears well-positioned for a potential move. If bulls can push through resistance and validate the TD signal with follow-through volume, DOGE may quickly retest higher levels last seen during early-year surges. The coming sessions could be pivotal. Dogecoin Consolidates As Buy Signal Hints At Incoming Breakout Dogecoin is showing signs of renewed strength, consolidating within a key range between $0.21 and $0.25. After a powerful surge of over 90% since early April, DOGE has cooled off slightly, but remains firmly within bullish territory. The recent price action has been marked by steadily higher lows and a tightening range structure, suggesting that the asset is gearing up for its next major move. The $0.25 resistance remains a critical level to watch. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open the door to a more aggressive rally and shift market sentiment decisively in favor of the bulls. However, momentum has slowed in recent days, and global macroeconomic uncertainty—particularly surrounding inflation and interest rate expectations—continues to weigh on risk assets across the board. Despite these challenges, optimism persists. Martinez recently pointed to a TD Sequential buy signal that has appeared on the 1-hour chart for Dogecoin. This indicator, known for predicting trend reversals and short-term impulses, tends to be particularly effective when it flashes during consolidation phases like the current one. If confirmed, the signal could provide the spark needed to push DOGE back toward the $0.25 resistance—and potentially beyond. For now, bulls must continue to defend the $0.21 support level while looking for momentum to build above the current range. If broader market conditions remain favorable and DOGE can reclaim $0.25 with volume, a new leg higher may follow. Until then, the setup remains constructive, with strong technical support and early signals pointing toward a possible breakout. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? DOGE Consolidates Below Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.222, consolidating after a strong rally in early May. The chart shows price holding within a tight range between $0.21 and $0.25, with the $0.25 level acting as strong resistance. Despite recent pullbacks, DOGE continues to trade above its key moving averages, signaling that bullish structure remains intact in the short term. The 34 EMA (green) at $0.2112 is providing dynamic support, while the 50 SMA (blue) at $0.1929 reinforces a solid base just below. The 200 SMA (red), currently at $0.2714, is the next significant resistance if DOGE breaks out above $0.25. Volume has decreased slightly during this consolidation, a typical sign of a market pausing before a potential breakout or breakdown. The lack of aggressive selling pressure suggests that bulls are still in control, but need renewed momentum to challenge and reclaim the $0.25 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? A clean break and close above $0.25 would likely confirm the continuation of the bullish trend, potentially targeting the $0.28–$0.30 range. However, failure to hold above $0.21 could open the door for a retest of deeper support near the 100 SMA. For now, DOGE remains in a constructive holding pattern.

Mantra (OM) is making headlines after a strong price surge, and XRP still holds key support despite slower momentum. Meanwhile, Web3 ai ($WAI) is gaining quite traction by building something different. Rather than chasing short-term hype, the project is focused on giving traders real AI tools that serve a purpose. From scam detectors to smart optimization features, Web3 AI delivers more than promises. It’s built with function in mind, making it one of the cryptos to watch right now. With over $5.8 million raised and a low current price, it could be a rare early-stage gem. In a market full of noise, coins that offer substance and long-term value stand out, and Web3 ai is clearly one of them. Mantra (OM) Signals Strong Bullish Momentum Mantra (OM) is catching attention after a solid 10.24% jump in price and a massive 500% boost in trading volume. This growth came after its recent listing on Upbit, the top exchange in South Korea. As a result, OM moved beyond its $0.43 resistance, reaching $0.49, and now aims for the $0.60 to $0.70 zone. The technical indicators support this trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 28, signaling an oversold asset likely to bounce. Meanwhile, the MACD has stayed in bullish crossover territory, and the green bars suggest ongoing buyer activity. Nansen recently became a validator for the MANTRA Chain. In addition, 300 million OM tokens, including 150 million from the founder, are being burned. This token burn is meant to reduce supply and increase confidence in the token. XRP Price Forecast: Strong Support, Weak Activity XRP is trading near $2.33, but the coin faces some pushback. One of the main concerns is the big drop in daily active addresses. From around 612,000 in Q1, the number has fallen to just 33,400, signaling lower engagement with the XRP Ledger. Another issue comes from big holders. Wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million XRP have been offloading coins. Their share of the supply dropped from 11% to 10.32% as of March 1. These exits could be weighing down momentum. The MACD is flashing a bearish crossover on the charts, and the RSI is dipping to 52, both signs of weaker sentiment. Still, XRP is holding above its 50-day EMA of $2.28. Staying above this support is key to avoiding a deeper dip. Web3 ai Delivers Real AI Tools with 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai isn’t just throwing around AI terms; it’s putting real tools in place that help traders act smarter. For example, the platform includes scam detectors that scan contracts instantly and tools that track sentiment for better timing. Portfolio management is also a major focus, helping users make strategic, informed choices with their digital assets. All of these tools will be fully functional upon launch for traders’ daily use. One of the standout aspects is how Web3 ai blends AI into every feature. The system uses long-short-term memory (LSTM) models for price signals and natural language processing (NLP) to track sentiment across platforms. Strategy suggestions are shaped using modern portfolio theory, giving users a strong foundation. These aren’t future promises. They’re already being used. The presale is in Stage 6, with tokens priced at just $0.000383. Web3 ai has already raised over $5.8 million, with the last stage priced at $0.003276. The projected listing price is $0.005242, offering an estimated 1,747% return. That ROI makes Web3 ai one of the cryptos to watch as the market shifts toward real utility. Unlike other platforms that promote vague AI hype, Web3 ai is focused on real benefits. Every tool is made for everyday use. In a space filled with speculation, this project gives traders what they need now, not just later. Summing Up! Market attention shifts fast, but lasting value always comes from solving real problems. Mantra (OM) is riding strong momentum and technical trends. XRP, meanwhile, is struggling to maintain growth due to shrinking activity and less whale support. Web3 ai stands apart by focusing on practical AI tools already in use. The platform is not just planning features, it’s rolling them out. That mix of current value and future potential puts it ahead of many other names. In the list of cryptos to watch, Web3 ai offers the strongest mix of ROI, product development, and user-ready solutions. While others chase headlines, this project is quietly building something lasting.

Altcoins are showing signs of life, and presale opportunities are rising fast. However, while retail traders focus on Ethereum, crypto whales track something else. Nexchain, a new AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain, is quietly gaining momentum. Many people are unaware of Nexchain, but early-stage investors are moving quickly. With its low token price, Nexchain is emerging as a hidden gem. Could this be the next breakout project? The data suggests it might be. And in a market where early entries matter, this might be the best move yet. This one deserves your full attention if you’re looking for the next major crypto presale. Why Big Wallets Are Betting on Nexchain Big wallets are increasingly backing Nexchain as the best crypto presale to invest in today. With a token price of $0.062 and a listing aim of $0.30, the project has already garnered over $3.3 million, providing early investors with an astounding 500% potential return on investment. With Nexchain’s hybrid consensus, which blends Proof-of-Stake with AI, transactions may be processed up to 400,000 times per second with lightning speed. This makes blockchain applications feasible and scalable in the real world. Nexchain uses stringent vesting schedules and anti-whale tokenomics to safeguard investors from whale dumping, guaranteeing equitable token distribution and price stability. Security comes first: Nexchain passed a thorough examination conducted by the top blockchain security company, Certik . Even though it is still in its early stages, Nexchain has a clear and comprehensive roadmap with forthcoming milestones, including mainnet deployment, listings for decentralised exchanges (DEX), and AI-driven integrations. UI teasers and roadmap images provide visible proof of development progress, reassuring investors of ongoing execution. Nexchain offers strong utility with staking rewards and a 10% daily gas fee redistribution to holders, delivering consistent passive income. The platform is designed for simplicity, allowing users to buy tokens easily in just three clicks, supported by comprehensive guides and user-friendly UX walkthroughs. Ethereum’s Current Landscape and Why Investors Are Looking Beyond Ethereum (ETH) just recovered to almost $2,600, about 36% higher than its previous lows. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, with a nearly $319 billion capitalization. The network handles more than 1.2 million transactions daily, with petrol prices averaging around $5 per transaction. Ethereum 2.0 improvements, which go from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus, are the primary focus of Ethereum’s current development. These improvements are intended to decrease transaction costs, increase scalability, and cut energy usage by more than 99%. Institutional interest remains strong, with Ethereum futures daily trading volumes reaching $1.5 billion. Despite its strengths, ETH’s price volatility and relatively high fees remain concerns. Currently priced near $2,600, ETH faces competition from newer projects offering innovative solutions and attractive tokenomics. As Ethereum recovers, some investors focus on Nexchain, an AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain gaining traction with an exciting crypto presale. Why This Presale Has Room to Run Nexchain is still early in its presale journey, making it a prime opportunity for investors tracking crypto presale alerts. The project uses vesting schedules and anti-dump mechanisms to manage the token supply. These features help reduce volatility and promote sustainable market growth. Whales are entering, but Nexchain remains accessible to smaller investors, encouraging broad participation. Investors benefit from staking rewards, tiered incentives, and community growth programs that foster long-term holding. With the next listing price projected around $0.30, early buyers can expect potential returns exceeding 500% ROI. This blend of strong tokenomics, growth incentives, and a clear roadmap positions Nexchain as a presale worth watching. Final Thoughts Nexchain is gaining strong momentum in the crypto presale space, backed by solid fundamentals and growing community interest. Large investors actively take positions, signaling confidence in the project’s potential. With a completed Certik audit , a hybrid consensus model, and well-designed tokenomics, Nexchain stands out as a promising opportunity. For those watching the next big crypto breakout, now is the time to act before Stage 16 begins. This presale is building serious momentum worth nothing.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As altcoins heat up alongside the Nasdaq, Pepeto emerges as the memecoin to watch before its presale window closes. Table of Contents Why analysts move toward Pepeto before the presale closes Pepeto: From meme to market mover Solaxy: A fancy layer? In crypto, clear narratives win: Pepeto has one Presale urgency: The window is closing fast Tokenomics that actually make sense Price forecast: One might jump, the other might soar Pepeto might be the comeback of the year About Pepeto According to the latest news, the rally in altcoins is picking up speed alongside the green moves in the Nasdaq composite. With DOGE and ETH price pushing higher and PEPE Coin maintaining attention, this could be the beginning of a new alt season. Historically, the biggest gains haven’t come from buying at the top, but from spotting strong projects during their ICO or presale phase. That’s where fortunes are made, and smart investors are watching closely. Why analysts move toward Pepeto before the presale closes Not all presales are created equal. In a sea of overpromised crypto projects, two names are starting to stand out, Pepeto and Solaxy. But when the dust settles, only one seems ready to deliver something beyond hype. Both claim to change the game. But while Solaxy talks theory, Pepeto is building. Fast. It’s not just catching attention, it’s converting believers. And that’s a sign worth watching. Pepeto: From meme to market mover Pepeto doesn’t just ride the meme wave, it’s steering it. It wraps the fun of internet culture with a utility-first structure: staking rewards, a zero-fee exchange, and a cross-chain bridge. That’s not just noise, it’s what the meme sector has been missing. This time, investors get both the laughs and the logic. And PepetoSwap? It’s on the way, built for memecoins, powered by actual demand. No recycled roadmaps here. Just smart timing, strong execution, and a fresh strategy that memecoins like Pepe never offered. Solaxy: A fancy layer? Solaxy wants to be the first Layer 2 on Solana, but that’s like installing an elevator in a one-story house. Solana is already fast and low-cost. It doesn’t need the fix Solaxy is trying to sell. That leaves investors wondering if the project is about real value or just clever packaging. Even with a working testnet bridge through Hyperlane, the problem isn’t code, it’s purpose. Solaxy’s tech might be solid, but it’s not clear who needs it or why. And in crypto, uncertainty kills momentum. You might also like: Pepeto vs. Pepe: A new memecoin war begins In crypto, clear narratives win: Pepeto has one Solaxy may be making quiet moves on the backend, but Pepeto is building in public. The branding hits. The story sticks. The product is rolling out. That’s what gets early investors excited. The staking reward alone, 287%, is turning heads. But add in a presale nearly maxed out at $5.2 million, and five big exchange listings already lined up, and it’s obvious: Pepeto is not just another memecoin. It’s a setup for serious growth. Presale urgency: The window is closing fast Unlike vague timelines, Pepeto is putting everything on the table, and it’s happening now. With only a sliver left before a price hike, the momentum is building fast. This isn’t just about buying in early. It’s about entering a token that’s positioning itself right, community-first, feature-ready, and exchange-backed before day one. Tokenomics that actually make sense Pepeto doesn’t inflate for headlines. With 420 trillion total supply and rewards released slowly, 32 million tokens per ETH block, it’s designed to grow without imploding. No sudden dumps. No hidden traps. Just consistent delivery. It’s proof that memecoins don’t need to be empty shells. They can be built with brains, and still deliver fun. Price forecast: One might jump, the other might soar Solaxy could deliver a short-term boost, maybe 300% to 400% after listing, thanks to its tech updates and testnet rollout. But long-term? Its ceiling feels close. Pepeto, on the other hand, is building on a story that’s already alive. With the same 420 trillion max supply as Pepe, strong staking rewards, and growing rumors linking it to Pepe’s untold history, it’s got fuel most tokens only dream of. Add the tools, the timing, and the hype, and it’s not hard to see why many believe Pepeto could climb 100x from here. Pepeto might be the comeback of the year Missed Pepe at the start? Pepeto could be investors’ second shot. This isn’t just another memecoin, this one has a mission, real tools, and a story that’s turning heads. If it gets listed on a top exchange, things could move fast. People are watching, and loading up. Here’s what gives Pepeto its edge: A special exchange just for memecoins Easy cross-chain trading with its own bridge Zero fees for every swap A story of comeback, built by the community About Pepeto Pepeto is what happens when memecoin culture meets real tech. It combines humor, utility, and smart design to reshape what a modern memecoin can be. With PepetoSwap, staking, and multi-chain bridges, it’s creating a real home for meme traders, and doing it early. Traders can go to pepeto.io , connect their MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and get their PEPETO tokens using ETH, USDT, or BNB.

While strengthening the expectation of a new record rise, Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, known for his bold predictions for Bitcoin, announced his new expectation for Bitcoin. Tom Lee, who shared from the X account, said that Bitcoin is about to enter the banana zone phase where it has high growth potential. Lee used analysis shared by Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, in his forecast. According to Bittel’s chart, Bitcoin has gone through four major market cycles since 2011. And each cycle consists of two correction phases before entering a period of rapid growth called “banana territory.” According to the shared chart, the current cycle started in 2022 and is currently experiencing its first correction. The second correction is occurring within the banana zone. If history repeats itself and the cycle continues in the same way, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a major rise. Bitcoin is the way https://t.co/9UxWuRGnLp — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) May 27, 2025 Lee said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year that he expects Bitcoin to surpass $150,000 this year.

We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X. Cork Protocol smart contract exploit details. Source: Cyvers The Cork Protocol exploit is the latest hacking incident to impact the crypto industry as cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in the sector, lowering consumer confidence , and prompting calls to improve security measures from crypto industry executives.

Sui validators froze a majority of the funds , sparking a debate about the centralization of the network and the appropriate course of action for blockchain validators following a major hacking incident. The Cetus team announced a $6 million bounty for white hat hackers assisting in the return of the remaining stolen funds. Blockchain security firm Dedaub released a post-mortem report dissecting the incident details. According to the report, the hack was caused by an exploit of the liquidity parameters used by the Cetus automated market maker (AMM). The hackers manipulated the field by altering values that went undetected in a most significant bits (MSB) check. Changes to a binary code’s most significant bits dramatically alter the values produced by that binary code. This allowed the hackers to add massive amounts of liquidity to the system with only a keystroke and drain other liquidity pools of hundreds of millions of dollars.

A few altcoins are emerging as leading candidates to double in value by mid-2025 as the market prepares for what many see as the next big bull run. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) is at the forefront of this field. Pi Network (PI), PEPE, Mantle (MNT), and Kaspa (KAS) are all promising contenders. Rexas Finance (RXS): Transforming Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance, a platform that enables users to tokenize almost any real-world asset—commodities, real estate, precious metals, or intellectual property—is at the vanguard of innovation. One of the most exciting developments in blockchain technology right now is tokenization, which Rexas Finance is enabling to be usable and accessible by a worldwide audience. By allowing fractional ownership of valuable assets, the platform increases transparency, liquidity, and democracy in investment. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, Rexas Finance has completed a thorough security audit by CertiK, guaranteeing investor confidence and user protection. Thanks to sophisticated tools like the Rexas Token Builder, users don’t need to write code to launch their asset-backed tokens. The Rexas Launchpad supports token fundraising campaigns, and Rexas GenAI gives creators additional opportunities by leveraging AI to produce ready NFTs for the market. Rexas has raised over $48.6 million of its $56 million target and is currently in Presale Stage 12. A debut price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025, from a current presale price of $0.20 shows a solid foundational value even before public trading starts. As adoption rises and significant exchange listings increase in 2025, Rexas Finance may easily earn 100% or higher returns given its position in the expanding real-world asset (RWA) industry. Pi Network (PI): An Emerging Sleeping Giant Pi Network (PI), a startup that seeks to make cryptocurrency mining as simple as tapping your smartphone screen, is another altcoin to monitor closely. Pi has one of the biggest grassroots crypto communities with over 30 million users worldwide. Since Pi mining is portable and energy-efficient, it lowers the entry barrier for millions of people worldwide, unlike traditional mining, which requires costly equipment. Since Pi is currently in an enclosed mainnet phase, coins are not yet available for trading on open markets. However, the project’s projected market capitalization is already above $4.1 billion, and this scarcity has only increased demand for its future listing. A significant price increase is anticipated when Pi moves to an open mainnet, which is tradeable on well-known platforms. Given its substantial user base and competitive edge in mobile mining, PI has the potential to double in value by June 2025. PEPE (PEPE): The Durable Meme Currency PEPE is challenging the conventional wisdom that meme currencies are transient hype factories. PEPE has established itself as one of the leading meme-based cryptocurrencies with a 24-hour turnover of $450 million and a market capitalization of over $3.3 billion. Memes are not the only factor contributing to their success; clever marketing, robust liquidity, and widespread community support are also important. PEPE stands out as a seasoned cryptocurrency prepared for its next surge, as meme coins have typically prospered throughout bull cycles. PEPE is well-positioned to produce another spectacular surge after having already withstood market turbulence and held its position. By the middle of 2025, PEPE might yield 100% or more returns if the upcoming meme coin season is successful. Mantle (MNT): Institutional Appeal and Layer-2 Efficiency Since Layer-2 solutions provide quicker and less expensive alternatives to Layer-1 congestion, they have grown in importance within the Ethereum ecosystem. With a market valuation of more than $2.4 billion and a modular architecture that isolates execution from data availability, Mantle (MNT) is among the most promising projects in this field. Speed and lower transaction costs are essential aspects of this system that appeal to developers and institutions. Mantle is becoming more popular in fields like Web3 infrastructure, DeFi, and GameFi. Due to its robust technical foundation and strategic approach, it is a strong contender for widespread adoption. Layer-2 solutions like Mantle will become even more crucial as Ethereum’s user base grows, setting up MNT for potentially enormous growth in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): The Quickest Proof-of-Work Blockchain Kaspa (KAS) provides security and decentralization for people who value both. Similar to Bitcoin, Kaspa is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency. Still, it differs significantly in that it uses the blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) design, which enables the creation of several blocks simultaneously. This preserves the fundamental security advantages of PoW while making Kaspa extremely quick, with block times of less than a second. Kaspa is an inexpensive entry with significant growth potential. With a price of less than $0.10 and a total supply of more than 26 billion tokens, Kaspa’s creative consensus design and devoted mining community could propel it to new heights as more consumers seek scalable and decentralized solutions. It has shown encouraging performance thus far, and if momentum keeps up, a 100% gain by June 2025 is achievable. Conclusion Concentrating on projects with solid fundamentals, distinct use cases, and vibrant communities is the best approach to disproportionate gains in the vast and somewhat bewildering cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance stands out with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization and its long-term growth narrative backed by security and utility. On the other hand, Pi Network, PEPE, Mantle, and Kaspa provide distinct value propositions to the cryptocurrency market, ranging from scaling solutions and PoW innovation to mobile mining and meme virality. These five altcoins are in a strong position to provide consistent growth and potentially transformative gains as the next crypto cycle peak draws near. These names should remain at the top of the watchlists of investors who want to make audacious yet strategic market moves.

This development, while long speculated in blockchain circles, marks a potentially transformative convergence between the centuries-old financial messaging giant and cutting-edge distributed ledger technology (DLT), positioning XRP at the heart of global payment infrastructure. The Intersection of SWIFT, R3 Corda, and XRP SWIFT , formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is the backbone of international banking communication, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. Traditionally, SWIFT has only handled the messaging layer of cross-border transactions — the actual money settlement still takes days due to intermediaries, reconciliations, and liquidity bottlenecks. Blockchain technology, with its promise of near-instant settlement and transparency, has long been eyed as the key to modernizing this outdated system. SWIFT using R3 Corda to settle payments using XRP. pic.twitter.com/zkzExHU4Ib — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Enter R3 Corda, a leading enterprise blockchain platform designed to facilitate secure, direct transactions between financial institutions. Unlike public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, Corda is designed for enterprise use, enabling private and permissioned transactions that meet stringent regulatory and privacy standards. Importantly, R3, the consortium behind Corda, has maintained a longstanding relationship with Ripple, the company behind XRP, and has developed capabilities for XRP settlement within its ecosystem. SMQKE’s post draws attention to what appears to be the formal integration of these elements: SWIFT using R3 Corda’s blockchain network as a settlement layer, with XRP acting as the digital asset bridging currency. This combination — SWIFT’s vast reach, Corda’s enterprise-grade DLT, and XRP’s speed and liquidity — could reshape the flow of international payments. Why XRP Is Central to This Integration XRP has always stood out among digital assets due to its design as a bridge currency for cross-border payments . Unlike Bitcoin, which is often compared to digital gold, or Ethereum, which serves as a base layer for decentralized applications, XRP’s primary use case is to facilitate fast, low-cost transfers of value between disparate currencies. RippleNet, Ripple’s global payments network, already uses XRP in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors, eliminating the need for pre-funded nostro-vostro accounts and unlocking trapped capital for financial institutions. With SWIFT reportedly now tapping into this ecosystem through R3 Corda, XRP’s utility appears to be expanding significantly. Instead of merely operating within Ripple’s proprietary network, XRP could now serve as a settlement asset across the vast SWIFT network, potentially powering real-time cross-border transactions between thousands of banks. This elevates XRP from a niche liquidity solution to a crucial component of the global financial system. Implications for Global Payments The integration of SWIFT, Corda, and XRP could have seismic implications for the future of global payments. Firstly, settlement times could plummet from several days to mere seconds, dramatically improving the efficiency of international trade, remittances, and capital flows. Banks and corporations would benefit from reduced operational costs, minimized counterparty risk, and enhanced liquidity management. The use of XRP, a neutral digital asset, reduces the need for correspondent banking networks that typically rely on dominant reserve currencies such as the US dollar and euro. This could democratize access to efficient cross-border payments, especially for emerging markets and smaller financial institutions that often face prohibitive costs in the current system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Thirdly, by leveraging R3 Corda’s permissioned blockchain, SWIFT can offer a high degree of privacy and regulatory compliance — two critical concerns for the conservative financial industry — while still harnessing the benefits of public digital assets such as XRP. This hybrid model blends the best of both worlds: the speed and innovation of crypto, with the security and oversight of traditional finance. A Long-Awaited Milestone For years, the crypto community has speculated about when — or if — SWIFT would embrace blockchain technology in a meaningful way. While SWIFT has conducted DLT trials, the move to settle payments with XRP via R3 Corda is one of the most substantial and impactful steps taken so far. It signals not just an experiment, but a potential production-level deployment that could redefine how value moves across borders. Moreover, this development places XRP at the forefront of institutional-grade blockchain adoption, countering narratives that its utility was limited to Ripple’s network. It reinforces XRP’s position as a neutral, highly liquid settlement asset and offers new momentum for its broader adoption by financial institutions worldwide. Looking Ahead As the global financial system continues to evolve under the pressure of technological innovation, partnerships and integrations like the one reported by SMQKE are critical markers of where the future is headed. The marriage of SWIFT’s entrenched network, R3 Corda’s enterprise blockchain, and XRP’s digital liquidity creates a powerful trifecta capable of transforming cross-border payments at scale. While the details of the implementation and rollout timeline remain to be fully disclosed, the significance of this development cannot be overstated. It represents a major leap forward for blockchain’s role in mainstream finance and underscores the growing recognition of XRP as a key player in the emerging digital economy. In the coming months, market watchers, financial institutions, and crypto enthusiasts alike will be closely monitoring how this integration unfolds — and whether it paves the way for a new era of faster, cheaper, and more inclusive global payments.

45208438,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68812,1748448565,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Hyperliquid Eyes $40 ATH As Whales Come Out To Play, Is This The Future Of Crypto Perps Trading?",https://timestabloid.com/hyperliquid-eyes-40-ath-as-whales-come-out-to-play/,"While Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to ride high on whale interest and explosive trading volumes, the crypto market is erupting with buzz about a more intelligent wave, one powered by AI. As investors and whales chase the next crypto gem, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has captured significant attention, positioning itself to front-run the entire crypto space in 2025. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Future of Meme Coins In a market overrun with speculative assets and hype-dependent meme tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is changing the narrative. Designed with self-sufficient AI utility, the memecoin is an intelligent financial instrument that reshapes the way crypto behaves. What separates this AI coin from the crowd is its zero-tax transactional structure, a rare find in the meme coin sector. Many investors are wary of Ethereum gas fees and slippages that can erode gains; the meme coin counters this with no transaction tax and a streamlined, frictionless ecosystem. The meme-based cryptocurrency also provides smart staking options, passive income opportunities, and liquidity mining for those looking to grow their portfolio while they hold. With 1% of every transaction permanently burned, FloppyPepe (FPPE) smartly enforces scarcity while redistributing another 1% to loyal holders. This deflationary model incentivizes long-term holding and consistently lifts token value. With AI cryptocurrencies booming, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the most strategically built coin in the sector. The presale price remains attractively low at $0.00000035 , and with a projected post-launch surge of 17,200%, the upside for investors is staggering. A modest $1,000 investment at this level could potentially return $172,999. Massive Utility, Real AI Power: Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Undeniable FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI-driven ecosystem includes features like FloppyX , an automated video content generator that responds dynamically to market conditions. Whether it’s meme creation with the Meme-o-Matic tool or generating viral content from a simple text prompt, the meme coin equips the average crypto user with tools once reserved for marketing giants. FloppyAI , the meme coin’s interactive AI bot, is not just a gimmick; it’s a fully capable agent pulling from a real-time, crypto-specific dataset to generate informed, witty, or educational responses. Users can chat live with it, making the token more engaging than any competitor. With its SolidProof- audited smart contract solidifies its credibility. Add a powerful 80% presale extra tokens with code “ FLOPPY80 ,” and early investors and whales gain a significant edge, especially with whales now accumulating massive bags ahead of the next bullish cycle. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Whales Drive Futures Platform Into The Spotlight Hyperliquid (HYPE) has surged into the spotlight of crypto traders. A decentralized perpetual exchange, HYPE has become the preferred playground for whales looking to leverage long positions on low-cap assets. Hyperliquid (HYPE) provides one fluid platform for whales to interact with crypto across multiple chains. With its own ATH target of $40 on perpetual, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has the liquidity and technology backbone that institutional crypto players love. But while Hyperliquid (HYPE) dominates crypto perp trading headlines, its appeal mostly serves seasoned traders. Notably, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is currently trading at $37.32, reflecting a slight 2.8% decline in the last 24 hours. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Smartest Bet For 2025 Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) potential $40 mark is impressive to whales, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) checks all their boxes: zero tax, AI-powered utility, sustainable tokenomics, deflationary mechanics, and a high-yield staking ecosystem. With a projected 17,200% upside and whales already making bold moves, this meme coin is primed to become the benchmark of AI meme coins. For those who missed out on Dogecoin’s rise or Shiba Inu’s explosive rallies, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the reset button. The second stage of presale is active, but with the FLOPPY80 bonus, every dollar counts double. The time is ticking away; investors and whales are urged to take advantage of this one-time bonus and low token cost, as the price may never see this level again.
