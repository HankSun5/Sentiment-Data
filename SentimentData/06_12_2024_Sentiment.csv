($GME) shares experienced a massive boost on Thursday after a cryptic post by Keith Gill, the influential figure behind the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy. The post immediately reignited investor interest, causing GameStop’s shares to spike and the Roaring Kitty meme to pump. Roaring Kitty’s Cryptic Post Sends $GME Stock Soaring 15% – What’s His Next Move? Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” has once again stirred up the markets with a cryptic post on social media platform X . Gill, a key figure in GameStop’s 2021 retail trading frenzy, shared an image of a Time magazine cover featuring a computer with an old video player. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Known online as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and “DeepF***ingValue” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, Gill posted an image of a Time magazine cover with a computer screen on the social media platform X. The post triggered a 15% spike in GameStop’s stock price, leading to trading halts on platforms like Robinhood due to heightened volatility. The ripple effect extended to the digital asset market, where a GameStop-inspired meme coin on the Solana blockchain skyrocketed by 65%. Gill, a former financial adviser from Massachusetts, initially gained fame in 2021 by championing GameStop as a retail investor opportunity. This sparked a retail trading frenzy that sent the stock soaring over 10,000% at its peak. Roaring Kitty Returns: Keith Gill Sparks Market Chaos After Three-Year Silence Gill’s recent social media activity comes after a three-year hiatus, during which his followers eagerly awaited his return. Many see him as a symbol of retail investors’ triumph over Wall Street, likening him to a modern David against Goliath. The GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, sparked by Gill’s bullish posts, extended to other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment. The collective effort by Reddit users to squeeze hedge funds resulted in billions of dollars in losses for institutional investors and drew the attention of regulators. The dramatic events of the Reddit rally were later dramatized in Craig Gillespie’s 2023 film Dumb Money. The 2021 rally also raised questions about market fairness, particularly after trading restrictions were imposed on retail investors. These measures drew allegations of manipulation, as hedge funds held large short positions in GameStop during the peak of the trading frenzy. By Thursday afternoon, trading activity around GameStop had intensified, with about 300,000 options contracts changing hands—approximately 1.5 times the usual trading volume, according to a Reuters report . The stock’s 30-day implied volatility, a measure of expected short-term price movements, also jumped to 132%, marking a three-week high. Among the most popular trades were contracts betting that GameStop’s stock price would exceed $30 by the end of the week, with 32,000 such options traded by late afternoon. A Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, Chewy (CHWY), surged nearly 28% after the return of Roaring Kitty , famous for the GameStop short squeeze. Gill posted a cryptic image on X on September 6 , sparking speculation among traders. The post featured a Toy Story meme with the Chewy logo, which some interpreted as a signal that Gill might be stepping back from his role at Chewy. Despite no technical utility, meme coins like CHWY thrive on social sentiment, making Gill’s posts influential for traders.

On Dec. 5, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100,000 barrier, just weeks after surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12, as reported by TradingView. Shortly after, Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $104,000 at 3:08 a.m. UTC, roughly 90 minutes after breaking the $100,000 threshold. The surge was fueled by over $31 billion in net inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tightened supply due to Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April. Donald Trump’s Victory Boosts Bitcoin Rally Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, alongside speculation of a strategic Bitcoin national reserve and increased corporate adoption led by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Additionally, Trump’s Dec. 4 nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair has sparked optimism. This move could eliminate regulatory barriers that have hindered the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Trump’s pro-crypto cabinet includes Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as nominees for Secretary of Treasury and Commerce, respectively, potentially creating the most crypto-friendly administration to date. Bitcoin Up 126% in 2024 Bitcoin’s value has increased by 126% since Jan. 1, when it traded at $44,000. Its market capitalization has now reached a record $2 trillion for the first time. While Bitcoin’s 2024 rally is impressive, it isn’t its most dramatic. In 2017, Bitcoin soared 1,900%, rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. Similarly, between March 2020 and November 2021, it surged 1,250%, climbing from $5,100 to $69,000.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 22:55:00

Yesterday, Coinbase announced the listing of Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin. “Moo Deng (MOODENG) is now live on http://coinbase.com & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” Moo Deng is the name of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand, this past summer. The hippo has become an internet sensation, inspiring memes and memecoins alike. Moo Deng means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Our favorite bouncy pork a.k.a Moo Deng ?? #moodeng @KhaokheowZoo @MooDengSOL pic.twitter.com/5cJl9oJD82 — Moo Deng (@moodengx) December 1, 2024 In November, Moo Deng went viral again by correctly “ predicting ” the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Despite Moo Deng’s internet fame, MOODENG has faltered in the hours following the Coinbase listing. Approximately 24 hours following the memecoin’s addition to Coinbase, MOODENG is down 12.4%. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto markets are largely surging following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) historic breakthrough of $100,000. In stark contrast with MOODENG’s struggles, another Solana-based memecoin ripped after Coinbase added support on Wednesday. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, pumped up 51% after the top US crypto exchange listed the memecoin.

Ceffu is an institutional partner of Binance, and this arrangement will support the EOS mainnet. The partnership will be critical in unlocking the new CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders while providing institutional-grade custodian services. Ceffu’s advanced custody infrastructure guarantees the institution’s safety on its EOS assets. Relying on multi-party computation and customized approval schemes highlights how seriously the firm has taken security matters. The arrangement will allow institutional fund handlers to use CeDeFi strategies that grasp the best of CEX and DeFi ecosystems. Through Binance liquidity and robust trading styles, EOS token holders can access the innovative yield solution tailored to institutional needs. With this partnership, though, there is a growing focus on institutional solutions. EOS seems to alienate retail holders and small-scale entities, so this partnership may bring very few benefits to small-scale blockchain users. EOS remains one of the top blockchain platforms With EOS featured on the Coinbase COIN50 index , its popularity and interest are growing among institutions. This recognition shows that EOS is among the leading blockchain platforms and an integral player in the crypto ecosystem. According to Yves La Rose, Founder & CEO of EOS Network Foundation, Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. He added that by partnering with Ceffu, they are creating new pathways for institutions to participate securely in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities. The EOS network is significant in this partnership. The third-generation blockchain that operates on the EOS virtual machine is set for high-speed and low-cost transactions. The design supports seamless Web3 for all players, developers, and users alike. Even though the partnership looks good, Ceffu’s ties with Binance might be a regulatory risk. Binance is sustainedly scrutinized in several jurisdictions. High innovations with strategic tokenomics build the EOS ecosystem Due to approved community tokenomics, EOS has seen regular growth, enhanced by performance improvements. One of its new tokenomics strategies is committing a funding portfolio for middleware with the executed Unicove doorway beaming the new entrance process and enhancing user experience. Also, a staking rewards plan distributes $450 worth of EOS. The plan, which has been in motion for more than five months, has led to more people taking EOS while extending the token lock-up time to almost one month. These simple yet strategic tokenomics are the cornerstone that strengthens the EOS ecosystem. They show how versatile, robust, and appealing the system is. Most EOS token holders see the partnership between EOS and Ceffu as a step in the right direction. It would guarantee the security of assets across various networks.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 23:29:00

Bitcoin Argentina, one of the nation’s top pro-crypto pressure groups, made its claims in an official statement published on December 4. The NGO claimed that the National Securities Commission (CNV)’s move to force all crypto exchanges in the company to register and share client data runs counter to the policies of the “libertarian” President Javier Milei. Crypto Exchange Regulations Hurt Argentina’s Cause, NGO Claims Earlier this year, the CNV began policing exchanges for the first time, requiring them to adhere to the kind of regulations now commonplace in Western Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea. However, Bitcoin Argentina said that the CNV’s new registry system is bringing “distortions and inefficiencies” to the crypto sector. President Javier Milei’s approval rating recovered last month as the economy showed signs of recovery and inflation cooled to its lowest point in nearly three years. https://t.co/H5y3uO7JyP — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 4, 2024 The NGO said the regulator should scrap its policies and “limit its scope” to fighting “money laundering.” The CNV has committed itself to creating the registry, with all “digital asset service providers (PSAVs)” obliged to apply for operating permits. However, the NGO claims that the regulator is trying to fix non-existent issues “in a sector that currently operates without problems.” La Nina could thwart Argentina's run at bumper crops https://t.co/sqW2JQQhLa pic.twitter.com/yENcfcXaTE — Reuters (@Reuters) December 5, 2024 “The current system is not a far-off, uncertain, or new market. It is not a sector in crisis or emergency. It is an existing one. And it works well. While the new rules will benefit some players in the ecosystem, they will stifle the growth of others. And it will do nothing to prevent the emergence of future scams.” Bitcoin Argentina And Bitcoin Argentina went a step further, claiming that the rules also “pose a risk for the CNV itself” and for crypto traders in the country. The NGO explained that this was due to the fact that it fails to “provide greater security tools” and “will even create a false sense of security and supervision.” Essentially granting firms the CNV “seal of approval” in “a market that is eminently risky, asymmetric, global, and unmanageable” would be a major risk, it said. “Argentina has a unique opportunity to commit to deregulation and maintain the freedom that has yielded such good results so far. We could model that for the rest of the world.” Ricardo Mihura, Bitcoin Argentina President ‘A Burden for Smaller Businesses’ The NGO’s President Ricardo Mihura said he “cannot understand how the CNV” had chosen to “deviate from the government’s deregulatory approach and propose an inefficient regulatory burden.” The NGO also warned of “immediate consequences” for “small businesses and self-employed workers,” who would be “forced out of the sector or dragged into illegality.” “Regulatory costs” could also cripple “new” Argentinian crypto projects in the future, Mihura noted.

Desde BitcoinAr se presentó esta semana una posición formal respecto del proyecto de regulación del Registro de Proveedores de Servicios de Activos Virtuales… pic.twitter.com/iy6rHal6lc — ONG Bitcoin Argentina (@BitcoinAR) December 4, 2024 And Rodrigo Andragnes, the NGRO’s founder claimed that the CNV should “take the necessary technical time to analyze whether regulating PSAVs really adds value to the community.” Crypto adoption has rocketed in Argentina in recent years, with stablecoin and Bitcoin buying on the rise. IMF Role? Most think the CNV’s crypto exchange regulations were intended as a gesture of good faith to the Intentional Monetary Fund, which has previously expressed concerns about the nation’s lack of crypto regulation.

And the CNV has also held several BTC adoption-themed meetings with its counterparts in El Salvador. It has also hinted at its softening stance on crypto by attending local crypto summits .

What Next For Bitcoin Price Following Rally To $100,000 In a recent TradingView post, Xanrox suggested that the Bitcoin price will unlikely enjoy a sustained rally for now. He explained that this is unlikely because a sustained rally could easily put Bitcoin at $600,000 by December 2025, which is impossible. As such, he believes that BTC would need to slow down.

Xanrox remarked that the market needs to see a shakeout and a flash crash first before anything else. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $85,000 when this correction finally happens. Xanrox stated that the $85,000 level is a very reasonable support because it is the end of the massive FVG (fair value gap) on the daily candles. He added that this target is also the start of the first price action on the volume profile. The crypto analyst revealed that this is the level at which he is looking to buy Bitcoin. The crypto analyst indicated that this Bitcoin price rally to $100,000 is a bull trap, as he highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. He said this looks like a bull trap for retail traders because everyone would buy the breakout. As such, he envisages that Bitcoin would make a last push to sweep liquidity. A Major Correction Might Not Come Anytime Soon On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered a diverging opinion, suggesting that a major correction might not come anytime soon for the Bitcoin price. In his recent X post, he alluded to a previous post in which he stated that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally If this pattern holds true, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price won’t suffer its first major correction of between 15% to 30% until its hits $135,000 or even $159,000. Meanwhile, the accompanying chart put the market top for Bitcoin at $240,000, indicating that it will still have more room to move the upside even after this correction. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,800, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Monero (XMR) just hit a two-year high of $211, fuelled by growing interest in privacy coins. At the same time, Immutable X (IMX) has taken the Web3 gaming world by storm with its $1 million player rewards initiative alongside Yield Guild Games (YGG). But the crown jewel of short-term crypto plays might just be Qubetics ($TICS) . Its presale is smashing records, with $4.4 million already raised and projections of insane ROI that have investors buzzing. What makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the innovation. The project’s Multi-Chain Wallet aims to solve real-world headaches for users, from freelancers needing quick cross-border payments to businesses managing assets across multiple blockchains. This is more than hype—it’s crypto stepping up to meet the demands of the modern world. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Revolutionises Asset Management Qubetics is taking the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 11th stage of its presale, it has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising a whopping $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, this is an opportunity that screams potential. But you’ll need to act fast—the price is set to climb by 10% this weekend when the 12th stage begins. The standout feature of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet , a tool that’s set to revolutionise how we manage digital assets. Imagine being a freelancer working with clients in different countries, each paying you in a different cryptocurrency. Normally, you’d spend hours juggling wallets and calculating conversion fees. Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies all of this, consolidating your assets in one secure place and automating conversions at competitive rates. Click here to learn more about how Qubetics makes cross-border payments as easy as a walk in the park with its multi-chain wallet. For businesses, the potential is just as massive. Picture an e-commerce store accepting payments in multiple cryptos or a logistics company managing supply chain payments across different blockchains. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates the hassle, offering a seamless experience that saves time and money. And then there are the numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, a staggering 783% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS is expected to climb to $1, delivering 3,434% returns. If it reaches $15 after its mainnet launch, you’re looking at an unbelievable 52,912% ROI. Let’s break it down. A $12,500 investment at today’s price of $0.0282 could grow to $111,066 by the presale’s end. If $TICS hits $1, your $12.5K turns into $442,335. And if it rockets to $15? You’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $6.63 million. That’s not just a win; it’s a game-changer . Monero (XMR): Privacy Coins Make a Comeback Monero is back in the spotlight, hitting a two-year high of $211 before settling at $205.05. Privacy coins as a category have surged over 12% in just 24 hours, with Monero leading the charge. What’s behind the buzz? A landmark U.S. court ruling on Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts has reignited interest in privacy-centric cryptos. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to shield transaction details, offering a level of anonymity akin to physical cash. For advocates, this isn’t just a feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is increasingly under threat. Critics, of course, argue that privacy coins are magnets for illicit activity, but Monero has held its ground, even as regulatory scrutiny ramps up. The surge in Monero’s price also reflects broader market interest in privacy coins, with other tokens like Haven, Verge, and Zcash posting impressive weekly gains. As the debate over financial privacy heats up, Monero’s resilience makes it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for those betting on continued market momentum. Immutable X (IMX): Redefining Web3 Gaming Immutable X is making waves in the gaming industry, partnering with Yield Guild Games (YGG) to allocate $1 million towards player rewards. This isn’t just a feel-good initiative; it’s a strategic move to dominate the Web3 gaming landscape. The partnership aims to create new earning opportunities for players and developers while expanding the ecosystem with Immutable’s cutting-edge Passport wallet and zkEVM scaling solution. Why does this matter for short-term investors? The gaming industry is massive, and Immutable X is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 developers. Its sponsorship of YGG’s Play Summit and the GAM3 Awards in Manila underscores its commitment to fostering a community-driven gaming experience. As the hype around Web3 gaming grows, so does the potential for IMX to see significant price appreciation. IMX isn’t just about gaming; it’s about creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a gamer earning rewards or a developer building the next hit game, Immutable X offers a platform that’s both scalable and user-friendly. For short-term investors, the buzz around IMX and its increasing adoption in the gaming sector make it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term . As more developers and players flock to its platform, the likelihood of a price spike grows, making now the perfect time to get in on the action. The Final Word: Top Short-Term Crypto Picks for 2024 When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , Qubetics, Monero, and Immutable X stand out for their unique strengths and growth potential. Qubetics offers unparalleled ROI projections and game-changing tools like the Multi-Chain Wallet. Monero is riding the wave of renewed interest in privacy coins, while Immutable X is set to redefine gaming with its innovative approach to Web3. The clock’s ticking, though. The Qubetics presale price won’t stay this low for long, and the momentum behind Monero and IMX could lead to quick price spikes. Don’t sit this one out—take action now and position yourself for short-term gains that could make a lasting impact.

This bullish trajectory signals a seismic shift in its journey from niche digital currency to a global financial asset. During an interview, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offered insights into the asset’s historic rally and implications. He weighed in on regulatory shifts and leadership changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Surge to $103,900: What’s Driving It? Bitcoin crossed $103,900 for the first time, fueled by strong institutional interest and regulatory changes. Tenev highlighted how Bitcoin’s perception has shifted from being dismissed to being taken seriously. This notion was further supported by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who recently compared Bitcoin to gold. Powell positioned Bitcoin as a speculative asset that competes with gold, not the dollar. This reassured crypto supporters, affirming Bitcoin’s status as a store of value. Tenev also mentioned the growing idea of Bitcoin being used as a reserve asset, similar to gold in national reserves. Many see its limited supply and decentralized nature as valuable for wealth protection. Institutional investors and governments increasingly view Bitcoin as a long-term wealth safeguard. As Bitcoin’s value soared, Robinhood became a major player in facilitating crypto transactions. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto trades in November, a 400% increase from the previous month. This surge highlights growing retail investor interest, with Robinhood’s services making crypto more accessible. Tenev stressed that regulatory clarity is key to maintaining this momentum. Paul Atkins’ Nomination Brings Hope for Crypto-Friendly Regulation The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair has stirred optimism within the crypto industry. Known for his pro-business stance, Atkins is expected to bring a more balanced approach to crypto regulation. Tenev contrasted this with the current administration’s regulatory framework, which he described as hostile to crypto. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also supported Atkins’ nomination. Garlinghouse expressed hope that his leadership would prioritize clear guidelines over harsh enforcement. Tenev argued that supportive policies could drive innovation and stability for crypto firms, contrasting with Gary Gensler ’s more cautious regulatory approach. Clearer regulations, he believes, would boost confidence and growth in the crypto market. The Road Ahead: A Bullish Outlook Financial experts believe that Bitcoin’s price could reach $120,000 by the end of the year if current trends persist. This optimism is fueled by continued institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and a growing consensus that Bitcoin is here to stay . As Bitcoin cements its place as digital gold, discussions on its regulation and adoption will shape the financial future. With industry leaders driving innovation and policymakers like Atkins offering support, crypto assets’s future looks bright.

This wallet has also gained profit from the Bitcoin price movement, with more than $28 million in unrealised profit. It is stated by Arkham that the Bitcoin owned by the UK government is a seized asset from Zhimin Qian, a fraudster with a multi-billion pound scam. “The UK government now holds $6 billion USD of Bitcoin.

As December 2024 unfolds, a new wave of meme coins is here, sparking both curiosity and FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. What makes this month particularly special? It’s all about the coins that mix cheeky charm with serious growth potential. BTFD , Notcoin, and Memecoin are the headline-makers right now, each bringing a unique spin to the meme coin space. Whether you’re after explosive presales, viral campaigns, or chaotic unpredictability, these coins have something for everyone. Let’s dive into why they’re being hailed as the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BFTD: The Veteran Making Waves Again BFTD, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” stands out as a meme coin that has managed to balance its playful identity with meaningful innovation. In December 2024, BFTD has cemented its reputation as more than just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem offering significant value to its community. Investors are drawn not just by the meme culture but also by its ecosystem that includes P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a strong utility-first approach. Currently trading at $0.000064 in Stage 7 , BFTD’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling more than 23 billion tokens. With a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors stand to gain returns of over 800%. For example, an investment of $5,000 now could fetch approximately 78,203,125 tokens. When BFTD hits its listing price, that investment could grow to $46,921—a compelling reason why it’s hailed as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024 . The excitement doesn’t stop there. BFTD’s partnership with gaming platforms and its reward-driven ecosystem are key factors in its rising popularity. With over 2,400 holders and counting, BFTD is not just a meme coin but a movement. Its potential to rival the meme coin giants of the past makes it a must-watch this month. Notcoin: The Meme Coin with a Mission NOTCOIN takes meme culture to the next level by parodying the very concept of cryptocurrency. Its tagline, “This Is Not a Coin,” has sparked a wave of curiosity, turning it into a viral sensation. But behind its ironic branding lies a serious project that’s making waves in the crypto community. At its core, NOTCOIN is about decentralised governance. The coin’s holders vote on key project decisions, making it one of the most community-driven meme coins on the market. Its DAO structure is a refreshing departure from the typical top-down approach seen in many crypto projects. This unique governance model has earned NOTCOIN a dedicated following, cementing its place among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. . NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns are unmatched. Its recent stunt involving a billboard in Times Square that simply said “This Is Not a Coin” generated millions of impressions online. This kind of marketing, paired with its innovative features, is driving adoption at a rapid pace. At its current price of $0.00009, analysts predict it could reach $0.001 by mid-2025, making it a high-potential investment for those looking to ride the meme coin wave. NOTCOIN is also making strides in utility. It recently announced a partnership with a major social media platform to integrate tipping using NOTCOIN, bringing real-world use cases to its holders. Whether it’s for fun, governance, or potential profit, NOTCOIN offers something for every kind of investor. Memecoin: The Wild Card of December 2024 Memecoin is the wildcard in this month’s meme coin race. While its name might seem generic, its approach is anything but. MEMECOIN thrives on unpredictability, using its lack of a strict roadmap as a marketing tactic. This “no-plan plan” approach has drawn in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on chaos. The coin’s recent rise in popularity is fuelled by its outrageous marketing stunts and viral memes that capture the internet’s ever-changing zeitgeist. At its current price of $0.00005, MEMECOIN’s low entry point makes it an attractive option for new investors. While its long-term viability is uncertain, its potential for explosive short-term gains is undeniable. Many see it as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., purely for its entertainment value and speculative potential. Conclusion The world of meme coins is as dynamic as it is unpredictable, but one thing is clear: December 2024 belongs to BTFD and NOTCOIN. These two projects bring a mix of humour, utility, and community-driven energy that sets them apart. MEMECOIN adds an element of wild unpredictability to the mix, making it a must-watch for risk-takers. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., BTFD’s utility-rich ecosystem and NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns and governance model make them standout choices. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these high-potential projects.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 00:16:17

On Dec. 4, Kraken released its Crypto FOMO Survey 2024 , examining the impact of fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on U.S. crypto holders’ investment decisions. The survey polled 1,248 participants, revealing how emotions influence their approach to digital assets. Investors Feel They Missed the Boat A significant portion of respondents expressed regret over missed opportunities. Kraken reported that 88% of survey participants believe they’ve lost out on major gains. This sentiment has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally, which saw BTC hit the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 for the first time. Bitcoin has surged 126% since January, driving the broader crypto market. Altcoins have also seen substantial growth. XRP recently overtook Solana and Tether to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite feelings of missed opportunities, 84% of respondents remain optimistic about future crypto gains. Emotions Influence Decisions When asked about their greatest concerns, 60% cited sudden price surges as the biggest missed opportunity. Additionally, 81% admitted making investment decisions based on FUD, while 84% said they acted on FOMO during price spikes. The survey also revealed that 63% of participants believe emotional decisions have negatively impacted their portfolios. A Methodical Approach is Key While market sentiment plays a role in investment decisions, Kraken emphasized the importance of a calculated strategy. The exchange recommends leveraging technical analysis and planned trading strategies to navigate the volatile crypto market.

Here’s What to Watch For,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cutting-edge-coin-transform-blockchain-forever-heres-what-to-watch-for/,"Blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed, and with it comes a wave of groundbreaking innovations. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the crypto world lately, one name might already be buzzing on your radar— Lightchain AI . This isn’t just another blockchain project vying for attention. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI promises to merge the boundless possibilities of blockchain with the unparalleled power of AI. But can it transform blockchain forever? Let’s dig into what makes this cutting-edge coin so intriguing. Why Investors Can’t Stop Talking About Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has emerged as a beacon of innovation in the crowded crypto space. Here’s why investors, crypto enthusiasts, and tech pioneers are excited about its potential to transform the future of decentralized systems. 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Most blockchain systems rely on traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). While effective, these systems demand significant energy or financial commitments to validate transactions. Enter Proof of Intelligence (PoI) . Unlike PoW or PoS, PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computational AI tasks, such as training machine learning models or enhancing algorithms, while still maintaining the integrity and security of the network. This means Lightchain AI doesn’t just reward for validation—it pushes the boundaries of what a blockchain can achieve by tapping into the growing demand for advanced AI computations. 2. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Redefining Decentralized Applications At the heart of Lightchain AI ‘s innovation lies its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . Think of it as a powerful computational brain designed to supercharge decentralized applications (dApps). Where traditional virtual machines are limited by static capabilities, the AIVM is dynamic and adaptable. It allows developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks, from processing natural language data to running predictive analytics—all within a decentralized framework. The result? Smarter, more efficient applications that bring real-world AI power to blockchain technology. 3. A Transparent and Community-Driven Ecosystem Blockchain’s ethos has always been rooted in transparency and decentralization. Lightchain AI takes this to the next level with its Transparent AI Framework . Every decision made by its AI systems is auditable, fostering trust and accountability—a crucial factor for attracting institutional investors and enterprises. What’s more, Lightchain AI integrates decentralized governance, empowering token holders to propose and vote on key initiatives. Imagine having a say in the future of the very protocol you’re invested in—it’s not just about financial returns anymore; it’s about creating a lasting impact. The Lightchain AI Roadmap to Success Any project with bold claims needs a solid plan. Thankfully, Lightchain AI has a well-thought-out roadmap to guide its goals. Phase 1: Prototype Development Bringing the vision to life with early-stage development of PoI, AIVM, and the governance framework while building initial community support. Phase 2: Testnet Deployment Launching a test environment to fine-tune performance, gather user feedback, and ensure scalability. Phase 3: Mainnet Launch The big moment—fully activating the PoI and AIVM for widespread adoption, while simultaneously onboarding validators and expanding partnerships. With $1,063,817.84 already raised in its presale and a current price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is steadily building momentum. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Future of Blockchain The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting frontiers in tech, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Its ability to fuse AI computations with decentralized infrastructure has massive implications for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. Here’s why it stands out: Efficiency: PoI ensures resources are used for meaningful tasks, reducing waste and boosting productivity. Scalability: With AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI enables dApps to tackle increasingly complex AI operations. Impact: By making its AI systems transparent and accountable, Lightchain AI builds trust for enterprise-level adoption. But What About Risks? Like any innovative concept, Lightchain AI isn’t without its risks. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and investor returns can never be guaranteed. Additionally, as a cutting-edge project, Lightchain AI relies heavily on adoption and execution to fully realize its potential. That said, the team’s focus on usability and community-driven governance indicates strong fundamentals, which could make it a promising investment for long-term crypto enthusiasts. How to Get Involved with Lightchain AI You don’t have to wait for the official launch to be a part of this revolution. Lightchain AI’s presale is already live , offering early adopters discounted tokens and exclusive perks, such as governance voting rights and priority access to future ecosystem features.

The pool will also appeal to institutional and retail miners with a commission rate beginning at 0.4%. BitFuFu has also said that it will allocate all its self-mining hashrate to the new pool to boost its mining capability as a part of its expansion plan. Furthermore, the company has stated that as of now it owns 1,664 Bitcoins. BitFuFu Expands Offerings with New Bitcoin Mining Pool According to a latest release , BitFuFu has launched BitFuFu Pool, a private-label Bitcoin mining pool that offers commission rates from 0.4%. This new offering will be offered beginning next week through the BitFuFu application. The offering will be available to those who make purchases of cloud-mining products and miners. In addition, BitFuFu has decided to direct its entire self-mining hashrate to the new pool. This means that all of the computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining will now be channeled into BitFuFu Pool. This shift will boost the pool’s capacity and attract more miners looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to mine. More so, the company is also focusing on offering an array of services to both institutional and retail clients. These include real-time monitoring tools, firmware solutions, maintenance services, and a user-friendly platform for easy mining operations. The strategic development comes amid rising Bitcoin price and growing demand for more efficient mining services. However, after crossing the $100,000 mark, BTC price experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $97,640 in a sudden flash crash. This drop resulted in over $649 million in total liquidations across the crypto market and Bitcoin had $216.95 million in losses. Focus on Institutional Clients and Customized Services BitFuFu also mentioned that it will serve the institutional clients and provide them service by the means of consultation with the sales representatives. These services will assist the large scale miners to manage there business in the Bitcoin mining network. The BitFuFu Pool is currently primarily a Bitcoin mining pool, however, other digital assets are also on the roadmap. This expansion will thus enable the crypto mining company to expand its product portfolio and venture into other cryptocurrencies. The company’s strategic partners are going to be of great importance in this expansion. As of today, the crypto mining company holds a total of 1,664 BTC, reflecting its disciplined approach to treasury management. This strategy allows the company to accumulate Bitcoin through self-mining while also generating cash flow by providing cloud-mining services. Similarly, most recently, Hut 8 announced plans to raise $500 million through the sale of common stock under an ATM program. The proceeds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, enhancing its reserves. Additionally, the company revealed a $250 million stock repurchase program, aiming to buy back 5% of its outstanding shares over the next 12 months.

Additionally, for the first time since BTC crossed the $100,000 mark, it has failed to sustain this level, resulting in the liquidation of 208,389 traders’ positions. During this market dip, BTC’s price declined by 5.47% in just minutes, dropping from $98,338 to $92,957. However, since the drop, the price has rebounded as of press time. Bitcoin Current Price Momentum At press time, Bitcoin is trading near $96,935 and has recorded a price decline of over 2.10% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, this crash has attracted notable participation, as evidenced by the trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC’s trading volume surged by 98% during the same period. However, this price drop has created fear among traders, as there is no clear reason identified for the decline. This has raised concerns about whether the drop will happen again or if the market will now rebound.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 00:54:16

Decentralized finance in underserved regions Each partner brings their own unique expertise to the table. Creditcoin will lay the financial groundwork to create a blockchain-based ecosystem conducive to secure lending and borrowing. Spacecoin, on the other hand, focuses on connectivity by deploying advanced satellite technology to deliver internet access to underserved regions. Sui, a smart contract platform, is responsible for scalable and secure computing, while Walrus ensures efficient data management and decentralized storage availability. How Creditcoin, Spacecoin, Sui, and Walrus can work together Together, all parties can work on delivering a cohesive system and tackle challenges such as the lack of internet access and limited financial inclusion in certain areas. As mentioned, Spacecoin’s satellite network will provide connectivity in regions where the necessary infrastructure is lacking, allowing Creditcoin users worldwide to execute transactions more safely. In the meanwhile, Sui and Walrus scalability solutions are expected to streamline peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial interactions and data sharing without centralized intermediaries. Most importantly, the P2P module is expected to reduce operational costs and enhance transparency in the process. As such, the partnership aims to address the needs of the 37% of the global population that remains offline and/or underbanked. New global avenues in DeFi By integrating connectivity with DeFi solutions, the partnership opens up new avenues for potential clients in remote regions. New users will thus gain access to financial services and manage their assets online, fostering inclusivity and economic growth.

This stabilization comes after a period of downward pressure, raising speculations of a rebound on the horizon. With bulls showing signs of resilience, the stage is set for a comeback that could redefine BONK’s near-term trajectory. Will this level be the springboard for a recovery, or is further consolidation needed before the next move? Support Holds Steady: Signs Of A Bullish Rebound As market sentiment teeters between caution and optimism, determining the meme coin’s recent hold at the $0.00004002 support level is crucial in order for investors and traders to reevaluate their positions ahead of potential volatility. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says On the 4-hour chart, BONK is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $0.00004002 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $0.00006247 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, possibly opening the door to higher levels. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. When the RSI rises and reaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BONK the strength to push higher and test key resistance levels. BONK Performance On The Daily Time Frame BONK is showing signs of a potential upward movement on the daily chart, staying above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $0.00004002 support level. Its maintenance above this support provides a foundation for further growth. If BONK can maintain its position above this level and continue building momentum, it could pave the way for a breakout and more upside movement. Furthermore, the daily RSI shows signs of a rebound, maintaining a steady position above the 50% threshold. The continued trend above this level implies that the asset is in a favorable position for more gains, with the possibility of a sustained rally. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could indicate growing confidence among traders and signal positive price action for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness Thus far, BONK is at a pivotal moment, having found stability above the $0.00004002 support level and the daily 100-day SMA. If Bonk can sustain its position above this support and build on its current momentum, a potential recovery could be underway, possibly driving the price toward the $0.00006247 resistance level and beyond. Nonetheless, failure to maintain $0.00004002 may alter the meme coin’s direction to the downside, causing it to retest lower support zones such as $0.00002962 and $0.00002320.

While Q4 is generally a bullish quarter, the surge in Bitcoin’s price reportedly came on the back of increased institutional demand and strong buying activity from the US. Buying pressure coincides with the holiday season, which may enhance market euphoria due to the “Holiday Effect.” Will the phenomenon intensify BTC price before 2024 ends? Bitcoin could hit another record high before year-end Bitcoin price surpassed $100k on December 4 for the first time, leading to celebrations within the crypto community. Bitcoin maintained the range before dropping under the crucial level on December 5. According to CryptoQuant data, the rise was on the back of 2 things : institutional demand and sustained buying by US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from U.S. investors. pic.twitter.com/eZvKFCmVxs — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 5, 2024 At the time of writing, CoinGecko notes Bitcoin’s 24-hour range between $92,900 and $103,600. However, there is one reason to be optimistic that BTC will break the upper band due to the ‘Holiday Effect.’ Research has shown that returns are generally higher around the holidays and this phenomenon is called the Holiday Effect. Bitcoin’s $100k peak comes squished between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Papers cite that investor buying is because of “holiday euphoria” during this period. But , it is also likely that not all investors would participate in the market during this time. Considering it is also a festive time to spend with families or on vacations. Therefore, despite uncertainty about the trading volumes, stocks have seen the Holiday Effect. This also means, that if Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory, another record peak could be achieved before 2024 concludes. Bitcoin demand is a positive indicator What is noteworthy is that retail demand for Bitcoin is already on the rise since 2020. CryptoQuant research finds that the 30-day demand change from retail investors is currently at a record high. The reason is simple—retail investments could be backed by institutional trust. And the latter could be playing a role in the former. Bitcoin 30-day retail demand | Source: CryptoQuant The research shows that there is high demand even as long-term holders are selling to take profits. The report says, “Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top.” This essentially means that when a lot of everyday investors jump in, it can signal that Bitcoin’s price is nearing a short-term peak. However, this surge also shows more people are getting involved, which can boost overall market activity, the research suggests. The research underlined 2 potential scenarios . One where Bitcoin price moves sideways, as retail enthusiasm cools off. Second was if Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 mark. And since it did, the prediction is of another wave of excitement, potentially leading to a “euphoric” market phase where prices climb quickly. The key is to watch how retail and institutional investors interact as it is about long-term adoption. Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, told Cryptopolitan, “It [ $100k milestone] comes in a year that has seen Bitcoin more than double, including a 45-percent advance in less than four weeks following Trump’s presidential victory.” Shekhar also reminds us that it has been 16 years since Bitcoin’s creation and signals “mainstream adoption.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, believes that the $100k mark is not a number but a “psychological breakthrough.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-06 01:22:16

The Altcoin Season Index recently hit 86/100, signaling that smaller assets are outshining Bitcoin in performance. $ HBAR , $XRP, and Solana ($ SOL ) have led the charge, fueled by institutional interest, explosive parabolic moves, and ETF speculation. $ XRP , the original institutional darling, and XLM, its younger sibling, have become focal points for investors. Both share striking similarities: founders, bear-market scars, and ETF hopes, but their paths are diverging. Let’s dissect what makes these assets tick, and more importantly, whether they’re worth the hype—or just the latest victims of “chasing the pump.” Fundamentals: Story of Strengths and Weaknesses XRP’s Institutional Edge XRP has come a long way since its fight with the SEC. Now cleared, it’s riding on institutional narratives, with Ripple expanding its ecosystem by introducing its $RLUSD stablecoin. Institutions may soon get access via a spot ETF in early 2025 (pending SEC approval). These factors scream adoption potential, but there’s a darker side. Ripple still holds tens of billions of XRP, leading to inflationary pressure. This centralization raises questions: will institutions trust an asset so tightly controlled? And privacy concerns linger—something institutions care deeply about. XLM: A Grassroots Underdog XLM, once overshadowed by XRP, differentiates itself with a more decentralized vibe. Its 50% token burn in 2019 reduced supply drastically, giving it a more deflationary edge. However, its trading volume is 50% lower than XRP, and its network hasn’t seen the same explosive adoption narrative. Both assets seem poised for institutional adoption, but their tokenomics and growth models diverge significantly. XRP rides institutional coattails; XLM thrives on grassroots utility. Technicals: Reading the Charts XRP’s Parabolic Surge XRP’s 280%+ November gain has pushed it into overbought RSI levels unseen since the 2021 bull market peak. On the daily chart, RSI is above 80, while the weekly RSI washitting historic extremes—a sign of overextension. But this parabolic move doesn’t mean it’s game over. Let’s talk buy-the-dip zones—or more realistically, buy-the-dip zones, not levels. Here’s what stands out: 1. $2.29 (Fib 0.382): The first retracement area from the local top. Confluences with horizontal resistance turned support. 2. $1.91 (Fib 0.618): A deeper retracement, backed by the 50-day moving average and sitting below a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $1.96-$2.20. 3. $1.63 (Fib 0.786): Major multi-cycle support with a weekly confluence. 4. $1.28: The last low before November’s parabolic surge—a critical test of XRP’s strength. XLM’s Mirror Reflection XLM followed XRP’s November run with a 450% + gain. Its weekly chart shows similarities, but RSI levels are less extreme. $0.414 is a critical pivot point—lose it, and the sell-off could accelerate. The 200-week moving average is catching up, suggesting a potential safety net for long-term bulls. Altcoin Season Context The Altcoin Season Index at 86/100 confirms what we’ve seen: altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as market dominance shifts. However, this often comes with risks. Historically, strong altcoin rallies like this tend to precede sharp corrections. XRP and XLM, despite their gains, may be entering a distribution phase—a period when early buyers lock in profits, leaving new entrants to bear the risk. Source: coinmarketcap.com Summary: Timing the Market XRP and XLM are undeniably similar in history but vastly different in fundamentals. XRP’s centralized narrative contrasts with XLM’s grassroots approach, but both face headwinds of overextension, high market caps ($130 billion for XRP, $14.5 billion for XLM), and a “sell-the-news” backdrop. The best time to buy was during accumulation at $0.30 or $0.55, not after 300%-400% gains. The second best strategy? Patience. Don’t chase pumps; wait for discounts. As the saying goes: “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.” Buying into overbought RSI levels is a gamble, especially when macro conditions remain uncertain. With the DXY stabilizing and equity markets under pressure (Nasdaq and S&P500 are flatlining), December could bring the answers we need.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 01:36:00

Pudgy Penguins launched three years ago as a set of 8,888 NFTs depicting colorful and comical birds. Now, the team behind the project tells CoinDesk that they will release a token called PENGU this year on the Solana blockchain. Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Pudgy Rods and more. A further 22.02% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% are set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. ""With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle,"" the team shared in a statement.Pudgy is among the rare collections that managed to stay culturally relevant in the otherwise dreadful NFT business following the price crash from the 2021-2022 bull market. Many NFTs lacked real utility beyond being a digital brag. It was also difficult to fully realize gains after price bumps — as market liquidity was often inadequate to fill orders. The pivot comes as fun tokens and memecoins, unlike NFTs, have taken off and flourished in the last two years. Liquidity, relative cheapness, virality and ease-of-use are key reasons why people have flocked to these latest hot asset classes — even though fun tokens and memecoins fundamentally represent the same idea as NFT collections did: belonging to a passionate community. Official Pudgy Penguins channels have over 3 million followers across Instagram, X, TikTok and YouTube, and videos involving the characters have notched 32 billion views on Giphy. One of the brand's TikTok accounts is focused on spreading good vibes under the ""Pudgy Kindness"" moniker — popularizing it as a feel-good service in the mainstream, outside of crypto circles. It goes beyond screens too. Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection, and has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies that are carried at major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens. Pudgy Penguins is the third-largest NFT collection by market capitalization — $550 million in total — as of Thursday, data shows , trailing only CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club. The collection came to life in 2021, and each penguin is hand-drawn and features various distinct traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin.",Markets|Pudgy Penguins|NFT|Exclusive,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-06 02:00:11

Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, has successfully performed 2 billion transactions in a mere four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This marks a historic day for Cardano, marking not only its technical prowess but also a strong contender in DeFi.

Visa, recognized for its efficiency, handles approximately 0.72 billion transactions per day—less than half of what Hydra accomplished in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network has been processing over 9,900 transactions per second, surpassing Solana in transaction speed and confirming its image as a highly scalable blockchain technology. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has crossed 9,900 transactions per second surpassing Solana. pic.twitter.com/bAOJCOraMl — TapTools (@TapTools) December 2, 2024 Investors’ interest has also risen. ADA, Cardano’s native coin, just recaptured the $1 price despite the issue of 36.84 million tokens. Another projected unlock of $21.3 million worth of ADA represents only 0.05% of the circulating supply, implying that the influence on market dynamics may be modest. Nonetheless, Cardano’s ecosystem remains resilient, because of an emphasis on efficiency and innovation. Hoskinson’s Pride And Community Optimism Input Output’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is elated on the latest development. In a social media post commemorating Hydra’s milestone, he wrote, “Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right.” His satisfaction in Cardano’s accomplishments reflects the community’s confidence. Many people believe that Hydra’s capacity to execute enormous transaction volumes while lowering fees puts Cardano at the forefront of blockchain scalability. Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right https://t.co/uff9GusWyo — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 4, 2024 This optimism also applies to ADA’s potential price changes. A prominent community member recently stated that the blockchain’s developing DeFi ecosystem and strong emphasis on liquid staking could result in significant growth over the next market cycle. As Cardano continues to attract retail and institutional investors, expectations for ADA’s long-term value remain high. Shaping The Future Of DeFi Hydra’s achievement is more than simply a gain for Cardano; it demonstrates the expanding possibilities of blockchain technology. By outperforming traditional payment systems and other blockchains, Cardano has raised the bar for what is feasible in the DeFi market. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst As the blockchain industry continues to expand at a rapid pace, Cardano is quickly becoming more than simply a competitor. Recent results for Hydra point to even greater things to come for the platform. ADA’s price, at $1.23, shows a minor decline over the past 24 hours, but the 24.2% increase in the past week emphasizes mounting investor confidence. Cardano’s position on the blockchain is strengthened by Hydra’s capacity to handle billions of transactions in such a short period of time, hence maybe paving the path for more price rise. Driven by both retail and institutional interest, ADA’s value could experience constant increase as Cardano keeps proving its scalability and creativity.

New projects and existing powerhouses are shaking up the scene. Did you catch the news about the PGA Tour teaming up with LIV Golf for a massive $10 million prize paid entirely in Cronos (CRO)? Or Chainlink’s big play with Fortlake Asset Management, where they’re revolutionizing fund tokenization? These developments aren’t just headlines—they’re paving the way for crypto adoption across industries. But wait—there’s more. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the new kid on the block with game-changing features that promise to simplify digital payments like never before. Qubetics isn’t here to just exist; it’s solving problems that others haven’t cracked. From a non-custodial wallet with seamless integration into Apple Pay and Google Pay to a “No KYC” process, Qubetics is shaping up to be a real contender. The project is currently in Presale Phase 11, with tokens priced at $0.0282. With over 6,500 holders and $4.4M raised, it’s easy to see why early investors are calling it a golden opportunity. Let’s break it all down and see how Qubetics compares to big names like Chainlink and Cronos. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Everyday Crypto Payments Imagine this: you’re at your local coffee shop, and instead of fumbling through your wallet or scanning QR codes for crypto payments, you just tap your phone. That’s the vision Qubetics is bringing to life with its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. The wallet integrates with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop platforms, making crypto transactions feel as simple as swiping your debit card. What’s even cooler? The smart contract conversion mechanism. It converts crypto into fiat at the point of sale, so you don’t have to worry about wild price swings. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is focused on privacy. Their No KYC (Know Your Customer) feature ensures you can manage your assets without the hassle of uploading personal data. This is perfect for freelancers juggling international clients or small businesses tired of currency conversion fees. For instance, a small café could accept crypto payments without worrying about market volatility—it’s all converted to stable fiat instantly. As of now, 1 $TICS token is $0.0282, but don’t sleep on it. With weekly 10% price hikes during presale, this is a get-in-early moment. After the presale, prices are projected to hit $0.25, offering an impressive 900% ROI. So far, over 270M tokens have been sold. Qubetics isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement aiming to make crypto payments part of everyday life. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting the Blockchain Dots If you’ve been around crypto for a minute, you know Chainlink is the OG of connecting real-world data to blockchain networks. Lately, it’s been making moves with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which simplifies the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchains. Think of it like a universal translator, but for blockchains. This innovation is clutch in a world that’s becoming more interconnected. Chainlink isn’t stopping there. They’ve teamed up with Avalanche to launch low-latency Data Streams, powering GMX V2’s decentralized markets on both Arbitrum and Avalanche. These markets are already pulling in $50 billion in trading volume, and Chainlink is right in the middle of it all. And let’s not forget the numbers. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $23.63, with analysts predicting further upside as adoption grows. With Fortlake Asset Management tapping Chainlink for fund tokenization, traditional finance is finally catching up to blockchain tech. This makes Chainlink one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for long-term growth. Cronos (CRO): The Backbone of Crypto.com Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is quietly becoming a heavy hitter. With the announcement of the Crypto.com Showdown, where a $10 million prize will be paid entirely in CRO, it’s clear that Cronos is stepping into the limelight. This isn’t just a token—it’s an ecosystem, and it’s expanding fast. One of the standout developments is the launch of the Cronos zkEVM network. This zero-knowledge layer 2 network is all about speed and scalability, offering gasless transactions and a system secured by Ethereum. Translation? Cronos is solving the scalability issues that have plagued blockchain for years. Currently, CRO is trading at $0.208846, with potential for major growth as adoption increases. With partnerships across industries and a strong push for real-world use cases, Cronos isn’t just riding the wave—it’s making its own. Add this to your list of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, and you won’t regret it. Conclusion So, where should you park your crypto dollars this month? Based on the latest research, Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Cronos (CRO) are your top picks. Qubetics is redefining crypto payments with its non-custodial wallet and “No KYC” process. Chainlink is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world data, while Cronos is expanding its ecosystem with groundbreaking technologies.

Toncoin, linked to Telegram, has seen remarkable price growth, reflecting increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning it closer to its all-time high. Meanwhile, Fantom has experienced a significant price surge, marking a notable recovery from its recent low of $0.64, with its price soaring by 85% and positioning itself for a potential move towards $1.68. Amidst this market optimism, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a promising contender, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. Currently in Presale Phase 11, with each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is set to transform how we handle digital assets and everyday payments. Its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial institutions and payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, whether you’re on iOS, Android, or desktop. This means managing your crypto assets could become as simple as using your regular payment apps. One of the most anticipated features is the smart contract conversion mechanism, which automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale. This protects users from the volatility of the crypto market, ensuring stable and secure transactions. Moreover, Qubetics offers a No KYC process, allowing users to engage without extensive identity verification, thereby enhancing privacy and ease of use. Currently, in Presale Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. With each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, early investors have a unique opportunity. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. For small businesses, this means accepting crypto payments without worrying about market fluctuations, as the smart contract conversion ensures they receive the exact fiat amount expected . For individuals, managing and spending crypto becomes as easy as using traditional currencies, with the added benefit of privacy through the No KYC process. Toncoin (TON): Riding the Bullish Wave Toncoin, the cryptocurrency linked to Telegram, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The surge in TON’s price reflects increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning the cryptocurrency closer to its all-time high. This bullish trend is further supported by technical indicators. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) reinforce the uptrend, with the price remaining well above the short-term averages. If TON maintains its trajectory, it could break the resistance of $7.198 and target the $8 level in December. However, a reversal could test support levels at $6.6 and $5.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for TON nearly touched the overbought threshold of 70 before pulling back to its current level of 63. This suggests that while the buying momentum has weakened slightly, it remains relatively strong, indicating that buyers maintain a slight edge. If the RSI climbs back above 70, as it did in could regain momentum and test levels above $7.2, signaling another bullish breakout. Additionally, the supply of TON on exchanges has decreased to 1.68 million, down from 1.75 million on December 1. This significant outflow suggests reduced selling pressure and a possible shift to long-term holding or staking, which could support the upward price trend as selling liquidity dries up. For trts an opportunity to capitalize on TON’s bullish momentum. Monitoring key resistance and support levels, along with technical indicators like the RSI and EMAs, can provide insights into potential entry and exit points. Staying informed about market trends and on-chain metrics is crucial for making infoions. Fantom (FTM): A Surge Toward New Heights Fantom (FTM) has been on a roll, delivering an 85% price surge after rebounding from a low of $0.64. Its current trajectory has analysts buzzing, with predictions of a push toward $1.68 in the coming weeks. This growth is fueled by strong technical indicators and increasing adoption within its ecosystem. Fantom’s unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture sets it apart, offering speed and scalability that traditional blockchains can’t match. Developers and users are flocking to Fantom because of its low transaction costs and lightning-fast confirmation times. Projects built on Fantom’s platform are gaining traction, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming and NFT marketplaces. This activity isn’t just hype—it’s creating real value and driving up demand for FTM tokens. As of now, FTM is trading around $1.32, showing robust momentum. Analysts believe breaking above the $1.50 resistance level could pave the way for a rally to $1.68 and beyond. For those seeking the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Fantom is an exciting choice with a proven track record of innovation and adoption. Conclusion: Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 As we close out the year, the crypto market is presenting opportunities for substantial returns, and these three projects are leading the charge.

Cronos is climbing charts, promising lucrative gains, while EOS battles a market dip, raising questions about its resilience. Amid this, Qubetics has emerged as a game-changer, offering innovative solutions and attracting over 6,500 holders with a staggering $4.4 million raised during its presale. While Cronos and EOS battle market volatility, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out by addressing real-world challenges with its revolutionary non-custodial wallet—a feature traditional systems have failed to perfect. With a mainnet launch on the horizon and predictions of $10-15 per token, Qubetics is turning skeptics into believers. Let’s dive into how these three altcoins stack up and why they’re the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics: Pioneering Financial Autonomy with Its Non-Custodial Wallet In a world where crypto wallets often compromise privacy and control, Qubetics flips the narrative. The project’s non-custodial wallet promises users full autonomy over their finances—no middlemen, no restrictions, just seamless access to your assets. Custodial wallets are prime targets for hackers. High-profile breaches, like the Mt. Gox hack that cost investors over $450 million, highlight this vulnerability. By eliminating third-party control, Qubetics ensures your assets remain yours—always. Custodial wallets often require extensive KYC protocols, exposing sensitive personal data. Qubetics’ decentralised model prioritises anonymity, offering a secure haven for users who value privacy. Centralised systems impose restrictions on transactions, particularly in regions with stringent regulations. Qubetics empowers users by removing these barriers, making global financial inclusion a reality. For more information, watch this video . Presale Numbers and Predictions The buzz around Qubetics is undeniable. With over 270 million $TICS tokens sold at $0.0282 each and a presale tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear investors see immense potential. Analysts predict the token could reach $10-15 post-mainnet launch, making it a prime contender among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Cronos: On the Rise with Promising Upside Potential Cronos ($CRO) has been making waves, recently gaining attention for its upside potential. Analysts suggest the token could climb 31% to reach its next target, driven by growing adoption and strategic partnerships. Cronos is more than just a token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem designed to support DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s interoperability with Ethereum and Cosmos gives it a competitive edge, enabling seamless integration across blockchain platforms. Despite market fluctuations, Cronos has shown resilience. Recent reports highlight its potential for significant gains, especially as the ecosystem attracts more developers and projects. At its current price, investors see it as a golden opportunity among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. However, like any altcoin, Cronos isn’t immune to risks. The token’s performance hinges on broader market trends and the success of its ongoing developments. Still, for those willing to ride the wave, it’s an enticing prospect. EOS: A Contender Facing Market Challenges EOS has long been hailed as a blockchain with groundbreaking scalability and speed, but 2024 hasn’t been kind. Recent reports show a 10% dip, leading some to question its stability. While EOS faces challenges, its robust technology cannot be ignored. The platform’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model allows for faster transactions and lower fees, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. However, competition from newer, more versatile blockchains has put EOS in a tough spot. For EOS to reclaim its status as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, it must adapt. The community’s push for updates and strategic partnerships could reignite interest, but for now, cautious optimism is the name of the game. Investors should keep a close eye on market movements and project developments. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, Qubetics, Cronos, and EOS should be on your radar. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking innovations and $10-15 price prediction, leads the pack. Cronos offers promising gains, while EOS holds potential despite its challenges. The clock is ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever. Dive into Qubetics’ presale , explore Cronos, and keep an eye on EOS. Your next big crypto win could be just around the corner.

BTC is now recovering losses and facing hurdles near $99,000. Bitcoin started a major decline after hitting a new all-time high at $104,015. The price is trading above $97,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $96,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain momentum if it closes above the key milestone level of $100,000. Bitcoin Price Recovers Losses Bitcoin price started another increase above the $98,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to clear the $99,500 and $100,000 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped it to a new all-time high. A high was formed at $104,015 and the price saw a major downside correction. There was a drop below the $100,000 and $95,000 levels. The price tested the $92,000 zone. A low was formed at $91,800 and the price is now recovering losses.

Bitcoin price is now trading above $97,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $96,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $99,360 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. The first key resistance is near the $100,000 level. A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $104,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $108,000 level. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $100,000 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $97,000 level. The first major support is near the $96,000 level. The next support is now near the $95,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

But before leaving, he has made a final strike against the crypto world. The SEC, under his watch, filed an 81-page document targeting Binance. It opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss its lawsuit, calling Binance Coin (BNB) and ten other tokens securities. Let’s unpack what this means for Binance and the broader crypto market. SEC’s Target: Eleven Cryptocurrencies The SEC is not happy targeting just Binance Coin. Along with BNB, it labeled ten more tokens as securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI. Source : courtlistener But the filing goes beyond naming tokens. The SEC accuses Binance of more than just selling them. It claims Binance promoted secondary markets for these tokens. Why does that matter? Because it allegedly encouraged investors to see these tokens as profit-making opportunities. Ripple’s partial victory earlier this year shaped the SEC’s arguments too. That case ruled XRP’s secondary sales weren’t securities. So now, the SEC is being extra careful to cover those gaps. How Binance is Being Called Out The SEC’s case rests on something called the Howey Test. In simple terms, this test asks three things to decide if something is a security: Was money invested? Was there a common goal? Did people expect profits from someone else’s work? The SEC says Binance ticks all three boxes. It claims Binance tied token value to its ecosystem’s growth, making users think they were investing. What’s more, the SEC argues secondary market trades are also securities. Binance has said otherwise, but this filing directly challenges that. Ethereum and Bitcoin: Why Are They Spared? Not everyone agrees with the SEC’s methods. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s legal chief, called out what he sees as selective enforcement. In a tweet, he asked why Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)—the two biggest cryptocurrencies—are always left out. Yesterday @SECGov filed eight-one pages of arguments that secondary trading of BNB and ten other tokens triggers liability under Howey. But do they offer ONE WORD explaining how this same bogus logic somehow avoids ETH? Or BTC? Nope. Because they can't. 1/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 5, 2024 It’s a fair question. ETH and BTC dominate the market. Yet, they’re nowhere in this filing. Ripple’s case may have influenced the SEC’s tactics here, but critics are still scratching their heads. What This Means for Crypto If the SEC wins, the fallout could be huge. Tokens labeled as securities might vanish from platforms like Binance. Developers and investors would face stricter rules, which could slow innovation and growth. The SEC’s goal is clear: take control of the crypto market. By targeting both token sales and secondary trades, it’s trying to set a firm legal standard. What’s Next? This filing isn’t a new lawsuit. It’s the SEC doubling down on its claims against Binance. But the exclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin? That raises serious questions about fairness. As Gensler prepares to leave, this feels like his last big move. For crypto, the stakes are massive. The court’s decision could either bring clarity—or turn the market upside down.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Vs SEC,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 03:05:06

Remember Turbo Coin (TURBO)? It started small, just another meme coin with big dreams, and shot to fame, creating life-changing wealth for early adopters. But if you hesitated, you likely missed its rocket to the moon. And let’s face it—missing out on Turbo feels like watching the parade from the sidelines. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the fresh face on the block that’s rewriting the meme coin game. With its jaw-dropping presale success—over $1 million raised in just ten days and 23 billion coins already sold—BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. A play-to-earn (P2E) game, 90% staking APY, and a vibrant community of over 2,400 holders are just a few of the reasons why this coin screams “Don’t miss this!” Let’s dive into how BTFD might just be the Best Meme Coin Presale with 1000X Potential you’ve been waiting for. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Redemption Arc Missed Turbo? Don’t sweat it. BTFD Coin offers a second shot at joining the next big thing before it hits the mainstream. Let’s break down why BTFD has crypto analysts and meme enthusiasts buzzing. A Community Like No Other At the heart of BTFD is its Bulls Squad—a community of investors rallying around the mantra “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just a coin; it’s a lifestyle. The Bulls Squad includes the fiery Raging Bull, the analytical Nerdy Bull, and the charming Baby Bull, who keep the community engaged, inspired, and ready to charge at every opportunity. The Numbers Don’t Lie BTFD’s presale has already surpassed expectations, raising over $1 million in just ten days. At Stage 7, the coin is priced at $0.000064, and it will list at $0.0006 after the presale ends. Let’s do some quick maths: a $2,500 investment at the presale price would fetch you 39,062,500 BTFD coins. By the time BTFD hits its listing price, that stash could balloon to $23,437.50. Now imagine if BTFD’s momentum propels it to a 1000X surge. Yes, we’re talking about the potential for millions. Unique Features Setting It Apart BTFD isn’t just riding on hype; it’s got the goods: Play-to-Earn Game: Imagine earning coins while gaming. The upcoming P2E game promises fun, rewards, and massive engagement. Staking Rewards: Offering a staggering 90% APY, staking your BTFD coins isn’t just lucrative; it’s a long-term growth strategy. Decentralised and Resilient: Built on Ethereum, BTFD ensures security, scalability, and accessibility for all. But wait—there’s more! You can buy BTFD with almost any major cryptocurrency. For example: 1 ETH buys 57,581,093 BTFD coins. 1 Bitcoin fetches a jaw-dropping 1,506,375,000 BTFD coins. 1 Solana gets you 3,742,656 BTFD coins. TURBO: The Wealth Train You Missed Turbo Coin started as a small community project, with no clear roadmap and minimal fanfare. Yet, its decentralised ethos and meme-driven charm struck a chord with crypto enthusiasts. Before anyone could blink, TURBO went from obscurity to a household name in the crypto world. Early investors who spent just a few hundred bucks walked away with six-figure payouts when the coin surged to unimaginable heights. But here’s the thing—Turbo wasn’t just about luck. It was about recognising the cultural power of memes and the strength of community-driven tokens. As of now, TURBO’s growth has steadied, making it a legendary “what could have been” story for latecomers. Had you thrown in $2,500 when TURBO was at its rock-bottom presale price, you might’ve been counting stacks instead of regrets. Missed it? It’s alright—because history is knocking on your door again with BTFD Coin. Why Analysts Are Eyeing BTFD Crypto analysts are already predicting BTFD will emerge as one of the Best Meme Coin Presales with 1000X Potential. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, token scarcity and burning mechanisms could further boost its value. Analysts foresee BTFD not just listing at $0.0006 but potentially climbing into the top meme coin ranks alongside giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out—Join the Presale Now! The crypto world doesn’t hand out second chances often, but BTFD Coin might just be yours.

ETH is gaining pace and might soon aim for a move above the $3,950 resistance zone. Ethereum remained in a positive zone and stayed above the $3,680 zone. The price is trading above $3,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $3,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,890 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Upsides Ethereum price remained well-bid above the $3,670 support zone. ETH formed a base and recently started a fresh increase above $3,720 beating Bitcoin . The bulls were able to push the price above the $3,780 resistance. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,956 swing high to the $3,680 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $3,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,890 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,956 swing high to the $3,680 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,950 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,980. A clear move above the $3,980 resistance might send the price toward the $4,000 resistance. An upside break above the $4,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,050 resistance zone or even $4,120. Another Pullback In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,890 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,820 level. The first major support sits near the $3,775 zone. A clear move below the $3,775 support might push the price toward the $3,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,650 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,620.

Here’s the Implication,https://timestabloid.com/reserve-for-every-xrp-wallet-dropped-to-1-xrp-on-dec-2nd-heres-the-implication/,"On December 2, 2024, the account reserve requirement for wallets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was reduced from 10 XRP to 1 XRP, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s evolution. This change reflects a broader effort to make XRPL more accessible and user-friendly for a diverse global audience. The decision has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency experts, who have varying perspectives on its potential impact on XRP’s price and ecosystem. The Reserve Reduction in Context The reserve requirement is a specific amount of XRP that must be held in a wallet to activate and maintain it. Originally set at 20 XRP, this reserve was lowered to 10 XRP in the past, and now to 1 XRP. Wietse Wind, founder of XRPL Labs and a prominent developer in the XRPL ecosystem, was a key proponent of this reduction. In a proposal detailed by Times Tabloid in October, Wind emphasized the importance of lowering the reserve to enhance accessibility. He argued that the previous reserve fee of 10 XRP hindered participation in regions with limited economic capacity, creating a barrier for many potential users and projects. By reducing this threshold to 1 XRP, the change aims to encourage broader adoption and engagement with the XRPL ecosystem. Speculation About XRP’s Price Wall Street veteran and financial expert Linda P. Jones highlighted an intriguing pattern in her analysis. She noted that reserve reductions on the XRPL have historically preceded price increases for XRP. She stated, “The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply a price of $4 to $16 per XRP soon?” Every wallet that holds XRP has a reserve requirement. It used to be 20 XRP, then it was reduced to 10 XRP. Dec. 2nd it was reduced to 1 XRP. The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an #XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply… pic.twitter.com/h7KMY1jVk3 — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 3, 2024 However, the correlation between reserve reductions and price increases remains speculative. An XRPL validator known as “Vet” responded , suggesting that the reduction is driven by increased price, greater network capacity, and lowering entry barriers for XRPL users, rather than being a direct indicator of future price movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Implications of Reserve Changes The reduction in the reserve requirement has also prompted discussions about the cost of self-custody for XRP holders. A user named “333” on X observed , “The more XRP goes up, the more it will cost to self-custody. Some people may not have 20, 30, or 50 dollars to spend to have their wallet. Some will be priced out of simply owning.” This perspective underscores the balance that must be struck between accessibility and maintaining network security. While a lower reserve may foster broader adoption, significant price increases for XRP could inadvertently create barriers for smaller investors, potentially pricing them out of the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Price Surpasses $100,000 In a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed his excitement and support, stating, “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump’s Bitcoin endorsement aligns with his campaign promises to position the United States as the “crypto capital of the world.” His administration, set to begin on January 20, 2025, is expected to implement significant regulatory changes through agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve These proposed adjustments are critical to fostering the growth of the digital asset ecosystem, which Trump believes will be a cornerstone of his presidency and a notable shift from President Biden’s administration and treatment of the nascent financial sector. The timing of Trump’s announcement coincides with the resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stated that his last day at the agency will also be January 20. This transition is anticipated to pave the way for former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is expected to take the helm with a pro-crypto vision. Legal chief Dan Gallagher of Robinhood Markets expressed confidence in Atkins, noting, “Paul Atkins was made for this job,” and predicting that he would tackle the industry’s concerns regarding “regulation by enforcement” from day one. BTC Valuation Surpasses Major Public Companies The recent surge past $100,000 has propelled Bitcoin’s market capitalization to over $2 trillion, making it a more substantial asset than most public companies, including tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet. This valuation also surpasses the government bond markets of several countries, including Spain and Brazil, and approaches the market capitalization of the FTSE 100 Index in the UK. Analysts are optimistic about the future, with Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies, stating that reaching $100,000 indicates the beginning of a new phase in the bull market, one that appears resilient to external shocks. Manuel Villegas, a digital assets analyst at Julius Baer, added that the demand for Bitcoin remains strong, suggesting the possibility of a supply squeeze in the coming year, similar to previous trends. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Bounces Back: Is a New Rally Brewing? Moreover, Trump’s return to the White House could signal a shift in government involvement in Bitcoin. During a Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump proposed the idea of creating a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin, starting with assets seized by the US government. Allies like Robert Kennedy Jr. and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis have even suggested that the government could purchase 1 million Bitcoin, worth approximately $100 billion at current prices, as a means to back the US dollar. Starting Thursday, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $104,150 per coin, marking a substantial 6.6% surge within 24 hours. However, since that peak, the price has retraced to around $103,000 The question now is whether this upward trend can be sustained or if profit-taking by investors will lead to a correction for the leading digital asset. The future outlook will also depend on the next key support level, with $100,000 as a critical point that could facilitate further price increases.

However, the coin is up by more than 50 percent in the past week. XRP is currently consolidating at a high level above its 2021 bull market peak. Today, the price is moving sideways, which is typical after a rally. Even though XRP has dropped from its recent high, it’s still relatively close to where the rally began. Current Wave Structure XRP is in a larger third wave of a bullish cycl e. This move includes smaller subwaves, and we are actively tracking these. Right now, XRP might be in the fourth wave of this structure, but the overall rally is not over yet. While there’s potential for a deeper correction, the focus remains on higher prices. Support and Resistance Levels There’s not enough data to confirm if a major correction is starting, but analysts are watching key support levels. The price may find support between $1.15 and $1.79 if it pulls back, but this is still speculative. Market Action: Corrective or Bullish? XRP seems to be in a corrective phase right now, which could mean sideways consolidation or a sharper pullback. Corrections often lead to indecision, so we might see small ups and downs without a clear trend. Future Price Targets If the price moves higher, the next targets are around $3.20 to $3.30 (previous highs) and possibly $4.20. However, the next big move depends on support levels holding up and whether the rally continues. Micro Support Areas On the smaller time frame, support is located between $2.33 and $2.06, with additional support at $2.21. There has been no impulsive price reaction yet, so the market is still uncertain.

He named David Sacks, a tech heavyweight and former COO of PayPal, as his White House Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptocurrency Czar. This announcement comes just a day after Trump selected Paul Atkins, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate, to chair the SEC. This is a big change for the crypto industry, which suffered tremendous losses due to the SEC’s overreach and unfair regulations. These regulations complicated trading for not only US citizens but also stopped big companies from entering the crypto space for a very long time. Post-election, many new companies are heading towards Bitcoin from all sorts of sectors, like AI, Healthcare, Automobiles, and Technology. In the meanwhile, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,679 on December 5, 2024, showcasing its immense growth since its all-time low of $67.81 on July 6, 2013. While it has dipped 6.11% from its peak, the staggering 143,450% rise from its lowest point underscores its long-term growth trajectory and resilience in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $ 97,341. Why David Sacks? Trump’s choice of Sacks is no surprise. Sacks is a highly respected entrepreneur with a stellar track record in the tech world. He’s invested in major companies like Facebook, SpaceX, Airbnb, and Palantir through his venture fund, Craft Ventures. He also co-founded Yammer, a software company Microsoft acquired for over $1 billion. In his new role, Sacks will be responsible for guiding U.S. policy in two critical areas: artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Trump highlighted the importance of Sacks’ role, saying he would work to make America a global leader in these fields while ensuring free speech is protected from what he called “Big Tech bias and censorship.” Clear Crypto Rules on the Way One of Sacks’ key tasks will be to develop a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry. This clarity has been a long-standing demand from crypto companies struggling with regulatory uncertainty. Trump said Sacks’ work will help the U.S. crypto market thrive. Moreover, Sacks will also chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, where he will drive innovation in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. Industry Cheers for Sacks The tech and crypto community is excited about this move. Chris Pavlovski, CEO of Rumble, called it a win for free speech and praised Sacks’ expertise. Dennis Porter, a crypto advocate, said Sacks’ industry knowledge and bold approach make him the perfect fit for this role. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulated David Sacks on his appointment as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, praising his deep understanding of technology and his alignment with pro-innovation policies for crypto and AI under President Trump. Garlinghouse called this a “dream team,” reflecting high optimism for Sacks’ role in advancing tech innovation in the U.S. This appointment signals Trump’s focus on positioning the U.S. as a tech powerhouse, balancing innovation with regulatory clarity and free speech safeguards.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 03:43:23

He says as crypto and crypto ATMs are easy to find and allow quick permanent transactions this makes them which makes them an “attractive avenues for criminals looking to launder money”. As it’s an initial step for the AUSTRAC to reduce the illegal use of cryptocurrency in Australia, the agency will continue to keep an eye on crypto ATMs moving into 2025. AUSTRAC says those caught breaking the rules could face hefty financial penalties AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas announced a new team at AUSTRAC will ensure crypto ATM operators obey rules aimed at reducing the risk of dirty money flowing through their machines.

On top of that, they must file a report concerning any suspicious activities if the withdrawn or deposited cash is more than $6,500 (10,000 Australian dollars).

There was a move below the $2.40 and $2.30 levels. However, the bulls remained active above the last low and support at $2.15. The price is now moving higher and trading above $2.20. It is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2.866 swing high to the $2.166 low. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.35 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.38 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is at $2.50. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2.866 swing high to the $2.166 low. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance or even $2.850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.380 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.200 level. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support and the trend line. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Accompanying his post was a detailed chart outlining the “Double Tops” RSI pattern observed over multiple market cycles and its implications for XRP’s price trajectory. According to the analyst, this repeating phenomenon indicates XRP’s potential ascent to double-digit price levels. The Double Tops RSI Pattern Explained Egrag’s analysis delves into XRP’s historical weekly RSI behavior, identifying a consistent movement across past market cycles: In the first top, the RSI peaks, followed by a sharp decline. For the Second Top, the RSI climbs again, forming the final peak of a bull run. This two-step RSI pattern has reportedly coincided with significant price movements in XRP’s history, signaling the culmination of bullish trends. Based on this historical data, Egrag believes that XRP may again follow this pattern, potentially achieving unprecedented price levels. In his words, “Double RSI Tops = Double Digits.” #XRP Weekly RSI Pattern: Double Tops, Double Digits! Let’s take a closer look at the Weekly RSI for #XRP Over the years, the Weekly RSI for #XRP reveals a fascinating rhythm: 1⃣ First Top – The RSI peaks and then dives aggressively . 2⃣ Second Top – The RSI climbs again,… pic.twitter.com/z5zwiFyGD3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 5, 2024 Egrag’s Price Projections and Market Outlook When asked by a fellow user, Superman_Crypto, whether XRP would directly reach double-digit prices or experience a correction first, Egrag provided a detailed response. He projected that XRP could initially hit a range of $4.85 to $6.40, followed by a significant correction, and then embark on another upward surge. Egrag elaborated on his expectations for corrections, stating that a 70% correction from $6.40 could see XRP retrace to $1.92, which he identified as a strong support level before a subsequent 5-10X rally. Similarly, a 70% correction from $4.85 would bring the price to $1.46, again followed by a potential 5-10X recovery. To manage such volatility, Egrag advised his followers to employ both dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and dollar-sell averaging, acknowledging the unpredictability of XRP’s ultimate peak price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Parallels and Investor Sentiment The RSI pattern highlighted by Egrag draws parallels to XRP’s previous bull runs. Historically, XRP has exhibited rapid price increases during bullish phases, often followed by equally sharp corrections. Egrag’s analysis has resonated with many in the XRP community , particularly given the asset’s recent price performance and growing institutional interest. However, some investors remain cautious, emphasizing the importance of considering broader market conditions and regulatory developments. As XRP continues to garner attention from institutional players and retail investors, the coming months could provide critical insights into whether the asset fulfills the ambitious forecasts set forth by analysts like Egrag.

This triggered some of the altcoins like Ethereum that traded close to $4000 but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance. However, among the top gainers was JasmyCoin, which broke the 2-year consolidation and marked highs close to $0.06 for the first time since January 2022. Therefore, the JASMY price is believed to revamp a significant upswing after undergoing a small consolidation, as the bulls seem to be poised for a 100% upswing. Ever since the token rose above the multi-year consolidation zone around $0.02, the buzz around the crypto was why the JASMY price is surging so much. JasmyCoin reacted to the BTC price rally positively, which was fueled by a couple of collaborations to strengthen the DePin space. The platform has collaborated with IOTEX, aiming to drive DePin innovation & empower users across the market. Now that the price is displaying massive bullish momentum, the question rises: whether the price can make it to $0.1 this weekend? JASMY price is displaying huge potential in maintaining a strong ascending trend as the upper cap remains pretty higher than the current levels. The RSI displays the possibility of a pullback but the 50/200 day MA is poised for a bullish crossover, indicating the revival of a bullish trend. Now that the price maintains an 18% jump after an 80% rise in the past trading day, the next upper target could be around $0.061 at 1.4 FIB. Although the price is facing significant upward pressure, the bulls are trying hard to push the prices higher. Therefore, the token is believed to test the resistance at $0.0595 in a short while from now. A breakout could push the prices higher but a rejection may lead to consolidation until the markets display the next bullish move. JASMY crypto is becoming one of the strongest in the long term. With its use cases and growing adoption, it has great potential for future gains. Therefore, the price target may not be restricted to $0.1, as the token carries huge potential to achieve the range between $0.2 and $0.25 if the bulls hold a tight grip over the rally.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|JASMY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 04:58:02

XRP Could Hit $3 Analysts are confident that XRP is still on the way to reaching $3 per coin, saying that the recent pullback in its price does not dampen the enthusiasm of market experts on crypto. They added that despite the price dip, investors continue to have a positive sentiment on its future. WallStreetBets, a pseudonymous analyst, emphasized in a post the significance of being bullish on XRP as the coin experiences the ebbs and flows before being catapulted to the $3 level. “If you’re not long XRP right now, you don’t respect yourself,” WallStreetBets wrote in an X post.

Data shows that in the last three days, XRP decreased by nearly 16% and is currently being traded at $2.3. Despite this correction, WallStreetBets and other analysts are still optimistic about the crypto, seeing the pullback as preparing the coin for a prolonged uptrend.

There were key announcements like the Solana ETP in Canada and the launch of a $60 million Solana startup fund, followed by VanEck’s filing for a Solana ETF. The filing has sparked increased interest, as VanEck sees Solana as a competitor to Ethereum, praising its scalability, speed, and low costs—factors that make it ideal for payments, trading, gaming, and decentralized finance. However, in a latest development, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared on X that she has confirmed the SEC has informed at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the SOL spot ETFs. Sources suggest that the SEC is unlikely to approve any new crypto ETFs under the current administration. https://twitter.com/ComfyGwei/status/1864877051515175268 When a user speculated that at least one ETF could be approved, Terrett replied and said, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” James Seyffart and other analysts predict that the Solana ETF might not launch until 2025, particularly if there is a regime change at the SEC. However, the progress made recently, combined with ongoing ETF filings for other crypto assets, signals the potential for more growth in the crypto market over the coming years. In Other News…. The SEC has responded to a request to dismiss its amended lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Binance.US, as well as former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The SEC’s brief opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that Binance operated an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC also alleges that Binance sold several cryptocurrencies, including BNB, as unregistered securities. Binance had previously sought to dismiss these allegations, challenging the SEC’s interpretation. Reflecting on the same, Ripple CLO said, “Instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with new leadership just weeks away, Gensler’s SEC filed an 81-page brief in the Binance case yesterday, recycling the same failed arguments—including the absurd (and unsupported) claim that crypto has no inherent value.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 05:00:56

But ever since Pepe began popping in 2023, memecoins have been printing gains and making everyone from the TradFi squares to the Bitcoin maxis very, very angry. Now bigger than ever, this unstoppable rise of memecoins has been dubbed the memecoin supercycle. And with its unique approach as the first ever memecoin portfolio, Vantard has been killing it. $910k raised and posting 74.74% gains—investors are having trouble containing their excitement. The memecoin supercycle: Offering a golden ticket to gain city Memecoin mania started in Q1 and hasn’t really cooled down since. If this graph doesn’t excite you, nothing else will. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin is steadily rising. Jacking up risk-on sentiment and creating a storm of potential for altcoins to start popping in 2025 when investors inevitably rotate their BTC profits into something offering bigger gains. An opportunity no investor wants to miss out on—enter memecoins. Popularized by memecoin flag waver Murad Mahmudov , the memecoin supercycle is the theory that’s proving more accurate by the day. It’s the theory that memecoins will be the best play for all of next year thanks to their viral and retail appeal, powering rapid and outsized gains. Why Vantard makes winning the memecoin supercycle easy But that graph above can be deceptive. Because we all know that for every high flyer, there are countless pieces of memecoin vapourware wallowing in wallets of shame. You could go neck-deep in meme coins, getting 3 hours of sleep a night in the hope of picking a winner. Or you could let the memecoin experts do the hard work for you. That’s what Vantard is. Vantard’s quants work day in and day out, sourcing the best memecoins for the Vantard portfolio. All Vantard investors will get a slice of this pie. A pie that’s currently up 74.74%. Vantard’s beauty is that it effortlessly exposes you to all the best memecoins on the market with a single investment, keeping you ahead of the market and saving you from doing all-nighters. If you’d been exposed to bluechip memes like Popcat earlier this year, you’d be up over 15,000% . Similarly, bluechip in the making, Gigachad has delivered gains of as much as +7000% . Vantard’s quants are digging deep, exposing holders to future blue chips and the promising low-cap gems so that you’re covered for next year. Vantard has the power to be memecoins’ answer to ETFs ETFs shifted crypto investing to easy mode, opening up piles of untapped capital. Vantard is set to do the same as millions of meme-curious investors who can’t stand the FOMO any longer but don’t know which dog or cat to choose. The difference is Bitcoin is likely offering around a 2x at best right now. Memecoins offer you a 50x or 100x in your sleep. The memecoin supercycle won’t be around forever, though. And investors likely have roughly a year to bank as much as possible. The earlier you allocate, the better.

Shortly after celebrating a historic milestone by crossing $100,000 for the first time, Bitcoin suffered a sharp price drop of 5.47% within minutes, briefly dipping below $93,000. The sudden decline erased over $300 million in long positions, prompting heated reactions from traders and analysts alike. Meanwhile, financial commentary outlet FT Alphaville stirred controversy with a sarcastic “apology” to Bitcoin proponents, reigniting debates about the cryptocurrency’s resilience and the media’s long-standing skepticism. FT Alphaville Slammed for Spiteful ”Apology” as Bitcoin Hits $100K Milestone Bitcoin's rise to an all-time high above $100,000 on Dec. 5 has ignited celebrations across the crypto community while sparking controversy elsewhere. Among the voices making headlines is FT Alphaville, a daily commentary service by the Financial Times, which issued what many have dubbed a ”spiteful apology” to Bitcoin supporters. The op-ed, published on the day of Bitcoin's milestone achievement, has triggered widespread backlash on X. In a piece authored by Bryce Elder, city editor of FT Alphaville’s op-ed section, the outlet extended a biting ”apology” to those who may have refrained from investing in Bitcoin based on its coverage. The article took a sarcastic tone, stating: “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up.” Elder further defended the outlet's critical stance on Bitcoin over the years, dismissing claims that its skepticism was rooted in support for traditional finance (tradfi). “We’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.” The op-ed reiterated Alphaville's long-standing criticisms of Bitcoin, labeling it a ”negative-sum game,” ”chronically inefficient,” and a ”compromised” store of value. Elder doubled down on the publication's past analyses, claiming that Bitcoin’s price remains an “arbitrary hype gauge disconnected from any utility.” The reaction from the crypto community on X was swift and unforgiving. Many dismissed the piece as a ”Cope-Pology” or a ”faux apology,” accusing FT Alphaville of lacking humility despite years of misplaced skepticism. One commenter remarked, ”Imagine being so wrong and still having this lack of humility,” reflecting the sentiment of many Bitcoin proponents who felt vindicated by the cryptocurrency's historic price milestone. Others highlighted the irony of the apology, calling it an admission of failure masked in sarcasm. FT Alphaville's critical stance on Bitcoin is nothing new. Since its first article on Bitcoin in June 2011—when the cryptocurrency was trading at $15.90—the publication has consistently framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble. Over the years, its writers have targeted every aspect of Bitcoin, from its price to its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2014, Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve risk examiner, likened Satoshi to a ”reckless” doctor prescribing penicillin without diagnosis. Williams argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule ignored the natural ebbs and flows of economic cycles, calling it a ”poorly designed” experiment destined for failure. Despite such criticisms, Bitcoin's meteoric rise from niche internet experiment to a globally recognized asset has made it one of the most debated topics in financial media. Bitcoin's Critics Stand Firm Even as Bitcoin crosses the $100,000 threshold, it still faces staunch criticism from prominent figures in traditional finance. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin as “rat poison squared,” while JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has referred to it as a “fraud” in the past. Meanwhile, financial commentator Peter Schiff has consistently predicted Bitcoin's collapse, often mocking its supporters. These critics now find themselves in the spotlight for their erroneous predictions. In November 2019, many publicly claimed Bitcoin would never hit $100,000—a claim that Bitcoin’s historic rally has decisively debunked. Bitcoin's price surge has also shifted how the media covers the cryptocurrency. While earlier narratives largely framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble or scam, recent coverage has begun to recognize its resilience and adoption by institutions. As noted by Bitcoin proponents, the media's evolving perception mirrors broader societal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. The controversy surrounding FT Alphaville’s “apology” shows the tension between traditional financial media and the burgeoning crypto space. While Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a significant milestone, it also highlights a growing divide in how the asset is perceived. Whether the op-ed was a genuine apology or a sarcastic jab, one thing remains clear: Bitcoin’s story is far from over, and its critics will continue to grapple with its ever-changing narrative. Bitcoin's Sudden Price Plunge Wipes Out $300M in Long Positions, Shaking the Market A sharp and unexpected drop in Bitcoin's price sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market on Dec. 5, liquidating over $300 million in long positions within minutes. The dramatic 5.47% decline briefly pushed Bitcoin below $93,000 before it rebounded, leaving traders and analysts speculating on the implications for the broader market. Between 10:23 am and 10:28 am UTC, Bitcoin fell from $98,338 to $92,957, a rapid decline that erased nearly 10% of its market value in just 180 seconds. The sudden movement caused significant liquidations, with data from CoinGlass revealing $303.48 million in long positions wiped out within the hour. While Bitcoin's price has since rebounded to $96,410, the brief dip below $93,000 has left many traders reeling. The event places the spotlight on the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even as Bitcoin recently celebrated its historic breach of the $100,000 price level. Traders Weigh In Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, provided an optimistic take, suggesting the sharp correction may have cleared excessive leverage in the market. “That wipe cleared out most of the lever on BTC. Only reason we go lower is if it spooked enough people into taking profit,” Hartmann commented on X, estimating a 70% chance that the market flush has ended. Pseudonymous crypto trader Smiley Capital highlighted the unprecedented nature of the event, calling it historic: “It took Bitcoin 3 minutes to drop ~10%, which equals ~200B drop. 180 seconds. 200 billion dollars lower,” Smiley Capital noted in a post on X. While the abrupt decline may signal a momentary setback, analysts believe it could indicate a period of consolidation rather than the end of Bitcoin's bull run. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, suggested Bitcoin might enter a short-term plateau. “While we don’t see this as the end of the Bitcoin bull run, it does signal we are entering a consolidation phase in the days/weeks ahead,” Sycamore wrote on X. The last major consolidation phase occurred between March and October of this year, when Bitcoin traded between $53,000 and $72,000 following its then-all-time high of $73,679. If history repeats itself, the market could stabilize within a similar range before resuming its upward trajectory. Bitcoin’s rapid rise to $100,000, culminating in a new all-time high of $104,000 on Dec. 4, has been fueled by strong institutional demand and tightening supply. The year saw over $31 billion in net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, combined with reduced Bitcoin issuance following April's halving event. Despite the bullish backdrop, such rapid price increases are often accompanied by heightened volatility. Analysts suggest the market’s reaction to the Dec. 5 plunge will offer insights into its resilience and potential for further growth. Bitcoin's ability to recover quickly from the sudden drop may reaffirm its growing maturity as an asset class. However, the event serves as a reminder of the market’s susceptibility to extreme volatility, especially in times of heightened leverage and speculative trading. While the near-term outlook may involve consolidation, the broader picture remains one of optimism. Many analysts continue to predict higher price targets for Bitcoin, with some forecasting a potential climb to $124,000 or beyond by the end of the year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 05:28:22

He loves Solana,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar/,"David Sacks, a venture capitalist and podcaster, will work as the White House AI and crypto czar under President-elect Donald Trump’s new administration. On Thursday, the president elect announced on Truth Social that David Sacks will be the AI and crypto czar for the White House. This position is first of its kind created by him specially for crypto-related policies. He wrote that the AI and crypto czar will determine America’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policies. David will form a legal framework on cryptocurrencies and head a presidential council on science and technology issues. Trump also added that “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas” by protecting free speech online and guiding the nation away from the hold and censorship of big tech companies. Trump’s announcement is a sign that his coming administration is rewarding Silicon Valley people who backed his campaign. It also signals that the administration will support policies that many crypto business venturers prefer. Sacks became Trump’s major support after a prominent shift in his stance David was a casual Trump supporter until this year. He became a major ally, hosting a fundraiser at his big San Francisco house. Tickets to the event were each worth $50,000, and those who paid $300,000 got additional benefits, such as a photo with Trump personally. It was a big transition in Sacks’ attitude since he openly criticized Trump a couple of weeks after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Back then, David said on his All-In podcast that the Republican nominee was obviously to blame for those events and he “disqualified himself from being a candidate at a national level.”.

It’s a big deal, and there’s no way around it. The job? To guide the country’s policy on two of the most important fields in tech right now—artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. But can he actually pull it off? That’s the real question. Sorce : Donald Trump Truth Social Profile Is This Role Too Much for David Sacks? Let’s be real. This job is not easy. Sacks will need to balance a lot. He’s supposed to be the middleman between the White House, Congress, and agencies like the SEC. His job is to finally give crypto the clear rules it’s been begging for, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI’s potential for privacy breaches, national security risks, and job losses is a huge problem, and Sacks will have to face it head-on. The question is: Can he handle it? Does He Have What It Takes? Look, David Sacks isn’t new to big challenges. He’s been involved in companies like PayPal and founded Yammer. But stepping into a role like this is a whole different beast. It’s one thing to run a company; it’s another to regulate industries that are moving faster than you can blink. He’ll have to deal with both AI and crypto, all while pushing back against Big Tech bias and protecting free speech online. Can he really juggle all of this and lead effectively? What’s at Stake? If Sacks gets this right, he could play a major part in keeping the U.S. on top when it comes to AI and cryptocurrency. But if he slips up? We could fall behind. These industries aren’t going anywhere—they’re shaping the future. The U.S. needs clear guidelines, and fast. There’s a lot riding on how Sacks handles it. What Happens Next?

Although Bitcoin dipped to $97,000, analyst are expecting an explosive altcoin rally . With altcoins like XRP already showing impressive growth, the market is gearing up for a major breakout, signaling the start of a potential altcoin season. Top Altcoins to Watch for Big Gains In a recent video analysis, Van de Poppe has identified several new altcoins with the potential for substantial growth in the coming months. According to him, these new coins paired with BTC will perform well in the current bull cycle. One of his top picks is Optimism (OP) , a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, is one of his top picks. With Ethereum’s scalability issues addressed, he expects Optimism to outperform Ethereum itself in the upcoming rally. He also points to SEI , a Layer-1 project that has recently undergone a price correction. Van de Poppe believes SEI could see a 3-4X increase against Bitcoin once it breaks key price levels. Omni , a smaller altcoin, is also under the analyst’s radar, as it has shown signs of breaking out from consolidation after a listing on Binance. Other Altcoins like Hedera Hashgraph , and Stellar (XLM ) are following suit, showing tremendous growth, but there’s still more room to run. Apart from these new coins, he is also bullish on Ethereum . With over $300 million invested in Ethereum ETFs , institutional investors are showing increased interest, signaling strong market potential. Crypto Market Today As of December 5, the Altcoin Season Index remains strong at 87, signaling that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Van de Poppe anticipates Bitcoin will consolidate after breaking through the $100,000 resistance level, which could pave the way for altcoins to surge. While Bitcoin experienced a brief dip, currently trading at around $97,000, its upward momentum could still benefit altcoins in the coming months. The last altcoin season in early 2021 saw altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Chainlink surge, and a similar trend may unfold this time around. With Bitcoin stabilizing, the coming months could see explosive growth for altcoins. FAQs How can Ethereum ETFs impact the altcoin market? Over $300M in Ethereum ETFs signal growing institutional interest, potentially driving up Ethereum’s value and boosting altcoins overall. Which crypto will skyrocket in 2024? Analysts predict Optimism (OP), SEI, and Ethereum may see explosive growth, driven by market trends and increased institutional interest. Which crypto can give 1000x in 2024? Low-cap altcoins like Omni could have 1000x potential, but they carry high risks.

How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 05:37:00

The blockchain network, which has witnessed significant growth across its DeFi, gaming, and real-world assets ecosystems, ranks as the 20 th largest cryptocurrency by market. Per CoinGecko data, Sui’s market cap is currently over $12.3 billion, which has increased sharply amid the 110% and 560% surge in SUI price over the past month and past year respectively. SUI traded at lows of $0.3648 in October 2023, which puts the current price level of $4.14 a notable 1,060% up. Analysts say Sui price could target $5 after its latest leg up. Copper adds USDC on Sui On Thursday, the Sui network hit upward momentum as a series of positive developments catalyzed bulls’ endeavors. Digital assets custody and collateral management provider Copper provided one of these positive announcements. In a blog post , Copper said it had added support for the USDC stablecoin on Sui. Circle’s USDC is a 1:1 USD redeemable stablecoin and is live on Copper’s custodial ecosystem, the company noted. Sui @SuiNetwork · Follow USDC on Sui now has the support of @CopperHQ ’s enterprise-grade custody infrastructure, adding even more momentum to Sui’s top 10 DeFi ecosystem! 9:17 pm · 5 Dec 2024 353 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies The integration comes nearly two months after Circle announced native USDC on Sui and will see institutional investors benefit from a reliable and secure USD-pegged stablecoin ecosystem. Stablecoin issuer Circle added native USDC on Sui in October. Adam VandenBoogaard, co-head of revenue for Americas at Copper, said: “Support USDC on the Sui blockchain is a notable step in strengthening our partnership with Sui. With much more to unlock across the stablecoin and Real-World Asset spaces, we’re committed to connecting the institutional finance world to on-chain opportunities on the Sui Network.” Integration key to DeFi Sui has seen its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem grow to a total value locked of over $2 billion. The addition of USDC via Copper’s integration will drive growth in this space even further. Sui Foundation head of ecosystem development Jameel Khalfan noted this in a statement. Currently, Sui ranks among the 10 largest DeFi chains. Jameel added, “Adding support for this asset within Copper’s enterprise-grade custody services will only add to the astounding growth of Sui as a destination for DeFi users.” The positive news for Sui also includes Phantom Wallet’s support. The layer-1 blockchain announced on Thursday that the DeFi and NFTs wallet is “coming to the Sui ecosystem.” Users will benefit from multi-chain support, native bridges, and asset swaps among other features.

Speaking about the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, Roubini noted Bitcoin's inherent volatility and lack of fundamental utility as a medium of exchange. Roubini criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for failing to meet the basic requirements of a currency. He argued that Bitcoin is neither a scalable means of payment nor a stable store of value. “Bitcoin is not an economic unit of account, it is not a stable store of value and it is not a scalable means of payment,” he said, citing its history of extreme price swings. Drawing attention to the example of El Salvador, where Bitcoin has begun to be used as legal tender, he said that less than 1% of transactions in the country are carried out using cryptocurrency. “I don’t think Bitcoin will ever become a currency,” he added. Related News: Giant Whale Sells Last Altcoins After Market Rally, Profiting 100,000x on This Altcoin Roubini also disagreed with the claims that Bitcoin provides protection against inflation or the devaluation of fiat currencies. “Historically, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with the stock market,” Roubini said, explaining that its price tends to rise and fall with stocks rather than acting as a counterweight during periods of inflation. Unlike gold, which has traditionally been a reliable hedge during inflationary periods, he argued that Bitcoin’s performance has not been in line with such expectations. Roubini also voiced concerns about regulatory developments in the crypto space. While acknowledging that retail use is increasing, he warned that looser regulation could lead to another speculative bubble. “The risk is that we are moving towards too little regulation, which could pave the way for scams and market failures similar to what we saw with FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried,” he said. He warned that a lack of oversight could increase systemic risks in the crypto ecosystem, resulting in another bubble and bust cycle. “Many players in this space are shady and weak regulation only increases the risk of fraud and volatility,” Roubini said. *This is not investment advice.

This move also shook the Worldcoin price, which was stuck in a tight consolidation phase as the bears restricted the trade within predetermined price levels. Meanwhile, the November breakout helped the price to rise above the range, which is now primed to rise by another 25% after securing a 25% upswing. Worldcoin is among the tokens that have failed to rise even 20% close to its yearly highs, which have already been surpassed by many. The prolonged accumulation may have attracted huge trader’s attention and as a result, the platform witnessed a massive increase in volume. With the levels hitting $2 billion from the lows below $400 million, the future prospectus of the WLD price remains extremely bullish as it has more room to grow. After facing a massive downfall, the bulls failed to trigger a strong rebound and as a result, the token remained accumulated for a long time. Meanwhile, the bulls caused some variations in between, which formed a bullish pattern later. Luckily, the recent price rise pushed the levels above the neckline of the Adam & Eve pattern and after a retest, the token has begun its journey towards higher highs. The WLD price is currently trading around $4 with over 21% in the past 24 hours and a cumulative growth of over 100% in the past 30 days. Although the price remains 65% away from its ATH at $11.82, the token demonstrates bullish performance and high volatility. Therefore, now that the price has launched a massive upswing, the next levels to watch could be around $4.4 while the pivotal resistance to achieve could be around $5.1, which may validate a rise from the bearish influence. Therefore, if the token continues to hold similar bullish momentum and reaches $5, then the probability of reaching a double-digit figure could be validated. However, this move could consume more time than expected, probably in the first few days of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 05:52:20

And Why Has Donald Trump Made Him Crypto Czar? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Former PayPal executive and renowned venture capitalist David O. Sacks has been appointed by Donald Trump as the White House’s first “AI & Crypto Czar.” This new role is part of Trump’s plan to position America as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, two rapidly growing fields shaping the future. The announcement came shortly after Bitcoin reached its $100k milestone . Why Trump Appointed David Sacks Only? In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced Sacks’ appointment and highlighted his mission to create a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector. However, Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks arose from his impressive track record as a tech entrepreneur and investor. Sacks, a founding-era COO of PayPal and a key member of the “PayPal Mafia,” has built and supported some of Silicon Valley’s most successful ventures. His expertise in technology and finance makes him tackle the challenges and opportunities in AI and crypto effectively. Meanwhile, some experts even hint that Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks is seen as a reward for his loyal support during the campaign. Sacks played a pivotal role in fundraising for Trump, helping to raise $12 million during a high-profile event earlier this year. What Changes Could Sacks Bring? David Sacks will focus on creating clear rules for cryptocurrencies to remove confusion and help the U.S. digital asset industry grow. His goal is to support crypto businesses and position the United States as a global leader in digital innovation. According to Trump, he will “steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” ensuring a balanced digital landscape that supports open discourse. Sacks will also focus on safeguarding free speech in the online space Additionally, Sacks will chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, guiding the administration’s policies on emerging technologies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : David Sacks Crypto Czar: Trump’s Visionary Choice to Shape US Tech Policy , Sacks Close Ties to Trump and Musk Sacks has been a strong Trump supporter of Trump, hosting fundraisers and rallying tech industry donors.

As of Thursday, JASMY broke out of a seven-month consolidation phase, climbing to $0.054. The Altcoin Outperforming Major Cryptos In addition to its impressive yearly performance, JasmyCoin has seen notable gains over shorter time frames, recording increases of 118%, 162%, and 211% over the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively.

Market experts anticipate that the overall market’s bullish trend could continue at least until the second quarter of 2025, suggesting further growth potential for JASMY, which remains 98% below its all-time high of $4.79, reached during the 2021 bull market. However, with further gains expected in the coming months, potentially reaching a cycle top by October 2025, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto, will play a key role as it often leads the way for further price appreciation like the altcoin in question. But, what exactly is JasmyCoin, and why has it attracted significant investment in recent weeks? JasmyCoin Eyes Key Resistance Levels JasmyCoin is the native token of the Jasmy platform, which aims to democratize data usage by integrating blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The platform provides a decentralized and secure infrastructure that allows individuals to control and monetize their personal data. Users can safely store and manage their data while granting businesses access with their consent. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this altcoin is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 50 billion tokens. Its primary uses include data transfer and storage, payment for services, facilitating market entry for institutional investors, offering crypto loans, and optimizing tax strategies. In contrast to Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains of 120%—following its recent all-time high of $104,000—JASMY has significantly outperformed the largest digital asset. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin saw a trading volume increase of 64% compared to Wednesday, while JasmyCoin recorded a nearly 100% surge in trading volume during the same period. As JasmyCoin continues its upward trajectory, technical analysis reveals critical resistance levels at $0.063, $0.067, and $0.070 on its JASMY/USDT daily chart—heights not seen since January 2022. These levels could pose challenges to further price surges for the altcoin. Conversely, key support levels to monitor include $0.040, which is vital for maintaining bullish momentum, and $0.031. Holding these support levels will be crucial for the altcoin as it aims to inch closer to the $0.10 mark.

Meanwhile, Binance.US listed the popular meme coin PEPE. This could be attributed to the growing acceptance of meme coins, which now has a collective market cap exceeding $140 billion. On a philanthropic note, the DOGS meme coin launched a charity portal, and pledged impressive donations to nonprofits and animal welfare. New Solana Meme Coin Raises Eyebrows Michael Bouhanna, a vice president at Sotheby’s auction house, again made waves in the crypto world with the launch of a second Solana-based meme coin. On Dec. 4, Bouhanna teased the release of his latest art-themed meme coin, Nothing (VOID), on his social media account. Shortly after, a wallet associated with him minted the VOID token. The launch led to a very lucrative trading event where one trader purchased 462 million VOID tokens for close to $8,200 worth of Solana (SOL) and sold 439 million of them just 30 minutes later for over $1 million. This isn’t Bouhanna’s first venture into the meme coin space. Earlier, he created another token called Comedian (BAN) , that is inspired by the viral $6-million banana artwork that was famously purchased by Tron founder Justin Sun. However, the BAN token’s launch became controversial after allegations of insider trading emerged. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain accused Bouhanna of making $1 million in profits through insider wallets associated with the BAN token. According to the firm, Bouhanna previouslyinvested in other meme coins with limited success, suggesting that the launch of BAN was motivated by a desire to profit from the hype. Bouhanna denied the allegations , and argued that the wallet in question does not belong to him and that the reported profits were largely unrealized. He described the creation of BAN as a personal hobby with no connection to his role at Sotheby’s. Bouhanna also clarified that he initially intended to launch the token anonymously to avoid any association with his professional profile. However, the community quickly linked the project to him, and created a narrative that BAN was affiliated with Sotheby’s. Bouhanna then claimed this narrative was used to promote the token without his consent. The community’s reaction to Bouhanna’s involvement in meme coins has been mixed. While some applauded his creativity, others criticized his actions and questioned the ethics of launching such tokens. Some users tagged Sotheby’s , and asked whether the auction house condoned these kinds of activities by its executives. Hawk Tuah Meme Coin Sparks Outrage Another meme coin also recently faced some controversy. The launch of Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) meme coin ignited widespread outrage across social media after a dramatic pump-and-dump scenario that unfolded shortly after its release. The crypto was launched at 10:00 pm UTC on Dec. 4, and the token quickly reached a peak market cap of $490 million before crashing by 91% in just three hours. On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps and Dexscreener revealed that between 80% and 90% of the HAWK token supply at launch was controlled by a combination of insider wallets and snipers. These entities very quickly bought large portions of the token’s supply during its early trading moments. Solana block explorer Solscanner pointed out a specific wallet that sniped 17.5% of the token’s supply for 4,195 Wrapped Solana (WSOL), valued at $993,000 at the time. Over the next 90 minutes, the wallet sold 135.8 million HAWK tokens, netting a profit of $1.3 million. In a Dec. 5 X post, Welch denied allegations of insider activity or any distribution of free tokens to influencers. She stated that the team did not sell any tokens and took measures to try and reduce sniper risks by launching on the decentralized liquidity protocol Meteora, which included high fees at the start of the launch. Despite these claims, the big price decline and the dominance of snipers and insiders in the token’s early supply fueled skepticism. The fallout from the HAWK token’s price crash has been quite severe, and several users reported major losses. One user on X shared that they lost $43,000 after investing in the token, while another reportedly swapped $1.4 million worth of MOODENG into HAWK and lost $1.3 million in the process. Some people suggest that Welch and her team may face legal repercussions as a result of the controversial token launch. Multiple users on X even claimed to file complaints with the SEC, and law firms started soliciting the affected investors. Burwick Law invited those who lost money on HAWK to contact them to explore their legal rights. Binance.US Lists PEPE On the other hand, things are going much better for other meme coins. Binance.US recently announced the listing of the popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE). The listing allows users to trade it against Tether (USDT) starting Dec. 5. Data from CoinMarketCap indicated that PEPE has a market cap of over $9 billion. PEPE’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The listing is part of a broader trend among crypto exchanges which are increasing their offerings of meme coins. This movement gained a lot of momentum after the election of crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump. Coinbase, for example, recently listed meme coins like Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF), while Binance.US added Bonk (BONK) to its roster in November. Meme coins collectively boast a market cap of more than $140 billion. The rise of meme coins sparked mixed reactions from the crypto community. Supporters like Murad Mahmudov argue that meme coins provide a legitimate use case for cryptocurrencies by reducing speculation premiums on altcoins. Critics, including Jimmy Song , view meme coins as overly speculative and detrimental to investors. Pepe is a cartoon frog that was created by artist Matt Furie in 2005. Since then, it has become a cultural phenomenon and a key symbol in the crypto space. Its popularity extends beyond just PEPE to other meme coins inspired by Furie’s work, like Brett (BRETT), Andy (ANDY), and Landwolf (WOLF). DOGS Launches Charity Portal The DOGS meme coin announced plans to donate more than 6 billion tokens, which are valued at almost $4.5 million, to nonprofit organizations worldwide. This announcement was made after the launch of a charity portal in late November that allowed registered nonprofits to apply for funding. DOGS plans to redirect unclaimed airdrop tokens to support charitable causes. As part of its charitable efforts, DOGS partnered with Best Friends Animal Society, and committed $150,000 to help care for homeless animals in the United States. This collaboration fits in perfectly with DOGS’ mission to support shelters in achieving a 90% no-kill rate by 2025. DOGS founder Andrew refered to the partnership as a call to action for the crypto community. Through this initiative, DOGS will fund one month of care for adopted dogs, with its mascot, Spotty, serving as an ambassador in events and promotional campaigns. The DOGS token was inspired by Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov’s iconic dog drawing. It symbolizes Digital Resistance and reflects TON’s rebranding after Durov’s arrest in France earlier this year. The dog symbol dates back to 2011 when Durov resisted demands to censor liberal and dissident voices in Russia. DOGS launched an airdrop in September, and quickly reached 17 million users . One of the main goals of the airdrop was to increase crypto awareness on Telegram and promote animal welfare by using the DOGS Mini App, which has over 53 million users. Despite its initial success, DOGS has faced a 50+% decline in value.

Flexible loans in USDT, BTC, and ETH are currently supported, with collateral assets such as USDT, BTC, and ETH accepted. There are plans to expand the range of loanable and collateral assets for Flexible Crypto Loans in the future. Meanwhile, the first phase of HTX’s limited-time “Borrow & Earn” event will also kick off, with a prize pool of 2,700,000,000 $HTX up for grabs.

Despite being up by more than 15 percent in the last seven days, ADA is currently showing no signs of bullish momentum. To start, let’s take a look at the broader picture for ADA. Short-Term Focus: Right now, the focus is on higher prices, with the potential for a pullback into the orange support region between $0.64 and $0.94. This could offer an opportunity for those looking to enter at better levels. On the smaller time frames, the analyst shared potential upside extensions, but if the price breaks below the support range between $1.11 and $1.21, it could signal a larger wave four pullback. If the price falls below $1.05, that would invalidate this structure. The target levels to watch for are around $1.42, $1.72, $2.36, and possibly even $2.95 in a euphoric phase. However, these targets depend on the price action during the next pullback. Bitcoin’s Influence: Bitcoin’s dominance has increased a bit, and for now, the focus is back on Bitcoin. However, altcoins like ADA aren’t necessarily suffering; they are just moving sideways. This pullback is still part of the overall setup, so higher prices are still in play. Key Resistance and Breakout Signals: If ADA breaks above the recent high around $1.25, it could signal an upside breakout. The more significant signal will come with a break above the yellow wave 1 high at $1.32 or $1.33, but the analyst said that ADA is not quite there yet. Near-Term Price Targets: If the third wave is unfolding, the price could hit the $1.42 level next. If the microstructure remains valid, we could see higher targets around $1.49 or $1.55.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 06:09:40

Key Insights from Supply Distribution Data,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-100k-just-the-beginning-key-insights-from-supply-distribution-data/,"Bitcoin has reached a landmark moment in its history earlier today, crossing the $100,000 price mark for the first time and cementing its position once again as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As it stands, BTC all-time high is at roughly $103,679. This significant achievement has prompted a detailed analysis of its supply distribution, offering valuable insights into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders and the broader implications for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Silent Whales: Rising Exchange Inflows Hint at Market’s Next Big Move Supply Distribution and Market Behaviour Amid the excitement of Bitcoin’s new all-time high, an analysis from CryptoQuant’s analyst, Crazzyblockk, sheds light on how this milestone impacts the cryptocurrency’s realized cap and the broader market structure. While the milestone reflects growing global adoption and investment confidence, it also raises questions about the potential trajectory of the market. According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s supply is currently divided between two key groups of holders: long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs). CryptoQuant data reveals that out of Bitcoin’s total supply, over 14.5 million BTC are held by LTHs, while nearly 5 million BTC are in the hands of STHs. Despite the price surge, only 52% of Bitcoin’s realized cap is attributed to STHs, a stark contrast to previous market peaks where this figure typically exceeded 80%. Historically, Bitcoin’s realized cap trends reveal distinct behaviors during market cycles. During bear market phases, most realized cap shifts towards LTHs as accumulation intensifies, signaling the end of the bearish trend. Conversely, during bull market peaks, the realized cap tends to be dominated by STHs, driven by speculative trading and short-term profits. However, the current distribution shows a higher concentration among LTHs, indicating a deviation from traditional market patterns. Implications for Bitcoin’s Market Momentum According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the relatively low realized cap held by STHs in the current market cycle suggests reduced selling pressure, which may support sustained price growth. The analyst revealed that with a significant proportion of Bitcoin held by LTHs, market confidence appears strong, potentially providing a buffer against abrupt price corrections. This stability is crucial as it reflects long-term investor trust and reduces the likelihood of speculative volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move? Coinbase Premium Suggests a Short-Term Rally May Be Brewing In addition, the analysis also highlights that this supply distribution aligns with a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The reduced participation of STHs in the realized cap indicates room for further upward movement as more capital may enter the market without triggering a significant sell-off. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is a historic achievement, but the current supply dynamics suggest the potential for further upward movement, given the stability provided by LTHs and the relatively low participation of STHs in the realized cap.

However, some analysts are concerned about its operating mechanism. The platform facilitated the launch of the M3M3 token to serve as a test run for this concept, with the token quickly gaining traction among the crypto community. Understanding the M3M3 platform M3M3 is Meteora’s attempt to address the challenges in the meme coin market, where the majority of tokens fail to sustain long-term value. Data confirms the grim state of meme coins, as out of 1.2 million new tokens launched last month on pump.fun, only 1.4% migrated to decentralized exchanges, and a mere 0.05% surpassed a $1 million market capitalization. This is largely due to the high rate of rug pulls. Earlier in the year, a crypto.news report confirmed that deployers of Solana-based meme coins facilitated rugpulls, leading to a combined loss of $26 million for investors in March. Most recently, the Hawk Tuah token collapsed 90% hours after launch amid rug pull allegations. $HAWK didn’t disappoint 96% of the supply in one cluster nice 🤡 https://t.co/AP645QzkfI pic.twitter.com/ERHTG7v5oa — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 4, 2024 Meteora looks to address these issues by promoting a player-versus-platform (PPP) model for meme coins. This would represent a shift from a player-versus-player (PvP) environment, where quick liquidity withdrawals often leave holders at a loss. The new PPP model will introduce a staking approach, according to the announcement. This staking mechanism essentially encourages token holders to stake their assets, reducing selling pressure and fostering long-term stability. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗠𝟯𝗠𝟯 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀: • Stake your memecoin to earn the fee rewards in M3M3. • The more you stake, the more you earn. • Only the top stakers share in the fee rewards. • If you unstake your tokens, you must wait before you can withdraw them. pic.twitter.com/uZF1aAIpac — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) December 4, 2024 How the M3M3 staking model works The M3M3 system incentivizes staking by presenting rewards derived from locked liquidity swap fees. These fees are distributed among the top stakers in the form of Solana ( SOL ) tokens, which can be claimed immediately, and meme coin rewards that are automatically restaked. The model potentially creates a positive feedback loop: as more participants stake, the competition increases, driving token purchases and enhancing liquidity, which in turn generates more rewards. Unstaking comes with conditions, as participants must wait a designated period before withdrawing tokens. This mechanism discourages short-term speculation and promotes sustained participation. A saturated market Meanwhile, M3M3 enters a crowded market of token deployment platforms, including Pump.fun, SunPump, and Snek.fun. PancakeSwap also recently launched Springboard on BNB Chain. Each competitor has carved out a niche by facilitating meme coin launches and liquidity generation. For instance, Pump.fun focuses on hype-driven token launches, while SunPump leverages on-chain buyback and burn mechanisms. Meanwhile, Springboard allows free token launches. However, M3M3’s introduction of staking rewards could set it apart by addressing the issue of value retention. By comparison, M3M3 leverages a staking mechanism inspired by the “(3,3)” model to create a sustainable ecosystem. Possible strengths and drawbacks The M3M3 model has several advantages. First, it incentivizes token holders to stake rather than sell, reducing market volatility. Second, it reportedly provides a steady income stream through fee rewards, even during market downturns the official website claims. Also, its configurability makes it attractive to launchpads seeking staking solutions for new projects. However, the platform is not without challenges. Its reliance on staking to sustain demand may falter if rewards become insufficient to attract participants. The potential for high entry barriers, as only top stakers benefit significantly, could alienate smaller investors.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 07:01:00

The confusion is evident in BTC's trading on Thursday, as it finally rose to six figures, tapping record highs near $103,900 before plummeting to $91,100, ultimately ending the day in UTC at approximately $97,000, data from TradingView and CoinDesk show. The trading range was so large that it engulfed all the price action since Nov. 20. This led to the formation of a ""high wave candle,"" characterized by a small real body that shows the gap between the open and closing prices, along with large shadows (wicks) that reflect unusually wide price swings throughout the day. It's a sign that the bulls now have less than full control, with sellers looking to reassert themselves, serving as a cautionary indicator for those looking to chase the market at this moment. This cautionary signal becomes even more significant given that the pattern has appeared at record highs, representing a failure to maintain gains above the closely-watched $100,000 mark. ""The long upper shadows mean that sometime after the session's open, buying pressure thrust the security's price to an extended high. During the same session, selling pressure drove the price to a protracted low. Yet, by the session's close, the price returned almost to the opening price. That's confusion,"" CMT 's explainer for high-wave candles says. The high wave candle gets its name because Japanese traders liken the extended shadows, or wicks, to large ocean waves. The high wave candle, coupled with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, a momentum indicator, points to consolidation or a temporary bearish shift in the market trend. A bearish divergence occurs when the momentum oscillator sich as the RSI doesn't confirm the new high in prices. The message is consistent with several analysts expressing concerns about overcrowding in long positions and the potential for price pullbacks. Moreover, directional plays become challenging while prices remain locked within Thursday's range, indicating ongoing market confusion. If it breaks below the range, more sellers may enter the market. Conversely, a move above Thursday's high would suggest a resumption of the bullish trend. Notably, Deribit-listed BTC calls expiring at the end of December now trade at a three volatility premium over puts, down from the five or higher seen on Thursday, according to data source Amberdata. This shift indicates that bullish sentiment has tempered.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|Markets|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-06 07:02:16

At that time, the market “capped out at ~$70K and ~$5K respectively back then, with $BTC only now reaching that target – lesson in there,” Burniske noted.

He emphasized that “no one ever lost money” by taking profits, adding that any foregone gains during the process would amount to psychological discomfort rather than actual losses. “No one ever lost money taking profits, the foregone gains as you harvest on the way up are psychological pain only. Sure hodl some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life.” Chris Burniske The Placeholder partner also urged investors to balance their financial goals with life priorities. “Time is more precious than even $BTC,” he wrote, emphasizing the importance of enjoying returns rather than striving for perfection. Burniske’s advice comes as Bitcoin has finally surpassed $100,000, setting a new all-time high of nearly $104,000. However, the BTC price has since pulled back to $95,000. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $98,067, with the total crypto market capitalization at $1.94 trillion.

On-chain data flagged that the beleaguered firm moved a whopping 3,620 coins, sparking concerns as the broader market witnessed over $1 billion in crypto liquidations recently. BTC price backtracked below the $100K level, raising severe market concerns amid the bankrupt exchange’s massive transfers. Bitcoin News: Bankrupt Crypto Exchange Shifts 3,620 BTC Raising Market Concerns According to the latest data by Arkham Intelligence , Mt Gox was recorded as shifting 3,620 BTC to two unknown wallets via a couple of transactions. Per the data, the bankrupt crypto exchange moved 3,493 coins, worth $340 million, to the unknown wallet address 1MAXy6…Ez3NQ9. Further, the exchange shifted another 126.577 coins, worth $12.33 million, to the unknown wallet address bc1qkf…ffm7sf. Overall, these transactions garnered significant attention as they could potentially be used in preparation for creditors’ reimbursement. Also, it’s noteworthy that these creditors may decide to sell the funds when received, thereby bringing heightened selling pressure to the flagship crypto ahead. Market participants remain apprehensive as this Bitcoin news could cause the crypto to face significant turbulence. Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that the defunct crypto exchange moved massive amounts of the same coin previously. CoinGape reported Mt Gox to have transferred 24K BTC quite recently, adding to concerns in light of creditor reimbursement plans. Crypto’s Price Slips Below $100K At the time of reporting, BTC price backtracked substantially, down 4% to $87,859. Its 24-hour low and high were $91,998.78 and $103,583, respectively. Notably, the flagship coin rides a rollercoaster ride against the backdrop of the broader crypto market movement that witnessed a flash crash intraday. Notably, the crash comes against the backdrop of over $1 billion in liquidations recorded across the crypto market, per recent Coinglass data. Further, the beleaguered firm’s recent transfers amid the massive liquidation have kept traders and investors on their toes. Nevertheless, broader sentiments amid a bullish Q4 remain optimistic, as also seen by Bitcoin rebounding from a $91K intraday low to near $98K. Market watchers continue to extensively eye the coin for further price action shifts amid a Q4 power play in the crypto realm. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that BTC miner Marathon Digital recently completed its $850 million convertible note offering at 0% interest. The proceeds from this offering are to be used in BTC purchases, emerging as optimistic Bitcoin news for the broader market. This saga has in turn sparked contrasting sentiments, carving a bullish outlook for the coin’s future despite Mt Gox’s movements.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty said Sacks will push President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans forward. It will also bring upside momentum to the cryptocurrencies he supports, including XRP and ZRX. Crypto Czar David Sacks Is SEC v Ripple, XRP Expert US President-elect Donald Trump on December 5 appointed David O. Sacks as the “White House AI & Crypto Czar.” Trump added that Sacks will guide the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency policies, two areas extremely vital to the future of American competitiveness. This is good news for Ripple and XRP community as he rooted for the company during the SEC lawsuit. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Moreover, he will work towards establishing a legal framework for the crypto industry, bringing crypto regulatory clarity to promote and thrive the industry in the United States. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty React Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulated David Sacks on the appointment. Garlinhouse said, “He understands tech inside and out, and importantly, will push forward President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans.” Stuart Alderoty thinks Sacks is another great pick by the Trump administration. Paul Atkins’ nomination as SEC Chairman to replace Gary Gensler by Trump sparked a massive bullish sentiment in the crypto industry. Alderoty said it will bring the “pro-business, pro-innovation, and fresh perspective we need.” He is also excited to work with David Sacks and the industry to finally establish clear rules of the road for crypto in the US. “The future starts now!” he claimed. XRP News: Ripple Vs SEC Lawsuit Nears End David Sacks has followed the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit and XRP news. An old video has emerged where he said Ripple won the case as Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security. John Deaton reacted to the video, claiming the win was a total victory for XRP. The price is now trading resiliently above $2.35 with a $134 billion market cap. As someone very involved in the @Ripple XRP case, the win was a total victory regarding everything important. And as @Jason said to @DavidSacks let’s see how XRP trades later. Hate it or love it, XRP above $2 with a $133B market cap is resilient. https://t.co/mYx06iLLBt — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 6, 2024 Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo and pro-XRP lawyers strongly claim that the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit appeal will likely get dropped or dismissed. Trump’s pro-crypto team, including Paul Atkins and David Sacks, has increased the odds of lawsuit resolution. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed his support for Atkins, calling him an “outstanding choice” to lead the watchdog. Meanwhile, speculation over whether the U.S. SEC will continue its legal battle or allow the deadline to pass as the January 15 deadline approaches. Amid the bullish news, XRP price has rallied 400% amid the change in leadership in the government agencies. The price currently trades at $2.36, up nearly 2% in last 24 hours and 50% in a week.

BTC futures recorded nearly $500 million in net liquidations, with $420 million of those stemming from longs, or bets on higher prices. ETH futures recorded a smaller $85 million in liquidations. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, they don't have enough funds to keep the trade open. Over 156,000 individual traders were liquidated, and the largest single liquidation order was on crypto exchange OKX – a BTC/USD trade worth $18 million. The data shows that some 89% of all traders affected were long traders, or those that bet on higher prices.

If you missed Mog Coin’s successful ICO, you’re not alone in your quiet longing for a better chance. Mog Coin rode the wave of internet nostalgia and delivered big rewards to its early adopters. But for those who missed the boat, the story isn’t over. Enter BTFD Coin , a meme coin built not just on humour but on solid fundamentals and a bullish outlook. Its presale has already raised over $1 million in under 10 days, selling more than 23 billion tokens to a community of over 2,400 holders. If Mog Coin was a cultural moment, BTFD Coin could be your chance to write your own crypto success story. Mog Coin: The Meme King That Captured Internet Hearts Every cat lover in Scandinavia will tell you that nothing unites people like a good feline meme. Mog Coin, inspired by the iconic Mog meme, brought a touch of warmth and whimsy to the cryptocurrency world. Launched with a focus on community and nostalgia, Mog Coin was a masterstroke in marrying internet culture with blockchain technology. During its ICO, Mog Coin was priced at just $0.000015 per token, and early investors quickly saw returns as the coin’s value surged. By the end of its first quarter, Mog Coin had doubled its market cap, supported by engaging campaigns and an active DAO that funded projects benefiting animal welfare—a cause close to many Nordic hearts. But its true charm lay in its purring potential. With every transaction, a portion was burned, making it a deflationary token. Mog Coin didn’t just offer a meme; it promised long-term rewards to its holders. Unfortunately, like an elusive aurora borealis, Mog Coin’s ICO was fleeting, leaving many investors wishing for a second chance. BTFD Coin: The New Meme Coin Set to Shine If Mog Coin was the cosy cat curled up by the fireplace, BTFD Coin is the daring bull charging into the snowstorm. BTFD Coin embodies the popular crypto mantra “Buy The Dip”, urging investors to see market downturns as opportunities, not setbacks. It’s a meme coin designed for those who believe in growth and resilience—a mindset that resonates well with Scandinavians who know how to weather life’s storms. BTFD Coin is more than just a cheeky name; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem designed for investors who want fun and functionality: Staking Rewards: Offering a staggering 90% average APY, BTFD Coin lets you grow your investment over time without lifting a finger. P2E Gaming: Its innovative play-to-earn game combines entertainment with tangible rewards, making it a hit for crypto gamers and casual players alike. Community Power: Led by the charismatic Bulls Squad , the project has fostered a vibrant community culture where every holder feels like a key player. Ethereum’s Strength: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD Coin benefits from top-tier security and scalability, ensuring its long-term success. Plus, BTFD Coin’s presale is turning heads.

FED Chairman Jerome Powell also stated at the New York Times Dealbook Summit that Bitcoin competes with gold rather than the US dollar. Anthony Georgiades, founder and general partner at Innovating Capital, noted the growing role of institutions in Bitcoin’s price action. He pointed to significant inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have brought nearly $8 billion to the market in November alone. He added that while institutional activity is driving the current momentum, individual investors could soon shift their focus to altcoins, setting the stage for a broader market rally. Related News: Giant Whale Sells Last Altcoins After Market Rally, Profiting 100,000x on This Altcoin Georgiades also noted the enduring appeal of memecoins like Dogecoin, especially for new cryptocurrency users. While acknowledging their speculative nature, he noted that memecoins often serve as an accessible entry point for individuals exploring the crypto space. Despite the risks, they continue to generate engagement and expand the crypto community. The analyst remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term outlook, pointing to the need for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption to maintain momentum.

As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-plunge-2-as-rising-bitcoin-dominance-could-crush-xrp-bulls/,"The post XRP Price to Plunge $2? As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, which experienced an impressive 335% gain in just one month, is now facing the threat of a significant price drop. After reaching its yearly high of $2.85 on December 3, XRP has already declined by nearly 18%. However, crypto expert Pav Hundal has raised concerns that if Bitcoin dominance continues to increase, XRP could drop to $2. With money already starting to shift back into Bitcoin, this could lead to a large sell-off in XRP, potentially wiping out long positions. Bitcoin Dominance Is the Real Threat Bitcoin dominance, which is currently sitting at 55.28% , has dropped slightly this week. However, Hundal hints that if it rises to 60-70%, the market could see a big shift as investors move their money from altcoins like XRP back into Bitcoin. XRP’s recent surge has made it a popular asset among traders, with open interest in XRP reaching new highs. This surge in leveraged positions, paired with XRP’s price retracing, could result in massive liquidations if the market continues to decline. Hundal mentioned that XRP longs are still being added, even as prices fall, signaling that the market may be approaching a “dangerous zone.” Meanwhile, the XRP/BTC ratio, which shows how strong XRP is compared to Bitcoin, is currently 0.00002375. This has increased by 2.7% since December 5 and by 47% over the past month. Additionally, Hundal suggests that if Bitcoin’s price becomes stable, it could calm the market and increase trading activity. XRP’s recent price surge has caught the attention of many investors—read our XRP price prediction to see where it’s headed next and stay ahead of the curve! Ripple Effect of Ripple’s Delay Adding to the uncertainty, Ripple’s recent delay in launching its RLUSD stablecoin has caused concerns among investors. This delay has led XRP to lose its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, falling behind USDT. XRP Bulls in Trouble? As of now, XRP is trading at $2.37, reflecting a slight price drop seen in the last 24 hours. If the price drops just 7% more, around $104 million in XRP long positions could be wiped out. XRP’s failure to break through the $2.50 resistance is putting even more pressure on the token, and the market cap has dropped below $134 billion. However, the next support level for XRP is near $2.20, with a potential further decline toward $2.00 if the bearish trend continues. But if it can clear the $2.50 resistance, we could see a rise to $2.70 or even $3.00. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These big purchases could lead to price increases for the underlying asset, which is predicted to continue its run and hit $1.5 next. ADA’s Current Run The so-called ‘Trump Pump’ initially missed ADA. While the rest of the market, led by BTC and DOGE, was charting massive gains, Cardano’s token remained relatively still at around $0.3. That all changed during the first weekend after the elections when IOG Founder Charles Hoskinson said he would work alongside the Trump administration to establish crypto regulations in the States. ADA skyrocketed immediately by double-digits and kept climbing in the following weeks amid the overall resurgance in the market, as well as other big hints by Hoskinson. The cryptocurrency’s ascent culminated on December 3, when it jumped to just over $1.3 for the first time in almost three years. Since then, though, ADA has retraced slightly to $1.2 after an 8% correction. The question now arises of what would push the asset further north and whether it can reach some of the big predictions made by analysts, including a price tag of up to $6. Whales on the Move Crypto whales tend to impact the market due to their ability to purchase or offload large portions of a certain asset. Consequently, their behavior could determine the upcoming price movements of a token. Recall that Cardano whales accumulated 130 million coins during the retracement at the end of November and the asset’s price jumped in the following days from $0.9 to the aforementioned peak of $1.3. The popular analyst Ali outlined another massive purchase by these large investors for more than 100 million ADA within the span of 24 hours. #Cardano whales bought over 100 million $ADA in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/IrZjA54tGy — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2024 This could lead to even further gains for ADA, as many experts have predicted that its next target is precisely $1.5, which means another 25% surge from its current levels. Ali, for instance, believes the asset has formed an “ascending triangle like it was extracted from a textbook” that could drive ti to that target.

However, analysts are pointing out that Litecoin (LTC) and crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) also see high volumes. Rollblock’s record-breaking crypto presale is racing toward $7 million sold as this top altcoin prepares for over 100x growth out of its highly anticipated ICO. Cardano Monthly Rally Fueled by Relentless Technical Upgrades In a little over one month, the Cardano price has gone from one of the year’s worst performers to one of its best. Cardano’s monthly rally of 270% has dragged it from a deep loss for 2024 to an almost 100% gain. Analysts attribute this impressive rebound to Cardano’s commitment to constant innovation. No sooner had Cardano completed its Chang upgrade than it announced its next big upgrade: midnight. The Midnight upgrade’s focus on the rapidly expanding DeFi sector has analysts expecting even more explosive growth for the Cardano price in 2025. Litecoin Stays at Centre of Expanding Web3 Thanks to Brand A growing Web3 economy has been a boon for the Litecoin price this month. Litecoin’s 35% rally in this week alone has brought its total monthly return to over 100%. Litecoin’s long-established brand makes it one of the top choices for merchants in the growing Web3 economy. These Web3 merchants are willing to overlook Litecoin’s slipping transaction technology in favor of the sense of security that its brand provides for customers. At the current rate of Web3 expansion, the Litecoin price is expected to continue its rapid ascent through 2025. Rollblock CoinMarketCap Listing Sends Sales Volumes Soaring Rollblock’s relative sales volumes are outperforming even Cardano and Litecoin thanks to its fresh listing on the popular CoinMarketCap website. Rollblock has now broken numerous crypto presale records as it races toward the $7 million market capitalization milestone. This top altcoin has already broken numerous presale records thanks to the enormous popularity of its crypto-gambling platform. Moreover, The vast potential of the $500 billion in revenue that is there for the taking in the gambling industry. This platform hosts more than 7,000 of the industry’s best provably fair casino games on the blockchain. It means fast, free and seamless access from anywhere in the world. Rollblock now offers the same blockchain excellence for sports betting after its recent expansion. Rollblock’s listing on the CoinMarketCap platform is expected to supercharge the rate of sales as even more investors learn about its excellent crypto gambling platform and its signature profit-sharing program. Rollblock’s program for profit sharing operates by employing up to 30% of weekly revenue to perform buybacks from the market. Instantly burning 60% of these buybacks maintains a constant upward pressure on the price, while handing out the other 40% as staking rewards creates an additional incentive for purchasing and holding RBLK. The increase in Rollblock’s sales volumes has already brought it to the brink of closing the eighth stage in its crypto presale, with hours left for its current price of $0.038. At this new rate of sales, RBLK is projected to soar over 100x out of its ICO, which is now forecasted for January 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

This historic price action has prompted analysts at the trading firm Bernstein to assert that Bitcoin is well-positioned to replace gold within the next decade. Bitcoin Poised To Outshine Gold Over Next Decade, Bernstein Says In a client note released earlier today, Bernstein analysts, led by Gautam Chhugani, expressed confidence that Bitcoin will eventually assume gold’s role as a reliable safe-haven asset. The note stated: We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing Gold over the next decade, and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin is up an impressive 141%. However, the lion’s share of these gains came following the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Historic $104,000: Key Factors Fueling The Surge The cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in optimism following Trump’s victory, as the president-elect is expected to create a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Since November 4, the total crypto market cap has climbed from $2.4 trillion to $3.9 trillion at the time of writing – a staggering 62.5% increase. In the note, Bernstein predicts that BTC may rise to $200,000 by late 2025. The trading firm’s forecast aligns with Charles Edwards’ – founder of Capriole Investments – prediction that BTC can potentially double in value within weeks, as its relatively smaller market cap enables more rapid price movements. BTC Adoption Major Driver Behind Its Success Bernstein’s bullish outlook was reinforced by Gil Luria, a D.A. Davidson analyst, who identified mainstream adoption as the key driver behind Bitcoin’s success. However, he cautioned that Bitcoin still has a “long path ahead” before it is widely accepted as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Luria added: Bitcoin’s main current application as a store of value — an appreciating, low-correlation asset that replaces gold as a hedge against a decline in economic stability. While Bitcoin is yet to achieve widespread use as a currency, it has gained significant traction as a reliable asset class for corporate balance sheets. Recently, Hut 8, a leading crypto-mining firm, announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic, tell their 63,200 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) metric is singling a weakening market. The BFI evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. When it declines, the risk of a market correction increases. “Not to rain on the parade, but Bitcoin has crossed $100,000, yet the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) is starting to weaken. Should we be concerned? This indicator often sends early warning signals, and once confirmed, they’re hard to ignore. Take the market peak in Q1 this year as an example: the BFI showed the exit point ahead of a significant correction. For now, we’ll keep monitoring, but the bull run still has fuel left.” Source: Negentropic/X Prior to Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 resistance level, the analysts said the net realized profit/loss metric, which tracks whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a loss or a profit, indicated holders were waiting for higher price targets before they’d likely start taking profits. “Bitcoin traders hold out for higher levels. Another sign of Bitcoin’s price consolidation is traders’ reluctance to take profits in this range. They’re aiming for higher levels, expecting gains once Bitcoin starts challenging key resistances. Once Bitcoin overcomes its resistance and establishes itself above $100,000, we’ll likely witness spikes to the upside on this chart, signaling trader confidence turning into action.” Source: Negentropic/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,579 at time of writing, down 6.8% from its new all-time high of $103,679.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has issued a warning for crypto ATM operators via a Dec. 6 statement , noting that non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws will result in enforcement actions and penalties. Coin ATM Radar data shows Australia as the third-largest hub for Bitcoin and crypto ATMs globally, with over 1,300 machines in operation. However, AUSTRAC, which put the number at around 1,200, claims only a small fraction of the country’s 400 registered digital currency exchanges operate these machines, making them a focal point for regulatory scrutiny. According to AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas, cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs have become “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate “near-instant and irreversible transfers.” You might also like: Australia’s AUSTRAC warns of crypto’s growing role in illicit activities As such, the agency will focus on eliminating non-compliant, high-risk operations throughout the next year to reduce the criminal misuse of cryptocurrency in Australia. “We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation, which is why this taskforce will work to eliminate non-compliant high-risk operations.” Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO Crypto ATM operators in Australia must adhere to anti-money laundering obligations, including registering with AUSTRAC, conducting Know Your Customer checks, monitoring transactions, and reporting suspicious activities, including large cash transactions involving amounts over 10,000 AUD (roughly $6,430). The task force will monitor the sector to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with these rules and minimize the risks the kiosks pose, such as facilitating money laundering, scams, and other illicit activities. The recent warning aligns with AUSTRAC’s stance that digital currencies and exchanges pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks. In its 2024 National Risk Assessment Report , the agency identified cryptocurrencies as a “high” risk channel to enable illicit activities. It warned that these risks are expected to increase over the next three years. Beyond Australia, some other jurisdictions have also turned their focus to regulating crypto ATMs to curb illicit activities. In late August, German regulators confiscated 13 crypto ATMs in a sting operation and warned that unlicensed operators would face severe penalties, including jail time of up to 5 years. Similarly, in the UK, during a money laundering case against an illegal operator, the Financial Conduct Authority declared that no crypto ATMs are legally operating in the country.

Howells accidentally discarded the hard drive during an office cleanup in 2013, and since then, his requests to search the landfill have been consistently rejected by Newport City Council. The council argues that discarded items in the landfill become their property and cannot be sold or retrieved. Howells has offered the council 25% of the recovered funds to gain permission for the search , but the council remains firm, citing legal and logistical challenges. Howells has assembled a team of data recovery and excavation experts who have pinpointed the likely location of the hard drive. Their plan involves a targeted excavation designed to minimize environmental impact. During a hearing at a Welsh court on December 2, his legal team argued that the project is being managed on a contingency basis, with the experts only receiving payment if the Bitcoin is recovered. The council's legal team dismissed the proposal, calling it an attempt to purchase something they claim cannot legally be sold. The hard drive, buried in the landfill for over a decade, represents one of the biggest losses in Bitcoin history. Social media users have compared Howells' misfortune to other famous cryptocurrency mishaps, such as the man who spent 10,000 Bitcoin on two pizzas in 2010, which would be worth billions today. Despite the obstacles, Howells continues to fight for permission to search the landfill. If his plans are approved, the recovery process would still be extremely challenging, likened to searching for a needle in a haystack. If denied, Howells’ story will remain a cautionary tale about the risks of handling digital assets.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-06 09:01:00

Gray Swan Events to Prepare For,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-2025-gray-swan-events-could-shape-crypto-markets/,"The post Crypto Market Turmoil in 2025? Gray Swan Events to Prepare For appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you are into crypto, you would be well experienced with its unpredictability. It is full of surprises. One day, prices soar and the next they might fall. According to Gareth Nicholson , Chief Investment Officer at Nomura, 2025 might bring some huge turmoil events to the global financial markets. He had made a 100 pages report for the next year that also contains some “Gray Swan Events”. Let’s understand what these events are and how they can affect the crypto market in the upcoming year. Nomura's list of 6 potential gray swan events is pretty sobering tbh: 1. Nvidia crash 2. Carry implosion 3. US 10YY > 6% 4. US growth shock 5. Geopolitics gets out of hand 6. China stimulus falls short pic.twitter.com/YmNcht8c3p — David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) December 6, 2024 What These Gray Swans Mean for Crypto Gray Swan Events are such events which have very low or almost no chance of happening but if they happen, leaves huge impacts. Nicholas has mentioned the below mentioned events in his report in Nomura’s 2025 Outlook. 1. NVIDIA Crash: Trouble for Crypto Mining NVIDIA is more than just a tech giant—it’s at the core of crypto mining. If its value drops sharply, miners might struggle to get the hardware they need. This could slow down blockchain networks and leave smaller cryptocurrencies exposed to attacks. If miners can’t access affordable tech, it could also lower confidence in the entire crypto ecosystem. A crash like this could lead to panic selling, and as a result, Bitcoin and altcoins may tumble. 2. Carry Trade Unwind: Liquidity Fades If this happens people will not have funds to invest more in crypto and they can even withdraw their crypto portfolios. Even big investors, in order to secure their money, might pull out their funds from the crypto market, triggering panic sales and plummeting. Still, some investors may see Bitcoin as a safer bet during tough times, viewing it as a hedge against traditional markets. But it’s a gamble either way. 3. Rising Treasury Yields: Pressure on Bitcoin If US Treasury yields go above 6%, it might make more sense for investors to park their money in safer, steady options. For crypto, this could reduce its appeal. People might move away from high-risk assets like Bitcoin and opt for more stable returns. However, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation could grow in this scenario. Higher Treasury yields might weaken the dollar, and Bitcoin could be seen as a better alternative. In the end, how people view Bitcoin—either as “digital gold” or just a speculative investment—will determine its fate. 4. US Growth Shock: What Happens If the Economy Slows Down? If the US economy unexpectedly slows down in 2025, it could cause big problems for markets worldwide. A shock like this would reduce the amount of money available for investment, making it harder for people to access funds and causing markets to drop. The crypto market, already seen as high-risk, might take an even bigger hit as investors pull back from risky assets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could see their prices fall as the global financial environment tightens. 5. Geopolitical Tensions: Can Bitcoin Handle It? When political conflicts happen, markets usually take a hit. Investors often turn to safer assets like gold, which can cause crypto to struggle. The world has witnessed this multiple times like during the conflicts in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin might stand out in these tough times. Since it’s decentralized, people in areas with financial restrictions could see it as a way to keep their money safe. While political tensions may cause short-term drops in the crypto market, Bitcoin could gain more support in the long run as people look for alternatives to traditional finance. 6. China stimulus falls short If China’s economic stimulus plan doesn’t live up to expectations, it could cause a slowdown in demand for Bitcoin. Investors might lose confidence in China’s ability to boost its economy, which could spill over into global markets, including crypto. Instead of pushing Bitcoin’s price higher, this scenario could result in lower investor sentiment and increased volatility, as markets react to the disappointment. Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now part of the larger financial ecosystem. Events like an NVIDIA crash or rising Treasury yields could bring both challenges and new opportunities. The key to navigating 2025 will be staying informed, flexible, and prepared for the unexpected Gray Swan Events. Crypto’s future will depend on how well it adapts to these changes. By preparing yourself, you can make the most of whatever happens in the coming year.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:01:34

With its focus on capital-efficient innovation, community-driven participation, and 100% revenue sharing among token holders, Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation, a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara, two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate. The Upcoming Public Sale The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format. The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06. Key Sale Details: Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply). Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30. Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients. For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M, Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M. The Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem. About Ocelex Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer 2.

The altcoin surged 35% over the past day, hitting a seven-month high of $2.45 on Nov. 6, bringing its market cap to over $1.67 billion. The recent rally positioned DYDX as the leading gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, ranking 94th according to data from CoinGecko at press time. dydx ( DYDX ) ‘s price surge also extended its fortnightly gains to over 83% while boosting its monthly gains to more than 125%. Daily trading volume for the token jumped 113.9% over the previous day to over $369 million. Why did DYDX price soar today? DYDX’s recent rally was primarily driven by reports that President-elect Donald Trump appointed David O. Sacks as the White House Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency. The news gained traction as Sacks’ venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, has made a significant investment in DYDX. This connection between the newly appointed crypto czar and the token fueled strong bullish sentiment among its investors, propelling DYDX to recent gains.

37282630,182054,1733475900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/37282630.jpeg,Zircuit Welcomes Ocelex: The Newest MetaDEX Driving DeFi Growth on Zircuit,https://chainwire.org/2024/12/06/zircuit-welcomes-ocelex-the-newest-metadex-driving-defi-growth-on-zircuit/,"Zurich, Switzerland, December 6th, 2024, Chainwire Ocelex is positioned to launch as a MetaDEX and liquidity layer on Zircuit , a zkEVM-based Layer 2 ecosystem designed for scalability and security. With its focus on capital-efficient innovation , community-driven participation , and 100% revenue sharing among token holders , Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation , a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara , two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate. The Upcoming Public Sale The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format . The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06. Key Sale Details: Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply). Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30. Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients. For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M , Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M. The Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem. About Ocelex Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer 2. Ocelex democratizes sophisticated liquidity strategies, seamlessly connecting everyday traders with expert-level capabilities. It features a competitive ecosystem of Automated Liquidity Managers (ALMs) and strategists, all striving to optimize returns, minimize risks like impermanent loss, and boost overall efficiency for every user.

These documents , which reveal important details about U.S. military actions, civilian deaths, and interrogation techniques, will be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, making them impossible to erase or hide. Why It Matters The Afghan War Logs were a huge deal when they were released in 2010. They showed the truth about the war in Afghanistan, including things the public didn’t know. To make sure this information can never be lost or hidden, Assange’s team is putting them on Bitcoin’s blockchain, where they’ll stay forever. Even if WikiLeaks’ website gets shut down, these documents will always be available. How It Works Project Spartacus will use Bitcoin’s blockchain to store these 76,911 files. They’ll be turned into small pieces of Bitcoin called satoshis, using a tool called Ordinals. This process will start on December 12, 2024, and will take some time because there are so many documents. Once they’re on the blockchain, they can’t be changed or erased. Interestingly, this project is more than just storing documents—it’s also about remembering Julian Assange’s role in the fight for free speech. Assange’s team isn’t trying to raise money from this project; instead, they want to honor his legacy by putting these important files on Bitcoin, a decentralized system that can’t be controlled or stopped by any government. Bitcoin’s Power to Protect Information What makes this project so special is Bitcoin’s ability to protect information from censorship. Julian Assange’s story is tightly connected to Bitcoin’s early days and its mission of resisting censorship. When traditional banks blocked WikiLeaks from receiving funds, Bitcoin became a lifeline, raising over $30 million to help with Assange’s legal battles. This showed the world how Bitcoin could stand strong where traditional systems failed. Even Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, noticed this and worried about the sudden spotlight on the new currency back in 2010. Assange proved how Bitcoin could support free speech by keeping WikiLeaks running despite global financial roadblocks, making it a real-world example of Bitcoin’s power to fight censorship. With Project Spartacus, WikiLeaks is not just preserving history—it’s making sure it’s never erased.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:06:49

At one point, it even managed to outpace USDT and claim the third spot. It’s up by more than 45% in the past seven days, clearly being the best-performing altcoin from the top 10. However, over the past few days, things have changed a bit, and XRP is now in a state of correction, down 5.3% in the past day alone. Source: TradingView As you can see in the chart above, XRP topped at around $2.9 the other day, and it has been declining since then, losing about 20% in the process. Interestingly enough, this happened when Donald Trump selected Paul Atkins as the new chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In Trump’s own words: “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” So, if the next SEC Chair is relatively pro-crypto, why is the XRP price going down ? Well, it’s important to look at things from perspective and understand that the cryptocurrency increased by almost 400% in less than 30 days at one point (before the recent correction). Nothing ever goes up in a straight line, and corrections are due. Another reason besides the market getting overheated could be the precise fact that Trump announced his candidate for the SEC Chairman. Many traders may have bought up the cryptocurrency in anticipation of his choice, essentially turning the event into a “sell-the-news.” On top of everything else, there’s also the fact that the entire market is seemingly going through a correction over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, for once, dropped to as low as $92,000 in a flash crash before recovering to where it’s currently trading.

Here’s What Experts Are Saying,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-is-rlusd-a-threat-to-xrp-heres-what-experts-are-saying/,"The post XRP News : Is RLUSD a Threat to XRP? Here’s What Experts Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price dropped sharply from $2.59 to $2.31 within 24 hours, bringing its market cap down by 12% to $131.42 billion. This decline pushed XRP out of its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency, falling behind Tether (USDT). Futures trading volume also plummeted from $32 billion to $16 billion, signaling reduced market activity. The decline is largely tied to increased selling pressure and market speculation, potentially influenced by the delay in Ripple’s RLUSD token launch. With this fluctuation, the community is in doubt that RLUSD may impact XRP which is initially planned to operate on Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). But analysts refuse such claims here’s what it means for you! RLUSD and XRP: A Partnership, Not a Rivalry Vincent Van Code, a key community voice, cleared up confusion about Ripple’s RLUSD token, emphasizing it won’t replace XRP but instead enhances the XRP Ledger (XRPL). XRP remains at the core of XRPL, streamlining cross-border transactions and solving inefficiencies in traditional forex systems by directly pairing various currencies with XRP like AUD/XRP or USD/XRP, saving costs and improving efficiency. A standout feature of XRPL is its auto-bridging capability, which simplifies currency conversions. For instance, sending RLUSD to someone in RLYEN is seamless, thanks to XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) pools. These pools stabilize prices and ensure smooth operations, even during market volatility. XRP continues to power the system as its indispensable backbone. Ripple’s Strategy Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, highlights that XRP is vital to the XRPL because it is decentralized and doesn’t rely on a middleman. While RLUSD adds new features to the system, it works alongside XRP rather than replacing it. Experts believe RLUSD’s launch might help increase XRP’s value over time, with predictions ranging from small gains to a potential high of $10 in a year. According to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse RLUSD will largely target the big institutional players. He even added that, once RLUSD is available, it will use both RLUSD and XRP in its cross-border payments solution making the experience more enhanced for the users. Though it is still not clear if RLUSD is a threat to XRP or not, XRP’s sudden rise towards the end of the year made it clear that XRP has all the possibility to rise, and RLUSD launch can only be a bonus to this bullish momentum.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|MINING|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:12:04

Speaking to Bloomberg TV on December 6, Summers argued the idea served more to please campaign donors than to benefit the nation. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary likened the proposal to historical strategies like accumulating gold reserves at Fort Knox or maintaining a national oil reserve but argued Bitcoin lacks the same strategic purpose. “Why would the government support a sterile inventory of Bitcoin? It’s purely about pandering to special interests,” Summers added. A Divided Debate on Bitcoin’s Role in Debt Management The remarks follow Trump’s campaign suggestion to retain the 198,000 BTC seized by the U.S. government—an amount valued at over $19 billion. Trump-aligned lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, have even proposed legislation to have the U.S. acquire 1 million BTC, representing approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply, as a long-term asset. Lummis’ push for a Bitcoin reserve is rooted in the idea of leveraging it to reduce the nation’s $36 trillion debt . However, critics argue that this approach is overly optimistic. Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, recently noted during a crypto summit that while a Bitcoin reserve might be beneficial, it is no substitute for structural fiscal reforms. “You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits,” Roy said. Balancing Innovation and Practicality While Summers dismissed the Bitcoin reserve idea, he acknowledged that not all of Trump’s crypto rhetoric is without merit. “I think we need to support financial innovation wherever it may go,” he remarked, suggesting that overzealous regulatory measures could be hindering the crypto industry’s growth. Summers’ stance reflects a broader skepticism within traditional finance circles about Bitcoin’s utility as a reserve asset . Despite his criticism, Summers, who once advised crypto giant Digital Currency Group, emphasized the importance of fostering innovation in financial technology.

The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection broke out, reaching a new floor price record. Pudgy Penguins set the stage for a renewed NFT season. The collection reached a new all-time high for its floor price, surpassing even the peak NFT season in 2021. Other collections appreciated as well, with CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club rising to a six-month high. For the top three collections, the price rally followed a handful of high-value deals, where just under 50 top NFT sales were enough to stir up the market. In the case of Pudgy Penguins, the floor price rose after only five valuable Penguins changed hands in the past day. Pudgy Penguins floor price rallied vertically to a new all-time high. | Source: NFT Price Floor NFTs have been trying to regain traction in late 2024, aiming to recapture the hype from the meme token market. The NFTs space is waiting for the relaunch of a new OpenSea version, while MagicEden is preparing for its ME token airdrop. Other top collections also rallied to an all-time high, including the Miladies. This collection’s community has remained active in the crypto space, quickly adopting any and all new trends and spilling over into meme tokens. Pudgy Penguins prepares for token launch in December For years, Pudgy Penguins was mostly known for its original collection of 8,888 NFTs. The project also launched side collections and real-world items with on-chain certification. The recent price rally preceded the announcement of a Pudgy Penguins token, expected to arrive by the end of the year. The token will trade under the ticker $PENGU, arriving after three years of adoption for the Penguins collection. Introducing $PENGU , the official coin of Pudgy Penguins. Launching in 2024. Learn more below. pic.twitter.com/J715bODcM6 — Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) December 6, 2024 Luca Netz , the CEO of Pudgy Penguins, announced a virtual meeting on December 7, with more potential information for the token launch. The token will try to reach multiple communities, in addition to current users. Pudgy Penguins is still connecting real-world shopping behaviors with crypto culture, and PENGU will also be used to that end. The token launch arrives shortly after Pudgy Penguins received a funding round from Animoca Brands . The PENGU token will launch on Solana, gaining access to some of the most active meme communities and wallet users. The token will run with a total supply of 88,888,888,888. The team will receive 17.8% of that supply, with a one-year cliff unlock and three years of vesting. More than 25% will be reserved for the community, with 24% reserved for other communities and incentives. The remaining PENGU will go toward the company reserves and for liquidity purposes. A small allocation will go to any remaining FTT token holders. Alameda Research and the FTX market operators were among Pudgy Penguin holders, though they have since moved on, leaving the project to the community. The token announcement has activated scam attempts around the token allocation. For now, there has been no token generation event (TGE), and the official Pudgy Penguins is yet to announce the mechanism of airdropping the tokens. The token launch is inviting scammers with fake links and Telegram bots, which may lead to NFT or asset losses. Can NFT make a comeback? Top collections retain high floor prices, but the mass rush to NFT is not there yet. The two events that may revive the sector are the MagicEden airdrop and the relaunch of OpenSea . MagicEden ME airdrops are often touted as having a value of a few hundred dollars. However, some users are reporting zero allocation, despite holding valuable NFTs and having a trading history. OpenSea announced it expects a relaunch in December, while also sparking expectations for an airdrop. Recently, the market operator sent out a message to its community, asking how long users relied on its platform for NFT swaps. It may be precisely the airdrop hopes that are boosting some collection holders. A retroactive snapshot from 2021 or 2022 activity levels would make many early NFT adopters return to the market. NFT-based tokens may become a new asset class, though arriving rather late in the game, as most altcoins already had their strongest rallies for the year.

These expirations often spark sudden price swings, and the tension is already building. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 5% in a single day, falling from its all-time high to $98K, while Ethereum has slipped to $3,890. Bitcoin: $2.29 Billion Options Set to Expire Data from Deribit shows that 23,481 Bitcoin contracts, valued at approximately $2.29 billion, are expiring today. The put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin stands at 1.11, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The maximum pain point, the level at which most options expire worthless, is at $97,000. Bitcoin has already seen a sharp drop, falling nearly 5% to $98,000, down from its recent all-time high of $100,000. Analysts from Greeks.live commented on this volatility, highlighting the resilience of the crypto market. 6 Dec Options Delivery Data 23,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.11, a maxpain point of $97,000 and a notional value of $2.3 billion. 147,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.62, a maxpain of $3,500 and a notional value of $570 million. Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/APzvJ1ohe3 — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 6, 2024 However, Bitcoin’s rise to $103,000 is incredible, but the recent sharp drop cleared out many leveraged positions. Still, the overall market is strong, and sentiment remains positive with solid buying in the spot market. Despite this optimism, high funding rates for leveraged contracts show that traders may have overextended their bullish bets. This raises concerns about more possible pullbacks. Ethereum: $585 Million in Contracts Expiring Ethereum is also facing significant expirations, with 148,733 contracts worth around $585 million set to expire . Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s put-to-call ratio is 0.55, indicating a more bullish sentiment. The maximum pain point for Ethereum stands at $3,500, slightly below its current price of $3,890. Ethereum’s lower put-to-call ratio suggests that traders are more optimistic about its price recovery compared to Bitcoin. However, the impact of these expirations on both assets is expected to be short-term. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Ethereum? As these massive options contracts expire, prices may move toward their maximum pain levels, causing temporary volatility. However, traders should note that the influence of these expirations is often brief, and broader market trends will likely dominate in the coming days.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:22:00

Among those contenders is Lunex Network , a new project attracting attention with its multichain interoperability and DeFi solutions. With over $4.4 million raised in its presale so far and a unique revenue-sharing model, Lunex Network is appealing to Fetch.ai and Arbitrum investors seeking high-growth potential assets. Arbitrum One Hits $20 Billion TVL Milestone Arbitrum One has hit $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) and is now a top Layer-2 blockchain. This milestone demonstrates the solid foundation of Arbitrum and the growing faith of investors in Layer-2 solutions. The Arbitrum Foundation is continually developing its ecosystem towards AI and tech advancements. Such growths reflect Arbitrum’s intent to remain at the forefront of blockchain advancements. As of December 5, Arbitrum’s ARB gained 17.46% to $1.18 and its market cap hit $4.84 billion. However, despite the rise, Arbitrum’s trading volume decreased by 3.01% to $1.38 billion. Nevertheless, the TVL growth shows Arbitrum One’s expanding presence in the blockchain space and its potential to rewrite decentralized finance down the road. Fetch.ai (FET) Breaks Out with 12% Surge, Eyes $2.70 Following Earn-and-Burn Announcement Fetch.ai (FET) has made waves following the launch of its “Earn-and-Burn” mechanism, which aims to reduce token supply by burning up to 100 million tokens in December. This move has sparked bullish momentum, pushing Fetch.ai out of weeks-long consolidation in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Breaking above $1.68, Fetch.ai surged to $1.94 within 24 hours, marking a solid 12% gain. The next major resistance levels lie at $2 and $2.15, with a successful break potentially paving the way to $2.70 for Fetch.ai—an impressive 71% upside. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 65, indicating upward potential without being overbought. If Fetch.ai holds above its breakout zone, the rally is likely to continue. Lunex Network: Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with Seamless Interoperability and Lucrative Staking Rewards Lunex network promises explosive growth due to its unique ability to join isolated blockchains together as a Network. This allows traders to swap over 50,000 crypto pairs at the best rates. Rather than utilizing outdated security protocols, Lunex Network (LNEX) leverages the latest smart contracts technology to facilitate crypto transactions. The platform includes an advanced, user-friendly, and efficient interface for trading, staking, and liquidity all without the KYC verification procedure. Users keep complete control over their assets and all trades are conducted over the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, Lunex Network does away with third-party wallets, giving security-conscious traders a break. Lunex Network also boasts a lucrative revenue-sharing system, with staking rewards offering up to 18% APY in as little as 30 days. Traders can increase their passive income by adding more Lunex Network tokens to their staking pool without losing their existing APY. The deflationary nature of the $LNEX token, supported by Lunex Network’s open-market buyback mechanism, further drives its value. Priced at just $0.0038 per token, Lunex Network is attracting both retail and institutional investors who have poured over $4.4M into the project so far. Analysts project a 2000% surge by the end of its presale, with potential for an additional 1,000% rally in 2025.

Based on these trends, IntoTheBlock expect a more conservative growth range of 100%-200% from the halving price, suggesting a peak between $130,000 and $190,000. IntoTheBlock analysts particularly wrote: So while some are calling for a million dollars per Bitcoin, a more reasonable expectation would be a 100%-200% return from the halving price, placing the top between 130k and 190k. However the analysts also pointed out: “That is, unless Bitcoin becomes a global reserve asset of course.” Analyzing Market Trends and Investor Behaviour Meanwhile, a CryptoQuant analyst has provided additional insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance and market behaviour. According to the analyst, Bitcoin purchases continue to rise, with the Coinbase Premium Index reflecting strong buying activity in the United States. The index, which tracks the difference in price between Coinbase Pro and Binance, shows sustained positive data, indicating active participation by US investors. The analyst emphasized the importance of monitoring this index alongside broader trend analysis. For example, during periods classified as “fear phases,” where buyers retreat and bearish momentum fails to materialize, the market often creates opportunities for strategic entry points.

Recent developments, however, are addressing these barriers. Solana, known for its speed and scalability, and innovative solutions like the Plena super app are making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible than ever. By focusing on simplifying user experiences—whether through gasless transactions or robust network performance—these initiatives are transforming blockchain from a niche technology into a practical tool for everyday users. Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko Lauds Meme Coins for Driving Network Resilience Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently credited the rise of meme coins with stress-testing the blockchain into becoming more resilient, transforming its past outages into opportunities for engineering innovation. Speaking at the Emergence conference in Prague, Yakovenko offered insights into how the network has evolved and thrived under pressure. ”Blessed are the meme coin traders, for those who can overcome their spam will inherit the metaverse,” Yakovenko quipped during the discussion. He likened the impact of meme coins to that of NFTs, saying, ”As with NFTs...we're blessed to solve a whole bunch of engineering problems with meme coins. It just makes the network and all the systems more robust.” Yakovenko highlighted that Solana’s developers have built a reputation for tackling extraordinarily difficult challenges. This ethos, which he referred to as “chewing glass,” has been instrumental in creating a high-performance blockchain capable of withstanding the rigors of unpredictable usage. The Solana network, which suffered a series of well-publicized outages in 2022, has significantly improved its reliability. In 2023, it experienced just one outage, occurring in February, shortly after the January launch of Pump.fun, a meme coin-driven platform. The reduction in downtime marks a dramatic improvement over the network’s earlier performance, signaling that the team’s iterative approach is paying off. ”We were just lucky enough to ship fast enough to have those bugs behind us,” Yakovenko said, explaining the changes to Solana’s development strategy. The network’s evolution required addressing intricate technical challenges associated with multi-core systems. These systems, Yakovenko noted, can experience cascading issues — from memory bandwidth bottlenecks to transaction throughput delays — that compound and disrupt performance. ”These problems...I have never seen anyone predict them in research, let alone have solutions for them,” Yakovenko added. The Solana team’s ability to iterate quickly in response to real-world usage, often spurred by the chaos brought by meme coin activity, has been key to overcoming these challenges. A Single State Advantage Yakovenko argued that Solana’s architectural design—its single state execution environment—plays a critical role in its scalability and usability. Unlike layer 2 solutions, which often require additional bridges and infrastructure, Solana’s unified state allows for faster, simpler, and cheaper transactions. “Raydium did not expect that every meme coin is going to use their pools for launches,” Yakovenko said, referring to the popular decentralized exchange on Solana. “But nobody had to ask Raydium, ‘Hey, can we do this?’ [and] nobody had to go and create additional bridges. It just became easy, and that ease of use and lack of fees and friction creates a thriving ecosystem.” Yakovenko pointed out that while other blockchain networks could theoretically replicate this functionality using layer 2 solutions, the inherent complexity and developer inertia often favor Solana’s streamlined approach. “In theory, it’s possible,” Yakovenko mused. “But developers are lazy and will take the path of least resistance.” The rise of meme coins on Solana has come as both a surprise and a natural progression in hindsight. Yakovenko shared his initial reaction to the phenomenon, admitting that he hadn’t anticipated the level of popularity these tokens would achieve on the network. However, upon reflection, the trend aligns with broader patterns in digital economies. “In almost all digital economies, entertainment is the biggest place where money is made,” Yakovenko noted. “When I start to think of it backwards, it’s almost obvious in retrospect.” The Solana network’s ability to turn challenges into strengths has positioned it as a robust blockchain ecosystem. From outages to innovations, the journey has been marked by adaptability and resilience. As Solana continues to grow, its commitment to performance, ease of use, and cost-efficiency ensures it remains a major player in the blockchain space, prepared to face the next wave of challenges—and opportunities—that come its way. Plena and Solana Partner to Revolutionize DeFi Accessibility with Gasless Transactions Blockchain technology has long been touted as a tool for breaking free from centralization, but its complex user experience has kept many from fully engaging with its benefits. Complicated onboarding processes, gas fee management, fragmented ecosystems, and a lack of intuitive wallet recovery options have created significant barriers to adoption. Now, a partnership between Plena, a crypto super app, and Solana, one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks, promises to simplify these challenges and usher in a new era of user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi). While blockchain’s potential to disrupt centralized systems is well-documented, the infrastructure has been notoriously difficult for newcomers to navigate. Managing volatile native tokens for gas fees, understanding complex wallet mechanics, and interacting with fragmented DApps have created a steep learning curve. These barriers have kept DeFi out of reach for many, despite its transformative potential. Simplifying the user experience is essential for bringing blockchain to mainstream audiences. The Plena-Solana partnership represents a critical step toward making DeFi intuitive, accessible, and widely adopted. Plena, a crypto super app with built-in account abstraction, has announced its integration with Solana. Account abstraction allows users to engage with blockchain services seamlessly by abstracting away technical complexities. This enables single-click swaps and trades, gasless transactions, and access to decentralized applications (DApps) like Jupiter — all within Plena’s unified interface. Through this partnership, Plena aims to make DeFi as effortless as using a traditional financial app. By integrating with Solana, a blockchain renowned for its speed, scalability, and affordability, the collaboration promises to eliminate common entry barriers and expand DeFi’s reach. Solana has emerged as a leading “consumer blockchain,” capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with near-zero fees. This speed and scalability have made it the go-to network for developers creating consumer-focused applications. Its vibrant ecosystem, bolstered by the meme coin craze, has driven confidence among users and developers alike. Recently, Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes hit all-time highs, even surpassing Ethereum and layer 2 solutions. This momentum solidifies Solana’s position as a decentralized trading powerhouse, perfectly suited for partnerships like the one with Plena. One of the most groundbreaking aspects of the Plena-Solana integration is the introduction of gasless transactions. Traditionally, users need native tokens like SOL or ETH to pay for gas fees when interacting with DApps or executing trades. This requirement often confuses newcomers and deters adoption. Plena eliminates this hurdle by enabling users to perform swaps, send tokens, and trade meme coins without holding SOL for gas fees. By abstracting this layer of complexity, Plena makes DeFi more accessible, allowing users to engage without needing to juggle multiple wallets or depend on centralized exchanges. This approach not only reduces friction but also enhances privacy and user control. Solana’s liquidity is another major advantage for decentralized trading. With billions of dollars in weekly trading volume, it has become a central hub for DeFi activities. Plena aims to make this liquidity more accessible by pairing Solana’s scalable network with a user-friendly interface. Plena’s super app, already boasting over 1.3 million active users, will introduce this audience to Solana’s ecosystem, unlocking extensive DEX volumes without the technical challenges that have traditionally plagued DeFi platforms. Available on the App Store, Google Play, and Telegram, the app bridges the gap between sophisticated blockchain technology and everyday users. The Future of DeFi: Intuitive and Inclusive The integration of Plena with Solana represents a pivotal moment in blockchain’s evolution. By focusing on gasless transactions, seamless asset bridging, and a simplified user experience, the partnership sets a new standard for consumer blockchain applications. Users can now tap into Solana’s liquidity with minimal friction, making DeFi as accessible as traditional financial services. This collaboration also shows the broader trend of improving blockchain usability. By removing barriers and making DeFi intuitive, projects like Plena are paving the way for mass adoption. With Solana’s unmatched speed and scalability powering this transformation, the DeFi landscape is poised for significant growth. The partnership between Plena and Solana demonstrates how blockchain technology is evolving to meet the demands of a broader audience. By simplifying complex processes, eliminating gas fees, and leveraging Solana’s high-performance infrastructure, Plena is setting a benchmark for user-friendly DeFi solutions. As blockchain continues to mature, integrations like this signal a future where decentralized finance is not just a tool for early adopters but a cornerstone of mainstream financial systems. With over a million users already on board, Plena’s expansion into the Solana ecosystem marks a significant step toward making DeFi accessible to everyone.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 09:35:40

However, crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of a change when SEC chairman Gary Gensler leaves office in January 2025. As reported by Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett, the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will be rejecting at least two of the five Solana (SOL) spot ETFs 19b-4 filings. Terrett shared the news on her X account, adding that the financial watchdog’s general consensus is that ETFs will no longer be approved under the outgoing administration. In a response to their post, a user asked if there’s a likelihood of one Solana ETF being approved, to which the journalist replied, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” Source: X _Many investors worry about what will become of Solana as other crypto coins get their ETFs approved. Is Solana missing out? Or the coin and it’s blockchain are okay as they are? Investors still hopeful of a future Solana ETF approval Across several social media platforms, the crypto community showered blame on the regulatory views of Joe Biden’s administration and SEC chair Gary Gensler. Crypto supporters believe the current regime used too much bureaucracy in the regulatory landscape of digital currencies. Nate Geraci, president and co-founder of The ETF Institute, believes the approval of new crypto spot ETFs was highly unlikely after Donald Trump’s presidential elections victory. “No surprise, but won’t be any movement on spot crypto ETF filings until new leadership is in place.” Geraci remarked. Several pro-crypto advocates on X are hopeful spot crypto ETF applications will be approved when Donald Trump enters office in January next year. Moreover, they expect the stringent regulatory landscape will loosen up when incoming US SEC chair Paul Atkins takes charge. One user expressed their belief that everything the SEC opposes will be authorized after Trump’s inauguration. They went on to say there’s no sense of delaying it for a couple months other than toying with the crypto community’s emotions. Source: X The current battle for SOL and XRP ETFs is what was in the days of BTC and ETH ETFs. Many are taunting that under Trump, many more altcoin ETFs will take market root because of the promise he made once he took office as POTUS. Bitcoin, and Ether ETFs performances show Solana investors missing out on profits The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed remarkable inflows and growth milestones, collectively attracting over $17 billion in net inflows within nine months. Over the last couple of months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has led the Bitcoin ETF inflows charge, currently boasting over $50 billion in assets under management, per CoinGlass data . Recent updates from CoinGlass also reveal a significant surge in inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. On December 3 alone, these funds recorded $675.97 million in inflows, a 90% increase from the $353.67 million seen the previous day. This marked the fourth consecutive day of net inflows, totaling over $1.45 billion during this period. BlackRock’s IBIT witnessed $693.25 million in single-day inflows, bringing its holdings to over 500,000 BTC. The fund now accounts for approximately 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply and has nearly $50 billion in assets under management, solidifying its position among the top ETF launches of 2024. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $52.17 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB secured $16.21 million and $7.8 million, respectively. In the Ether space, spot ETFs have seen net inflows reach $1.3 billion since their launch in July 2024. That said, Ethereum spot ETFs have faced several challenges in FY 2024, including restrictions on staking and options trading and limited distribution through major brokerages. Source: X Without ETF approval, Solana investors continue missing out on the substantial inflows and institutional attention enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a Solana ETF is not approved soon, this could hinder SOL’s acceptance in traditional investment portfolios, potentially negatively impacting growth and price trends. At the time of writing, Solana’s price is hovering around the $237-$240 region, up 2% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko updates . Analysts believe the price could gain ground to $290 if the coin breaks past its consolidation phase, but there’s growing skepticism that it could reach $300 following the news of Solana spot ETF application rejections.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

Ripple is finalizing the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, pending NYDFS approval. Meanwhile, Singapore-based Dtcpay is transitioning to a stablecoin-only model by 2025, focusing on USDC, USDt, FDUSD, and WUSD to improve payment reliability and scalability. Chainalysis, under its new CEO Jonathan Levin, also expects some stablecoin regulatory clarity by 2025. USDC Becomes First to Meet Canada’s New Listing Rules Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced that its United States dollar-pegged token achieved compliance with Canada's forthcoming listing requirements set by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This milestone positions USDC as the first stablecoin to meet the criteria under the CSA’s Value-Referenced Crypto Asset (VCRA) framework, which allows it to remain listed on licensed Canadian crypto trading platforms beyond the Dec. 31, 2024 compliance deadline. The VCRA classification applies to crypto assets that are designed to maintain a stable value by referencing fiat currencies, other values, or a combination thereof. Circle’s compliance was also solidified through its alignment with the Ontario Securities Commission's regulations. The company is led by Jeremy Allaire, and he believes in the potential for USDC to better cross-border payments and improve Canada’s retail and institutional settlement systems by offering lower transaction costs, increased consumer protections, reduced settlement risks, and heightened competition in payments. This latest development is part of Circle’s broader global expansion, which includes its French subsidiary achieving compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. This allows it to issue both USDC and the euro-backed stablecoin, Euro Coin (EURC), across the EU. In Asia, Circle’s Singaporean subsidiary received a payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in June of 2023. Currently, USDC holds a market cap of more than $40.3 billion, trailing only Tether (USDT) in the $201.2 billion stablecoin market . Top stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, also recently revealed plans for the city to start adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet as part of a strategy to diversify investments. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a combination of assets. These coins achieve stability through mechanisms like full backing by reserves or algorithmic adjustments to their supply. Stablecoins are often used in digital transactions, and they offer a more reliable and less volatile alternative for payments, savings, and trading in the crypto ecosystem. New Chainalysis CEO Expects Stablecoin Regulation Clarity in 2025 Chainalysis recently appointed Jonathan Levin, its chief strategy officer and co-founder, as its new CEO after the departure of Michael Gronager in October. Levin assumed the role on Dec. 3, which was announced in a Dec. 5 statement. The company also welcomed Paul Auvil, former chief financial officer at Proofpoint, as an independent director on its board. Under Levin’s leadership, Chainalysis plans to expand its international presence, and to enhance protections for cryptocurrency users globally as well as develop private-sector solutions for digital asset custody. Levin shared that while policymakers are unlikely to change their approach to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and national security concerns, he hopes to see more clarity on stablecoin regulations, particularly concerning their issuance, redemption, and regulatory oversight. In October, Chainalysis reported a surge in Bitcoin transactions in the United States after the approval of more spot crypto exchange-traded funds. On the other hand, it also noted a decline in stablecoin activity compared to other countries. The share of stablecoin transactions on U.S.-regulated exchanges dropped from about 50% in 2023 to under 40% in 2024. However, Levin expects some major regulatory developments in the United States, including the potential repeal of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which mandates financial institutions to account for customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Although lawmakers voted to overturn the rule, it was vetoed by President Joe Biden in May. Levin also expects more detailed guidance and no-action letters addressing new crypto applications and tokens. RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval Ripple has been at the forefront of stablecoin news lately, and the company finally addressed the speculation surrounding the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple clarified that the token did not launch on Dec. 4 as rumored. In a statement on X, Ripple confirmed that RLUSD’s release is still pending final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The company plans to work very closely with the regulator to meet the highest standards before proceeding with the launch. RLUSD is a 1:1 U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and will be fully backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasury securities, and cash equivalents. Since August, the stablecoin has undergone beta testing on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet. Ripple has plans to expand RLUSD’s reach to additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and the stablecoin is designed to complement and enhance XRP within Ripple’s ecosystem. Ripple shared that it will provide updates as they become available. The crypto community is very eagerly awaiting the launch but has been warned to remain vigilant against potential scams. Ripple itself also warned people about an increase in fraudulent activity, and reminded users that it will never request XRP or solicit funds from them. Dtcpay Shifts to Stablecoin-Only Transactions Dtcpay, a Singapore-licensed crypto payment platform, announced plans to phase out support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) in favor of a stablecoin-only model. The transition is set to be completed by January of 2025, and will focus on supporting stablecoins like Tether’s USDt, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). The move aligns with Dtcpay’s mission to provide a more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience, as stablecoins already account for a large chunk of its transaction volume. Dtcpay was launched in 2019 and was formerly known as Digital Treasures Center. It secured a major payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2022, which allowed it to offer digital payment token (DPT) services. Since then, the platform has supported fiat and cryptocurrency payments for in-store and online transactions, including partnerships with major companies like Singapore’s Pontiac Land Group.

The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has positively influenced many cryptos, especially those with high market capitalisation. Meanwhile, most experts confirm the beginning of the Alt Season. Unsurprisingly, crypto enthusiasts are eager to know what is next for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Bitcoin Halving Pattern and Price Predictions In the previous halving cycle, which began on May 11, 2020, and ended on April 19, 2024, the Bitcoin market experienced a surge of approximately 645.68%. At the beginning of the current cycle, the BTC price stood at around $63762.59. So far, in the current cycle, the market has showcased an increase of 53.8%. Experts project $120K as a reasonable target for Bitcoin in 2025. They also acknowledge the possibility of the price hitting $150K. However, they believe the highest the price can reach next year is $200K. Institutional Accumulation and Puell Multiple Outlook Experts note that the Puell Multiple chart, a metric for estimating the level of sell pressure in the market coming from miners, supports the assessment of Bitcoin going up to at least $120K next year. Currently, the Puell Multiple index stands at 1.241. At the start of this month, it stood at 1.76. On April 20, it hit a yearly peak of 2.77. On September 11, it touched a low of 0.48. Notably, in November, it fluctuated within the range of 1.3 and 0.93. Experts also emphasise the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Global Political Shift Towards Crypto In the latest US presidential election, pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump attained a massive victory over the ruling Democratic government, which had launched several regulatory crackdowns against the cryptocurrency industry. Recently, Trump announced his decision to nominate pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the successor of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who had invited the ire of the crypto community for his tougher regulatory approach. Since the US political landscape tilted towards the pro-crypto side, many global leaders have openly expressed their support for the crypto sector, especially Bitcoin. Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that it is impossible to ban Bitcoin and his country cannot ignore new technologies like digital currencies. Interestingly, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, while answering whether the rising interest in Bitcoin can be perceived as an indication of the emerging lack of trust in the US dollar, stated that Bitcoin poses no threat to the US dollar but actually competes with gold. Altcoin Season Duration and Insights While discussing the Alt Season, experts highlight crypto expert Miles Deutscher’s post, noting that the last altcoin season lasted at least 88 days. Emphasising the predictions of Deutscher, experts forecast that the altcoin market would achieve significant gains in 2025.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:53:01

While Solana and XRP ETFs are expected to be approved, FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC is preparing to reject spot SOL ETF applications. Terrett, who posted from his X account, said that the current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified at least two SOL spot ETF applicants that their 19/b-4 filings will be rejected. Terrett also cited sources as saying that no new cryptocurrency ETF applications will be approved during the current SEC administration. “SPECIAL NEWS: I have confirmed that the SEC has notified at least two of the five potential issuers that it will reject their 19/b-4 applications for spot Solana ETFs. “From what I’ve been told, the consensus here is that the SEC will not approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration.” This development from the SEC has senior analysts not expecting a major move until Paul Atkins became the US SEC Chairman in January. Speaking about the development in Solana ETFs, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said: “Not surprising, but there will be no movement on spot crypto ETF applications until there is a new SEC chairman… Lame duck.” Solana continues to trade at $238. *This is not investment advice.

The firm’s analysts expect Bitcoin to become a core component of institutional asset allocations and corporate treasuries. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote, “We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing gold.” This prediction comes as Bitcoin surges past the $100,000 mark for the first time, driven by a 141% surge in 2024 alone. The historic rally picked up steam after the U.S. presidential election on November 5, with investors betting on the incoming Trump administration to adopt policies favorable to the crypto industry. Bernstein projects Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by late 2025. Bitcoin kickstarts long-awaited bull run Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 barrier late Wednesday night, reaching a peak of $103,844.05. By Thursday afternoon, it pulled back slightly to $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics. The rally has been fueled by institutional support and political developments, including Trump’s plan to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler with Paul Atkins . Gary is viewed as a major obstacle to the sector’s growth. Trump’s announcement energized the market, as did his post on Truth Social, where he took credit for Bitcoin’s milestone. “You’re welcome,” he wrote. His administration promises to push for policies to support Bitcoin’s growth, such as removing taxes on crypto transactions and creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Bernstein isn’t alone in its optimism. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson called Bitcoin a low-correlation asset that could replace gold as a hedge against economic instability. “Bitcoin’s main application right now is as a store of value,” Luria said . However, he did point out that Bitcoin’s price still moves more in line with risk assets than gold does, making it less stable as a hedge. Luria attributed Bitcoin’s growth to its adoption rate rather than macroeconomic factors. Employment, regulation , tax policy, and globalization all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s value. Despite its rising profile, Luria acknowledged that Bitcoin still has hurdles to clear before it can function as a widely accepted medium of exchange or unit of account. “There is still a long path ahead,” he said. Bitcoin is here to stay The roots of Bitcoin’s appeal lie in its origins during the 2008 financial crisis. Created as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, Bitcoin promised a way to bypass banks and governments. Satoshi Nakamoto ’s Bitcoin Whitepaper described it as “peer-to-peer electronic cash,” laying the groundwork for what has now become a 2 trillion-dollar market. Over the years, Bitcoin has endured skepticism, hostility, and regulatory crackdowns, but its resilience has made it a favorite among both retail and institutional investors. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, called the $100,000 milestone a “paradigm shift.” He pointed to the pro-crypto policies expected under Trump as a key driver of Bitcoin’s continued success. While Novogratz warned that Bitcoin’s price won’t always move in a straight line upward, he remains bullish on its long-term potential. Bitcoin is now up more than 133% for the year, with a 42% gain since the November election. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed in on Bitcoin’s role in the financial ecosystem during the DealBook conference. “Bitcoin is just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell said, adding that it competes with gold rather than traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. It’s not exactly an endorsement, but it’s the closest we can get to when it comes to Powell.

The election of Trump is expected to significantly reduce crypto regulation, making now a good time to consider investing in DAPP. DAPP is still down from its inception in April 2021, but it has significantly outperformed the S&P Cryptocurrency DeFi Index over the past 3-year and 1-year time frames. DAPP is a high-risk, high-reward investment suitable for a speculative growth category within a well-diversified portfolio, rated as a buy. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) is a diversified yet relatively bold bet on the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The DAPP portfolio gives investors strong exposures to Bitcoin, digital asset exchanges, crypto miners, and other blockchain-based infrastructure companies. DAPP is +142% over the past year - no doubt supercharged by the thesis that Trump 2.0 will be much more friendly than the Biden administration toward all things crypto. That said, note that DAPP is still down significantly from its inception in April 2021 (see chart below). I would argue that, given the prospects for significant reductions in crypto regulation and the Trump 2.0 momentum factor, now is a good time to consider an allocation in the DAPP ETF. Today, I'll take a closer look at the DAPP and you can decide if it might be a good fit within your well-diversified portfolio. Data by YCharts Investment Thesis The election of Trump in November will likely lead to a step-function change in the regulatory outlook for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrencies in general. Indeed, Trump has said he wants the U.S. to become the ""Bitcoin superpower of the world"" and supports the establishment of a ""National Bitcoin Reserve"". Indeed, Trump recently announced crypto advocate Paul Atkins as his nominee for Chairman of the SEC. While there are other factors driving the recent price appreciation of BTC (see the Barron's article Why Did Bitcoin Surge Past $100,000 ), the response in the price of Bitcoin since the election is undeniable and has been both fast and furious: coinmarketcap.com As you can see from the graphic above, CoinMarketCap.com reports the current circulating supply of BTC is estimated to be 19.79 million and the total BTC market cap now exceeds US$2 trillion. As you know, the total possible BTC supply (i.e., the theoretical maximum mined limit) is capped at 21 million, which is estimated to be mined by the year 2140 . The point here is that there are only ~1.2 million BTC left to be mined (~5.7% of the total). With that as background, let's take a look to see how VanEck has positioned the DAPP ETF for investor success going forward. I'll start with a review of the top holdings. Top-10 Holdings The top-10 holdings are shown below and were taken directly from the VanEck DAPP ETF webpage where you can find more detailed information on the fund: Van Eck The #1 holding with an 11.7% weight is MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy is arguably no longer a software company at all, but is, instead, a whale holder of a large reserve of Bitcoin. Indeed, Seeking Alpha reports that MSTR bought a whopping $1.5 billion worth of BTC from November 25 to December 1. The purchases were made using the proceeds of a recent $21 billion stock offering. As of December 1, MicroStrategy held an aggregate of ~402,100 Bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of around $23.4 billion. Given the current BTC price (at pixel time) of $101,400, those BTCs are now worth $40.8 billion. MicroStrategy stock has soared on the ""Trump trade"" and is up 600%+ over the past year: Data by YCharts Coinbase Global ( COIN ) is the #2 holding with an 8.9% weight. COIN provides financial and technology infrastructure for consumers who want a marketplace to trade cryptocurrencies and/or securely accept crypto assets as payment. COIN announced its Q3 report on October 31st. Highlights included: Revenue of $1.2 billion (-17% qoq but +81% yoy) Net income of $75 million The 7th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA ($449 million in Q3) A $1 billion share buyback plan COIN stock is +133% over the past year and trades with a forward P/E=62x (on adjusted earnings). Block ( SQ ), the old ""Square"", is the #3 holding with a 6.6% weight. Block operates the popular ""Cash App"", along with supporting commerce and financial products, hardware, and software services. Block has established a strong long-term track record of revenue growth: Seeking Alpha Block stock is +50% over the past year and trades with a TTM P/E=58.4x and a forward P/E=28.0x . The #7 holding with a 5.4% weight is Applied Digital Corp. ( APLD ). Applied provides and operates digital infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing (""HPC"") and AI industries. APLD operates via three segments: Data Center Hosting Business, Cloud Services Business, and HPC Hosting Business. The company is expected to more than double revenue by 2026 (to $394 million). The Dallas-based company is +90% over the past year, but is still losing money (see Q4 FY24 results ), issuing shares (see here and here ), and taking on debt . Bitcoin miners are well represented in DAPP's top-10 holdings with Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), in aggregate, equating to a little over 10% of the entire portfolio. New York-based Cipher develops and operates industrial-scale Bitcoin mining in the U.S. Riot Platforms is also engaged in Bitcoin mining in the U.S. and operates through 3 segments: Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Engineering. The stocks of these two companies have been on divergent paths this year as RIOT has faced significant financial and operational challenges : Data by YCharts Performance As mentioned earlier, and despite the excellent performance over the past 12 months, the DAPP ETF is still down significantly from its price at inception in April 2021. The fund's 3-year average annual returns (-11%) reflect that fact: Van Eck That said, DAPP's 3-year and 1-year performance numbers significantly beat the S&P Cryptocurrency De-Fi Index (-29.3% and +38.4%, respectively). The following graphic compares the 1-year returns of the DAPP ETF as compared to two leading Bitcoin ETFs: The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ): Data by YCharts Interestingly enough, the DAPP ETF has been almost directly correlated to the Bitcoin ETFs over the past 6-months, with the 12-month returns being almost identical. ETF Basics: The following bullets summarize some of the ETF metrics that investors typically care about: Expense Ratio: 0.51% Total Net Assets: $211 million # of Holdings: 22 30-day SEC yield: 0% TTM P/E Ratio: 20.4x Price-to-Book Ratio: 3.34x As you can see, the DAPP ETF is certainly more expensive as compared to a low-cost S&P500 fund (VOO's expense fee is 0.03%). However, VanEck has a history of relatively expensive ETFs that deliver strong returns for investors (the SMH Semiconductor ETF, for example, is a favorite of mine). The DAPP ETF is still a ""young fund"" and $211 million of AUM is relatively tiny in the ETF universe. Likewise, the total number of holdings (22) is quite small. The (VanEck reported...) P/E and price-to-book ratios look almost too good to be true and are actually below that of the S&P500. Not sure how that works, considering many of the top holdings in the DAPP ETF are not yet GAAP earnings positive. Risks The risks of investing in DAPP are, to put it mildly, huge. I already mentioned the relatively low AUM and total number of holdings - both of which could lead to liquidity issues on a crypto-rout. Volatility is very high: back in Q2 of 2022, the DAPP ETF dropped a whopping 71%. Many of the companies in the DAPP portfolio are not yet GAAP earnings positive, and may never be. The DAPP ETF's portfolio of companies may have elevated risks as compared to ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin (like the FBTC and IBIT ETFs mentioned earlier) because these companies have balance sheets, employee payrolls, and operational expenses whereas pure Bitcoin, obviously, does not. Given the massive recent gains in Bitcoin and the crypto-related companies, you may have already ""missed the boat"" on the Trump 2.0 momentum thesis. Upside risks include investors not having any direct exposure to Bitcoin and/or blockchain-based companies, and totally missing out on a continued bull market in the space. Summary & Conclusion Followers who have read my articles on portfolio management know that many investors can afford to have a ""speculative growth"" category within their otherwise well-diversified portfolio. Indeed, I have written previous articles on why Bitcoin is an excellent choice for this category (i.e., high-risk, high reward). See my November 2020 Seeking Alpha article Bitcoin Penetrates Further Into The 'Mainstream' - It Should Penetrate Your Portfolio Too , for example. For investors who want to make an arguably more leveraged bet on Bitcoin/crypto as compared to the straight-up Bitcoin ETFs, I advise you to consider the DAPP ETF, which I rate as a buy to profit from market momentum driven by the Trump 2.0 thesis.",APLD|CIFR|COIN|FBTC|IBIT|MSTR|RIOT|SQ|DAPP,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-06 11:30:00

According to this prediction, BTC will trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024. Looking further, TradingShot identified a chart pattern that could put Bitcoin at $140,000 by February 2025 . Meanwhile, the financial giant Standard Chartered sees BTC trading at $200,000 by the end of 2025 after correctly calling the $100k this year. However, Bitcoin’s volatility can still cause investors to see more “pump and dump” events, such as yesterday’s. On that note, the best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki believes that these BTC crashes offer opportunities for accumulation. Yet, investors and traders should be cautious and avoid losing money to market liquidations, having a solid plan on Bitcoin. Featured image from Shutterstock.

But let’s not get carried away. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen an explosive bull run, and history shows it can come crashing down quickly, too. US President Trump’s vow to establish the country as the global crypto hub and his selection of pro-crypto regulators are key drivers of this surge. Retail traders fuel the frenzy Retail investors, often the first to arrive at market peaks, are back. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 cryptos has more than doubled since Trump’s November 5 election win, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 46% gain in the same period. But even with these jaw-dropping numbers, the index is still only a third of its pandemic-era peak. This is a critical phase in the bull cycle: the latter half, where big returns are possible but risks are magnified. Breadth and leverage are elevated but not overextended. NFTs are also seeing a resurgence. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index jumped 106% in November, its best month since the start of 2022. Even so, the index is far below its record high, proving the fragility of this rebound. South Korea, a hotbed for crypto activity, saw trading volumes on local platforms hit $254 billion in November. For context, this figure surpasses the turnover on the Kospi, the country’s benchmark equity index. It’s bullish all over Trump’s choice for the SEC chair (a known crypto supporter) and the appointment of the first White House crypto czar have made markets bullish all over. Meanwhile, meme stocks like GameStop and AMC are seeing sharp intraday rallies. As we reported , a cryptic social media post from Keith Gill, the infamous “Roaring Kitty” of the 2021 investing craze, added to the frenzy. Bitcoin’s record-breaking week coincided with the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearing 45,000. Investors are pouring into everything from junk bonds to stocks, initially driven by easy monetary conditions. MicroStrategy has become the poster child for this speculative mania. The company’s stock has soared 464% this year, driven by its massive Bitcoin holdings worth around $41 billion. MicroStrategy plans to buy another $40 billion in Bitcoin, funding these purchases through convertible notes that investors can exchange for equity if the stock price rises. This strategy is as risky as it is ambitious. If Bitcoin prices drop, the impact on MicroStrategy’s stock could be catastrophic. The parallels to the meme stock rally of 2021 are unmistakable—everything works until it doesn’t. Signs of froth are everywhere. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett pointed out that the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio is now at 5.3, just shy of the 5.5 peak during the 2000 tech bubble. He warns of an “overshoot” in early 2025 if the S&P 500 climbs another 10% to 6,666 points. Bitcoin’s market cap now exceeds $2 trillion, making it comparable to the world’s 11th-largest economy. But while investors may be partying like it’s 2021, history suggests the music will eventually stop.

Bitcoin Price Today: Here’s Why BTC Crashed Below $100K Bitcoin price crashed 13.53% between December 4 and 5, wiping out an excess of $1.5 billion worth of positions in just 19 hours. On December 5 alone, more than $1 billion worth of longs and short positions got wiped from the cryptocurrency market. BTC Crash, Crypto Liquidations But why did Bitcoin suddenly dip below the historic $100,000 level, and will it recover? Let’s discover! Meitu, dubbed as the chinese MicroStrategy, sold its crypto holdings, which led to the sudden drop in Bitcoin price on December 4. The Chinese selfie application operator sold 940 BTC and 31,000 ETH, realizing nearly $80 million in profits, the company’s Wednesday statement noted.

Value of BTC trades at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, bringing the year-to-date gain from 56% on October 20 to roughly 130% as of December 6. The YTD performance has slumped due to the recent BTC crash. Although many altcoins have shot up over triple digits, Bitcoin is catching up. Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 70%, and is well below BTC. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. Will Bitcoin End 2024 on Positive Note? Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note. Many even expect a six-digit target for BTC by the end of November, and this is due to the historical returns . History shows that Bitcoin has always performed massively in the fourth quarter. Historical Bitcoin Price Performance With that said, if Bitcoin price hits a new ATH in November or December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, could finally hit the $2 trillion mark. Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization While Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, with Ethereum, the duo controls nearly 65% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Despite the seven-month consolidation, Bitcoin’s $1.93 trillion market cap remains strong, anticipating it reaching $2 trillion before 2025. BTC: A composition of 24-hour Trading Volume Being the top crypto has its benefits; more people tend to flock toward the asset. Likewise, BTC’s 24-hour trading volume stands at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, contributes a major portion of this volume. Binance’s share of BTC’s 24-hour trading volume comprises spot and perpetuals trading. While spot volume hovers around 11%, perpetual volume is 41%. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, etc, follow Binance. Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin Network Upgrades Since 2009 Here are some key milestone upgrades to the Bitcoin network over the past decade. 2020-2024: Taproot Upgrade (2021): Improved Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality, allowing for more complex transactions and enhanced privacy.Muir Glacier Upgrade (2020): Delayed the “ice age” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring the continued smooth operation of Bitcoin. 2017-2019: Segregated Witness (SegWit) Upgrade (2017): Increased the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed on the network, and improved the overall scalability of Bitcoin. Schnorr/Tapscript Upgrade (proposed): Aims to further improve the efficiency and scalability of Bitcoin transactions, but has not yet been activated. SegWit2x (canceled): A proposed upgrade that aimed to increase the block size limit, but was ultimately canceled due to lack of consensus. 2015-2016: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 Upgrade (2016): Introduced several improvements, including better wallet management and enhanced security features. BIP66 Upgrade (2015): Standardized the way Bitcoin transactions are verified, improving the overall security and reliability of the network. 2013-2014: Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 Upgrade (2014): Introduced a new wallet format and improved the overall performance of the Bitcoin client. BIP0016 Upgrade (2013): Enabled the use of payment protocol, allowing for more efficient and secure transactions. 2010-2012: Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) Upgrade (2012): Introduced a new type of transaction that allows for more complex payment scenarios, improving the overall flexibility of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core 0.6.0 Upgrade (2011): Introduced several improvements, including better wallet management and enhanced security features. 2009-2010: Bitcoin Core 0.3.0 Upgrade (2009): One of the earliest upgrades to the Bitcoin network, introducing several key features and improvements.

Bitcoin’s dominance over gold hits largest margin in history,https://finbold.com/new-store-of-value-bitcoins-dominance-over-gold-hits-largest-margin-in-history/,"The recent Bitcoin ( BTC ) spike above $100,000 has elevated the asset to outperform gold by the largest margin in history. Specifically, Bitcoin is now valued at 36.78 ounces of gold per BTC, a historic high against the traditional store of value, according to data shared by Barchart on December 6. Bitcoin and gold price performance. Source: Barchart The data indicates that from its early years, Bitcoin’s price trajectory has been marked by volatile but meteoric rises. In contrast, gold’s performance has remained steady and relatively flat over the same period, highlighting its traditional role as a safe-haven asset rather than a high-growth investment . While gold has long been hailed as the ultimate store of value, Bitcoin’s ascent signals a possible paradigm shift in how investors are choosing to preserve wealth. This development lends credence to Bitcoin’s emerging status as ‘digital gold.’ Interestingly, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has highlighted the possibility of Bitcoin outperforming gold, noting that the digital currency is a competitor to gold but not to the dollar. Despite Bitcoin’s rapid growth, the asset significantly trails the precious metal, which boasts a market cap of almost $18 trillion compared to Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion. Skepticism on Bitcoin replacing gold Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility has led some gold advocates to dismiss its potential as a gold replacement. Economist Peter Schiff, for instance, remains a vocal proponent of gold, emphasizing that Bitcoin is destined to crash to zero. In a November 25 X post , Schiff argued that Bitcoin lacks the intrinsic value needed to serve as a store of value. According to the gold enthusiast, Bitcoin’s appeal is purely speculative, driven by Fear of Missing Out ( FOMO ) and faith rather than fundamentals. He claimed Bitcoin’s rising price relies on attracting more buyers and likened investing in it to a risky game where participants must sell before the bubble bursts. You don't store value by holding #Bitcoin . Unlike #gold , Bitcoin has no actual value to store. Holding Bitcoin is a bet that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise, as FOMO ensures that more people will buy and have faith in Bitcoin in the future than have faith in it today. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 25, 2024 Unlike gold, which Schiff champions for its tangible value, Bitcoin, he argues, is a bet on momentum rather than a reliable hedge. Conversely, other figures like author and investor Robert Kiyosaki have dismissed the debate between gold and Bitcoin, emphasizing that both asset classes serve the same purpose. For the celebrity financial educator, both can act as a safeguard, especially during his long-projected historic market crash . Gold and Bitcoin price movement Regarding price movements, Bitcoin and gold have had a stellar year. Gold was on track to target the $3,000 mark , but bullish momentum stalled after the United States presidential election. Regarding gold’s outlook, legendary trader Peter Brandt noted in a December 5 X post that the metal’s price action displays a potential diamond pattern —a rare formation that typically signals indecision and possible trend reversals. Currently, gold is trading near $2,653, with the diamond structure forming between resistance at $2,748.2 and support at $2,629.6. Gold price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt A breakout above or below these levels could dictate the next major move, but the prevalence of similar patterns across assets has made traders hesitant to trust this signal fully. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish sentiment despite experiencing a sharp drop below the $100,000 level. Bitcoin was trading at $98,070 at press time, having corrected by over 4% in the last 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin has the potential to reclaim the $100,000 resistance level, supported by its hold above $95,000. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

On December 5, 2024, Gill posted a cryptic image on X, which appeared to be an altered Time magazine cover from 2006. This mysterious post sent Ripples through the market, sparking a rally in both GameStop and AMC stocks. Gill is no stranger to influencing stock prices—his posts played a major role in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, where the stock skyrocketed over 1,600%, shaking the financial world and crushing hedge funds that had bet against it. GameStop’s Price Surge After Gill’s recent post, GameStop’s stock jumped by 16%, reaching $30.87. It later closed at $28.60, still showing a 6% drop over the past five days. The sharp rise caused a brief trading halt, showing that people still react strongly to Gill’s posts, highlighting the unpredictable nature of meme stocks. AMC Follows Suit The post also pumped the prices of AMC Entertainment, another favorite stock among retail traders, also saw a 12% increase, reaching $5.55. While this is a far cry from AMC’s all-time high of $261 in 2021, it highlights how the meme stock movement continues to resonate in the market. AMC, much like GameStop, became a symbol of retail investors challenging Wall Street hedge funds, and Gill’s involvement continues to drive interest. Memecoin GME Makes Waves In addition to the stocks, an unofficial GameStop Solana-based memecoin (GME) saw a remarkable rise of 72% following Gill’s post, briefly reaching $0.007672. Though it later pulled back to $0.006488, the coin’s price movement highlights the connection between Gill’s online presence and the memecoin market, which thrives on speculative trading. Roaring Kitty’s Return After a quiet period following the GameStop rally in 2021, Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) returned to social media in May 2024, sparking renewed interest in meme stocks and crypto. His posts in September and December have shown that his influence is still strong, causing big price movements. However, his impact has also attracted legal attention. In June 2024, a GameStop investor sued him for stock manipulation, but the case was dismissed, highlighting the legal scrutiny surrounding Gill’s influence on the market. Impact of Speculative Trading Crypto analyst Evan noticed that GameStop’s stock jumped 5% right after Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill) posted on X. He joked about how this shows the market doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to since a single post can move stock prices, which goes against the idea that prices should always reflect all available info.

Eric Trump, Donald Trump’s second eldest son , shared a post on X that included a screen grab of the latter’s post on Truth Social. According to the younger Trump, his father, the 45th president of the United States, was ecstatic about the development and claimed credit for it. He then ended it with a typical Make America Great Again Rhetoric. Image Source: X Bitcoin’s Latest Price Action The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization went above $104k in the trading session earlier yesterday but has since dropped below $100k once again. However, one of the biggest and most storeyed price resistances in digital currency history has been subdued, and commentators took a moment to celebrate this occasion. Some called it a watershed moment in the history of the digital currency revolution, while others called it a launchpad for further price action going into 2025. Did Trump Cause Bitcoin to Go Above $100k? Donald Trump loves to take credit for positive developments from around the world. Bitcoin did benefit from Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, but to say that he is the sole reason or even the biggest one behind the $100k move is highly inaccurate. Trump famously opposed Bitcoin during his 2016-2020 presidency and once compared the premier digital currency to a scam in a 2018 presidential address. He also stated his desire to ban the cryptocurrency in America. However, Bitcoin paid no heed to his threats and continued to grow strongly over time. It was only in 2022 that Trump changed his original position and started courting crypto users and their votes. By then, the blockchain economy had grown to become a huge industry with tens of millions of users in the US. They readily started to support Trump, as the alternative was the Democrats, who wanted to censure the trillion-dollar decentralized economy even further. Trump was one of many factors that helped Bitcoin go above $100k, but the real challenge will be upon him soon. So far, all of his rhetoric has been talking and political point-scoring. It remains to be seen whether he will walk the walk on the matter once he takes oath as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-06 11:42:07

An analyst assessing the state of Bitcoin and XRP has warned of a potential bloodbath in XRP as Bitcoin dominance increases. Pav Hundal, chief analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx, noted that if Bitcoin dominance continues to grow, XRP could fall and the majority of long positions in XRP could be liquidated. “The real danger for XRP bulls, who are currently heavily leveraged, is a return to Bitcoin dominance. A rotation from XRP to Bitcoin would likely lead to a long liquidation bloodbath.” Stating that investors' expectations for an increase have increased after the incredible rise in XRP, the analyst said that investors are open to long positions even as the XRP price falls. At this point, citing CoinGlass data, the analyst noted that XRP's open interest (OI) reached $ 3.44 billion on December 5, pointing out that this figure is much higher than the $ 2 billion recorded during the price increase in April 2021. Finally, the analyst added that he predicts that spot volumes and prices for XRP and altcoins could increase again once Bitcoin stabilizes and its dominance declines. *This is not investment advice.

And one has added its own twist by also adding Ripple’s native coin XRP to its balance sheet. Worksport To Incorporate BTC And XRP Into Its Corporate Treasury Worksport, a New York-based company that trades on the Nasdaq and sells pickup truck covers, announced Thursday that it was investing up to 10% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin and XRP. This is equivalent to $5 million. The decision to buy up these two cryptocurrencies is intended to safeguard Worksport’s assets against inflation and to boost transaction efficiency. Worksport CEO Steven Rossi described Bitcoin and XRP as “increasingly reliable stores of value” due to their “inflation-resistant” properties. Apart from adding BTC and XRP to its corporate treasury, the company said it would also accept crypto for payments on its e-commerce platform. Worksport expects a 37% reduction in transaction costs with cryptocurrency payments. $WKSP Worksport To Adopt Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and XRP for Corporate Treasury.

(@WorksportLtd) December 5, 2024 “By strategically allocating a portion of our treasury to these digital assets and accepting crypto payments, we’re enhancing our financial strategy and aligning ourselves with the future of global finance,” Rossi noted. Why XRP? Worksport joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that have taken the plunge and used excess cash reserves to purchase digital assets this year. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy was the first public company to put BTC on its balance sheet back in 2020, in an effort to accrue the best returns for shareholders instead of holding excess cash. The software firm now holds a staggering 402,100 BTC , worth around $39 billion at the coin’s current market price. However, it’s extremely rare for firms to opt for altcoins such as XRP. Rossi, who has personally invested in XRP, shared his belief in the industry’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap during an interview. “XRP has been doing quite well recently, and it reaffirmed that these are early assets that really challenge central banking,” he posited. While XRP has registered some extreme volatility, the Worksport boss believes it’s stabilizing and will bring long-term value. Besides the spectacular price rally, the fact that there’s also a handful of spot XRP exchange-traded fund applications on the SEC’s desk might also make the digital asset more appealing for corporate adoption.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-06 11:54:15

The event may add to the market volatility, with the distinct possibility of a new direction after the contracts expire. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are preparing for more volatility ahead of the weekly options expiry. The December contracts are already setting the pace for prices at the end of 2024. The expiry arrives at a time when the BTC spot price is volatile in the short term, even though it is showing a recovery trend. BTC rallied again to $98,237.17, while still trading at the ‘greed’ sentiment level. As of December 6, BTC had a weekly options expiry of 23K contracts, with a notional value of $2.3B and maximum pain at $97,000. The put/call ratio of 1.1 suggested a relative balance between long and short positions. ETH options accrued just $570K for the week but with a put/call ratio of 0.62. The ratio suggests a stronger bullish attitude for ETH, as the price approaches $4,000. Even without other factors, trading ahead of weekends and options expiry boosts volatility in the short term. For BTC, options expiry also precedes bigger price rallies. The November expiry of $13.6B in options preceded the recent rally to $104,000. What caused the BTC flash crash to $93,000? The BTC rally ground to a halt as it endured a worrying flash crash to $93,000. The options expiry event may have added to the volatility. The flash crash liquidated up to $450M in leveraged positions. The event continued on Friday, with a total of $1B liquidations of exposed positions. Other explanations include rapid liquidation, as well as normalizing the BTC levels to available liquidity. The selling may be due to relatively large put option positions, which would be liquidated at a lower price range. BTC recovered above $97,000, but may still face price pressures from long positions at a lower price range. One liquidation target holds more than $84M in leveraged positions at $95,322, as well as $73.52M in leveraged positions at $94,011. The recent volatile price moves may not reflect long-term opportunities, but they are still leading to re-estimations on whether BTC can go higher, or if it has already achieved its cycle peak. Options trading also gives an outlook on expected performance. The biggest liquidity of call options can be seen at $100,000, followed by a buildup at the $110,000 and $120,000 levels. Those options point to cautious trading for year-end levels. The most actively traded options expiring on December 27 point to $110,000 as a possible scenario for BTC. | Source: Deribit BTC price moves in December may be swayed even more by the options set to expire on the 27th. One of the biggest contracts with $229M in notional value is a call option at $110,000. For more cautious traders, the $96,000 and $120,000 call options have almost similar volumes, exploring both the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. Will ETH finally show its bullish side? The bullish options ratio for ETH suggests an expectation for a breakout above $4,000. The $3,600 resistance level has turned into support in the past few days. ETH traders may also attack the accrued short positions, all of which are above the current price. The liquidation heatmap points to $877M in attackable positions. ETH benefitted from highly active ETF inflows reaching an all-time peak. In the past day, ETF inflows expanded to $428.44M, surpassing the last few months of inflows. For now, ETH still lags behind BTC in activity and leveraged liquidity. However, the slowdown of the BTC rally may lead to a rollover into ETH in expectation of a breakout. ETH traded at a spot price of $3,869.86, with trading volumes close to the higher range for the past month. ETH’s performance is also tied to the expectations of an altcoin season, which also involves multiple tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem.

So, that's the bitcoin market right now. The bulls pushed prices above $103,000 early Thursday, only for the bears to bite back, crashing prices to $91,000. As it stands, we’re trading steadily around $98,000. Talk about undecided ... The crash shook out leveraged crypto futures bets worth around $1 billion, bringing a degree of normality to what had become an overheated market. That's possibly a blessing in disguise, because had BTC surged all the way up to $120,000, the eventual leverage shakeout would have been even more severe and could have potentially damaged investor confidence. The glass-half-full perspective is supported by bitcoin spot ETFs, which managed to pull in a net $766 million despite the chaos. But there's a glass-half-empty side too. The ProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF, which tracks twice the inverse of bitcoin’s daily performance, also saw a net inflow as well as record trading volume. While the $7 million added is small compared with the long spot ETFs, it shows the bears are ready to make their presence felt. If it all feels a little shaky, there's more to come, with the chance of downside volatility if U.S. nonfarm payrolls data points to a resilient labour market and sticky wage pressures. That would prompt a recalibration of Fed rate-cut expectations and possibly hurt crypto prices. Weak data, conversely, could yield a price bounce, although trading directionally might be tricky while prices are this indecisive. In other news, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of David Sacks as Crypto and AI Czar (which might seem like the opposite of crypto’s decentralization ethos) is being viewed positively for Solana’s ETF prospects. Why? Because at one point, Sacks was associated with the crypto hedge fund Multicoin, one of Solana's early investors. It seems farfetched, but hey it's a typical bull-market narrative. Looking at the broader market, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is quickly approaching the $4.6 billion market value of Arbitrum's ARB token in a move that indicates application-specific layer 2s like Hyperliquid are becoming the ""real value capture mechanisms for DeFi applications,"" according to Gautham Santosh, founder of Polynomial Protocol. Gautham noted on X that building on general-purpose layer 2s could mean constructing someone else's moat, essentially translating your success into their token value. He points out that while Arbitrum-based perpetual protocol GMX generates 54% more revenue than Hyperliquid, its market cap stands at just $376 million or just 8% of Hyperliquid's. That's a lot to take in for today. So, as trader Alex Kruger said on X, ""If you're not a full-time trader, focus on portfolio construction."" Stay alert out there!

It becomes the second-largest cat-themed token behind Solana-based popcat (POPCAT) The memecoin is known for its distinctive branding around the meme of a cat laughing with tears (often represented by the ""joycat"" emoji 😹) and sporting Pit Viper sunglasses. This token doesn't boast any intrinsic utility, thriving instead on its community-driven ethos and the virality of meme culture within the cryptocurrency space. Meme coins often rely on community hype, and MOG has successfully captured a zeitgeist with its humorous and culturally resonant branding driving demand. Its cult community often appears to 'mog' other token communities (a slang term for outperforming) on social posts or in replies on X — and that has become a meme itself, further fueling the token’s popularity. Derivatives Positioning BTC and ETH perpetual funding rates have normalized from previously overheated levels, with the ETH rate remaining elevated compared with BTC, suggesting a bullish bias for the ETH/BTC ratio. The positioning in SOL perpetuals is even more bullish. The open interest-normalized cumulative volume delta has declined for most major tokens in the past 24 hours, indicating that the sell-off primarily resulted from the unwinding of long positions rather than fresh shorts. Despite BTC's quick retrace to sub-$100K levels, calls continue to trade at a premium to puts, although the spread is narrower than it was early Thursday. A similar dynamic is observed in ETH options. A large bull call spread crossed the tape on Deribit, involving a long position in the $106,000 strike call and shorting the $110,000 strike call, both expiring on Dec. 27, according to data source Amberdata.

After years of regulatory uncertainty and a flurry of enforcement actions, US voters have delivered a resounding message: the time has come for a new approach to crypto regulation. This sentiment has been echoed across both executive and legislative branches, with over 292 candidates who openly support crypto elected to the legislature. This wave of pro-crypto leadership has ignited cautious optimism within the industry, bolstered by a post-election surge in institutional and retail adoption. You might also like: Blockchain tech can restore trust in US elections | Opinion If the incoming administration fulfils its pre-election promises , the US could position itself again as a global hub for crypto innovation. However, the path forward is not without challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation , set to take effect on December 30, will introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework, potentially outpacing the US in offering clarity to crypto businesses. To maintain its leadership, the US must seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that strikes a delicate balance: one that fosters innovation while safeguarding consumers and investors. This will require moving beyond the reactive, enforcement-first strategies of the past and embracing a more proactive, principles-based approach. The turning point Since 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has largely relied on enforcement actions to address perceived regulatory gaps in the crypto industry. This approach, while well-intentioned, has contributed to significant uncertainty. In 2023 alone, the SEC initiated 46 enforcement actions—a 53% increase from the previous year—further highlighting the inadequacy of applying legacy financial regulations to this rapidly evolving space. Recent proposals, such as granting the Federal Reserve authority over stablecoin issuers as ‘depository institutions,’ demonstrate the tension between traditional regulatory frameworks and crypto’s unique characteristics. Stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) thrive on their flexibility and global reach, attributes that don’t neatly align with the requirements of traditional banking regulations. Fortunately, the outcome of the recent elections suggests a shift in public sentiment. Voters are signalling a preference for regulatory clarity and more constructive dialogue between lawmakers and the crypto industry. Momentum for change One of the most notable shifts occurred in Ohio, where incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, known for his critical stance on crypto, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Backed by industry heavyweights like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz, Moreno’s campaign underscored the growing influence of the crypto sector in shaping political outcomes. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure coming to an end in January, new leadership at the agency—potentially someone like Dan Gallagher , an advocate for balanced regulation—offers some hope for a fresh approach. Gallagher’s experience and pragmatic stance could help bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Gallagher’s experience and pragmatic stance could help bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, remarked that this is America’s most pro-crypto Congress ever. This optimism is justified, as Congress appears poised to revisit critical legislation like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act ( DCCPA ). If passed, this bill could grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a more prominent role in overseeing digital asset markets, reducing the SEC’s outsized influence and providing much-needed regulatory clarity. Balancing innovation and regulation While the promise of pro-crypto legislation is encouraging, lawmakers must tread carefully to avoid the pitfalls of overregulation. For example, the EU’s MiCA framework has drawn criticism for its “ systemic risks ” and the potential to stifle innovation by imposing stringent requirements on certain crypto assets and markets. Similarly, recent moves by French regulators to clamp down on prediction markets, such as Polymarket, underscore the risks of applying outdated regulatory models to innovative technologies. Such actions, while aimed at investor protection, may inadvertently hamper market growth and limit consumer choice. The goal for the US should be a regulatory regime that promotes innovation, encourages competition, and facilitates market access for startups and larger institutions. By fostering an environment of trust and transparency, lawmakers can protect consumers without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the crypto industry forward. A bright but uncertain future With a historic pro-crypto mandate, the US is at a pivotal moment. The opportunity to reclaim its position as a global leader in financial innovation is within reach, but the path ahead remains to be determined. Success will depend on the willingness of lawmakers and regulators to embrace collaboration, prioritize clarity, and foster an ecosystem that balances innovation with robust consumer protections. As this new chapter unfolds, one thing is clear: the future of crypto in America holds immense potential. Whether that potential is realized will depend on the actions taken in the months and years to come.

However, some cryptocurrencies are showing indications that they are perhaps reaching a top. Is this the case for Sui ($SUI), Aptos ($APT) and Near Protocol ($NEAR)? $SUI reaches its cup and handle measured move Source: TradingView The $SUI price has been on the up for some time now. Breaking out of a cup and handle formation earlier in November, the price has since reached its measured move at $4.15. After surpassing this level, the price has been quickly sold back down, leaving a couple of small candle wicks behind. It remains to be seen whether this will now become support, or whether the price might come back down - perhaps all the way to retest the 1.618 at $3.25. If there is continuation of the upside move, and in all probability there probably is room for this, the 2.618 Fibonacci is a target above at $5. Major resistance approaching for $APT Source: TradingView On the weekly chart for $APT, it can be seen that the price is rising towards $16 after hopefully being able to hold above the 0.618 Fibonacci at $13.58. Given that there is a descending trendline that is coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci, there is likely to be a lot of resistance at this level. $NEAR needs to get above its next price step Source: TradingView The $NEAR price has broken out of the long-time descending trendline that began in early 2022. In the weekly chart above, it can be noted that some nice price structure has been built. Two price steps now exist at $5.65 and $8.53. It’s this next step at $8.53 that $NEAR bulls need to lift the price above. This could then act as support for the rest of the bull market. However, the Stochastic RSI has reached its top on the weekly time frame, and therefore upward price momentum could start to dissipate, and a rejection at the 0.382 Fibonacci could be the upshot. The weekly RSI is at the top for not just the three cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, but also for most other cryptocurrencies. This is something to bear in mind, and there is likely to be a correction coming at some point. Stay alert. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The buying pressure that elevated the levels beyond $100K appears to have turned into a selling pressure. Therefore, after a tough fight, the bears successfully dragged the levels below $98,000. The buying volume does not appear to have substantiated the selling pressure and as a result, the BTC price may go lower and test the pivotal support shortly. The BTC price was expected to undergo a retracement after rising above the much-awaited milestone of $100K. As almost all the BTCs were in profits, the probability of a spot price reversal was much less. Meanwhile, the data from Coinglass shows that the traders had leveraged huge long positions across $100K to $103K, which have been liquidated. As a result, the price has faced a significant pullback. More than $400 million in longs were liquidated, which is said to be one of the largest liquidations in the past few months. With this, the leverage seems to have whipped out to a large extent, paving the way for a healthy upswing. Currently, the price remains above the crucial demand zone, just below $97,000 and as long as the token remains within the range, the possibility of marching towards upper resistance remains high. Mainly because a massive amount of BTCs were bought around this range. As per the data shared by an analyst, ALI , more than 1.42 million BTCs were bought by 1.45 million addresses around the range of $95,043 and $97,899. Hence, these can be considered as one of the strongest support levels at present and as long as bulls defend them, the probability of a rebound continues to hover over the BTC price rally. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to remain within a bullish range regardless of the bears offering strong upward pressure, trying to send the levels lower.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 12:12:32

According to a recent statement from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the agency has created an internal task force to oversee crypto ATM operators and crack down on those who fail to comply with local mandates. Australia has witnessed an uptick in cryptocurrency-related crimes, with bad actors exploiting the anonymity and rapid transaction capabilities of digital assets. These crimes range from money laundering and fraud to the use of money mules in facilitating illicit activities, according to intelligence data cited by AUSTRAC. Notably, criminals often misuse crypto ATMs, which AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas described as “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate instant and irreversible transfers. Such activities are expected to increase as crypto adoption grows, Thomas noted, stating: We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, and we’ve heard of some victims losing their life savings, which is just heartbreaking. As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation. To minimize these risks, over the next year, the task force will work to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. This includes verifying that operators are registered with AUSTRAC, conducting thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and reporting large cash deposits or withdrawals exceeding AUD 10,000 (approximately $6400). Failure to comply with these requirements would lead to “significant financial penalties,” Thomas continued, emphasizing that “AUSTRAC won’t hesitate in taking action.” “This is the first step in AUSTRAC’s focus to reduce the criminal use of cryptocurrency in Australia,” he added. Australia currently ranks third globally in the number of crypto ATMs, with data from Coin ATM Radar indicating a total of 1,308 machines, with Sydney and Melbourne hosting the highest numbers. However, the agency claims that only a small fraction of these machines are operated by registered operators. Australia is keeping the crypto sector in check Australia remains cautious of the crypto sector and has time and again issued warnings about the various risks involved with this rapidly expanding asset class. Earlier this year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) warned about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies ahead of the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). ASIC has also been going after crypto companies, which it believes have been offering unregistered securities. Meanwhile, in its 2024 risk assessment report, AUSTRAC flagged cryptocurrencies as a “high-risk” tool that could promote money laundering activities. Australia’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies comes as the nation has witnessed a surge in crypto crimes . An August report from the Australian Federal Police found that locals lost over AUD$180 million to crypto investment scams in just 12 months. During the same month, ASIC took down over 600 websites that were allegedly promoting crypto-related scams.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 12:22:00

This could be a pivotal moment for the NFT brand which has been lately struggling due to the slowdown in the NFT market. As a result, the popular NFT brand is looking to expand its footprint in the fun games and meme coin market and revive its prospects. PENGU Token Will Have A Total of 88 Billion Tokens Supply According to an official post on X, PENGU will debut on the Solana network with a total supply of 88,888,888,888 tokens. The goal is to provide fans and newcomers a chance to connect with the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. However, users must note that the Pudgy Penguins NFTs will continue to operate on the Ethereum blockchain network. To incentivize community participation, Pudgy Penguins ensures a fair and equitable distribution of the tokens. Approximately 23.5% of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be allocated to holders of the project’s NFT collections, including Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, and Pudgy Rods. Additionally, 22.02% will be distributed to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% is designated for providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. In an official statement, the Pudgy Penguin team noted: “With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle”. How Can the Pudgy Tokens Succeed The launch of the PENGU token could be a pivotal moment for the Pudy Penguin ecosystem including the future of NFTs, blockchain games and meme coins. Despite the NFT market downturn, the platform stands out for its ability to attract public interest. Below are the three major advantages of launching PENGU on the Solana blockchain. Expanding ecosystem : Solana’s rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem, known for its scalability and increasing adoption in the DeFi sector, makes it a popular choice for token creation. Community-driven approach : By allocating a significant portion of tokens to Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token holders, the project seeks to deepen connections with its dedicated fanbase while attracting new participants. Cultural significance : Pudgy Penguins, as an established and recognizable brand, is well-positioned to promote Pengu beyond the crypto space, leveraging its broader appeal. Earlier this year in August, NFT marketplace Magic Eden also took a similar route by launching its own ME tokens as a measure to expand its crypto offerings. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token also facilitates cross-chain trading. Magic Eden said that it would integrate the ME tokens with third-party protocols and dApps.

While the reasons for this historic rise in the market continue to be discussed, Citigroup analysts said that Bitcoin exceeded $100,000 thanks to the positive regulatory environment and macroeconomic supports in the USA. Citigroup stated in a recent report that Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000 was due to the US elections and the appointment of cryptocurrency lover Paul Atkins as SEC chairman, Coindesk reported. At this point, analysts stated that the upward momentum that started after Donald Trump won the elections was supported by factors such as a positive macroeconomic environment and increasing spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Analysts led by Alex Saunders stated that the last upward move needed to break $ 100,000 was Trump's appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chairman, and said, “The nomination of cryptocurrency friend Paul Atkins as SEC chairman provided the final momentum that allowed Bitcoin to exceed $ 100,000 and reach record levels.” Analysts also noted in the report that there has been a decline in BTC dominance and said that altcoins other than Bitcoin could see greater gains due to regulatory relaxation. “A new regulatory framework that would come with Trump’s election could expand the use cases for cryptocurrencies and elevate Bitcoin’s position as an asset class. Altcoins other than Bitcoin will also benefit from this environment.” *This is not investment advice.

He said that although US stocks and crypto have experienced robust rallies, the asset classes are appearing frothy. After maintaining a pessimistic stance in 2023, the strategist chose a more neutral stance toward equities this year. The S&P 500 experienced a 27% increase in 2024 and is currently on course to achieve its best year since 2019. This has been attributed to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence and the belief that President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” policies would stimulate domestic markets. BofA’s Hartnett 2025 overshoot theory Hartnett said that the S&P 500 is at a significant risk of “overshoot” in early 2025 if it reaches 6,666 points, which is approximately 10% above its current level. There is currently no indication of exuberance among global investors, as indicated by the bank’s bull-and-bear indicator. According to reports, the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio increased to 5.3 times in 2024, which is on the brink of the 5.5 times it reached at the height of the technology bubble in March 2000. In a report published on November 28, Michael Hartnett said, “Invest in international stocks during the second quarter due to the aggressive easing of financial conditions overseas and the panic in Europe/Asia policy.” Comparison of cumulative inflow to equity funds decade-to-date between the US and the rest of the world. In addition, according to BofA, investors should acquire 10-year US Treasuries when yields reach 5%, as this level would result in volatility and risk-asset losses, a peak “inflation boom,” and innovative solutions to reduce the US budget deficit. Also, analysts at Bank of America suggest that investors seeking a contrarian investment in 2025 should invest in “BIG” – bonds, international equities, and gold. Hartnett agrees with this assertion. The current situation in the crypto industry Hartnett’s worries have substance, but they have not deterred progress in the crypto industry. Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond $100,000 has resulted in waves, with some tokens (especially memecoins) experiencing significant gains and others enduring precipitous declines. Gigachad (GIGA) is one of the victors, as it experienced a 36% increase in value following its listing on Coinbase and Kucoin. GIGA’s price increased from $0.04146 to $0.06555; however, it has encountered resistance at approximately $0.050 since then. Turbo (TURBO) has also experienced growth, as its listing on Coinbase has contributed to its price increase. In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced increases of 6.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The value of the memecoin Keyboard Cat on Base (KEYCAT) increased by 21.8%, while the value of newer entries such as Ski Mask Dog (SKI) on the Base chain surged by 50.8%. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), however, experienced a 26.5% decline, while Moo Deng (MOODENG) experienced a substantial 19.5% decline. Other tokens, such as Fwog (FWOG) and Non-Playable Coin (NPC), also experienced losses, with a 9.4% and 13% decline, respectively. In addition, problems have arisen for specific tokens due to developer manipulation. The value of Flog the Frog (FLOG), a once-promising memecoin, experienced a significant decline after its developers sold their holdings, resulting in a collapse. List of cryptos with the highest gains and losses Hawk Tuah (HAWK) has encountered comparable challenges, as evidenced by its 92% decline in value subsequent to fraud claims surrounding its introduction. On the other hand, the US dollar weakened as mixed economic data shaped market sentiment, which may affect the stablecoins attached to it. This occurs in the context of a broader market shakeup, which has resulted in $570 million in liquidations since Bitcoin’s fleeting decline from $100,000 to $93.7K on December 5. Crypto optimists say otherwise ARK Invest, a firm known for its positive views on Bitcoin, predicts a minimum year-end price of $124,000, based on a performance multiple of 2.48x to 2.94x. Their analysis identifies increased institutional interest and proposes that Bitcoin might be considered for US strategic reserves, which they believe would dramatically increase its market value. Jelle, a well-known analyst, indicated a bullish pennant breakthrough and set a goal of $130,000. Another trader, Aksel Kibar, cited $137,000 as Bitcoin’s next key resistance level, claiming that $100,000 is not a psychologically or technically significant price point. Kalshi’s analysis also shows a 10% chance of Bitcoin reaching $150,000. However, more ambitious predictions, such as Bitcoin reaching $250,000, are viewed skeptically, with Polymarket assigning only a 2% probability to this scenario.

On Friday, a renowned trader within the SHIB community revealed that the 1 CENT DREAM project strives to achieve the abovementioned endeavor. Simultaneously, crypto market traders and investors are eyeing huge gains in the dog-themed meme crypto’s price by this Christmas. Shiba Inu Coin’s Community Eyes 250M Token Burn By 1 CENT DREAM Project In an X post by SHIB Knight dated December 6, the crypto trader notified that the Shiba Inu coin’s community is preparing for a 250M token burn today. Notably, this token burn is to be conducted by the 1 CENT DREAM project. For context, the dog-themed meme crypto’s burn mechanism reduces the token’s circulating supply, bolstering market dynamics. It’s also noteworthy that CoinGape Media reported previously that the meme coin already witnessed massive SHIB burns , adding to bullishness surrounding future price movements. Notably, the bullish projections are primarily attributed to the law of supply and demand, reflecting price gains remain imminent with reducing supply. Simultaneously, a stockpile of other events has further paved a bullish path for the crypto, indicating strong gains by this Christmas. SHIB Price To $0.00005 By Year End? Despite the optimistic news, SHIB price cracked nearly 6% intraday and reached $0.00002996. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00002991 and $0.00003243, respectively. Nevertheless, weekly and monthly charts for the token showcased gains worth 19% and 58%, respectively. The broader momentum indicates an ongoing bull run for the meme coin amid a broader bullish Q4 crypto market. Simultaneously, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape Media flagged that a $0.00005458 price target for the meme coin looms by December 31. This bullish anticipation comes against the backdrop of highly optimistic market technicals, including a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD. Market watchers continue to monitor the coin for further gains in light of the abovementioned market dynamics. Additionally, the looming launch of the TREAT token , a revolutionary measure for Shibarium, has added to market optimism surrounding the dog-themed meme coin’s future. The crypto’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, pointed out the previous month that TREAT token launch lies shortly ahead. Should the new token launch this year-end, the Shiba Inu coin could see further significant upside momentum. Also, Kusama hinted that the SHIFU coin launch lies shortly ahead, adding a layer of intrigue to future price movements. Notably, SHIFU is a coin backed by SHIB developers. Crypto market participants continue to monitor the Ethereum-based meme token for further price shifts amid the latest ecosystem developments.

This move aims to address longstanding demands from the crypto sector for regulatory clarity, a factor that many believe has driven blockchain innovation and investment away from the US. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US,” Trump wrote. This aligns with the president-elect’s broader vision of transforming the US into the ”world capital of crypto,” a campaign promise that resonated strongly with tech-savvy voters and financial innovators. Beyond regulation, Trump’s campaign pledged to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and mine ”all the remaining Bitcoin” within the US, a strategy that could position America as a global leader in blockchain technology. Sacks’ responsibilities extend beyond crypto. He is tasked with leading efforts to safeguard online speech, a role Trump defined as steering the nation “away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” This mission, though somewhat unexplained in Trump’s post, aligns with Sacks’ prior critiques of centralized technology platforms and their influence on free expression. Additionally, Sacks will chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, signaling that his influence will span multiple dimensions of technological advancement. With his extensive background in technology and venture capital, Sacks brings a wealth of experience to these interconnected challenges. Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency marks a significant departure from traditional US policy toward digital assets. His plans include creating a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, potentially reversing the trend of enforcement-focused oversight seen under previous administrations. The announcement follows Trump’s campaign rhetoric, which included promises to solidify the US as a hub for blockchain innovation. This vision is likely to resonate with major stakeholders in the crypto industry, who have long sought clear guidelines to foster innovation within the nation’s borders. Trump’s latest move has already sparked heated debate within the crypto community. While many see this as a promising step toward regulatory clarity and growth, others remain skeptical of centralized intervention in what has traditionally been a decentralized ecosystem. Critics argue that combining cryptocurrency with AI under a centralized ”Czar” raises concerns about government overreach and potential unintended consequences. Moreover, Trump’s call for ”all the remaining Bitcoin” to be mined domestically has drawn skepticism, as mining resources are globally distributed and reliant on free-market mechanisms. The Stakes for US Competitiveness By placing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency at the forefront of his administration’s policy agenda, Trump aims to position the US as a global leader in these cutting-edge industries. In his Truth Social post, Trump described these areas as critical to the nation’s future competitiveness, a statement that shows his administration’s focus on leveraging emerging technologies to boost economic growth and strategic security. Sacks, known for his investments in tech startups and his outspoken views on free speech, seems poised to bring a blend of innovation and advocacy to the role. However, his ability to navigate the complex and often contentious intersection of policy, technology, and finance will be tested in the months to come. Trump’s decision to appoint David Sacks as White House A.I. & Crypto Czar represents a defining moment in US policy, with significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and online freedom. While the road ahead is fraught with challenges, the administration’s commitment to positioning the US as a leader in these transformative industries is clear. As the nation prepares for Trump’s presidency, all eyes will be on Sacks and his ability to deliver on these ambitious promises. Crypto Industry Reacts Positively to Paul Atkins as Trump’s SEC Chair Pick The cryptocurrency industry in the United States is voicing cautious optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The announcement has ignited discussions across the crypto landscape, as executives, legal experts, and blockchain advocates assess what the new leadership might mean for the sector. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who served from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush, is widely regarded as a pragmatic regulator with a business-friendly approach. If confirmed, his appointment could mark a significant shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, potentially moving away from enforcement-led actions under the current chair, Gary Gensler. Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise Asset Management, described Atkins as a “great choice” for the SEC’s top job. Speaking in a Dec. 5 interview with Bloomberg, Dowling expressed optimism about Atkins’ ability to foster collaboration between regulators and lawmakers. “We’re very much looking forward to a person who can come in, hit the ground running, work with the other commissioners, and hopefully also have a dialogue with the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and with lawmakers so in the new Congress we can get some clarity, we can get some forward motion: stablecoin bill, market structure,” said Dowling. Her remarks echo widespread calls from the crypto industry for regulatory clarity. Many believe Atkins’ leadership could usher in a more constructive relationship between the SEC, Congress, and other regulatory bodies, paving the way for legislative progress on critical issues like stablecoins and market structure. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal were among the prominent crypto executives to endorse Trump’s pick. Garlinghouse, whose company has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the SEC since 2020, praised Atkins for his potential to restore “common sense” to the agency. Ripple has long criticized the SEC’s litigation-focused approach, arguing that it stifles innovation and lacks clear guidance for crypto firms. “Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC will bring common sense back to the agency,” Garlinghouse wrote in a Dec. 4 post on X. Coinbase, another major target of the SEC under Gensler’s tenure, also welcomed the news. Grewal called Atkins’ appointment “sorely needed,” noting that the SEC’s current enforcement-first strategy has left the crypto industry in a state of uncertainty. Coinbase has been fighting a lawsuit filed by the SEC in June 2023, which alleges that the exchange offered unregistered securities. The Ripple Effect on Regulation Atkins’ tenure at the SEC predates the rise of cryptocurrencies, but his track record suggests he could bring a more balanced approach to the regulatory landscape. In a February 2023 interview, Atkins advocated for a regulatory framework that is “more accommodating” to crypto firms, emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Ripple’s ongoing case with the SEC, which resulted in a $125 million judgment against the company in August, could be a litmus test for Atkins’ leadership. The case remains in flux as the SEC appeals portions of the ruling, leaving the crypto industry eager to see how the new chair might influence its resolution. Despite the warm reception from many in the crypto space, Atkins’ path to confirmation is not without obstacles. The US Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority starting in 2025, will need to approve his nomination. While Atkins enjoys support from key figures in the industry, some lawmakers may raise concerns about his ties to crypto advocacy groups and his perceived leniency toward the sector. As the CEO of Patomak Global Partners and a member of the Digital Chamber of Commerce’s advisory board, Atkins has been actively engaged with the blockchain and crypto industries. However, his specific stance on issues like initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoin regulation remains unclear. For years, crypto advocates have criticized the SEC’s lack of clear rules, accusing the agency of regulating by enforcement rather than through transparent guidelines. Atkins’ potential leadership offers a chance to reset this dynamic. Many in the industry hope his tenure will prioritize collaboration and provide a roadmap for sustainable growth in the US crypto market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 13:25:27

The $20 million fund isn’t the first venture by Bitget into the burgeoning TON ecosystem. On June 25, Bitget Wallet launched a comprehensive support package for the TON network. The initiative was intended to connect decentralized applications within the TON ecosystem and further solidify Bitget’s presence in the rapidly expanding landscape. In addition to the wallet launch, Bitget had previously introduced the Telegram Signal Bot to streamline direct trading signals across various trading communities, enhancing trading efficiency and convenience.

Gensler, who was widely criticized by crypto investors during his tenure, will leave just days before a major decision in the SEC’s ongoing legal battle with Ripple , set for January 25, 2025. What Gary Gensler’s Departure Means for the SEC’s Ripple Lawsuit However, despite Gensler’s departure, the future of the SEC’s approach to crypto remains uncertain. Bill Morgan , an attorney closely following the case, pointed out that the SEC’s new chief litigation counsel, Jorge Tenreiro, is deeply involved in the Ripple litigation. Tenreiro, who will be the key lawyer in the SEC v. Ripple case, may continue in this role even after the confirmation of the new SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins. Morgan expressed skepticism about any significant shift in the SEC’s stance on crypto if Tenreiro remains in charge of the litigation. Morgan warned against assuming that the SEC’s decision not to file its brief in the Ripple case by January 15, 2025, signals a change in approach. He said that Tenreiro would still be handling it. Morgan wrote, “If Tenreiro stays in the new role it will not signal a big change in SEC enforcement policy towards crypto. Even if there is a change the SEC v Ripple Appeal may continue.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is XRP Dropping?

A forming technical chart points to a potential 60% jump, a view that is supported by the ongoing Terra Classic token burn. LUNC Price Is Forming Bullish Patterns Terra Classic price was trading at $0.0001620 on Friday, a 193% surge from its lowest point this year. There are odds that the coin will continue rising in the next few weeks as it is forming several bullish patterns. LUNC formed a golden cross pattern on November 18 as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) flipped each other. Historically, this cross has been one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. For example, Terra Classic formed this cross in October last year when it was trading at $0.00013. It then jumped to the year-to-date high at $0.0002795, a 125% surge. Most importantly, there are early signs that Terra is slowly forming a cup and handle (C&H) pattern whose higher side is at $0.0002795. A C&H often takes months or even years to form and is one of the most popular bullish signs. It has a horizontal line and a rounded bottom. Therefore, in this case, it means that the coin may jump by about 60% to get to the year-to-date high of $0.0002795. For that to happen, it will need to cross the important resistance point at $0.0002546, its highest level in March this year. LUNA is also slowly forming what seems like a bullish flag or a pennant. These continuation patterns have a vertical line and some consolidation. In this case, more upside will be confirmed if it rises above this week’s high of $0.0001794. LUNC Price Chart Terra Classic (LUNC) Boosted By Token Burns A key fundamental catalyst for the LUNC price is the ongoing token burn. A burn happens when cryptocurrencies are removed from circulation by being sent in an inaccessible address. In Terra’s case, over 393 billion tokens representing 84% of the total have been burned since its inception. 2.36 billions of these tokens were burned in the past seven days. This trend may continue for a long time. Terra Classic price may also jump because of an upcoming upgrade to its network . The new upgrade will mainly focus on simplifying the tax handling for the network. Most importantly, it will also let developers on Cosmos build on the Terra Classic network.

The milestone event has allowed the first cryptocurrency to achieve a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, underscoring its importance as the most coveted and valuable investment asset in history, surpassing even gold. The rise in capitalization came on a protracted wave of Bitcoin’s gradual appreciation, which started sharply on November 6 after the announcement of the results of the presidential elections in the United States, which saw crypto-friendly candidate Donald Trump take the lead. Bitcoin then started its sharp appreciation, jumping from $68,000 to over $75,000 in mere hours. Underpinning Reasons The appreciation of Bitcoin to over $100,000 followed shortly after president elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he had decided to nominate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as the new head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The choice of specialist to advice on cryptocurrency matters was lauded by the crypto community, since Atkins is a former federal regulator and is well known as an adviser of financial firms and cryptocurrency companies on legal matters pertaining to regulation “Paul Atkins was made for this job,” as legal chief Dan Gallagher of Robinhood Markets Inc. commented on Trump’s decision. The appointment followed a series of announcements made by leading US administration specialists regarding the nature of Bitcoin. The same day of Trump’s decision to appoint Atkins, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell made a statement on the status of Bitcoin as an investment tool: “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. It’s like gold, it’s just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or a store of value,” Powell stated. “It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold,” as he concluded. The appointment of Atkins marks a diametric shift in the US government’s stance on cryptocurrencies, considering the negative attitude the Biden administration had taken against digital assets. The outgoing administration had taken considerable action against both select cryptocurrencies and crypto firms, as well as their founders , paying particular scrutiny to their persons and operations with crypto. The new administration that Trump is assembling seems to be taking a proactive stance and is willing to embrace cryptocurrencies by partnering with the community of the industry instead. This step could be construed as a means of curbing illegal activities in the crypto sector through cooperation and collaboration, instead of enforcement and relying on legal crackdowns. In his earlier speeches during the election campaign, Trump had made numerous promises to ease crypto industry related regulation and attract companies from the sector to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” This step could lead to more crypto-friendly specialists being appointed to key roles in the incoming administration, especially regulatory authority posts. The deposition of Gary Gensler, a prominent opponent of crypto, in itself was enough to uplift investor sentiment in the crypto market. The euphoria reigning on the crypto market at present can be best described as a consequence of anticipated administration change in the US. The optimistic outlooks of investors could, however, be misplaced if Trump backs down on his promises upon stepping into office in January. Investors are thus advised to curb their enthusiasm and hedge risks accordingly to suit any possible scenario and formulate exit strategies. Companies closely related to cryptocurrencies, such as asset management firms and business software developers like MicroStrategy, have also welcomed Trump’s reshuffling of administration posts. This is especially true, considering that the company is known to be officially the largest Bitcoin holder in the United States as a publicly traded enterprise. The positive aspect is, however, more reserved for companies operating in United States Dollars, considering that Bitcoin has become inaccessible to most legal entities and individuals outside the US. The Risks While the market at large is celebrating Bitcoin’s milestone, there are risks involved and there is also regulation to take into account. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance may turn out to be a business venture, considering that he has recently established World Liberty Financial – a company made up of his family members intended as a platform for trading cryptocurrencies. With that in mind, crypto enthusiasts who have long lobbied for regulation change could find themselves overboard or lacking legitimacy. The current market situation could reverse at any moment, just as it had during the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw Bitcoin climb up to $69,000 in late 2021 just to plummet below $17,000 by late 2022 against the backdrop of the FTX exchange collapse. All crypto traders and experts stress the need for caution and selection of reliable business partners and platforms when operating with cryptocurrencies. Work with the Pros The new ATH of Bitcoin is a sure sign that a sharp rise in demand for crypto is inevitable market-wide. In order to stay ahead of the curb and catch the most profitable signals, it is imperative to work with the most reliable partners in the industry. Entering on the lows is the first principle of crypto trade as the foundation of the concept of “buy low, sell high”. ChangeNOW gives individuals the ideal exchange venue for making swaps at the lowest possible commissions with Bitcoin and over 1,200 other digital currencies. Any kind of operation from swaps to buy and sell is available on ChangeNOW via a convenient and all-in-one interface. Businesses accepting cryptocurrencies as means of payment from their clients using NOWPayments API will find it extremely profitable to have their operations routed through the service. Anything from 24/7 support in multiple languages to low commissions with instant processing will be available with the NOWPayments API for businesses. Companies considering the option of attracting crypto clients should turn to ChangeNOW and connect the NOWPayments service to fast-track their operations with cryptocurrencies and create an instant point-of-service. Takeaway As Bitcoin strives up the price charts, crypto market participants are rallying to reap the profits. It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will live up to his word and ease the administration’s stance on cryptocurrencies, but for now, his decision to appoint Atkins as head of the SEC is a step in the right direction that the market was hoping to witness. While the market overheats, both individuals and businesses will find no better partner on the market than ChangeNOW for all their crypto operation needs.

Specifically, it was named and inspired by a squirrel of the same name that animal control agents killed in a raid due to wild animal complaints. Given the social media popularity of the squirrel and its owner and the seemingly unjustifiably violent nature of the intervention, it became something of a poster child against regulatory and law enforcement overreach. Peanut’s role was further bolstered due to the political climate ahead of the 2024 presidential election, with some Trump voters practically adopting it as a symbol. One cryptocurrency trader seemingly entered a PNUT position at exactly the right moment – though the unusual size of the meme coin bet certainly raises some questions. The ballad of Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Specifically, the investor spent 2,717 Solana (SOL) – worth approximately $450,000 – on November 5 to purchase 16 million PNUT. At the time of the original trade, Peanut the Squirrel was changing hands at approximately $0.045. On December 6, the trader finally moved his meme coin to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance in order to cash in on the non-trivial return, estimated at 1,772% by the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. Indeed, as PNUT is trading at about $1.34 at press time, the fortunate investor turned $450,000 into almost $8 million with a combination – at the very least – of great timing and luck . PNUT 30-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Of bulls, squirrels, and bears Though the Peanut the Squirrel trade is certainly remarkable, it is merely one of the many such meme coin maneuvers executed during the 2024 bull market . For example, early in December, another trader made an even more remarkable investment as they, also in about a month, turned $169 worth of Solana into $435,000 by investing in a Leonardo da Vinci-inspired token called Salvator Mundi (MUNDI). A November 25 FRIC (FRIC) trade was even more incredible as it saw one cryptocurrency market investor turn $6,300 into $1.5 million – a 23,378% return – within just one hour. Still, for all the meme coin trader successes, it is always worth remembering that stellar successes become known far more frequently than ruinous failures with the extraordinary risks being highlighted by a recent BInance study showcasing that 97% of all such coins and tokens ever created ‘have died.’ Featured image via Shutterstock The post Crypto trader turns $450K into $8M in a month appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|cryptocurrency|meme coins|Peanut the Squirrel|Pnut,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2024-12-06 13:43:53

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.01 by the end of 2027. By 2030, XTZ’s price may surge to $18.90. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles causing a loss in investor trust. Eventually, under the effects of the overall market, its price plummeted, and the coin has failed to recover up to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network bringing it in close competition to other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded in the same manner, hitting a high of $1.85. As the current market sentiments are largely bullish, many crypto enthusiasts are asking questions like, “Can Tezos token hit $100 in the long-term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.633 Market cap $1,675,192,868.75 Trading volume $187,877,666.56 Circulating supply 1,016,928,909.87 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.62 24-hour high $1.75 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $1.649 (-2.20%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 32.78% 50-day SMA $0.9095 14-Day RSI 74.48 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 20/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $0.839 Tezos price analysis: XTZ consolidates after hitting a high of $1.855 TL; DR Breakdown XTZ/USD support is present at $1.593. XTZ could drop below its support level if the bears take control of the market. Immediate resistance for XTZ/USD is present at $1.855. XTZ price analysis for December 6 confirms that the market is on an uptrend but with a possible price reversal looming. The token has seen a 28% price jump over the past 7 days and 154.99% over the past month. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to remain above support at $1.593? The 1-day Tezos (XTZ/USDT) chart shows strong bullish momentum, with the price consolidating at $1.633 after hitting a recent high of $1.855. The 50-day SMA at $1.593 provides solid support, signaling continued upward strength. XTZ to remain above support at $1.593? The RSI is at 70.60, indicating overbought conditions and suggesting a possible short-term pullback or consolidation. The MACD remains bullish, with the MACD line above the signal line, though the weakening histogram hints at slowing momentum. A breakout above $1.752 could fuel further gains, while a drop below $1.593 might lead to a brief correction. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Sellers take control of the market in the short-term The 4-hour XTZ/USDT chart analysis shows consolidation within a symmetrical triangle, with higher lows (HL) and lower highs (LH). The price is currently $1.616, down 2.42%, as the market tests the balance between buyers and sellers. Sellers take control of the XTZ market in the short-term The rising trendline of higher lows indicates underlying bullish support, while resistance from lower highs limits upward movement. A breakout above $1.70 could spark bullish momentum, while a break below $1.60 may lead to further declines. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.61 suggests sellers are in control for now, aligning with the recent pullback. However, strong support near $1.60 could prevent significant downside unless it’s broken. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 1.368 BUY SMA 5 $ 1.477 BUY SMA 10 $ 1.418 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.248 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.909 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.790 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.839 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 1.189 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.038 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.884 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.784 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.727 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.733 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.793 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is at a critical juncture, with its price movement confined within a symmetrical triangle. The next major price action will depend on whether it breaks above resistance or falls below support. If XTZ breaks upward, it could target the $1.85–$2.00 range, signaling a continuation of its bullish trend. On the other hand, if it drops below the key $1.60 support level, the price could retreat to around $1.50 or lower. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Yes, Tezos could be a good investment as it is currently on a dip, and the prospects look good. Once the bull market returns in full swing, Tezos’ price will likely soar upwards. The platform itself is quite developed, supporting DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Although a slight decrease of about 2.4% in 24 hours, Tezos has experienced a significant upward trend in recent weeks, with its value surging by 85% in the past month. The recent surge can be attributed to the overall positive market sentiments that saw BTC hit $103k, and strategic partnerships and project rollouts in the Tezos ecosystem. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that we can see XTZ hitting $2 by the end of this year. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was at $9.18, and significant bullish momentum will be required to break through this level. At that point, we will see old investors cutting their losses and new investors taking profits aggressively. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 by 2030. To get to that point, it will require a huge market cap. It is certainly possible if mass adoption happens and Tezos gets integrated with new systems. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Yes, Tezos seems to have a good long-term future due to the fact that the platform regularly brings updates and development is still ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance, and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018, and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it reached above $9.0. After 4th April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0 and by the 9th of May, its price had sharply fallen below the $2 mark.

In October, Tezos hit a peak price of $0.7173, and in November, the coin hit a peak price of $1.856.

However, its journey beyond the milestone was brief, as the cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash to below $92,000. The recovery was swift, with Bitcoin currently trading near $98,000. Data from CryptoQuant suggest that the rally is supported by decreasing BTC supply on exchanges and sustained demand, indicating the current uptrend could be sustainable. Bitcoin Outflow From Exchanges According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , there is a significant trend in Bitcoin exchange netflows, signaling potential bullish momentum in the market. Negative flows, indicating more Bitcoin leaving exchanges than entering, have intensified since late October, suggesting that whales are transferring their holdings to long-term storage. This movement reduces the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, easing selling pressure and creating conditions for price appreciation. The trend aligns with Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond the $100,000 mark, supported by decreasing exchange supply and sustained demand. However, CryptoQuant cautions that as prices approach higher levels, profit-taking could introduce short-term volatility. For long-term investors, the shrinking supply paired with steady demand strengthens the case for further gains. Retail Demand for Bitcoin There has also been a surge in retail investor demand for Bitcoin, with the 30-day demand change reaching its highest level since 2020. CryptoQuant said that this heightened retail interest has boosted ongoing market demand, even as some long-term holders begin taking profits. Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top, but it also reflects growing market engagement. Bitcoin’s sideways trading phase suggested that retail demand could taper off gradually, though a breakthrough past the $100,000 level is now expected to reignite enthusiasm and potentially drive a euphoric market phase. “Monitoring the interplay between retail and institutional activity during this phase will be crucial, as strong retail participation often signals heightened market optimism, while institutional interest provides the foundation for sustained momentum.” The post Bitcoin Leaves Exchanges as Retail Demand Surges Despite Profit-Taking appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-06 13:52:47

(COIN). Coinbase's hired help, History Associates Inc., had taken the FDIC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to court in June and finally won access to certain internal FDIC communications. The heavily-redacted documents emerged on Friday, showing the banking regulator slamming the brakes on lenders offering or considering products and services in the digital assets sector. ""We respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity,"" the regulator wrote in one of the 23 letters shared by the crypto exchange. ""The FDIC will notify all FDIC-supervised banks at a later date when a determination has been made on the supervisory expectations for engaging in crypto asset-related activity."" The industry has long complained that it's been under a banking crisis in which companies and leading crypto figures are blocked from U.S. bank services. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal argued that these letters represent hard evidence that crypto businesses were systematically walled off from banking by the regulator. ""The letters show that this was no conspiracy theory at all, that this was not just rank speculation or the musings of a paranoid industry,"" Grewal said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""There was a concerted plan on the part of the FDIC that they carried out — without any reluctance — to deny banking services to a legal American industry. That should give everyone great pause."" Read More: Citibank Debanked Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse Due to Crypto, Exec Says Though much of the text of the FDIC letters is blacked out and the specific institutions aren't identified, the communications dated throughout 2022 make it clear that the various crypto activities bankers submitted for FDIC approval wouldn't be moving forward until the banks could answer questions on how they would meet compliance demands, which didn't yet seem fleshed out. In some cases, the activity was stopped before it started, and in others, the agency seemed to caution against any further expansion or was asking a bank to halt a line of business until the agency could finish reviewing the firm's request. ""We expect you to satisfactorily address these and any subsequent questions (in advance of implementation) to ensure the bank of operating in a safe and sound manner,"" read a typical example. Some of the confidential letters included dozens of highly complex and demanding questions posed to the banks. But many of the documents also indicated the agency wasn't yet sure what regulatory filings would even be required before it could green-light crypto business. While the three primary banking regulators in the U.S. — also including the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — have issued some broad cautionary guidance about crypto, the agencies haven't instituted a formal set of rules regulating the sector. An FDIC spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the letters sent after hours on Thursday. Grewal said the next step in federal court will be to request that the letters be cleared of the redactions, revealing the institutions, the services they sought to offer and all the questions they were asked. That will get to the ""why"" behind the FDIC's stance, he said. ""Even after federal courts ordered the FDIC to produce this information over and over again, they continue to drag their feet, and we think it's time that they stop,"" Grewal said. The debanking campaign has been known in the industry as Operation Chokepoint 2.0 after a previous government effort to sever controversial but legal businesses from banking. The topic arose again in Congress this week during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, where crypto business leaders testified that their companies had been cut off from financial services. ""We've also been debanked,"" said Nathan McCauley, the CEO of Anchorage Digital, a bank federally chartered in the U.S. by the OCC. ""It's particularly surprising, because we ourselves are a national bank.""",Policy|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|Martin Gruenberg|Coinbase|banking|Court Cases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-06 13:56:34

Ripple’s XRP is leading the charge with a hot rally, and Kaspa’s scalable technology is turning heads. But positioned as the freshest DeFi project on the block, 1FUEL’s presale offers early movers a chance to secure high-reward potential. As demand for privacy and usability skyrockets, this next-gen secure crypto wallet could be the spark that ignites the next wave of crypto adoption. Ripple Is On A Wild Run, Can Xrp Break Ath? Now sitting as the third-largest crypto with a massive $152.2 billion market cap (at the time of writing), XRP’s leapfrogged big names like Solana and Binance Coin. A big shift in Washington, D.C. Trump’s win has crypto enthusiasts buzzing about a more favorable regulatory environment, and it’s giving Ripple Labs a much-needed boost as they edge closer to resolving their long-running SEC battle. Investors are piling in, with over $120 billion in fresh cash boosting XRP’s momentum. Weekly active addresses have shot up nearly 200%, showing the network is buzzing with activity. Add in the hype around Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch, and it’s no wonder XRP could soon smash through the $3 mark, putting a new ATH within reach. Kaspa’s Tech Is Blockchain Efficiency At Its Finest Kaspa (KAS) might not be grabbing XRP-level headlines, but its blockDAG architecture delivers blazing 1-second block times, putting it miles ahead in speed and scalability.

Strong support above its 20-day moving average and a steady increase in trading volumes signal growing buyer confidence. If Kaspa breaks through its $0.17 resistance, it could be primed for another big run.

Meanwhile, major firms like BlackRock, MARA Holdings and MicroStrategy are doubling down on Bitcoin accumulation. BlackRock added 7,750 BTC via its ETF and MicroStrategy reported more than $17 billion in unrealized Bitcoin profits after its jump past $100K. Additionally, Trump's nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair attracted a lot of praise from crypto leaders, who see it as a very positive development for the crypto industry. Lawrence Summers Questions Logic of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Former United States Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers strongly criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Summers even called it “crazy” and a political maneuver that is aimed at pleasing crypto campaign donors. On Bloomberg TV on Dec. 6, Summers dismissed the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve as impractical, and questioned the rationale behind the government holding a ”sterile inventory” of Bitcoin. He also argued that while reserves of commodities like oil and gold actually have historical and practical significance, accumulating Bitcoin lacks a compelling justification. Summers on Bloomberg TV (Source: YouTube ) Summers suggested that the concept is primarily driven by political interests, and stated that this move will serve as a way to pander to wealthy crypto donors. Trump previously suggested that the U.S. government should hold on to the approximately 198,000 BTC it seized , which is worth more than $19 billion. Some Trump-aligned Republicans, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, are also advocating for legislation that will see the government buy and hold 1 million BTC for at least twenty years. U.S. government Bitcoin holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) While Summers dismissed the notion of a Bitcoin reserve, he did acknowledge that some of Trump’s broader comments on crypto regulation have merit. He agreed that financial innovation should be supported and suggested that regulatory overreach may have stifled crypto’s potential. Summers served as Treasury Secretary from 1999 to 2001, and advised crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group in 2016. Supporters of Lummis’ Bitcoin reserve proposal argue it could be a tool to address the nation’s over $36 trillion debt. However, critics like Avik Roy, the president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, warned against overestimating Bitcoin’s role in dealing with fiscal challenges. At a recent crypto summit , Roy stated that while a Bitcoin reserve might have some benefits, it does not address the underlying issue of federal deficits. Major Players Scoop up More Bitcoin The crypto industry certainly has a lot more faith in Bitcoin than Lawrence Summers. Bitcoin-stacking activities surged after major firms and a crypto whale took advantage of the crypto’s recent price drop to $92,957 on Dec. 5. Leading the purchases was BlackRock, which bought 7,750 Bitcoin through its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This brought BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to $46 billion. Thomas Fahrer, the founder of Apollo, even called BlackRock’s ETF the “ fastest growing ETF ever .” Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings also bought 1,423 Bitcoin worth $139.5 million across multiple transactions. The acquisitions happened after the closing of the company’s second $850 million convertible note offering , which MARA earmarked for Bitcoin accumulation. With these purchases, MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings rose to 22,108 Bitcoin, worth $2.17 billion. This is a 162% increase compared to last month. An anonymous crypto whale also took advantage of the price dip by purchasing 600 Bitcoin worth close to $58.9 million. Blockchain data revealed that the whale’s wallet address became active just a few weeks earlier. Its first transaction was recorded on Nov. 24. Additionally, health-tech firm Semler Scientific joined the Bitcoin-stacking trend, and bought 303 Bitcoin on Dec. 4 at an average price of $96,779. The purchases were made just hours before Bitcoin’s price surpassed the $100,000 mark. This brought Semler’s holdings to 1,873 Bitcoin, valued at $182.8 million. Public firms collectively hold about 527,026 Bitcoin, which is 2.66% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Governments hold 2,856 Bitcoin, while asset management firms and private companies hold 1,253 Bitcoin and 410,418 Bitcoin, respectively. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Profits Soar MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy resulted in over $17 billion in unrealized profits, according to data from MSTR Tracker . Since 2020, the company purchased more than $23 billion worth of Bitcoin under the guidance of founder Michael Saylor. After Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 per coin for the first time on Dec. 4, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings swelled to a value of more than $40 billion. MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR tracker ) The company’s strategy not only paid off in cryptocurrency gains but also propelled its stock to exceptional heights. MicroStrategy’s shares surged more than 463% year-to-date, outpacing almost every stock in the S&P 500. As of Dec. 5, the company had a market cap of close to $90 billion, which is more than double the value of its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy share price YTD (Source: Google Finance ) Analysts predict that the stock could continue to grow due to its accelerating Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Benchmark fintech analyst Mark Palmer recently raised his price target for MicroStrategy’s shares from $450 to $650, though the stock currently trades around $386. After its success, MicroStrategy is still committed to its bold approach, and introduced Bitcoin yield as a new performance metric to measure the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares. In October, the company also announced its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” to raise $42 billion through equity and debt to fund a three-year Bitcoin purchasing campaign. Ripple and Coinbase Praise Trump’s SEC Chair Choice Bitcoin could receive an extra price boost after crypto executives in the United States shared their support for President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the SEC. Former SEC commissioner Atkins, who served under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008, is considered by many in the crypto industry as a very favorable choice, and could signal a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach under current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Bitwise Asset Management general counsel Katherine Dowling called Atkins a “great choice” during a Bloomberg interview , and suggested that he could encourage better collaboration with lawmakers and other regulatory bodies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse welcomed the prospect of Atkins leading the SEC, and stated it will bring ”common sense” back to the agency. Ripple has been at odds with the SEC since a 2020 lawsuit alleged the company used XRP as an unregistered security. Despite a recent $125 million judgment against Ripple, the case is still ongoing. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also praised Atkins, and described his potential appointment as ”sorely needed” for an agency that has faced criticism for its approach to regulating digital assets. Coinbase is also currently battling an SEC lawsuit over alleged unregistered securities. Atkins has ties to the blockchain advocacy group Digital Chamber as well as crypto industry players, and previously suggested the SEC adopt a more accommodating stance toward digital assets to encourage industry growth in the U.S. If nominated, Atkins will require Senate confirmation, where the slim Republican majority could play a pivotal role in his approval.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 14:00:00

According to a video by Braiins mining’s Chief of Propaganda, Kristian Csepcsar, the Czech Republic Parliament has unanimously agreed to exempt capital gains tax on Bitcoin ( BTC ) held for more than three years. Previously, capital gains that came from owning Bitcoin was subject to a 21% corporate income tax. Not only that, the parliament has also agreed on a set of new laws that would serve to benefit Bitcoin holders in the long-run. One of the laws passed by parliament includes giving Bitcoin-related businesses the right to open up a bank account. Oftentimes traditional finance institutions would choose not to invest or offer services to crypto firms for fear of losing support, as seen in the U.S. with Operation Chokepoint 2.0 which led to numerous crypto-related banks going bankrupt. “Local Bitcoin businesses have the right to a bank account. Banks can no longer discriminate against them by closing their accounts for no reason,” said Csepcsar, who is based in Prague, Czech Republic’s capital city. The Czech Republic actively promotes HODLing by cancelling capital gains tax on #Bitcoin held for longer than 3 years in a unanimous vote! @BraiinsMining Chief of Propaganda @KristianCsep has the details ⬇️ https://t.co/YXUzcDBbbn — BTC Prague (@BTCPrague) December 6, 2024 Another major milestone mentioned by Csepcsar in the video, is the fact that now the Czech Republic has legal clarity when it comes to the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations or MiCA , which applies to all regions under the European Union . MiCA is a regulatory framework that clarifies and uniformly regulates the cryptocurrency market. It defines digital asset classification and specifies laws and areas of responsibility for their implementation. Crypto and stablecoin firms are expected to fully comply with the new MiCA laws by Dec. 30. Aside from the Czech Republic, a number of other countries have also declared zero personal income and capital gains tax on crypto gains over the years, including United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Switzerland among others. On the other hand, French regulators are considering a proposal that would tax unrealized capital gains for cryptocurrencies, potentially altering how assets like Bitcoin are taxed.

Particularly, the cryptocurrency is now trading between crucial Fibonacci levels that could be correcting for a while longer. With the aid of these Fibonacci levels, crypto analyst Dark Defender shared insights on social media platform X, highlighting the $2.13 and $2.92 price ranges as pivotal for the XRP price. XRP Tests Fibonacci Levels Amid Market Correction According to the XRP chart below, which was first highlighted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Dark Defender, the XRP price rally earlier in the month saw it peaking around $2.92 on crypto exchange Binance, which also aligned with the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level. This impressive high, however, was short-lived as the token faced a correction that brought its price down to a support at $2.17. Notably, this support is also just above the 161.80% Fibonacci extension level at $2.13, which is now a critical point for the XRP price going forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $100,000: Road To More Gains Or Potential Bull Trap? Analyst Has Answers With this in mind, Dark Defender noted that both $2.92 and $2.17 are the most important price levels to watch right now. The rebound from $2.17 suggests that the correction may be bottoming out, with his analysis pointing to a transition into Wave B in the daily time frame. What To Expect During Wave B Speaking of Wave B, this analysis is based off of a three-corrective-wave pattern. This pattern, comprising three distinct phases, Waves A, B, and C, has played out repeatedly during XRP’s price rally. Within this structure, Waves A and C represent downward trends, while Wave B reflects an upward move. If this corrective model were to repeat itself, the XRP price could experience a climb to $2.92, corresponding to the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level, before another downward trend potentially leads it back to retest support at $2.13, the 161.80% Fibonacci extension level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally As Dark Defender noted, it might take a couple of days to get rid of this structure. This means that the XRP price could continue to trade between these levels before any decisive move either upwards or downwards. Recent market factors suggest a break to the upside, which would send the XRP price on a resumption of breaking into new multi-year highs. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $2.37, having increased by 2.9% in the past 24 hours. One factor contributing to this optimism is the nomination of Paul Atkins by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the SEC. Atkins is widely regarded as crypto-friendly, and his potential leadership could mark the end of the longstanding SEC-Ripple legal feud. Such a resolution would likely invite significant institutional and retail inflows into the XRP ecosystem.

This decline has investors worried, and there is concern about whether there will be further declines. At this point, famous Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor said that an 80% collapse in Bitcoin is unlikely. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor addressed his personal Bitcoin purchases in an interview with Yahoo Finance, stating that he does not expect a major crash in the BTC price. Saylor, who admitted that an 80% collapse in Bitcoin is theoretically possible, stated that he believes this will not happen in practice. While Bitcoin has seen pullbacks, Saylor said he does not believe BTC will experience a major correction in 2022 like the previous cycle, when it fell 80% from $66,000 to $16,000. “For a drop like this to happen, there would have to be a bunch of very poorly capitalized companies like FTX, Genesis, Celsius and BlockFi that would go bankrupt. But right now, there are no such companies in the market, and it seems very unlikely that this scenario will happen again,” Saylor said. Saylor also noted that Bitcoin’s high volatility has not hindered his company’s regular BTC purchase strategy, which he funds by issuing MSTR shares. Saylor said that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-based return has brought in $12.3 billion in profit this year, making MicroStrategy the most profitable, fastest-growing company in the Bitcoin standard. *This is not investment advice.

He proposed Vancouver explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset to diversify its financial reserves and protect the city’s purchasing power. His proposal will be reviewed by the Vancouver City Council on December 11. Sim’s motion, “Preserving the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves – Becoming a Bitcoin Friendly City,” is being pitched as a forward-thinking move in an economy he says is riddled with uncertainty. During a council meeting , Sim made his case loud and clear. He told council members that Bitcoin’s performance over the past 16 years can’t be ignored. “It would be irresponsible for the City of Vancouver to not look at the merits of adding Bitcoin to the City’s strategic assets,” Sim said. The mayor has called Bitcoin “the greatest invention in human history” and suggested that other cities should be paying attention to what Vancouver is trying to do. Bitcoin’s place in Vancouver’s future The proposal focuses on hedging against inflation and ensuring financial resilience. Bitcoin’s limited supply, capped at 21 million coins, gives it an edge over traditional currencies, which can be printed endlessly. Sim argued that Bitcoin offers a unique shield against the erosion of purchasing power in an economy where inflation is a constant threat. The motion is about more than just inflation, though. Diversification is a key element of Sim’s strategy. The mayor wants to reduce Vancouver’s reliance on traditional financial assets, which he says are vulnerable to economic shocks. Not everyone shares Sim’s optimism. The idea of using Bitcoin as a municipal reserve asset has raised eyebrows. Bitcoin’s volatility is one of the most obvious concerns. Its price has seen dramatic swings, including an 80% drop between November 2021 and November 2022. Critics argue that this unpredictability makes it a risky choice for a city’s financial foundation. Another sticking point is Bitcoin’s lack of intrinsic value. Unlike gold, which has been a reliable store of value for centuries, Bitcoin is entirely digital and has no physical backing. Economists have questioned whether Bitcoin can truly be a stable asset in the long term, pointing out that its value is largely speculative and doesn’t have the same industrial or historical backing as gold. Liquidity is another concern. Reserve assets are supposed to be liquid and accessible during emergencies. Bitcoin’s design doesn’t align with this purpose. Its value often depends on long-term holding rather than short-term liquidity. Critics argue that this makes it unsuitable as a financial safety net for municipalities.

Now, 1FUEL (OFT) is being hailed as the next big thing, with market strategists calling its $0.01 presale a golden opportunity. 1FUEL is setting itself apart with its powerful mix of privacy, seamless functionality, and earning potential, positioning itself as a game-changer in the DeFi landscape. Could this be your chance to catch the next Dogecoin-level rocket? Let’s find out. Is the meme king ready to reclaim the throne? South Korea’s crypto market exploded, with trading volumes blowing past its stock market inflows of $385 million. Veteran tokens like Dogecoin are back in the spotlight. Once dismissed as a playful meme coin, DOGE has roared back, posting a staggering $60.8 billion market cap and attracting major whale action with $102 million in transfers. But it’s not just whales circling; Dogecoin’s network is buzzing with record-breaking activity, tallying 9.23 million active addresses. And let’s not overlook November, when DOGE’s transaction volume soared to over $10 billion daily before leveling off to a still-impressive $2.44 billion in December. DOGE technical patterns hint at a rally against Bitcoin, rekindling excitement among retail investors. Could this be the start of another epic Dogecoin run? 1FUEL presale: Is this the next DOGE? If Dogecoin’s meteoric rise proves anything, it’s that the right mix of accessibility, hype, and community power can create life-changing returns. Now, 1FUEL (OFT) is taking that blueprint and upgrading it for the DeFi age. This next-gen crypto wallet is designed to streamline digital asset management. 1FUEL simplifies cross-chain crypto transactions with a single click, making it a game-changer as multi-chain ecosystems become the norm. 1Fuel is building a P2P exchange that lets you trade directly with others without worrying about middlemen or sketchy platforms. Add a privacy mixer and cutting-edge cold storage for crypto, and you’ve got a fortress for your assets. It’s a solution tailor-made for an era where privacy is gold, and scrutiny is the new norm. But it goes beyond a regular exchange: passive income. Combine crypto staking rewards up to 10% APR, and the skyrocketing DeFi adoption, projected to hit $232 billion by 2030, and you’ve got a secure crypto wallet built for the future. What ties it all together is the presale. Early supporters get in at $0.01 with perks like bonuses and exclusive features. With 36% of tokens allocated to presale and a roadmap geared toward development and marketing, it’s clear why 1FUEL’s privacy-focused cryptocurrency is the project market strategists are betting on. The bottom line If you missed out on Dogecoin’s 2021 breakout, here’s your second chance to catch lightning in a bottle. 1FUEL (OFT) brings the same potential for explosive growth but with a DeFi edge that could take it even further with privacy-first tech, one-click cross-chain transactions, and staking rewards that let your investment earn while you hold. The $0.01 presale stage is rapidly selling out, and this might just be the lowest price 1FUEL will ever see. Learn more about 1FUEL.

Insights From Leading Analysts,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-bitcoin-reached-its-cycle-top-insights-from-leading-analysts/,"Bitcoin experienced extreme volatility yesterday after reaching a new all-time high of $104,088 on Wednesday. What followed was a textbook “Darth Maul” candle on the daily chart, as BTC plummeted from $103,550 to as low as $90,500 before stabilizing. While some observers initially read the move as a harsh rejection at the psychologically significant $100,000 level, leading analysts suggest this could represent a routine market flush-out rather than a cyclical peak. Could This Be The Bitcoin Cycle Top? Traders and analysts on X present a unified narrative: the abrupt spike and subsequent plunge were likely orchestrated by large players capitalizing on high-leverage traders. Veteran trader IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) stated, “Bitcoin – Classic Darth Maul. Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think we’ve seen an asset top with that kind of candle. Usually that’s the punish late longers, trap the shorters, and send it higher candle.” Another crypto analyst known as Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) added, “It’s just whales using the ‘rinse high leverage button.’ Before continuing whatever it was meant to do. I would want to see the downside of that wick cleared, but that could be it too.” Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, underscored the scale of these moves, noting: “An $11K ‘Darth Maul’ on the Bitcoin daily chart. Stops on both sides were run. Incredible intraday volatility in Bitcoin. Welcome to what it’s like for BTC to be $100K. $10,000 moves in a day are now a thing.” He followed up, “$100K Bitcoin is the new $10K,” sharing comparative charts from the 2020–2021 bull run and drawing parallels to the current price environment. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, reinforced this historical context: “Bitcoin. Yes, this is normal.” Edwards posted a similar chart, recalling the volatility when BTC was at $10,000 as well as $1,000 in early 2017. Key indicators also remain suggestive of further upside. According to Matthew Sigel, head of research at VanEck, top signals are scarce at these levels. “Aside from funding rates, which can stay elevated for some time, very few of our ‘top signals’ indicators say the cycle is peaking. The path of least resistance is still higher, in my opinion.” Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts Sigel referenced four key metrics: the MVRV Z-Score (still below 5), the Bitcoin Price SMA Multiplier (indicating room for further growth), subdued Google Trends, and Crypto Market Dominance at a mid-range level. These data points collectively imply that the current cycle may not be approaching its apex. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) delivered another perspective: “Being asked if that was the top so allow me to share my view. In my book the first levered flush out of a strong bull run, particularly one driven by strong fundamentals, does not mark the top.” He noted that while the move was widely anticipated in general terms—albeit not precisely timed—it does not alter the underlying strength of Bitcoin’s rally. Krüger added that the sudden retail pivot to older, “dino” altcoins might have signaled a local top for those assets, but not necessarily for Bitcoin: “Nothing really has changed imo. Would have liked to see funding also reset on alts. Alas, we can’t get it all.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,146.

However, reports show that this robust optimism is spotted mainly among BTC’s short-term investors. Bullish Sentiment Shifts Toward Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holders In a sudden turn of events, Bitcoin’s short-term holders or retail investors are showcasing more confidence in the crypto asset than the long-term holders, as reported by Alphractal, an advanced on-chain data and investment platform. This change in market dynamics implies that retail investors are beginning to trust the resiliency of BTC. While long-term holders have demonstrated less interest in Bitcoin, the platform highlighted that the short-term owners have persistently accumulated BTC throughout the last rally. Despite recent market volatility , the short-term holders seem to be clinging to their positions, which reflects a strong conviction in BTC’s potential in the near term. It is important to note that long-term holders typically distribute their coins in bull cycles and send them over to crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, retail holders have more influence over price behavior since they contribute more to short-term demand. In essence, they accumulate more BTC , and the price usually reacts favorably. As retail holders continue to gather more coins, Alphractal noted that the key point of attention focuses on BTC holders of up to 1 month. This is because a substantial BTC accumulation by the investor profile has historically signaled local market tops and frequently suggested market euphoria, thereby creating room for price corrections at any time. The platform further pointed out that determining exactly when this will happen may be impossible, but recent data revealed that this group of investors is growing steadily. Nonetheless, the levels are still significantly lower than those recorded in the 2017 and 2021 bull market, which implies that there is still a chance for these new investors to acquire more Bitcoin , potentially bolstering its price toward higher levels in the coming weeks. A Surge In BTC Retail Investors Demand To A New Level Retail investors’ demand is currently at levels not seen in years. According to data from CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain and data provider the 30-day demand change from these investors has hit its highest level since 2020, indicating a potential local top. Even as long-term holders start to close their positions in order to secure profits, the spike in retail interest may partially explain the strong persistent demand. While the development might suggest a local top, it also emphasizes rising market engagement, which can generate positive momentum when combined with institutional interest. However, over time, retail demand may begin to drop as BTC moves into a sideways phase.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Demand|btc|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-06 15:30:43

In a statement, the Treasury Department says it is imposing sanctions on those associated with the TGR Group, which uses digital assets, including the US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT, to facilitate the financial activities of high-net-worth Russian nationals despite restrictions that were put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia-born Ukranian national George Rossi is believed to have overall control of the TGR Group. Other members and affiliates include Elena Chirkinyan, Andrejs Bradens, Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov and Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov. “As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.” The international network is believed to have laundered funds on behalf of sanctioned entities, provided unregistered services for exchanging cash and cryptocurrency, made cash value available to clients in the form of crypto, provided prepaid credit card services and obfuscated fund sources, which allowed wealthy Russians to buy properties in the United Kingdom. Says acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets—in particular US dollar-backed stablecoins—to evade US and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the superior alternative, poised for an explosive 89,000% presale rally that promises to create generational billions for early buyers. As the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale raises almost $2 million in revenue, investors seize the chance to secure tokens at $0.0243 before prices increase further. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Choice For Generational Wealth Over XRP While the XRP price continues to attract attention, with analysts predicting bullish activity that could make investors rich, a better alternative has emerged. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a groundbreaking DeFi wallet, is disrupting the market as a more reliable path to generational billion-dollar profits. With an astonishing 89,000% rally projected in its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will offer investors lifetime returns. Currently priced at $0.0243 as it enters a new presale stage, WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens are selling at their lowest possible price. Thousands of savvy investors are joining the presale as it sells out, with millions of tokens generating more than $1.9 million in revenue. The presale is expected to close in a matter of weeks, after which the token price will jump to another price level. After all the presale stages conclude, WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens will be listed on prominent exchanges at a new price, making $0.0243 the best opportunity for its 89,000% rally.

Analysts Predict XRP Price Will Overcome Declines And Make Investors Rich Analysts are forecasting significant gains for the XRP price, predicting it could make investors very rich as the price shows signs of recovery in the charts. After a prolonged consolidation phase between $1 and $2, the XRP price has broken free, surging 95% last week and an impressive 424% in the past month. Currently trading around $2.64, the XRP price steadily climbs from bearish control and extended stagnation. With the XRP price edging closer to its all-time high of $3, analysts believe a new peak is within reach, offering the potential for substantial returns. Meanwhile, its rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), seems to magnet the attention of investors, with its forecasted 89,000% rally set to generate billions in profits. Why Investors Are Racing To Secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) Before It Explodes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to dominate the crypto wallet and AI market by transforming how users trade, manage, and protect digital assets. Intrigued by WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet features and an audited smart contract by SolidProof, investors are selling off other assets to get WLTQ affordable presale tokens before they increase. Market analysts believe WallitIQ (WLTQ) is on track to become one of the most profitable investments of the year, overshadowing even the XRP price's bullish potential. With massive sellouts already in its new presale stage and almost $2 million raised, it is only a matter of time before it sells out entirely. As WallitIQ (WLTQ) gears up for an explosive 89,000% rally, it’s no wonder buyers are scrambling to secure their spot in what’s guaranteed to make generational billions. As the presale rally continues to cause FOMO among crypto investors, time is running out for those who want to secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) at its current price of $0.0243 . With features that simplify trading, improve security, and provide real-world utility, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet is on track to surpass rivals and dominate the crypto market. As WLTQ tokens continue to sell at record speed, now is the moment to act before the presale ends and prices rise significantly.

Hydra—Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution—has notably outperformed Visa by successfully performing 2 billion transactions in just four hours. This marks a huge achievement for Cardano, not only showcasing ADA’s innovative prowess but also strengthening its position in the DeFi space. Meanwhile, rising altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is creating a loud buzz among crypto insiders with its zero-gas technology and other Web3 innovations. JetBolt’s presale has soared to over 100 million tokens sold already. With Hydra’s remarkable success, could Cardano continue its upward trajectory towards setting new all-time highs in 2025? Or could JetBolt’s rising momentum be the catalyst for other next-gen altcoins to keep surging in the exciting days ahead? Let’s explore further. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA ready to set new all-time highs in 2025? In November, ADA surged to its highest level since April 2024 when murmurs circulated that Cardano’s co-founder, Charles Hoskins, would be helping reshape cryptocurrency policies in the U.S. under the Trump administration. 7-day Price chart of Cardano as per data from Coingecko website Adding to this momentum, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, recently processed 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This historic achievement underscores Cardano’s technical prowess and solidifies its position as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Currently trading at $1.19, Cardano has skyrocketed by an impressive 231.9% over the last 30 days, making ADA one of the heavy gainers among the top 10 biggest coins. However, analysts suggest that whales seem to have calmed down for now after accumulating ADA in November. The outlook for ADA remains optimistic, as reflected by its EMA lines, with short-term averages still above long-term ones. Analysts predict that if buying pressure holds, ADA could break through the $1.32 resistance level, with a potential further push to $1.40—a price ADA has not seen since 2022, and one that could trigger ADA’s climb to new highs in 2025 JetBolt: Surging in the Web3 space with zero-gas technology While Cardano strengthens its position, a young altcoin continues to gain traction in the Web3 space preparing the way for 2025: JetBolt (JBOLT). JetBolt’s zero-gas technology, which eliminates gas fees, is a fresh and innovative breakthrough that delivers practical benefits for both everyday users and developers. This feature enables users to make blockchain transactions minus the frustration over hefty gas costs, while empowering developers to more cost-efficiently work on decentralized applications (dApps). JetBolt also offers an intuitive Web3 wallet with advanced integrations like the WebAuthN protocol and face ID recognition, enabling easy access to and management of JetBolt tokens for both new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. As a next-generation innovation, JetBolt boasts an AI-powered insights tool that curates the latest market news and crypto insights to keep users informed of key developments in the rapidly changing crypto environment. Moreover, JetBolt’s advanced staking system has a unique social element—allowing users to enhance their rewards by connecting with friends on the platform. This feature not only boosts their earnings but enriches the staking activity by making it a fun and collaborative experience. Early adopters are also rewarded with presale bonus of up to 25% extra tokens when they avail of JetBolt’s special Alpha Boxes or token batch packages. It’s no surprise then that JetBolt’s presale has already sold over 100 million tokens, pointing to a growing interest from whales in this next-gen altcoin. With blockchain innovation at the core of its rising momentum, JetBolt is rapidly becoming a revolutionary altcoin that could continue surging in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Will Cardano reach new all-time highs in 2025 as next-gen altcoins surge? The crypto market is open and ripe with exciting opportunities for all. Cardano is seizing every opportunity to pursue innovations and developments that will solidify ADA’s position in the fast-changing crypto economy, with the goal of staying relevant and focused on reaching new highs in 2025. Meanwhile, young altcoin JetBolt’s notable rise in the crypto space could signal a new era in Web3. Equipped with zero-gas technology and other next generation solutions with real-world impact, JetBolt is all geared up to keep charging ahead as the crypto world ushers into the year 2025.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 15:39:42

Ripple’s latest developments, IntelMarket’s success in the presale stage, and Worldcoin’s iconic World ID Passport Credential are turning out to be the dominant drivers of this crypto space. Trade analysts are speculating if Worldcoin can hit the target of $4 by December and whether new milestones for XRP and IntelMarkets will be hit. XRP’s Latest Development in Base Reserve Reduction The XRP ledger developers have brought major changes in the Ripple ecosphere by lowering the base reserve requirement for accounts to 1 XRP. In the past, the minimal reserve amount was 20 XRP and was later decreased to 10 XRP in 2021. This marks new changes within the Ripple ecosphere. The move would increase demand for XRP by making the token accessible to users. The market has recently seen a surge in the XRP price. The XRP is currently trading at $2.27. Moreover, Ripple (XRP) is surging due to legal victories. Worldcoin’s World ID Passport Credential – A Massive Win Worldcoin (WLD) is making big headlines due to the development of World ID Passport Credential, which is a breakthrough feature focussed on the enhancement of user privacy and worldwide accessibility. So far, this feature is being tested in various countries including South Korea, Colombia, Chile, and Malaysia, and is letting users link their passports smoothly and safely to their World ID with the help of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. All the data gets stored in user’s devices, maximizing privacy and reducing the risks involved in data breaches, which has never been done by conventional identification systems. The Passport Credential was discovered at ‘A New World’ event in the city of San Francisco and has positioned Worldcoin as a dominant player in decentralized identity verification. This new advancement is the need of the hour since data privacy is the leading concern of users throughout the globe, and is also a great value proposition for interested investors. The WLD is right now priced at $3.43. Trade analysts are expecting a price surge of Worldcoin and believe that the milestone of hitting $4 could happen by December. With the successful rollout of this Passport Credential and ever-increasing global footprint, WLD is set to have a considerable market share in a decentralized identity ecosystem. Increasing Limelight on IntelMarkets IntelMarkets is turning out to be the hottest altcoin investment of this year. Currently, INTL is priced at $0.06 and is set to hit $0.07 in the upcoming round. This rapid momentum is because of the cutting-edge AI-based trading platform, which will be a highly intuitive tool for novice as well as seasoned traders. IntelMarketsINTL seems to be the breakthrough force in the crypto space with 1000x leverage. Traders are increasingly choosing this altcoin for live data processing, AI-empowered trading bots, and leading-edge trading algorithms. IntelMarket’s growth makes trade analysts project a quick surge by December, aligning with the current bullish growth in the crypto market. Investors looking for early gains must look out for the IntelMarkets. Final Thoughts – XRP, INTL, WorldCoin Setting Promising Momentum The three cryptocurrencies XRP, INTL, and Worldcoin are signaling bullish momentum in this final month of 2024. XRP’s recent innovation of decreasing reserve need influences the Ripple appeal, IntelMarket’s epic surge displays its potential to dominate the crypto market, and Worldcoin’s Passport Credential move may make it a big deal in decentralized identity, with the expected crossing of $4 in December. For traders and investors, this is a prime time to take on the opportunity and invest.

Cardano’s slow development pace hampers real-world adoption, while Dogecoin lacks innovation beyond its community-driven value. As a result, undervalued altcoins are developing advanced solutions and strategic growth, outpacing both. PropiChain , one of the top-rated altcoins, stands out with its groundbreaking blockchain solutions, innovative features, and strong potential to lead the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain Technology PropiChain is a leader among undervalued altcoins, revolutionizing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. It makes it easy for investors to purchase shares in premium properties through blockchain-backed NFTs. This opens up real estate investments to individuals from different backgrounds, removing the barriers of traditional property ownership and creating more accessible entry points to the market. The platform integrates AI-powered tools for predictive analytics, streamlining property management, and improving investment decisions. Additionally, its decentralized finance (DeFi) applications offer lucrative staking rewards, allowing investors to earn while holding their tokens. PropiChain’s metaverse integration is another standout feature, enabling users to explore tokenized properties in a virtual environment. This digital and physical real estate blend provides an interactive and high-ROI experience. As one of the undervalued altcoins, BlockAudit has reviewed and audited Propichain’s credibility, security, and transparency. Furthermore, its listing on CoinMarketCap has also boosted its visibility, solidifying its position in the market. Currently in its presale phase , Propichain is offering tokens at competitive prices. Investors can purchase these tokens at a fraction of their expected post-launch value. Analysts project this undervalued altcoin will provide unparalleled ROI by 2025, positioning it as a must-try for investors seeking exponential growth. The platform enables investors to gain exposure to global real estate markets with low entry points, starting from as little as $0.004. This allows users to diversify their portfolios and access global properties through a transparent and accessible digital platform. PropiChain is making real estate investment more accessible and efficient than ever before. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Advancing Toward a Functional Ecosystem Shiba Inu is shaping its reputation amid a bull market by building a comprehensive ecosystem. With the launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu now supports faster and cheaper transactions. This scalability improvement has drawn in decentralized application (dApp) developers and bolstered its utility. Token burns, strategic partnerships, and a growing community contributed to SHIB’s market stability and future potential. However, its high dependence on speculative interest challenges its long-term competitiveness against other undervalued altcoins. TRON (TRX): Decentralized Infrastructure at Scale TRON is another undervalued altcoin with immense potential. Its blockchain supports up to 2,000 transactions per second, providing a robust infrastructure for decentralized applications. TRON’s affordability and energy efficiency make it a favorite among developers and enterprises. Recent upgrades to its ecosystem, such as the TRON Virtual Machine, have increased its appeal to investors. Still, questions about its centralization could hinder its ability to compete with other undervalued altcoins’ transparent frameworks. PropiChain: Your Best Bet for Market-Leading Returns PropiChain stands out as one of the most promising undervalued altcoins, with immense potential for growth in real estate investment. PropiChain offers a tangible, blockchain-powered solution through real estate tokenization, unlike speculative tokens like Dogecoin or Cardano, making it an innovative and practical choice. With tokens priced at $0.01275 in Stage 1, your $500 investment could secure approximately 39,215 tokens. And with a promising listing price of $0.4 to $0.6, your tokens could be worth roughly $15,686 and $23,529, an impressive return, right? As a result of all these innovations and technology, PCHAIN has become one of the best-undervalued altcoins for investors seeking measurable returns in the cryptocurrency market. Act now to secure your stake in this transformative project before the presale ends.

Lightchain AI fuses blockchain and AI, promising to redefine decentralized computing and potential 10x gains by Dec 2024. Table of Contents The technology driving Lightchain AI Why this crypto could be the next big thing Realistic gains or “too good to be true”? How to get started with Lightchain AI Key takeaways Cryptocurrency is no stranger to wild surges and groundbreaking innovations. From Bitcoin ’s meteoric rise to Ethereum ’s smart contracts and, more recently, the buzz around AI advancements, the possibilities seem endless. But now, there’s a new project storming the crypto world that could potentially 10x your investment by December 2024. Enter Lightchain AI —a unique fusion of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence designed to redefine decentralized computing. What sets this project apart from the others? Grab the favourite coffee, and let’s deep-dive into how Lightchain AI brings innovation, scalability, and mind-blowing potential gains to the blockchain landscape. The technology driving Lightchain AI To understand why Lightchain AI stands out, we need a glimpse into what makes it tick. The project combines two key innovations that could reshape how crypto, AI, and decentralized ecosystems function. You might also like: Why Lightchain AI is stealing the spotlight from Ethereum and Solana Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus Forget energy-guzzling Proof of Work (PoW) or stake-based Proof of Stake (PoS). Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a new consensus model that rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations like machine learning training or inference. This isn’t just about transaction validation; this is a smarter blockchain revolution! Imagine contributing to the training of AI models and getting compensated for your efforts. The PoI mechanism leverages real-world utility while maintaining security, efficiency, and scalability. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) Here’s where it gets cooler. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) serves as a futuristic computational layer designed specifically for AI tasks. Developers can deploy decentralized applications (dApps) that harness the power of AI for enhanced functionality. From autonomous financial bots to AI-driven decentralized decision-making systems, the possibilities are staggering. The AIVM evolves constantly, thanks to input from the Lightchain global community of developers. It’s not static—it’s a living ecosystem. Why this crypto could be the next big thing While the technology is compelling, what’s in it for you as an investor or trader? Here’s a glimpse of why Lightchain AI is turning heads in the crypto-verse. Innovation meets opportunity AI and blockchain are arguably two of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Lightchain bridges the two flawlessly, offering a unique proposition for developers, businesses, and crypto enthusiasts alike. This dual-mission ensures sustained interest and growth in its ecosystem. Undervalued tokenomics Lightchain AI’s presale stage is grabbing attention, with tokens priced at just $0.003. And here’s the kicker—the next stage sees a price increase. Early adopters have a chance to lock in profits even before the project hits mainstream exchanges. Decentralized community governance Lightchain AI takes decentralization seriously. Holders of its native token, LCAI, actively participate in shaping the project’s future. Propose initiatives, vote on critical updates, and ensure the ecosystem aligns with the community’s vision. A growing ecosystem of dApps With its AI-driven dApp ecosystem flourishing, Lightchain AI has already attracted developers working to build innovative solutions. This could position Lightchain as the backbone for next-gen applications disrupting finance, healthcare, and supply chains. Transparent and accountable technology Lightchain adopts a transparent AI framework. Every AI-based decision is auditable and explainable, fostering trust within its community. Goodbye black-box AI, hello open and reliable innovation! Realistic gains or “too good to be true”? Many skeptics rightfully ask if Lightchain AI could live up to its claims. Historically, projects with first-mover advantages or unique innovations often outpace competitors. And when it comes to blending AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI has some of the sharpest tools in the shed. Just remember Bitcoin’s early skeptics—where are they now? Think of Lightchain AI as the chance to board an innovative train before it leaves the station. How to get started with Lightchain AI Feeling inspired to explore the future?

37294890,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623872,1733499785,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37294890.jpeg,"Ethereum continues long-awaited comeback with a surge past $4,000",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-surge-past-4000/,"Ethereum just smashed through the $4,000 barrier, a level it hadn’t touched since March. This milestone is being driven by record-breaking inflows into U.S.-listed Ethereum spot ETFs. On December 5, these ETFs saw an eye-popping $428 million in net inflows, the highest one-day figure ever recorded, according to data from SoSoValue . This surge comes in the shadow of Bitcoin breaking past $100,000. Ethereum is quietly building its own rally, with investors betting it could soon topple its 2021 all-time high. Since November 5, when Donald Trump won the presidential election, Ethereum’s price has climbed 61%, outperforming Bitcoin. Trump’s win also reignited hopes for regulatory changes, especially with his appointment of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Inflows and futures frenzy Ethereum’s rally is being powered by institutional interest. U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs are seeing unprecedented activity. The $428 million that poured into these funds in one day highlights the growing appetite for Ethereum among big-money players. This demand is particularly interesting because Ethereum ETFs, unlike staking directly in the network, don’t generate staking rewards for holders. Despite this limitation, the inflows show strong investor confidence. The futures market tells the same story. Open interest in Ethereum futures contracts on the CME Group exchange has hit record highs. Ethereum’s network data is equally bullish. Its Realized Cap—a metric that calculates the value of coins based on their last transaction price—has hit a record high of $243.45 billion. This indicator had been in decline from August to November, but the recent spike signals renewed confidence. Historically, increases in the Realized Cap have preceded major price surges. Glassnode data shows that the rise in Ethereum’s Realized Cap reflects a repricing of ETH as coins last moved at lower prices. This suggests holders are becoming more confident, pushing Ethereum’s value higher. For traders betting against Ethereum, this could be a dangerous sign. Another metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Long/Short Difference, backs up the bullish outlook. This indicator measures the unrealized profits of long-term holders compared to short-term ones. Ethereum’s MVRV is now at 5.67%, entering a positive zone that signals undervaluation. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, notes that similar MVRV levels have historically led to significant price rallies. The last time Ethereum followed this pattern, its price surged to $4,100. If this trajectory holds, the current rally could still have plenty of room to run.

A new contender, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is ready for a similar rally. This AI altcoin focuses on revolutionizing the real estate market. It could deliver similar life-changing returns by Q1 2025. PropiChain is still in its presale stage, but it offers massive growth potential at its lowest price yet. This makes it a good opportunity for early investors looking for a potential winner. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, the AI altcoin aims to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. Its price is set to explode thanks to strong fundamentals and investor interest. Analysts predict PropiChain could outperform many cryptos in the coming months. Its specialized focus and innovative technology give it a clear edge. Analyst: Dogecoin to Reach $1 An analyst has claimed that Dogecoin could surge to $1 as it has the momentum to do so. In the past 30 days, Dogecoin has risen 161%, bringing its market cap to $62.6 billion. In the past year alone, It rose 408%, making it one of the best investments in that period. Now, it is projected to soar higher. However, despite its promising prospects, the analyst warned about potential short-term price drops. At $0.4239, Dogecoin would need to surge 136% to reach $1. The analyst also pointed out that Dogecoin faces selling pressure as traders may want to book profits. PCHAIN: AI Altcoin to Grow $500 Into $55K PropiChain is tipped to surge 800% during the presale alone. Its price can jump from $0.004 in round 1 to 200% higher in round 2. Analysts predict that by 2025, this AI altcoin could turn a $500 investment into an incredible $55,000. As an AI altcoin, PropiChain is counting on artificial intelligence to take real estate management and investment to the next level. PropiChain uses AI to provide users with predictive market analysis . This offers investors data-driven insights to help them make smarter decisions. This feature reduces risks and increases profit potential. Its AI technology also simplifies property searches with advanced filtering and personalized suggestions. Users can find real estate opportunities tailored to their needs, saving time and maximizing value. In addition, PropiChain employs automated valuation models powered by AI, delivering unbiased and accurate appraisals. This benefits buyers and sellers by providing transparent property pricing. This reduces delays caused by negotiations. The platform goes further with 24/7 AI chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools provide real-time support, answering queries and guiding users through complex processes. Investors' problems are quickly addressed. PropiChain also uses AI-powered smart contracts to automate real estate transactions like lease renewals and property sales. This eliminates delays and reduces costs. Its successful smart contract audit with BlockAudit has added a layer of credibility. Dogecoin vs PCHAIN: The Best Crypto Investment? Dogecoin has previously transformed small investments into fortunes with its substantial gains. However, its days of meteoric growth are likely behind it. Dogecoin is now handing the reigns to a new AI altcoin in town. Unlike Dogecoin, PropiChain is at its lowest-ever price. This gives it a competitive edge as its price can rise during the presale and after the public launch. PCHAIN is already attracting Dogecoin whales, indicating confidence in the AI altcoin. Conclusion PropiChain is one of the most promising altcoins for 2024. It offers a unique value proposition. It is currently in the first round of its presale, with each PCHAIN token going for its lowest-ever price of $0.004. PropiChain’s smart contract has been independently audited by BlockAudit . The AI altcoin has been listed on CoinMarketCap . This milestone achievement points to a project that takes its users and investors seriously. Don't wait any longer. Join PropiChain's token presale and create generational wealth, with a $500 investment potentially yielding $55,000 in Q1 2025.

Amidst broader market sentiments, the crypto community eagerly anticipates that Trump administration will prove to be pro-crypto and will stand behind his promise of a strategic BTC reserve for the United States. Advocates believe it could serve as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool in portfolios. However, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has criticized Bitcoin’s role as money, describing its volatility and lack of income generation as its shortcomings. As per a latest Bloomberg report, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has expressed concerns over the idea of incorporating Bitcoin into the U.S. national reserves and argues that it would not benefit most Americans. He emphasized that such a move might not align with the nation’s best interests and could divert focus from more inclusive economic policies. Can Bitcoin Undermine USD’s Status? He noted that incorporating Bitcoin into the US national reserves could undermine the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency and primarily benefit specific interest groups rather than the broader American public. Notably, Bill Dudley stated that Bitcoin is a weak asset, noting reasons such as price volatility, lack of widespread acceptance as payment, and slow and expensive transaction processes that make BTC a weak asset. He also noted the risk of individuals losing access to their Bitcoin holdings and that, unlike traditional financial assets, Bitcoin does not generate income through interest or dividends. “Bitcoin is not connected to any cash flows like interest or dividends, and its price is driven purely by speculative demand,” he explained. The former Fed chair also noted that the absence of an exit strategy for a Bitcoin reserve would make it a liability. “The government would end up holding tokens that produce no income, offering no real value to the majority of Americans,” he said. Suggests To Focus On Comprehensive Regulations- Notably, Dudley argued that creating a Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. would require the Treasury to increase borrowing, raising debt servicing costs or requiring the Fed to print more money, ultimately fueling inflation. Instead of focusing on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Dudley has called for the Trump administration to prioritize creating a robust regulatory framework for the crypto industry. He stressed the need for clear rules to protect consumers, regulate stablecoins, and prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. “Crypto technology has the potential to improve the financial system,” Dudley noted. “However, without strong guardrails, fraud and abuse will continue to undermine trust and hinder progress.” Market Optimism Prevails Nevertheless, there is market optimism amidst expectations of a more crypto-friendly administration. Also, the nomination of digital asset-friendly Paul Atkins to chair the SEC provided the final boost as bitcoin surpassed $100,000 to record highs. Recently, Trump nominated venture capitalist David Sacks as the White House AI & Crypto Czar, who is expected to push to push Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans forward.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 15:53:44

However, new reports suggest that Solana may not follow this path to accessibility due to regulatory obstacles. Solana ETFs Set to Be Rejected? Spot Solana ETFs are set to face disappointment, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notifying at least two of the five prospective issuers about the rejection of their 19b-4 filings. FOX Business’s Eleanor Terrett confirmed that sources suggest the securities regulator is not inclined to approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration. This approach aligns with the SEC’s handling of Bitcoin ETFs, where approvals were coordinated across multiple issuers, avoiding selective approval. Earlier this year, in January, the SEC approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by a series of spot Ethereum ETFs in July. As such, a Solana ETF would further diversify the selection of crypto spot ETFs accessible to investors. So far, multiple asset managers have sought to secure approval for Solana-based investment products, the most recent being Grayscale. According to a filing on Tuesday, the crypto asset manager is looking to convert its $120 million Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot ETF on NYSE Arca, With this, Grayscale became the fifth asset manager to apply for a spot in Solana ETF this year. Other large asset managers, such as VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have similarly applied , reflecting significant industry enthusiasm amid a market-wide resurgence, with SOL alone rising by over 200% this year. However, concerns regarding SOL’s classification persist. The SEC rejected Cboe BZX’s proposals for two spot Solana ETFs in August this year, citing doubts over whether SOL qualifies as a security. Atkins’ SEC Appointment Sparks Hope The recent appointment of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair, however, has sparked renewed optimism for a more favorable regulatory environment for digital asset products, including Solana ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, echoed this sentiment in a tweet , stating that the SEC will not approve any ETF filings until Atkins officially takes charge as SEC Chair in January. As the current administration winds down, industry veterans anticipate that regulatory changes, including potential approvals for crypto ETFs, will only accelerate once new leadership takes the helm.

XRP Set to Soar Again,https://coinpedia.org/news/breakout-alert-xrp-set-to-soar-again/,"The post Breakout Alert! XRP Set to Soar Again appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple, is poised to continue its upward momentum as its hourly chart flashes a bullish signal. This bullishness in the chart appears after three days of price consolidation. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has broken out of a descending triangle price action pattern on the hourly time frame and is now poised to soar again. The recent price correction appears to be beneficial for XRP’s upcoming rally. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP continues its upward momentum and closes a daily candle above $2.48, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 17% to reach the $2.90 level or even higher if the trend remains unchanged. Currently, the altcoin is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both hourly and daily time frames, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near the oversold area, suggesting potential upward momentum in the coming days. $386 Million XRP Outflow From Exchanges In addition to the bullish technical analysis, whales and institutions have shown strong interest in the altcoin, as reported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow metrics. Data reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $386.04 million over the past four trading days. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses. These metrics suggest that whales and institutions are accumulating tokens for the long term. Furthermore, outflows indicate potential buying opportunities, reduce the likelihood of selling pressure, and signal possible upward momentum. With bullish on-chain metrics and positive technical analysis, it appears that the bulls are currently dominating the asset and could support XRP in its upcoming rally. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.35 and has experienced a price drop of 0.35% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has long been touted by its die-hard supporters as the crypto destined to hit $100,000 — and eventually even $1 million. Now, with Bitcoin finally surpassing the $100,000 mark, the question remains: Is this the beginning of something bigger, or are we nearing a point where the market could hit a rough patch? Table of Contents Accumulation zones and liquidity gaps Voices of caution Broader market risks Accumulation zones and liquidity gaps Data revealed by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlights key levels shaping Bitcoin’s current market dynamics, based on their new Cost Basis Distribution metric, which helps track where BTC has been bought and sold by showing where investors have concentrated their purchases. According to their findings , the $39,000-$40,000 range has become “the largest accumulation zone” in 2023, with 322,000 BTC bought at these levels. This shows that investors have had confidence at that level, and it might act as a key support should Bitcoin’s price drop. #BTC briefly advanced above the historic $100K level but the move was short-lived.

The period helped set the stage for Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, and now, these levels are seen as “strong demand zones,” likely to draw in buyers if Bitcoin’s price falls back to them, the analysts say. “This period marked consolidation and investor positioning for the rally. These levels now serve as strong demand zones that were critical in kickstarting the next leg of the bull run.” Glassnode More recently, over 101,000 BTC have been accumulated between $96,000 and $98,000, making this range a strong support zone in the short term. Above $98,000, about 81,000 BTC were bought, creating resistance, the analysts add. However, Glassnode points out that below $96,000, there’s weak support because not much trading has happened there, opening space for more volatility if prices drop toward the liquidity gap below $88,000.

His caution comes as Bitcoin pulls back from its recent high of $103,000, sitting at around $98,000 as of press time.

For instance, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett also flagged potential overheating in financial markets, pointing to the S&P 500’s remarkable 27% gain this year, what appears to be its best performance since 2019. With the index nearing its dot-com-era peak valuation, Hartnett predicts an “overshoot” for Bitcoin and stocks in early 2025. Bitcoin, now with a market capitalization of around $2 trillion, ranks as the world’s 11th-largest economy. And while institutional interest has bolstered its rise, concerns about market leverage still loom. Earlier on, Galaxy Digital ‘s Mike Novogratz shared similar concerns, warning that the current high leverage in the crypto market will eventually lead to “one, if not two, vicious retracements, which will test your soul.” Navigating the path ahead What is clear now is that the $96,000–$98,000 range acts as the first line of defence, with the $62,000–$64,000 accumulation zone coming next. However, if Bitcoin drops below $88,000, the liquidity might — in theory — cause a faster decline, possibly pushing the price back to the $39,000–$40,000 range, which is seen as a historical demand zone. The market’s future is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear that factors like economic trends, investor sentiment, and the political landscape will play a big role, especially under the Trump administration .

These communications, brought to light by Coinbase , highlight how regulatory ambiguity has fueled tension between crypto firms and federal banking authorities. The documents , obtained through a legal challenge by Coinbase and released on Friday, include letters instructing banks to pause all activities related to cryptocurrencies. “We respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity,” the documents read. These FDIC directives reportedly delayed or halted banks’ plans to offer crypto services until they could address unclear compliance requirements. CoinDesk was the first to report this news.

Thank you to the Coinbase legal team for doggedly pursuing these documents. https://t.co/VtLs9Uhbuj — Miller (@millercwl) December 6, 2024 Coinbase claims these communications reveal a coordinated effort to restrict banking access for legitimate crypto businesses, a practice some in the industry refer to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Crypto’s fractured relationship with banking For years, crypto companies have struggled to maintain reliable banking partnerships in the U.S., citing vague or overly cautious guidance from federal regulators. Banks are hesitant to engage with crypto firms due to concerns about regulatory compliance, fraud risks, and potential reputational harm. Without clear rules, many banks avoid the sector altogether, creating a significant hurdle for crypto businesses that rely on traditional banking to operate. The FDIC’s letters appear to underscore this dynamic. The communications show that the agency required banks to answer complex questions about their proposed crypto activities. These inquiries often delayed approvals or led banks to abandon their plans. Coinbase executives argue that the lack of formal crypto guidelines allows regulators to impose informal restrictions, effectively isolating the crypto industry from mainstream financial services. The letters “show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. [The FDIC] is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions,” wrote Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal on X. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, as alleged by crypto proponents, describes regulatory efforts to limit the crypto industry’s access to banking services. Critics argue this approach stifles legal crypto businesses by effectively cutting them off from traditional financial infrastructure. “Law abiding American businesses should be able to access banking services without government interference. The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Paul Grewal via X.",News|Coinbase|FDIC|legal,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-06 16:04:07

The second-largest cryptocurrency is up 2.4% in the last 24 hours and 8.4% in the last seven days, outperforming bitcoin ( BTC ) in both timeframes. The move comes as spot ether exchange-traded funds saw record inflows on Thursday. As of writing, ether is trading for $4,033, just 2% away from setting a fresh 2024 high. It's also a mere 20% away from its all-time high of $4,868. The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been getting hammered since September 2022, has reached 0.04 again — a level that marked a brief top for ether in relation to bitcoin on Nov. 10. The Coinbase premium on ether also continues to expand — meaning that ether is trading for a higher price on the exchange than on the most liquid crypto exchange, Binance. Coinbase premiums are generally seen as a sign of demand among U.S. institutional investors as well as retail participants. TradingView data shows a slight increase in ether's price on Coinbase relative to Binance, suggesting the market is driven by activity from the U.S,., which coincided with the U.S. market opening around an hour ago. That's not all. Glassnode data shows that active addresses on Ethereum have shot up on a 7-day moving average from 368,000 to 523,000 from Sept. 24 to Dec. 5, indicating an expansion of on-chain activity, which in turn ends up benefitting ether by constraining its the token’s supply through the ""burn"" mechanism. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — is down 1.4%, with its worst performers consisting of stellar ( XLM ) and litecoin ( LTC ), which have dropped 3.1% and 5% respectively in the last 24 hours.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, holds 1.1 million tokens worth $108 billion at current prices, with those holdings remaining dormant for years. Outpacing Satoshi’s stack is a big deal for U.S. spot BTC ETFs, an asset class that started trading on Wall Street in mid-January 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT topped the group, managing nearly half of spot Bitcoin ETF volume. Investors have allocated over $51 billion to Bitcoin through the $10 trillion asset management giant.

Traders pay premiums to maintain long positions, reflecting confidence in a near-term rally. Despite market volatility, Solana’s resilience has bolstered investor optimism.

Initially created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin has since transformed into a significant player in the crypto market. As the crypto enters its 12th year, analysts are weighing in on the direction of the coin’s price, considering recent trends. Dogecoin Turns 11: Experts Forecast Price Surge Amid Continued Market Growth Dogecoin marked its 11th year in the cryptocurrency market, maintaining its position as one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Originally launched as a parody of Bitcoin, Dogecoin now boasts a market capitalization exceeding $62 billion. This makes it the seventh-largest cryptocurrency . Over the years, the coin has achieved mainstream recognition, partly driven by high-profile endorsements. The Dogecoin Co-Founder reacting to the milestone added, “It is extremely surreal that some silly thing I made in a few hours has had the impact on the world that it has. It’s a nice reminder that everyone has the potential to make a huge impact with their actions, whether big or small.” Analysts are optimistic about the DOGE price trajectory as the market anticipates celebratory trading activity. Historical patterns suggest that milestones such as anniversaries often lead to increased attention and trading volume, which push prices higher. DOGE Price Breakout Expected Following Consolidation Phase Market analysts suggest that Dogecoin is poised for another bullish rally. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating for approximately 25 days following an initial price surge in November. Historical data from similar market cycles indicate that this consolidation could lead to a significant upward trend. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi predicts that the crypto could see prices reach $1 during its next upward movement. Another analyst, Kevin Capital, highlighted a broader potential for the DOGE price to climb to the $3-$4 range, depending on market momentum. Moreover, another analyst identified a similar bullish pattern commenting, “Just let the $DOGE loose please.”These forecasts are supported by patterns observed in previous bull runs, which showed similar consolidation phases preceding major rallies. Source: X Development Initiatives and Market Trends Could Boost Value Dogecoin’s growth is also linked to ongoing development efforts by the Dogecoin Foundation. Since its relaunch in 2021, the foundation has focused on enhancing scalability and utility as a payment currency. Initiatives such as the Dogebox Decentralized Infrastructure System will integrate the crypto into small business operations, enabling widespread adoption. Additionally, external factors like Elon Musk’s association with the meme coin have historically influenced its performance. The ongoing DOGE initiative, led by Musk and others, continues to drive interest potentially taking DOGE price past $1. At the time of writing, DOGE price is approximately $0.43, reflecting a 0.63% drop over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term decline, the cryptocurrency has remained 3% higher over the past week.

He also emphasized that no concrete decisions have been made regarding the creation of a common BRICS currency. As Forbes reported , India’s central bank head has confirmed that de-dollarization is not part of the country’s objectives under the BRICS group. Das’ remarks come in the wake of sharp criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS nations if they attempt to replace the dollar in international trade. India’s approach to currency use During a press briefing , Das addressed questions on India’s stance, clarifying that the country has only sought local currency trade agreements to mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single currency. “Dependence on one currency can be problematic at times because of appreciation or depreciation,” Das explained but stressed that India’s actions are aimed at diversification rather than outright de-dollarization. He noted that one of the group’s members introduced the concept of a BRICS currency, but no progress has been made. “The geographical spread of the countries has also to be kept in mind, unlike the eurozone which has geographical contiguity,” he added. India’s cautious stance on de-dollarization and the BRICS currency initiative raises questions about the bloc’s long-term unity and vision. The country’s cooperation is especially pivotal to the BRICS framework, particularly for Russia and China, as it serves as a bridge between diverse geopolitical and economic interests. India and Russia have formed strong ties in sectors like energy and defense, with $68 billion in bilateral commerce, mostly from cheaper imports of Russian petroleum. The potential for economic cooperation is evident in strategic initiatives like the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor and the International North-South Transport Corridor. However, India’s pragmatic approach, balancing relationships with both the West and Russia, adds complexity, especially amid ongoing global tensions such as the Ukraine conflict. China and India, as the largest BRICS economies, also stand to benefit from their cooperation within the bloc. However, their partnership is nuanced by tension from underlying geopolitical challenges that led the countries to war in 2020 in the Ladakh region. BRICS expansion and currency debate BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. The move was not supported by India, which believes the bloc needs time to “adjust to new members.” At its most recent summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS leaders unveiled a symbolic banknote, signaling support for the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements. Still, the notion of a common trade currency remains highly contentious. Earlier this year, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva advocated for a BRICS currency to challenge the dollar’s dominance. However, critics, including RBI governor Das, have pointed to the complexity of creating such a currency across a geographically and economically diverse bloc. The debate intensified after Trump, via his Truth Social platform, warned that any move by BRICS nations to establish a common trade currency or undermine the dollar would trigger severe economic repercussions. Source: X “There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” Trump wrote. Governor Das declined to comment on Trump’s remarks directly, stating, “Let the policy come first.” Economist says BRICS has a common currency in Gold While the BRICS bloc is not currently planning a common currency, economist and author Jim Rickards argued that they already share a de facto currency: gold. According to Rickards, BRICS countries rely on national currencies like the yuan and ruble for trade but use gold for periodic settlements to balance accounts. Rickards described Trump’s tariff threats as more of a warning than a reaction to an immediate threat. He suggested that if he were in charge of the U.S. Treasury, he would prioritize purchasing gold to complicate the efforts of BRICS nations, effectively preempting their chances of relying on a gold-based trade system.

The documents, which were obtained as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include letters that encouraged banks to “pause all crypto asset-related activity.” The purported regulatory action resulted in delays or complete halts to plans by banks to offer cryptocurrency services, causing significant burdens on the crypto industry. Coinbase says the letters demonstrate a lack of transparency and a lack of clarity from regulators , which has led to tension between crypto companies and federal regulators. The FDIC’s instructions apparently called for banks to resolve thorny compliance issues before taking up any crypto-related business, resulting in a practical freeze on the industry. Crypto’s Rocky Relationship With Banking For years, the firms of cryptocurrency have been trying to have decent banking relationships in place within the U.S. Banks were continuing to stay away out of a lack of regulatory clarity, fraud concerns, and potential reputational risk. All that leaves many crypto businesses without the financial infrastructure to operate. The recently disclosed FDIC communications further underscore this strained relationship. By placing burdensome requirements on banks, the agency has reportedly deterred institutions from exploring partnerships with crypto businesses. The lack of formalized crypto guidelines has created an environment of uncertainty, where banks prefer to avoid the sector altogether rather than risk non-compliance. Operation Chokepoint 2.0: Fact or Fiction? Coinbase claims these moves are part of a wider effort that it refers to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The term alludes to allegations of federal regulators surreptitiously trying to choke the crypto industry by cutting off its access to critical banking services. Critics contend such measures inappropriately insulate legitimate crypto businesses, ultimately stifling innovation and undermining growth in the industry. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, underlined the importance of these revelations: “The letters show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t some crypto conspiracy theory. The FDIC must answer for its overreach.” Clear Crypto Guidelines: A Need Meanwhile, crypto leaders are clamoring for clear, consistent regulations to replace these vague and unofficial restrictions. He urged rulemakers to adopt guidelines that allow law-abiding cryptocurrency companies to have fair access to banking without politically driven regulatory actions that will adversely affect their businesses. In the interim, the FDIC’s actions reignited long-running debates over the role of government in or around the stifling of financial innovation, and the crypto world wants an easier onramp into legitimacy with traditional banks.",Blockchain|Coinbase|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-06 17:22:46

This creates an encouraging market scenario for the investors, as the cryptocurrency is now on the gaining end. Technical indicators as well as the price charts are giving out a highly bullish signal as well. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly crossing above $9000 in 2030. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price ascended over the last 24 hours, above the support at $740.1. Buyers have recently stepped in to buy the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable, as bulls have dominated in the past weeks. Will BNB reach $700? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $700 mark by the end of 2024, which would be quite higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach nearly $2000 by the end of 2026 and surpass this mark at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7000 by 2030. Recent news/opinion on BNB Binance Faces Whistleblower Lawsuit from Ex-Executive in UK Amrita Srivastava, a former executive at Binance, is suing the firm in the UK, alleging she was fired after disclosing a colleague had accepted a bribe from a customer to expedite their integration.

BNB historic price sentiment Binance coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018 BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, the Binance Coin traded near $300, rising to $425 by March. It surged further to $600 by the end of the month and peaked at an all-time high of $717.48 on June 6. After fluctuating between $488 and $605 in July and August, BNB recovered to $620 in September and recovered above $590 by the end of October. In November, BNB price went as high as $661 and at the start of December 2024, it is trading near $650 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-06 17:26:00

This surge was triggered by a strong demand for Ethereum ETFs. It reflects a 65% rise in Ethereum’s price over the last month, following Donald Trump’s election as the 47th President of the United States, signaling a significant rebound after a period of lagging behind Bitcoin. Institutional Interest Controls Ethereum Price Ether has climbed above the $4,000 level, reaching heights last seen in March 2024 following a phase of low trading activity. Data from Coinglass shows that Ethereum witnessed total liquidation of nearly $87 million over the last 24 hours. In March 2024, the launch of the Dencun upgrade drastically cut fees for Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions, resulting in a 99% decline in Ethereum layer-1 network revenues. The reduction in fees initially led to less demand for the smart contract-based cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, by September 2024, network fees began to increase again. Also read: Ethereum Breaks Through $4,000 Amid Growing Demand For ETH ETF Data from Token Terminal shows that on December 5, the Ethereum base layer collected about $11 million in fees. In contrast, during the peak of fee suppression in August 2024, Ethereum’s fees were around $500,000. The surge in Ethereum’s price is driven by rising demand for Ethereum ETFs, which saw a record daily net inflow exceeding $430 million on December 5, as reported by CoinGlass. In the last week, Ethereum ETFs have gained more than $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $788 million of that total, as per data from Farside Investors. Significant inflows into major Ethereum ETFs are occurring amid increasing bullish analysis. In November, Plume CEO Chris Yin explained that anticipation of more favorable crypto regulations under President-elect Donald Trump is sparking “overdue excitement” for these funds, which started trading in the U.S. in July. What’s Next for ETH Price? Ethereum price is currently showing a strong buying pattern, breaking through the $4K mark. Buyers are now aiming to hold the price above that level to validate further upswings. As of writing, ETH price trades at $4,016, surging over 2.5% in the last 2 hours. The upward trending 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,837 and a positive relative strength index (RSI) suggest that the bulls currently have a slight upper hand. If Ethereum breaks above the upper boundary and closes there, it could trigger a rally potentially reaching above $4,400, with targets at $4,800. Conversely, if Ethereum breaks and closes below the EMA20 trend line, it would signal a shift in advantage to the bears, potentially leading to a drop towards $3,500 and possibly further to $2,700. Should these support levels fail, the next critical level could be the 50-day simple moving average at $2,200.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 17:26:18

Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $3,600; now up ~54% year-to-date. XRP has wiped out its losses this year and is currently up ~301% year-to-date. This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's closing price climbed toward the $100,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~117% year-to-date. Ether Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $3,600. ETH is now up ~54% year-to-date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple ( XRP-USD ) and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP has wiped out its losses this year and is currently up ~301% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch . On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH).

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 17:34:42

Certik noted both the number of hacks and the crypto stolen declined for the second month in a row. Hacks and exploits have been on the decline since September. November’s result shows a total of 50 successful attacks with an estimated value of $65M. Data by Certik shows a two-month streak of declining attacks, despite the record market value of crypto assets. November was also the second-slowest month when it came to direct crypto hacks. Hacks decline in November 2024 compared to November 2023 Certik’s estimate for November is the most conservative, based on its methodology. The Web3 auditing firm tracks big exploits against DeFi, protocols, and enterprise wallets. Certik also excludes decentralized and trading attacks, including sandwich attacks, flash loan trades, and rug pulls. Other estimates that include a wider selection of hacks tally up the losses to $71M or even up to $85M. The result for November 2024 is still smaller compared to November 2023, where a total of $343M was lost, based on estimates by ImmuneFi. November 2023 was a notable month, with a $118M hack against the Poloniex exchange. In comparison, November 2024 shows a slowdown of big exploits and a turn toward small DEX and DeFi protocols. November also saw an acceleration of attacks directed at personal wallets through malicious links, supply chain attacks, or social phishing. According to ScamSniffer data, 9,208 victims were affected in small-scale exploits against personal wallets. A total of $9.3M were lost. Hacks slow down, on track to remain below 2023 levels Hacks and exploits on a year-to-date basis make up to $1.49B in a total of 209 notable incidents, with the most activity around mid-2024. For now, the year’s exploits are smaller compared to 2023 with a total of $1.7B. Peak activity for crypto exploits happened in 2022 when hackers took hold of more than $3.7B. Besides the bear market, one of the factors was a slowdown of the Lazarus Group activity, at least based on the usage of TornadoCash. The other reason is an attempt to shift exploits to the Solana ecosystem, while Ethereum is still the biggest target for exploits. Tornado Cash deposits slowed down since the sanctions verdict in 2022. | Source: Dune Analytics Activity on Tornado Cash fell off a cliff in 2022, after the OFAC sanctions verdict. Even after the verdict was overturned in 2022, the mixer did not regain its original volume . TornadoCash remains the most widely used for Ethereum-based ERC-20 assets. TornadoCash, however, remains key to mixing funds, with recent deposits from the DEXX hack getting sent in test transactions. Hacks become more detailed and creative The biggest hack for November was DEXX, which exposed thousands of Solana wallets and led to a loss of $30M. The DEXX hack exposed 8,620 Solana wallets as a result of social engineering to steal private keys. Thala Labs was the second-biggest hack in November, for a total of $25.5M. The exploit was white-hatted, later allowing the platform to recover its funds after deducting a $300K bug bounty. Gifto was a questionable hack, where new tokens were printed and sold on exchanges. Polter Finance lost $12M in an Oracle exploit, while Delta Prime erased $4.8M in a contract exploit. MetaWin was another mid-range hack, where a smart contract allowed for oversized withdrawals. The betting platform lost $4M from its permissionless withdrawal contract. The smallest hack was XT Exchange , losing between $1M and $1.7M from compromised wallets. Certik, whose main task is private contract audits, noted November arrived with multiple exploits based on flawed logic. Audits do not always guarantee a contract will not be exploited, but a total lack of audits may be an easy target for hackers. At the same time, bridge hacks and exploits have almost disappeared, as projects rarely use bridge activity and have siloed their liquidity.

This sharp decline triggered a wave of panic sell-offs, impacting major altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ) and XRP , which mirrored Bitcoin’s downward trajectory. The resulting liquidation frenzy has pushed market-wide liquidations to a staggering $881 million, further intensifying bearish sentiment. While the exact catalyst for this sell-off remains unclear, heightened volatility has spotlighted overbought conditions in several cryptocurrencies. According to CoinGlass’s 12-hour relative strength index ( RSI ), heatmap , multiple assets have breached overbought thresholds, presenting opportunities for short-term corrections. ‘ With the average daily RSI currently at 70.36 and the 12-hour RSI at 65.55, the broader market shows signs of overheating, increasing the likelihood of retracements in select assets. Against this backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies, Xai (XAI) and JasmyCoin ( JASMY ), that exhibit strong sell signals based on momentum indicators, suggesting they may be poised for imminent price corrections. Xai (XAI) XAI’s current RSI levels across multiple timeframes point to an emerging sell signal as overbought conditions dominate the higher timeframes. The 12-hour RSI has surged to 71.59, while the 24-hour RSI climbs even higher to 74.1, both breaching the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that buying momentum is reaching its peak, with a pullback or consolidation likely on the horizon. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: XAI. Source: CoinGlass Adding to this, a sharp 9.75% price increase over the last 12 hours suggests the asset may be overextended, inviting selling pressure as traders begin to secure profits. While shorter timeframes, such as the 15-minute RSI at 56.88 and the one-hour RSI at 55.59, remain in neutral territory, they fail to show the strong upward momentum needed to sustain further gains. With the broader market’s average 12-hour RSI standing at 65.55, which is on the verge of overbought levels, XAI’s upward trend could face resistance, signaling a key moment for traders to take profits before a potential correction sets in. JasmyCoin (JASMY) JASMY also presents strong sell signals, with RSI levels across multiple timeframes firmly in overbought territory. The 12-hour RSI stands at 75.71, the 24-hour RSI at 76.77, and the one-week RSI at 75.55, all exceeding the overbought threshold of 70. These readings indicate that JASMY’s recent bullish momentum is unsustainable and likely to reverse soon. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: JASMY. Source: CoinGlass Adding to this bearish outlook, JASMY has seen an extraordinary 73.2% price surge over the past 12 hours, a sharp spike that typically triggers profit-taking. Shorter timeframes, such as the 15-minute RSI of 45.61 and one-hour RSI of 50.41, remain neutral, signaling that the upward momentum is not strong enough to sustain further gains. With the broader market’s 12-hour RSI average at 65.55, the potential for selling pressure across the market increases. These factors make JASMY a prime candidate for a short-term correction, presenting traders with an opportunity to secure gains. However, it is important to note that an overbought RSI is not a definitive predictor of an immediate downturn, as such conditions can persist in prolonged bullish markets. Therefore, while caution is warranted, traders should also consider broader market trends and additional indicators to make informed decisions. In the current backdrop, closely monitoring market dynamics will be crucial for navigating the heightened volatility.

Important statements were made by FED members Hammack and Goolsbee, touching on interest rates, economic growth, and Bitcoin's role in the financial ecosystem. Hammack emphasized a data-driven approach to monetary policy, noting that the U.S. economy remains strong with solid growth, low unemployment and gradually decreasing inflation, adding that “the economic situation requires moderately restrictive monetary policy.” Hammack hinted that the Fed may slow the pace of rate cuts, in line with market expectations that there will be a single rate cut at the next two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “The time has come, or will soon come, for the Fed to slow the pace of rate cuts,” Hammack said. The member added that the outlook for financial markets was consistent with his view, suggesting a less aggressive stance as inflationary pressures ease and the labor market stabilizes. Meanwhile, Fed member Goolsbee addressed cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, arguing that its high volatility prevents it from functioning effectively as a currency. Related News: Analyst il Capo Reveals What to Expect Next in Bitcoin Price! Is a Correction Coming? What to Expect in Altcoins? “Bitcoin’s attractive volatility prevents it from being a currency because it is not a stable store of value,” Goolsbee said. Goolsbee also expressed skepticism about the broader economic impact of cryptocurrencies, describing them as speculative assets with limited real-world applications: “So far, the rise of crypto assets hasn’t had much of a macro impact, but there could be a wealth impact.” Regarding the FED's intervention in Bitcoin, Hammack explained that the FED follows developments regarding cryptocurrencies but does not have a direct relationship with Bitcoin. Both officials said that incoming data is important in shaping the Fed's decisions. Hammack took a clear stance on the December FOMC meeting, saying additional data on inflation and consumer spending would influence the final decision. *This is not investment advice.

With its fixed supply and growing demand driven by rising investor confidence and adoption as a payments technology, Bitcoin is positioned as a unique addition to investment portfolios by offering low correlation to traditional risk assets such as stocks and bonds, according to the report. The report notes that Bitcoin’s value is driven by different factors, including its limited supply and its potential for widespread adoption. BlackRock says: “Bitcoin’s potential as a new diversifier stems from its unique value drivers: the potential to appreciate over time as its predetermined supply is met by increasing demand, and demand is driven by investors’ belief in Bitcoin’s potential for wider adoption as a payments technology.” Related News: Analyst il Capo Reveals What to Expect Next in Bitcoin Price! Is a Correction Coming? What to Expect in Altcoins? The asset manager also points to Bitcoin’s resilience as a potential buffer in an increasingly volatile market environment. As correlations between stocks and bonds weaken, traditional safe havens like gold and emerging assets like Bitcoin could fill the gap left by government bonds that have become less effective as a hedge against stock sell-offs, analysts say. Bitcoin’s historically low correlation with equity markets increases its appeal as a diversifier, but its risk-return profile could change with wider adoption, according to BlackRock. The report highlights: “The risk and return profile of Bitcoin will change if it becomes widely adopted. At that point, it may be more suitable as a tactical hedge against certain risks, like gold.” *This is not investment advice.

The blockchain has the power to revolutionize many segments of our society and life, such as travel and trivial payments. In particular, two startups – built on Algorand ( ALGO ) – are using blockchain to innovate on airline tickets and energy bill payments. These startups are TravelX and HesabPay, featured in the Algorand Foundation’s new campaign “Algorand Can” as evidence of what blockchain technology can do in the real world, especially when using ALGO’s infrastructure. Essentially, Algorand is a blockchain platform designed for speed, scalability, and security, competing with Ethereum ( ETH ) and other “layer-ones (L1s).” It uses a pure proof-of-stake consensus model and has a supply cap set at 10 billion ALGO. These characteristics can leverage startups like TravelX and HesabPay with efficient and secure solutions for their needs. Finbold looked at publicly available stats from these businesses, showing the impact they are already bringing to the real world. TravelX – Using Algorand NFTs for airplane tickets TravelX is using Algorand’s blockchain to run “NFTickets” for airline travel, aiming to solve known issues in this industry. According to its case study , “Airlines face operational cost burdens managing complex distribution networks and numerous intermediaries.” “NFTickets, governed by smart contracts, provide secure, flexible, and efficient ticket distribution while reducing customer service costs and increasing airline revenue. The use of blockchain provides enhanced security, transparency, and immutability to travel transactions.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study Notably, TravelX claims to have onboarded over 5 million passengers in 2023, being a battle-tested case of success. Since its launch, the startup has recorded over 2.2 million NFTickets and 18 million transactions on the Algorand blockchain. “This eliminates the risk of fraud and fosters trust between airlines and passengers, ensuring all parties involved have clear and verifiable records. NFTs represent unique, secure, and transferable digital ownership of airline tickets, offering passengers greater control over their travel plans.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study Besides increased security, eliminating the risk of fraud, and providing true digital ownership of the tickets, the benefits go further. TravelX also leverages a safe environment for secondary markets and more flexibility for its customers than conventional airline ticketing systems. “Unlike traditional tickets, NFTickets can be easily transferred or even resold on secondary markets, providing passengers with increased flexibility. Smart contracts automate ticket functionalities and interactions, such as managing ticket changes or cancellations. This automation leads to reduced operational costs and improved efficiency for airlines.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study HesabPay – Afghanistan energy bill payments via ALGO Meanwhile, HesabPay, in partnership with UNDP and Unicef, is using the Algorand network to foster digital payments’ accessibility in Afghanistan. According to data shared at the “Can A Blockchain Do That” website, the app has processed over $64 million worth of electricity bills and 106,000 humanitarian cash transfers in the country, resulting in over 8 million transactions confirmed by the Algorand blockchain. HesabPay stats. Source: canablockchaindothat.com On that note, Alex, an Algorand contributor, shared that HesabPay has processed $40 million in electricity monthly bills. This, according to Alex and Algorand Foundation’s CMO, Marc Vanlerberghe, equals 30% of all Afghanistan electricity bills. 30% of electricity bills are paid each month in Afghanistan using #Algorand , via @HesabPay_ ! ⚡️ We're talking about hundreds of millions of $ annually.

Finbold covered three other interesting use cases built on top of MultiversX ( EGLD ), for example. In the meantime, cryptocurrency analysts are showing growing optimism about “utility altcoins” like ALGO, EGLD, ETH, and others. Alex Becker believes “utility altcoins” are the “ easiest and surest play ” in crypto. Additionally, Alex Svanevik listed promising utility narratives in what he called an upcoming “ mother of all bull markets .” Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), urged the industry to build real-world applications as meme coins started to become “weird.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

Canada’s new regulations call for delisting noncompliant stablecoins after December 31st. Circle’s compliance means USDC, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, can trade on crypto exchanges in the Canadian market, according to a new press release . Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, says the new development underscores the stablecoin issuer’s regulatory efforts. “The Canadian Securities Administrators’ proactive approach in providing a digital asset regulatory framework reinforces the integrity of digital asset markets, while ensuring continued reliance on USDC across Canada’s burgeoning ecosystem.” The announcement comes as Circle launched a new wave of layoffs, Bloomberg reports . A company spokesperson tells the news outlet the downsizing was routine and represented less than 6% of the firm’s workforce. “Circle regularly reviews our investments and expenses. This includes investing in teams and operational infrastructure that need to grow, while marginally reducing spend and some roles in other areas of the business.” This summer, USDC and Circle’s euro-pegged stablecoin EURC also achieved compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. MiCA is upcoming EU legislation that will provide rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The law includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing, and it places stablecoin issuers under the European Banking Authority while requiring them to hold sufficient liquid reserves. It’s also scheduled to take effect in December 2024.

Donald Trump is selling DOGE T-shirts . It's a frenetic time for crypto. But what are my non-crypto friends texting me about? ""Hawk Tuah"" coin. Yep, in a very unscientific sample size of the seven friends who texted me — unsolicited — about crypto this week, six essentially asked: ""What's the deal with Hawk Tuah coin?"" (The seventh asked about litecoin). That a low-level celebrity's dalliance with memecoins would dominate the groupchat's mindshare at the same time the original cryptocurrency smashed through a historic level points to a chasm between the crypto industry's perception of itself and the general public's — or at least my friends' — perception. When HAWK launched Wednesday , it immediately rocketed up to a market capitalization of almost $500 million. Then, just as fast, it crashed below $100 million, wiping out individual investments once worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It now fetches less than $30 million. Betting on memecoins is never a surefire investment strategy. But there were signs that Hawk Tuah was a worse investment than most. Its launch was marred by allegations of insider dumping (which the founders deny) and a pricey swap tax that failed to stop snipers from essentially manipulating its price. Most of the people who reached out to me didn't know this level of detail. They'd just heard the ""hawk tuah"" woman, Haliey Welch, had launched a memecoin and it did not go very well. ""It reinforces my previous belief that it's all nonsense,"" said one friend who bought bitcoin in 2020 but quickly sold. He acknowledged that bitcoin and Ethereum's ether may have ""certain technological advances."" And yet, ""​​the fact that essentially anyone can create a new — potentially preferred — cryptocurrency at any point in time"" boggled his mind. To my surprise, this friend had not heard that one bitcoin was now worth $100,000, the headline story according to most everyone who works inside crypto. Most of the ""normies"" who reached out to me about HAWK didn't know this. Instead, they wondered if Hawk Tuah would face legal blowback. ""I can't help but feel like [Haliey] Welch is gonna be unintentionally responsible for some butterfly effect that ruins people's lives,"" another friend mused. Less interesting to him was the price of bitcoin. He wasn't interested in buying before, and certainly not now. ""I don't like crypto,"" he said. Plenty of people don't like crypto. That may be why plenty of the people I know are so enchanted by HAWK. It reinforces all the bad, scammy notions they have for what they view as digital nonsense nickels. Of course, that's the promise and peril of permissionless blockchains. Anyone can do anything. Of the people who reached out to me, only one mentioned bitcoin without prompting. That friend, a gold bug, jokingly taunted me for bitcoin's failure to hold $100k for even 24 hours. Another friend who buys cryptocurrencies through Robinhood admitted he owed no BTC. ""I don't really have a reason why I have no btc,"" he said, ""I guess im just so not mainstream.""

MSTR shares were trading at $390 on Dec. 6, continuing a decline that began on Nov. 21, when the stock peaked at $541. Even with this pullback, MicroStrategy remains one of the best-performing stocks this year, up over 500%, with a market cap exceeding $91 billion. It is also the top gainer in the Russell 2000 index. There are two possible reasons why the stock has retreated this month. First, this decline is because of profit-taking among investors who have benefited from its climb. Second, investors are likely concerned about its valuation, which stands at about $91 billion. This is a big premium considering that MicroStrategy holds 402,100 coins valued at under $40 billion. As such, there is a $50 billion gap that cannot be filled by the struggling original data analytics business. You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Therefore, some investors believe that the company’s valuation will ultimately drop to bring its valuation close to its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. Still, most Wall Street analysts are optimistic that the stock has more upside left. According to Yahoo Finance , some of the most bullish analysts are from Cowen, Barclays, Benchmark, and Bernstein. The average estimate for the stock is $492, higher than the current $390. MicroStrategy’s stock has also mirrored the performance of other Bitcoin-exposed companies. Marathon Digital, the second-largest Bitcoin holder, has declined 14% from its November peak, while Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8 Mining have also experienced pullbacks. What next for MSTR stock? MSTR stock chart | Source: TradingView MicroStrategy’s stock has pulled back but remains above the ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since Nov. 11. It is also trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, suggesting potential support for further gains. It has also bottomed at the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the stock will likely bounce back if Bitcoin continues rising, as analysts expect . If this happens, the stock will likely continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $540. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the extreme overshoot level at $625. Conversely, a drop below the rising trendline could see the stock have a mean reversal and drop to the 100-day moving average at $240. This price coincides with the major S&R level of the Murrey Math Lines.

The city seeks to strike a balance between financial stability and consumer safety while pursuing its virtual asset agenda. On the other hand, China continues to prioritize digital assets that can be controlled. The Chinese authorities, then and now, regard decentralized digital currencies as more destructive than beneficial. The risk stems from crypto’s capacity to hide capital outflows, which Chinese policymakers wish to discourage rather than encourage, as well as its role in money laundering. China is, however, gradually opening up to crypto under its jurisdiction. The publication of the stablecoin bill follows a public consultation held in July by the city’s financial affairs office, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and industry players. Three stablecoin issuers were admitted in July to test its use in various settings. The HKMA will be granted the authority to supervise, investigate, and enforce the regime in order to ensure its effective implementation. The government has announced that the Stablecoins Bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council for a first reading on December 18. Stablecoin introduction in Hong Kong – Details Under the proposed regulatory system, issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins and [other] tokens that claim to maintain a stable value with the Hong Kong dollar will be required to get a license from the HKMA. According to their statement, licenses are also required to publicly sell the issuance of these tokens. Christopher Hui Ching-yu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said in a statement, “The legislative proposal is essential for Hong Kong in fulfilling our obligations as a member of the Financial Stability Board.” He added, “This risk-based proposal aims to promote a robust regulatory environment, which is in line with Hong Kong’s approach to virtual-asset development.” The draft includes information regarding the definition of stablecoins, the licensing application procedure, and transitional arrangements for current stablecoin issuers, among other things. It also prohibits certain activities, such as using misrepresentation to persuade another individual to acquire a stablecoin. According to Andrew Fei, a partner at the law firm King & Wood Mallesons, the framework provides more detail in nearly 300 pages compared to the 30-page consultation document. He explained with an example that the proposed definition of a stablecoin is “ future-proof and comprehensive .” According to him, it encompasses stablecoins that operate on a distributed ledger as well as those that operate on any comparable information repository. In order to fulfill its obligations, a licensed issuer must possess sufficient financial resources and liquid assets, in addition to comprehensive risk-management strategies. For instance, the minimum paid-up capital is the equivalent of US$3.2 million (HK$25 million). The impact of legalizing stablecoins in Hong Kong Lawrence Chu, co-founder of IDA, a Hong Kong-based Web3 digital asset company, believes that the legal framework will provide major opportunities. He said, “Stablecoins can provide cost-effective and efficient cross-border transactions, offering businesses 24/7 digital payment services.” Lawrence Chu further stated that the integration of Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins into the financial system will enhance the city’s reputation as an international digital asset hub and facilitate cross-border trade. Their aim is that as the globe explores transactions in the Web3 ecosystem, there will be more usage and larger transactions completed or paid for with stablecoins . As a result, Hong Kong regulators are concerned about potential dangers to financial system stability. Hong Kong has also been marked as one of the first countries to regulate stablecoin issuers, following initiatives by the European Union and Japan. Singapore and the United Kingdom are amid developing regulations, whilst the United States currently has no restrictions in place.
