($GME) shares experienced a massive boost on Thursday after a cryptic post by Keith Gill, the influential figure behind the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy. The post immediately reignited investor interest, causing GameStop’s shares to spike and the Roaring Kitty meme to pump. Roaring Kitty’s Cryptic Post Sends $GME Stock Soaring 15% – What’s His Next Move? Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” has once again stirred up the markets with a cryptic post on social media platform X . Gill, a key figure in GameStop’s 2021 retail trading frenzy, shared an image of a Time magazine cover featuring a computer with an old video player. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Known online as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and “DeepF***ingValue” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, Gill posted an image of a Time magazine cover with a computer screen on the social media platform X. The post triggered a 15% spike in GameStop’s stock price, leading to trading halts on platforms like Robinhood due to heightened volatility. The ripple effect extended to the digital asset market, where a GameStop-inspired meme coin on the Solana blockchain skyrocketed by 65%. Gill, a former financial adviser from Massachusetts, initially gained fame in 2021 by championing GameStop as a retail investor opportunity. This sparked a retail trading frenzy that sent the stock soaring over 10,000% at its peak. Roaring Kitty Returns: Keith Gill Sparks Market Chaos After Three-Year Silence Gill’s recent social media activity comes after a three-year hiatus, during which his followers eagerly awaited his return. Many see him as a symbol of retail investors’ triumph over Wall Street, likening him to a modern David against Goliath. The GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, sparked by Gill’s bullish posts, extended to other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment. The collective effort by Reddit users to squeeze hedge funds resulted in billions of dollars in losses for institutional investors and drew the attention of regulators. The dramatic events of the Reddit rally were later dramatized in Craig Gillespie’s 2023 film Dumb Money. The 2021 rally also raised questions about market fairness, particularly after trading restrictions were imposed on retail investors. These measures drew allegations of manipulation, as hedge funds held large short positions in GameStop during the peak of the trading frenzy. By Thursday afternoon, trading activity around GameStop had intensified, with about 300,000 options contracts changing hands—approximately 1.5 times the usual trading volume, according to a Reuters report . The stock’s 30-day implied volatility, a measure of expected short-term price movements, also jumped to 132%, marking a three-week high. Among the most popular trades were contracts betting that GameStop’s stock price would exceed $30 by the end of the week, with 32,000 such options traded by late afternoon. A Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, Chewy (CHWY), surged nearly 28% after the return of Roaring Kitty , famous for the GameStop short squeeze. Gill posted a cryptic image on X on September 6 , sparking speculation among traders. The post featured a Toy Story meme with the Chewy logo, which some interpreted as a signal that Gill might be stepping back from his role at Chewy. Despite no technical utility, meme coins like CHWY thrive on social sentiment, making Gill’s posts influential for traders.

On Dec. 5, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100,000 barrier, just weeks after surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12, as reported by TradingView. Shortly after, Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $104,000 at 3:08 a.m. UTC, roughly 90 minutes after breaking the $100,000 threshold. The surge was fueled by over $31 billion in net inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tightened supply due to Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April. Donald Trump’s Victory Boosts Bitcoin Rally Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, alongside speculation of a strategic Bitcoin national reserve and increased corporate adoption led by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Additionally, Trump’s Dec. 4 nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair has sparked optimism. This move could eliminate regulatory barriers that have hindered the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Trump’s pro-crypto cabinet includes Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as nominees for Secretary of Treasury and Commerce, respectively, potentially creating the most crypto-friendly administration to date. Bitcoin Up 126% in 2024 Bitcoin’s value has increased by 126% since Jan. 1, when it traded at $44,000. Its market capitalization has now reached a record $2 trillion for the first time. While Bitcoin’s 2024 rally is impressive, it isn’t its most dramatic. In 2017, Bitcoin soared 1,900%, rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. Similarly, between March 2020 and November 2021, it surged 1,250%, climbing from $5,100 to $69,000.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 22:55:00

Yesterday, Coinbase announced the listing of Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin. “Moo Deng (MOODENG) is now live on http://coinbase.com & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” Moo Deng is the name of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand, this past summer. The hippo has become an internet sensation, inspiring memes and memecoins alike. Moo Deng means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Our favorite bouncy pork a.k.a Moo Deng ?? #moodeng @KhaokheowZoo @MooDengSOL pic.twitter.com/5cJl9oJD82 — Moo Deng (@moodengx) December 1, 2024 In November, Moo Deng went viral again by correctly “ predicting ” the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Despite Moo Deng’s internet fame, MOODENG has faltered in the hours following the Coinbase listing. Approximately 24 hours following the memecoin’s addition to Coinbase, MOODENG is down 12.4%. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto markets are largely surging following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) historic breakthrough of $100,000. In stark contrast with MOODENG’s struggles, another Solana-based memecoin ripped after Coinbase added support on Wednesday. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, pumped up 51% after the top US crypto exchange listed the memecoin.

Ceffu is an institutional partner of Binance, and this arrangement will support the EOS mainnet. The partnership will be critical in unlocking the new CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders while providing institutional-grade custodian services. Ceffu’s advanced custody infrastructure guarantees the institution’s safety on its EOS assets. Relying on multi-party computation and customized approval schemes highlights how seriously the firm has taken security matters. The arrangement will allow institutional fund handlers to use CeDeFi strategies that grasp the best of CEX and DeFi ecosystems. Through Binance liquidity and robust trading styles, EOS token holders can access the innovative yield solution tailored to institutional needs. With this partnership, though, there is a growing focus on institutional solutions. EOS seems to alienate retail holders and small-scale entities, so this partnership may bring very few benefits to small-scale blockchain users. EOS remains one of the top blockchain platforms With EOS featured on the Coinbase COIN50 index , its popularity and interest are growing among institutions. This recognition shows that EOS is among the leading blockchain platforms and an integral player in the crypto ecosystem. According to Yves La Rose, Founder & CEO of EOS Network Foundation, Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. He added that by partnering with Ceffu, they are creating new pathways for institutions to participate securely in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities. The EOS network is significant in this partnership. The third-generation blockchain that operates on the EOS virtual machine is set for high-speed and low-cost transactions. The design supports seamless Web3 for all players, developers, and users alike. Even though the partnership looks good, Ceffu’s ties with Binance might be a regulatory risk. Binance is sustainedly scrutinized in several jurisdictions. High innovations with strategic tokenomics build the EOS ecosystem Due to approved community tokenomics, EOS has seen regular growth, enhanced by performance improvements. One of its new tokenomics strategies is committing a funding portfolio for middleware with the executed Unicove doorway beaming the new entrance process and enhancing user experience. Also, a staking rewards plan distributes $450 worth of EOS. The plan, which has been in motion for more than five months, has led to more people taking EOS while extending the token lock-up time to almost one month. These simple yet strategic tokenomics are the cornerstone that strengthens the EOS ecosystem. They show how versatile, robust, and appealing the system is. Most EOS token holders see the partnership between EOS and Ceffu as a step in the right direction. It would guarantee the security of assets across various networks.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 23:29:00

Bitcoin Argentina, one of the nation’s top pro-crypto pressure groups, made its claims in an official statement published on December 4. The NGO claimed that the National Securities Commission (CNV)’s move to force all crypto exchanges in the company to register and share client data runs counter to the policies of the “libertarian” President Javier Milei. Crypto Exchange Regulations Hurt Argentina’s Cause, NGO Claims Earlier this year, the CNV began policing exchanges for the first time, requiring them to adhere to the kind of regulations now commonplace in Western Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea. However, Bitcoin Argentina said that the CNV’s new registry system is bringing “distortions and inefficiencies” to the crypto sector. President Javier Milei’s approval rating recovered last month as the economy showed signs of recovery and inflation cooled to its lowest point in nearly three years. https://t.co/H5y3uO7JyP — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 4, 2024 The NGO said the regulator should scrap its policies and “limit its scope” to fighting “money laundering.” The CNV has committed itself to creating the registry, with all “digital asset service providers (PSAVs)” obliged to apply for operating permits. However, the NGO claims that the regulator is trying to fix non-existent issues “in a sector that currently operates without problems.” La Nina could thwart Argentina's run at bumper crops https://t.co/sqW2JQQhLa pic.twitter.com/yENcfcXaTE — Reuters (@Reuters) December 5, 2024 “The current system is not a far-off, uncertain, or new market. It is not a sector in crisis or emergency. It is an existing one. And it works well. While the new rules will benefit some players in the ecosystem, they will stifle the growth of others. And it will do nothing to prevent the emergence of future scams.” Bitcoin Argentina And Bitcoin Argentina went a step further, claiming that the rules also “pose a risk for the CNV itself” and for crypto traders in the country. The NGO explained that this was due to the fact that it fails to “provide greater security tools” and “will even create a false sense of security and supervision.” Essentially granting firms the CNV “seal of approval” in “a market that is eminently risky, asymmetric, global, and unmanageable” would be a major risk, it said. “Argentina has a unique opportunity to commit to deregulation and maintain the freedom that has yielded such good results so far. We could model that for the rest of the world.” Ricardo Mihura, Bitcoin Argentina President ‘A Burden for Smaller Businesses’ The NGO’s President Ricardo Mihura said he “cannot understand how the CNV” had chosen to “deviate from the government’s deregulatory approach and propose an inefficient regulatory burden.” The NGO also warned of “immediate consequences” for “small businesses and self-employed workers,” who would be “forced out of the sector or dragged into illegality.” “Regulatory costs” could also cripple “new” Argentinian crypto projects in the future, Mihura noted.

Desde BitcoinAr se presentó esta semana una posición formal respecto del proyecto de regulación del Registro de Proveedores de Servicios de Activos Virtuales… pic.twitter.com/iy6rHal6lc — ONG Bitcoin Argentina (@BitcoinAR) December 4, 2024 And Rodrigo Andragnes, the NGRO’s founder claimed that the CNV should “take the necessary technical time to analyze whether regulating PSAVs really adds value to the community.” Crypto adoption has rocketed in Argentina in recent years, with stablecoin and Bitcoin buying on the rise. IMF Role? Most think the CNV’s crypto exchange regulations were intended as a gesture of good faith to the Intentional Monetary Fund, which has previously expressed concerns about the nation’s lack of crypto regulation.

And the CNV has also held several BTC adoption-themed meetings with its counterparts in El Salvador. It has also hinted at its softening stance on crypto by attending local crypto summits .

What Next For Bitcoin Price Following Rally To $100,000 In a recent TradingView post, Xanrox suggested that the Bitcoin price will unlikely enjoy a sustained rally for now. He explained that this is unlikely because a sustained rally could easily put Bitcoin at $600,000 by December 2025, which is impossible. As such, he believes that BTC would need to slow down.

Xanrox remarked that the market needs to see a shakeout and a flash crash first before anything else. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $85,000 when this correction finally happens. Xanrox stated that the $85,000 level is a very reasonable support because it is the end of the massive FVG (fair value gap) on the daily candles. He added that this target is also the start of the first price action on the volume profile. The crypto analyst revealed that this is the level at which he is looking to buy Bitcoin. The crypto analyst indicated that this Bitcoin price rally to $100,000 is a bull trap, as he highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. He said this looks like a bull trap for retail traders because everyone would buy the breakout. As such, he envisages that Bitcoin would make a last push to sweep liquidity. A Major Correction Might Not Come Anytime Soon On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered a diverging opinion, suggesting that a major correction might not come anytime soon for the Bitcoin price. In his recent X post, he alluded to a previous post in which he stated that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally If this pattern holds true, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price won’t suffer its first major correction of between 15% to 30% until its hits $135,000 or even $159,000. Meanwhile, the accompanying chart put the market top for Bitcoin at $240,000, indicating that it will still have more room to move the upside even after this correction. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,800, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Monero (XMR) just hit a two-year high of $211, fuelled by growing interest in privacy coins. At the same time, Immutable X (IMX) has taken the Web3 gaming world by storm with its $1 million player rewards initiative alongside Yield Guild Games (YGG). But the crown jewel of short-term crypto plays might just be Qubetics ($TICS) . Its presale is smashing records, with $4.4 million already raised and projections of insane ROI that have investors buzzing. What makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the innovation. The project’s Multi-Chain Wallet aims to solve real-world headaches for users, from freelancers needing quick cross-border payments to businesses managing assets across multiple blockchains. This is more than hype—it’s crypto stepping up to meet the demands of the modern world. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Revolutionises Asset Management Qubetics is taking the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 11th stage of its presale, it has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising a whopping $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, this is an opportunity that screams potential. But you’ll need to act fast—the price is set to climb by 10% this weekend when the 12th stage begins. The standout feature of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet , a tool that’s set to revolutionise how we manage digital assets. Imagine being a freelancer working with clients in different countries, each paying you in a different cryptocurrency. Normally, you’d spend hours juggling wallets and calculating conversion fees. Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies all of this, consolidating your assets in one secure place and automating conversions at competitive rates. Click here to learn more about how Qubetics makes cross-border payments as easy as a walk in the park with its multi-chain wallet. For businesses, the potential is just as massive. Picture an e-commerce store accepting payments in multiple cryptos or a logistics company managing supply chain payments across different blockchains. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates the hassle, offering a seamless experience that saves time and money. And then there are the numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, a staggering 783% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS is expected to climb to $1, delivering 3,434% returns. If it reaches $15 after its mainnet launch, you’re looking at an unbelievable 52,912% ROI. Let’s break it down. A $12,500 investment at today’s price of $0.0282 could grow to $111,066 by the presale’s end. If $TICS hits $1, your $12.5K turns into $442,335. And if it rockets to $15? You’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $6.63 million. That’s not just a win; it’s a game-changer . Monero (XMR): Privacy Coins Make a Comeback Monero is back in the spotlight, hitting a two-year high of $211 before settling at $205.05. Privacy coins as a category have surged over 12% in just 24 hours, with Monero leading the charge. What’s behind the buzz? A landmark U.S. court ruling on Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts has reignited interest in privacy-centric cryptos. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to shield transaction details, offering a level of anonymity akin to physical cash. For advocates, this isn’t just a feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is increasingly under threat. Critics, of course, argue that privacy coins are magnets for illicit activity, but Monero has held its ground, even as regulatory scrutiny ramps up. The surge in Monero’s price also reflects broader market interest in privacy coins, with other tokens like Haven, Verge, and Zcash posting impressive weekly gains. As the debate over financial privacy heats up, Monero’s resilience makes it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for those betting on continued market momentum. Immutable X (IMX): Redefining Web3 Gaming Immutable X is making waves in the gaming industry, partnering with Yield Guild Games (YGG) to allocate $1 million towards player rewards. This isn’t just a feel-good initiative; it’s a strategic move to dominate the Web3 gaming landscape. The partnership aims to create new earning opportunities for players and developers while expanding the ecosystem with Immutable’s cutting-edge Passport wallet and zkEVM scaling solution. Why does this matter for short-term investors? The gaming industry is massive, and Immutable X is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 developers. Its sponsorship of YGG’s Play Summit and the GAM3 Awards in Manila underscores its commitment to fostering a community-driven gaming experience. As the hype around Web3 gaming grows, so does the potential for IMX to see significant price appreciation. IMX isn’t just about gaming; it’s about creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a gamer earning rewards or a developer building the next hit game, Immutable X offers a platform that’s both scalable and user-friendly. For short-term investors, the buzz around IMX and its increasing adoption in the gaming sector make it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term . As more developers and players flock to its platform, the likelihood of a price spike grows, making now the perfect time to get in on the action. The Final Word: Top Short-Term Crypto Picks for 2024 When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , Qubetics, Monero, and Immutable X stand out for their unique strengths and growth potential. Qubetics offers unparalleled ROI projections and game-changing tools like the Multi-Chain Wallet. Monero is riding the wave of renewed interest in privacy coins, while Immutable X is set to redefine gaming with its innovative approach to Web3. The clock’s ticking, though. The Qubetics presale price won’t stay this low for long, and the momentum behind Monero and IMX could lead to quick price spikes. Don’t sit this one out—take action now and position yourself for short-term gains that could make a lasting impact.

This bullish trajectory signals a seismic shift in its journey from niche digital currency to a global financial asset. During an interview, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offered insights into the asset’s historic rally and implications. He weighed in on regulatory shifts and leadership changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Surge to $103,900: What’s Driving It? Bitcoin crossed $103,900 for the first time, fueled by strong institutional interest and regulatory changes. Tenev highlighted how Bitcoin’s perception has shifted from being dismissed to being taken seriously. This notion was further supported by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who recently compared Bitcoin to gold. Powell positioned Bitcoin as a speculative asset that competes with gold, not the dollar. This reassured crypto supporters, affirming Bitcoin’s status as a store of value. Tenev also mentioned the growing idea of Bitcoin being used as a reserve asset, similar to gold in national reserves. Many see its limited supply and decentralized nature as valuable for wealth protection. Institutional investors and governments increasingly view Bitcoin as a long-term wealth safeguard. As Bitcoin’s value soared, Robinhood became a major player in facilitating crypto transactions. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto trades in November, a 400% increase from the previous month. This surge highlights growing retail investor interest, with Robinhood’s services making crypto more accessible. Tenev stressed that regulatory clarity is key to maintaining this momentum. Paul Atkins’ Nomination Brings Hope for Crypto-Friendly Regulation The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair has stirred optimism within the crypto industry. Known for his pro-business stance, Atkins is expected to bring a more balanced approach to crypto regulation. Tenev contrasted this with the current administration’s regulatory framework, which he described as hostile to crypto. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also supported Atkins’ nomination. Garlinghouse expressed hope that his leadership would prioritize clear guidelines over harsh enforcement. Tenev argued that supportive policies could drive innovation and stability for crypto firms, contrasting with Gary Gensler ’s more cautious regulatory approach. Clearer regulations, he believes, would boost confidence and growth in the crypto market. The Road Ahead: A Bullish Outlook Financial experts believe that Bitcoin’s price could reach $120,000 by the end of the year if current trends persist. This optimism is fueled by continued institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and a growing consensus that Bitcoin is here to stay . As Bitcoin cements its place as digital gold, discussions on its regulation and adoption will shape the financial future. With industry leaders driving innovation and policymakers like Atkins offering support, crypto assets’s future looks bright.

As December 2024 unfolds, a new wave of meme coins is here, sparking both curiosity and FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. What makes this month particularly special? It’s all about the coins that mix cheeky charm with serious growth potential. BTFD , Notcoin, and Memecoin are the headline-makers right now, each bringing a unique spin to the meme coin space. Whether you’re after explosive presales, viral campaigns, or chaotic unpredictability, these coins have something for everyone. Let’s dive into why they’re being hailed as the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BFTD: The Veteran Making Waves Again BFTD, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” stands out as a meme coin that has managed to balance its playful identity with meaningful innovation. In December 2024, BFTD has cemented its reputation as more than just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem offering significant value to its community. Investors are drawn not just by the meme culture but also by its ecosystem that includes P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a strong utility-first approach. Currently trading at $0.000064 in Stage 7 , BFTD’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling more than 23 billion tokens. With a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors stand to gain returns of over 800%. For example, an investment of $5,000 now could fetch approximately 78,203,125 tokens. When BFTD hits its listing price, that investment could grow to $46,921—a compelling reason why it’s hailed as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024 . The excitement doesn’t stop there. BFTD’s partnership with gaming platforms and its reward-driven ecosystem are key factors in its rising popularity. With over 2,400 holders and counting, BFTD is not just a meme coin but a movement. Its potential to rival the meme coin giants of the past makes it a must-watch this month. Notcoin: The Meme Coin with a Mission NOTCOIN takes meme culture to the next level by parodying the very concept of cryptocurrency. Its tagline, “This Is Not a Coin,” has sparked a wave of curiosity, turning it into a viral sensation. But behind its ironic branding lies a serious project that’s making waves in the crypto community. At its core, NOTCOIN is about decentralised governance. The coin’s holders vote on key project decisions, making it one of the most community-driven meme coins on the market. Its DAO structure is a refreshing departure from the typical top-down approach seen in many crypto projects. This unique governance model has earned NOTCOIN a dedicated following, cementing its place among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. . NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns are unmatched. Its recent stunt involving a billboard in Times Square that simply said “This Is Not a Coin” generated millions of impressions online. This kind of marketing, paired with its innovative features, is driving adoption at a rapid pace. At its current price of $0.00009, analysts predict it could reach $0.001 by mid-2025, making it a high-potential investment for those looking to ride the meme coin wave. NOTCOIN is also making strides in utility. It recently announced a partnership with a major social media platform to integrate tipping using NOTCOIN, bringing real-world use cases to its holders. Whether it’s for fun, governance, or potential profit, NOTCOIN offers something for every kind of investor. Memecoin: The Wild Card of December 2024 Memecoin is the wildcard in this month’s meme coin race. While its name might seem generic, its approach is anything but. MEMECOIN thrives on unpredictability, using its lack of a strict roadmap as a marketing tactic. This “no-plan plan” approach has drawn in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on chaos. The coin’s recent rise in popularity is fuelled by its outrageous marketing stunts and viral memes that capture the internet’s ever-changing zeitgeist. At its current price of $0.00005, MEMECOIN’s low entry point makes it an attractive option for new investors. While its long-term viability is uncertain, its potential for explosive short-term gains is undeniable. Many see it as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., purely for its entertainment value and speculative potential. Conclusion The world of meme coins is as dynamic as it is unpredictable, but one thing is clear: December 2024 belongs to BTFD and NOTCOIN. These two projects bring a mix of humour, utility, and community-driven energy that sets them apart. MEMECOIN adds an element of wild unpredictability to the mix, making it a must-watch for risk-takers. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., BTFD’s utility-rich ecosystem and NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns and governance model make them standout choices. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these high-potential projects.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 00:16:17

On Dec. 4, Kraken released its Crypto FOMO Survey 2024 , examining the impact of fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on U.S. crypto holders’ investment decisions. The survey polled 1,248 participants, revealing how emotions influence their approach to digital assets. Investors Feel They Missed the Boat A significant portion of respondents expressed regret over missed opportunities. Kraken reported that 88% of survey participants believe they’ve lost out on major gains. This sentiment has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally, which saw BTC hit the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 for the first time. Bitcoin has surged 126% since January, driving the broader crypto market. Altcoins have also seen substantial growth. XRP recently overtook Solana and Tether to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite feelings of missed opportunities, 84% of respondents remain optimistic about future crypto gains. Emotions Influence Decisions When asked about their greatest concerns, 60% cited sudden price surges as the biggest missed opportunity. Additionally, 81% admitted making investment decisions based on FUD, while 84% said they acted on FOMO during price spikes. The survey also revealed that 63% of participants believe emotional decisions have negatively impacted their portfolios. A Methodical Approach is Key While market sentiment plays a role in investment decisions, Kraken emphasized the importance of a calculated strategy. The exchange recommends leveraging technical analysis and planned trading strategies to navigate the volatile crypto market.

Here’s What to Watch For,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cutting-edge-coin-transform-blockchain-forever-heres-what-to-watch-for/,"Blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed, and with it comes a wave of groundbreaking innovations. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the crypto world lately, one name might already be buzzing on your radar— Lightchain AI . This isn’t just another blockchain project vying for attention. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI promises to merge the boundless possibilities of blockchain with the unparalleled power of AI. But can it transform blockchain forever? Let’s dig into what makes this cutting-edge coin so intriguing. Why Investors Can’t Stop Talking About Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has emerged as a beacon of innovation in the crowded crypto space. Here’s why investors, crypto enthusiasts, and tech pioneers are excited about its potential to transform the future of decentralized systems. 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Most blockchain systems rely on traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). While effective, these systems demand significant energy or financial commitments to validate transactions. Enter Proof of Intelligence (PoI) . Unlike PoW or PoS, PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computational AI tasks, such as training machine learning models or enhancing algorithms, while still maintaining the integrity and security of the network. This means Lightchain AI doesn’t just reward for validation—it pushes the boundaries of what a blockchain can achieve by tapping into the growing demand for advanced AI computations. 2. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Redefining Decentralized Applications At the heart of Lightchain AI ‘s innovation lies its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . Think of it as a powerful computational brain designed to supercharge decentralized applications (dApps). Where traditional virtual machines are limited by static capabilities, the AIVM is dynamic and adaptable. It allows developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks, from processing natural language data to running predictive analytics—all within a decentralized framework. The result? Smarter, more efficient applications that bring real-world AI power to blockchain technology. 3. A Transparent and Community-Driven Ecosystem Blockchain’s ethos has always been rooted in transparency and decentralization. Lightchain AI takes this to the next level with its Transparent AI Framework . Every decision made by its AI systems is auditable, fostering trust and accountability—a crucial factor for attracting institutional investors and enterprises. What’s more, Lightchain AI integrates decentralized governance, empowering token holders to propose and vote on key initiatives. Imagine having a say in the future of the very protocol you’re invested in—it’s not just about financial returns anymore; it’s about creating a lasting impact. The Lightchain AI Roadmap to Success Any project with bold claims needs a solid plan. Thankfully, Lightchain AI has a well-thought-out roadmap to guide its goals. Phase 1: Prototype Development Bringing the vision to life with early-stage development of PoI, AIVM, and the governance framework while building initial community support. Phase 2: Testnet Deployment Launching a test environment to fine-tune performance, gather user feedback, and ensure scalability. Phase 3: Mainnet Launch The big moment—fully activating the PoI and AIVM for widespread adoption, while simultaneously onboarding validators and expanding partnerships. With $1,063,817.84 already raised in its presale and a current price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is steadily building momentum. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Future of Blockchain The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting frontiers in tech, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Its ability to fuse AI computations with decentralized infrastructure has massive implications for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. Here’s why it stands out: Efficiency: PoI ensures resources are used for meaningful tasks, reducing waste and boosting productivity. Scalability: With AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI enables dApps to tackle increasingly complex AI operations. Impact: By making its AI systems transparent and accountable, Lightchain AI builds trust for enterprise-level adoption. But What About Risks? Like any innovative concept, Lightchain AI isn’t without its risks. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and investor returns can never be guaranteed. Additionally, as a cutting-edge project, Lightchain AI relies heavily on adoption and execution to fully realize its potential. That said, the team’s focus on usability and community-driven governance indicates strong fundamentals, which could make it a promising investment for long-term crypto enthusiasts. How to Get Involved with Lightchain AI You don’t have to wait for the official launch to be a part of this revolution. Lightchain AI’s presale is already live , offering early adopters discounted tokens and exclusive perks, such as governance voting rights and priority access to future ecosystem features.

The pool will also appeal to institutional and retail miners with a commission rate beginning at 0.4%. BitFuFu has also said that it will allocate all its self-mining hashrate to the new pool to boost its mining capability as a part of its expansion plan. Furthermore, the company has stated that as of now it owns 1,664 Bitcoins. BitFuFu Expands Offerings with New Bitcoin Mining Pool According to a latest release , BitFuFu has launched BitFuFu Pool, a private-label Bitcoin mining pool that offers commission rates from 0.4%. This new offering will be offered beginning next week through the BitFuFu application. The offering will be available to those who make purchases of cloud-mining products and miners. In addition, BitFuFu has decided to direct its entire self-mining hashrate to the new pool. This means that all of the computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining will now be channeled into BitFuFu Pool. This shift will boost the pool’s capacity and attract more miners looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to mine. More so, the company is also focusing on offering an array of services to both institutional and retail clients. These include real-time monitoring tools, firmware solutions, maintenance services, and a user-friendly platform for easy mining operations. The strategic development comes amid rising Bitcoin price and growing demand for more efficient mining services. However, after crossing the $100,000 mark, BTC price experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $97,640 in a sudden flash crash. This drop resulted in over $649 million in total liquidations across the crypto market and Bitcoin had $216.95 million in losses. Focus on Institutional Clients and Customized Services BitFuFu also mentioned that it will serve the institutional clients and provide them service by the means of consultation with the sales representatives. These services will assist the large scale miners to manage there business in the Bitcoin mining network. The BitFuFu Pool is currently primarily a Bitcoin mining pool, however, other digital assets are also on the roadmap. This expansion will thus enable the crypto mining company to expand its product portfolio and venture into other cryptocurrencies. The company’s strategic partners are going to be of great importance in this expansion. As of today, the crypto mining company holds a total of 1,664 BTC, reflecting its disciplined approach to treasury management. This strategy allows the company to accumulate Bitcoin through self-mining while also generating cash flow by providing cloud-mining services. Similarly, most recently, Hut 8 announced plans to raise $500 million through the sale of common stock under an ATM program. The proceeds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, enhancing its reserves. Additionally, the company revealed a $250 million stock repurchase program, aiming to buy back 5% of its outstanding shares over the next 12 months.

Additionally, for the first time since BTC crossed the $100,000 mark, it has failed to sustain this level, resulting in the liquidation of 208,389 traders’ positions. During this market dip, BTC’s price declined by 5.47% in just minutes, dropping from $98,338 to $92,957. However, since the drop, the price has rebounded as of press time. Bitcoin Current Price Momentum At press time, Bitcoin is trading near $96,935 and has recorded a price decline of over 2.10% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, this crash has attracted notable participation, as evidenced by the trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC’s trading volume surged by 98% during the same period. However, this price drop has created fear among traders, as there is no clear reason identified for the decline. This has raised concerns about whether the drop will happen again or if the market will now rebound.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 00:54:16

Decentralized finance in underserved regions Each partner brings their own unique expertise to the table. Creditcoin will lay the financial groundwork to create a blockchain-based ecosystem conducive to secure lending and borrowing. Spacecoin, on the other hand, focuses on connectivity by deploying advanced satellite technology to deliver internet access to underserved regions. Sui, a smart contract platform, is responsible for scalable and secure computing, while Walrus ensures efficient data management and decentralized storage availability. How Creditcoin, Spacecoin, Sui, and Walrus can work together Together, all parties can work on delivering a cohesive system and tackle challenges such as the lack of internet access and limited financial inclusion in certain areas. As mentioned, Spacecoin’s satellite network will provide connectivity in regions where the necessary infrastructure is lacking, allowing Creditcoin users worldwide to execute transactions more safely. In the meanwhile, Sui and Walrus scalability solutions are expected to streamline peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial interactions and data sharing without centralized intermediaries. Most importantly, the P2P module is expected to reduce operational costs and enhance transparency in the process. As such, the partnership aims to address the needs of the 37% of the global population that remains offline and/or underbanked. New global avenues in DeFi By integrating connectivity with DeFi solutions, the partnership opens up new avenues for potential clients in remote regions. New users will thus gain access to financial services and manage their assets online, fostering inclusivity and economic growth.

This stabilization comes after a period of downward pressure, raising speculations of a rebound on the horizon. With bulls showing signs of resilience, the stage is set for a comeback that could redefine BONK’s near-term trajectory. Will this level be the springboard for a recovery, or is further consolidation needed before the next move? Support Holds Steady: Signs Of A Bullish Rebound As market sentiment teeters between caution and optimism, determining the meme coin’s recent hold at the $0.00004002 support level is crucial in order for investors and traders to reevaluate their positions ahead of potential volatility. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says On the 4-hour chart, BONK is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $0.00004002 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $0.00006247 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, possibly opening the door to higher levels. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. When the RSI rises and reaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BONK the strength to push higher and test key resistance levels. BONK Performance On The Daily Time Frame BONK is showing signs of a potential upward movement on the daily chart, staying above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $0.00004002 support level. Its maintenance above this support provides a foundation for further growth. If BONK can maintain its position above this level and continue building momentum, it could pave the way for a breakout and more upside movement. Furthermore, the daily RSI shows signs of a rebound, maintaining a steady position above the 50% threshold. The continued trend above this level implies that the asset is in a favorable position for more gains, with the possibility of a sustained rally. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could indicate growing confidence among traders and signal positive price action for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness Thus far, BONK is at a pivotal moment, having found stability above the $0.00004002 support level and the daily 100-day SMA. If Bonk can sustain its position above this support and build on its current momentum, a potential recovery could be underway, possibly driving the price toward the $0.00006247 resistance level and beyond. Nonetheless, failure to maintain $0.00004002 may alter the meme coin’s direction to the downside, causing it to retest lower support zones such as $0.00002962 and $0.00002320.

While Q4 is generally a bullish quarter, the surge in Bitcoin’s price reportedly came on the back of increased institutional demand and strong buying activity from the US. Buying pressure coincides with the holiday season, which may enhance market euphoria due to the “Holiday Effect.” Will the phenomenon intensify BTC price before 2024 ends? Bitcoin could hit another record high before year-end Bitcoin price surpassed $100k on December 4 for the first time, leading to celebrations within the crypto community. Bitcoin maintained the range before dropping under the crucial level on December 5. According to CryptoQuant data, the rise was on the back of 2 things : institutional demand and sustained buying by US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from U.S. investors. pic.twitter.com/eZvKFCmVxs — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 5, 2024 At the time of writing, CoinGecko notes Bitcoin’s 24-hour range between $92,900 and $103,600. However, there is one reason to be optimistic that BTC will break the upper band due to the ‘Holiday Effect.’ Research has shown that returns are generally higher around the holidays and this phenomenon is called the Holiday Effect. Bitcoin’s $100k peak comes squished between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Papers cite that investor buying is because of “holiday euphoria” during this period. But , it is also likely that not all investors would participate in the market during this time. Considering it is also a festive time to spend with families or on vacations. Therefore, despite uncertainty about the trading volumes, stocks have seen the Holiday Effect. This also means, that if Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory, another record peak could be achieved before 2024 concludes. Bitcoin demand is a positive indicator What is noteworthy is that retail demand for Bitcoin is already on the rise since 2020. CryptoQuant research finds that the 30-day demand change from retail investors is currently at a record high. The reason is simple—retail investments could be backed by institutional trust. And the latter could be playing a role in the former. Bitcoin 30-day retail demand | Source: CryptoQuant The research shows that there is high demand even as long-term holders are selling to take profits. The report says, “Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top.” This essentially means that when a lot of everyday investors jump in, it can signal that Bitcoin’s price is nearing a short-term peak. However, this surge also shows more people are getting involved, which can boost overall market activity, the research suggests. The research underlined 2 potential scenarios . One where Bitcoin price moves sideways, as retail enthusiasm cools off. Second was if Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 mark. And since it did, the prediction is of another wave of excitement, potentially leading to a “euphoric” market phase where prices climb quickly. The key is to watch how retail and institutional investors interact as it is about long-term adoption. Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, told Cryptopolitan, “It [ $100k milestone] comes in a year that has seen Bitcoin more than double, including a 45-percent advance in less than four weeks following Trump’s presidential victory.” Shekhar also reminds us that it has been 16 years since Bitcoin’s creation and signals “mainstream adoption.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, believes that the $100k mark is not a number but a “psychological breakthrough.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-06 01:22:16

The Altcoin Season Index recently hit 86/100, signaling that smaller assets are outshining Bitcoin in performance. $ HBAR , $XRP, and Solana ($ SOL ) have led the charge, fueled by institutional interest, explosive parabolic moves, and ETF speculation. $ XRP , the original institutional darling, and XLM, its younger sibling, have become focal points for investors. Both share striking similarities: founders, bear-market scars, and ETF hopes, but their paths are diverging. Let’s dissect what makes these assets tick, and more importantly, whether they’re worth the hype—or just the latest victims of “chasing the pump.” Fundamentals: Story of Strengths and Weaknesses XRP’s Institutional Edge XRP has come a long way since its fight with the SEC. Now cleared, it’s riding on institutional narratives, with Ripple expanding its ecosystem by introducing its $RLUSD stablecoin. Institutions may soon get access via a spot ETF in early 2025 (pending SEC approval). These factors scream adoption potential, but there’s a darker side. Ripple still holds tens of billions of XRP, leading to inflationary pressure. This centralization raises questions: will institutions trust an asset so tightly controlled? And privacy concerns linger—something institutions care deeply about. XLM: A Grassroots Underdog XLM, once overshadowed by XRP, differentiates itself with a more decentralized vibe. Its 50% token burn in 2019 reduced supply drastically, giving it a more deflationary edge. However, its trading volume is 50% lower than XRP, and its network hasn’t seen the same explosive adoption narrative. Both assets seem poised for institutional adoption, but their tokenomics and growth models diverge significantly. XRP rides institutional coattails; XLM thrives on grassroots utility. Technicals: Reading the Charts XRP’s Parabolic Surge XRP’s 280%+ November gain has pushed it into overbought RSI levels unseen since the 2021 bull market peak. On the daily chart, RSI is above 80, while the weekly RSI washitting historic extremes—a sign of overextension. But this parabolic move doesn’t mean it’s game over. Let’s talk buy-the-dip zones—or more realistically, buy-the-dip zones, not levels. Here’s what stands out: 1. $2.29 (Fib 0.382): The first retracement area from the local top. Confluences with horizontal resistance turned support. 2. $1.91 (Fib 0.618): A deeper retracement, backed by the 50-day moving average and sitting below a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $1.96-$2.20. 3. $1.63 (Fib 0.786): Major multi-cycle support with a weekly confluence. 4. $1.28: The last low before November’s parabolic surge—a critical test of XRP’s strength. XLM’s Mirror Reflection XLM followed XRP’s November run with a 450% + gain. Its weekly chart shows similarities, but RSI levels are less extreme. $0.414 is a critical pivot point—lose it, and the sell-off could accelerate. The 200-week moving average is catching up, suggesting a potential safety net for long-term bulls. Altcoin Season Context The Altcoin Season Index at 86/100 confirms what we’ve seen: altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as market dominance shifts. However, this often comes with risks. Historically, strong altcoin rallies like this tend to precede sharp corrections. XRP and XLM, despite their gains, may be entering a distribution phase—a period when early buyers lock in profits, leaving new entrants to bear the risk. Source: coinmarketcap.com Summary: Timing the Market XRP and XLM are undeniably similar in history but vastly different in fundamentals. XRP’s centralized narrative contrasts with XLM’s grassroots approach, but both face headwinds of overextension, high market caps ($130 billion for XRP, $14.5 billion for XLM), and a “sell-the-news” backdrop. The best time to buy was during accumulation at $0.30 or $0.55, not after 300%-400% gains. The second best strategy? Patience. Don’t chase pumps; wait for discounts. As the saying goes: “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.” Buying into overbought RSI levels is a gamble, especially when macro conditions remain uncertain. With the DXY stabilizing and equity markets under pressure (Nasdaq and S&P500 are flatlining), December could bring the answers we need.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 01:36:00

Pudgy Penguins launched three years ago as a set of 8,888 NFTs depicting colorful and comical birds. Now, the team behind the project tells CoinDesk that they will release a token called PENGU this year on the Solana blockchain. Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Pudgy Rods and more. A further 22.02% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% are set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. ""With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle,"" the team shared in a statement.Pudgy is among the rare collections that managed to stay culturally relevant in the otherwise dreadful NFT business following the price crash from the 2021-2022 bull market. Many NFTs lacked real utility beyond being a digital brag. It was also difficult to fully realize gains after price bumps — as market liquidity was often inadequate to fill orders. The pivot comes as fun tokens and memecoins, unlike NFTs, have taken off and flourished in the last two years. Liquidity, relative cheapness, virality and ease-of-use are key reasons why people have flocked to these latest hot asset classes — even though fun tokens and memecoins fundamentally represent the same idea as NFT collections did: belonging to a passionate community. Official Pudgy Penguins channels have over 3 million followers across Instagram, X, TikTok and YouTube, and videos involving the characters have notched 32 billion views on Giphy. One of the brand's TikTok accounts is focused on spreading good vibes under the ""Pudgy Kindness"" moniker — popularizing it as a feel-good service in the mainstream, outside of crypto circles. It goes beyond screens too. Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection, and has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies that are carried at major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens. Pudgy Penguins is the third-largest NFT collection by market capitalization — $550 million in total — as of Thursday, data shows , trailing only CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club. The collection came to life in 2021, and each penguin is hand-drawn and features various distinct traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin.",Markets|Pudgy Penguins|NFT|Exclusive,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-06 02:00:11

Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, has successfully performed 2 billion transactions in a mere four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This marks a historic day for Cardano, marking not only its technical prowess but also a strong contender in DeFi.

Visa, recognized for its efficiency, handles approximately 0.72 billion transactions per day—less than half of what Hydra accomplished in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network has been processing over 9,900 transactions per second, surpassing Solana in transaction speed and confirming its image as a highly scalable blockchain technology. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has crossed 9,900 transactions per second surpassing Solana. pic.twitter.com/bAOJCOraMl — TapTools (@TapTools) December 2, 2024 Investors’ interest has also risen. ADA, Cardano’s native coin, just recaptured the $1 price despite the issue of 36.84 million tokens. Another projected unlock of $21.3 million worth of ADA represents only 0.05% of the circulating supply, implying that the influence on market dynamics may be modest. Nonetheless, Cardano’s ecosystem remains resilient, because of an emphasis on efficiency and innovation. Hoskinson’s Pride And Community Optimism Input Output’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is elated on the latest development. In a social media post commemorating Hydra’s milestone, he wrote, “Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right.” His satisfaction in Cardano’s accomplishments reflects the community’s confidence. Many people believe that Hydra’s capacity to execute enormous transaction volumes while lowering fees puts Cardano at the forefront of blockchain scalability. Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right https://t.co/uff9GusWyo — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 4, 2024 This optimism also applies to ADA’s potential price changes. A prominent community member recently stated that the blockchain’s developing DeFi ecosystem and strong emphasis on liquid staking could result in significant growth over the next market cycle. As Cardano continues to attract retail and institutional investors, expectations for ADA’s long-term value remain high. Shaping The Future Of DeFi Hydra’s achievement is more than simply a gain for Cardano; it demonstrates the expanding possibilities of blockchain technology. By outperforming traditional payment systems and other blockchains, Cardano has raised the bar for what is feasible in the DeFi market. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst As the blockchain industry continues to expand at a rapid pace, Cardano is quickly becoming more than simply a competitor. Recent results for Hydra point to even greater things to come for the platform. ADA’s price, at $1.23, shows a minor decline over the past 24 hours, but the 24.2% increase in the past week emphasizes mounting investor confidence. Cardano’s position on the blockchain is strengthened by Hydra’s capacity to handle billions of transactions in such a short period of time, hence maybe paving the path for more price rise. Driven by both retail and institutional interest, ADA’s value could experience constant increase as Cardano keeps proving its scalability and creativity.

New projects and existing powerhouses are shaking up the scene. Did you catch the news about the PGA Tour teaming up with LIV Golf for a massive $10 million prize paid entirely in Cronos (CRO)? Or Chainlink’s big play with Fortlake Asset Management, where they’re revolutionizing fund tokenization? These developments aren’t just headlines—they’re paving the way for crypto adoption across industries. But wait—there’s more. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the new kid on the block with game-changing features that promise to simplify digital payments like never before. Qubetics isn’t here to just exist; it’s solving problems that others haven’t cracked. From a non-custodial wallet with seamless integration into Apple Pay and Google Pay to a “No KYC” process, Qubetics is shaping up to be a real contender. The project is currently in Presale Phase 11, with tokens priced at $0.0282. With over 6,500 holders and $4.4M raised, it’s easy to see why early investors are calling it a golden opportunity. Let’s break it all down and see how Qubetics compares to big names like Chainlink and Cronos. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Everyday Crypto Payments Imagine this: you’re at your local coffee shop, and instead of fumbling through your wallet or scanning QR codes for crypto payments, you just tap your phone. That’s the vision Qubetics is bringing to life with its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. The wallet integrates with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop platforms, making crypto transactions feel as simple as swiping your debit card. What’s even cooler? The smart contract conversion mechanism. It converts crypto into fiat at the point of sale, so you don’t have to worry about wild price swings. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is focused on privacy. Their No KYC (Know Your Customer) feature ensures you can manage your assets without the hassle of uploading personal data. This is perfect for freelancers juggling international clients or small businesses tired of currency conversion fees. For instance, a small café could accept crypto payments without worrying about market volatility—it’s all converted to stable fiat instantly. As of now, 1 $TICS token is $0.0282, but don’t sleep on it. With weekly 10% price hikes during presale, this is a get-in-early moment. After the presale, prices are projected to hit $0.25, offering an impressive 900% ROI. So far, over 270M tokens have been sold. Qubetics isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement aiming to make crypto payments part of everyday life. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting the Blockchain Dots If you’ve been around crypto for a minute, you know Chainlink is the OG of connecting real-world data to blockchain networks. Lately, it’s been making moves with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which simplifies the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchains. Think of it like a universal translator, but for blockchains. This innovation is clutch in a world that’s becoming more interconnected. Chainlink isn’t stopping there. They’ve teamed up with Avalanche to launch low-latency Data Streams, powering GMX V2’s decentralized markets on both Arbitrum and Avalanche. These markets are already pulling in $50 billion in trading volume, and Chainlink is right in the middle of it all. And let’s not forget the numbers. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $23.63, with analysts predicting further upside as adoption grows. With Fortlake Asset Management tapping Chainlink for fund tokenization, traditional finance is finally catching up to blockchain tech. This makes Chainlink one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for long-term growth. Cronos (CRO): The Backbone of Crypto.com Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is quietly becoming a heavy hitter. With the announcement of the Crypto.com Showdown, where a $10 million prize will be paid entirely in CRO, it’s clear that Cronos is stepping into the limelight. This isn’t just a token—it’s an ecosystem, and it’s expanding fast. One of the standout developments is the launch of the Cronos zkEVM network. This zero-knowledge layer 2 network is all about speed and scalability, offering gasless transactions and a system secured by Ethereum. Translation? Cronos is solving the scalability issues that have plagued blockchain for years. Currently, CRO is trading at $0.208846, with potential for major growth as adoption increases. With partnerships across industries and a strong push for real-world use cases, Cronos isn’t just riding the wave—it’s making its own. Add this to your list of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, and you won’t regret it. Conclusion So, where should you park your crypto dollars this month? Based on the latest research, Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Cronos (CRO) are your top picks. Qubetics is redefining crypto payments with its non-custodial wallet and “No KYC” process.

Toncoin, linked to Telegram, has seen remarkable price growth, reflecting increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning it closer to its all-time high. Meanwhile, Fantom has experienced a significant price surge, marking a notable recovery from its recent low of $0.64, with its price soaring by 85% and positioning itself for a potential move towards $1.68. Amidst this market optimism, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a promising contender, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. Currently in Presale Phase 11, with each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is set to transform how we handle digital assets and everyday payments. Its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial institutions and payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, whether you’re on iOS, Android, or desktop. This means managing your crypto assets could become as simple as using your regular payment apps. One of the most anticipated features is the smart contract conversion mechanism, which automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale. This protects users from the volatility of the crypto market, ensuring stable and secure transactions. Moreover, Qubetics offers a No KYC process, allowing users to engage without extensive identity verification, thereby enhancing privacy and ease of use. Currently, in Presale Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. With each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, early investors have a unique opportunity. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. For small businesses, this means accepting crypto payments without worrying about market fluctuations, as the smart contract conversion ensures they receive the exact fiat amount expected . For individuals, managing and spending crypto becomes as easy as using traditional currencies, with the added benefit of privacy through the No KYC process. Toncoin (TON): Riding the Bullish Wave Toncoin, the cryptocurrency linked to Telegram, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The surge in TON’s price reflects increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning the cryptocurrency closer to its all-time high. This bullish trend is further supported by technical indicators. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) reinforce the uptrend, with the price remaining well above the short-term averages. If TON maintains its trajectory, it could break the resistance of $7.198 and target the $8 level in December. However, a reversal could test support levels at $6.6 and $5.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for TON nearly touched the overbought threshold of 70 before pulling back to its current level of 63. This suggests that while the buying momentum has weakened slightly, it remains relatively strong, indicating that buyers maintain a slight edge. If the RSI climbs back above 70, as it did in could regain momentum and test levels above $7.2, signaling another bullish breakout. Additionally, the supply of TON on exchanges has decreased to 1.68 million, down from 1.75 million on December 1. This significant outflow suggests reduced selling pressure and a possible shift to long-term holding or staking, which could support the upward price trend as selling liquidity dries up. For trts an opportunity to capitalize on TON’s bullish momentum. Monitoring key resistance and support levels, along with technical indicators like the RSI and EMAs, can provide insights into potential entry and exit points. Staying informed about market trends and on-chain metrics is crucial for making infoions. Fantom (FTM): A Surge Toward New Heights Fantom (FTM) has been on a roll, delivering an 85% price surge after rebounding from a low of $0.64. Its current trajectory has analysts buzzing, with predictions of a push toward $1.68 in the coming weeks. This growth is fueled by strong technical indicators and increasing adoption within its ecosystem. Fantom’s unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture sets it apart, offering speed and scalability that traditional blockchains can’t match. Developers and users are flocking to Fantom because of its low transaction costs and lightning-fast confirmation times. Projects built on Fantom’s platform are gaining traction, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming and NFT marketplaces. This activity isn’t just hype—it’s creating real value and driving up demand for FTM tokens. As of now, FTM is trading around $1.32, showing robust momentum. Analysts believe breaking above the $1.50 resistance level could pave the way for a rally to $1.68 and beyond. For those seeking the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Fantom is an exciting choice with a proven track record of innovation and adoption.

Cronos is climbing charts, promising lucrative gains, while EOS battles a market dip, raising questions about its resilience. Amid this, Qubetics has emerged as a game-changer, offering innovative solutions and attracting over 6,500 holders with a staggering $4.4 million raised during its presale. While Cronos and EOS battle market volatility, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out by addressing real-world challenges with its revolutionary non-custodial wallet—a feature traditional systems have failed to perfect. With a mainnet launch on the horizon and predictions of $10-15 per token, Qubetics is turning skeptics into believers. Let’s dive into how these three altcoins stack up and why they’re the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics: Pioneering Financial Autonomy with Its Non-Custodial Wallet In a world where crypto wallets often compromise privacy and control, Qubetics flips the narrative. The project’s non-custodial wallet promises users full autonomy over their finances—no middlemen, no restrictions, just seamless access to your assets. Custodial wallets are prime targets for hackers. High-profile breaches, like the Mt. Gox hack that cost investors over $450 million, highlight this vulnerability. By eliminating third-party control, Qubetics ensures your assets remain yours—always. Custodial wallets often require extensive KYC protocols, exposing sensitive personal data. Qubetics’ decentralised model prioritises anonymity, offering a secure haven for users who value privacy. Centralised systems impose restrictions on transactions, particularly in regions with stringent regulations. Qubetics empowers users by removing these barriers, making global financial inclusion a reality. For more information, watch this video . Presale Numbers and Predictions The buzz around Qubetics is undeniable. With over 270 million $TICS tokens sold at $0.0282 each and a presale tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear investors see immense potential. Analysts predict the token could reach $10-15 post-mainnet launch, making it a prime contender among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Cronos: On the Rise with Promising Upside Potential Cronos ($CRO) has been making waves, recently gaining attention for its upside potential. Analysts suggest the token could climb 31% to reach its next target, driven by growing adoption and strategic partnerships. Cronos is more than just a token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem designed to support DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s interoperability with Ethereum and Cosmos gives it a competitive edge, enabling seamless integration across blockchain platforms. Despite market fluctuations, Cronos has shown resilience. Recent reports highlight its potential for significant gains, especially as the ecosystem attracts more developers and projects. At its current price, investors see it as a golden opportunity among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. However, like any altcoin, Cronos isn’t immune to risks. The token’s performance hinges on broader market trends and the success of its ongoing developments. Still, for those willing to ride the wave, it’s an enticing prospect. EOS: A Contender Facing Market Challenges EOS has long been hailed as a blockchain with groundbreaking scalability and speed, but 2024 hasn’t been kind. Recent reports show a 10% dip, leading some to question its stability. While EOS faces challenges, its robust technology cannot be ignored. The platform’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model allows for faster transactions and lower fees, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. However, competition from newer, more versatile blockchains has put EOS in a tough spot. For EOS to reclaim its status as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, it must adapt. The community’s push for updates and strategic partnerships could reignite interest, but for now, cautious optimism is the name of the game. Investors should keep a close eye on market movements and project developments. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, Qubetics, Cronos, and EOS should be on your radar. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking innovations and $10-15 price prediction, leads the pack. Cronos offers promising gains, while EOS holds potential despite its challenges. The clock is ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever. Dive into Qubetics’ presale , explore Cronos, and keep an eye on EOS. Your next big crypto win could be just around the corner.

Gox Makes A $2.4 Billion Power Play,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-100k-and-mt-gox-makes-a-2-4-billion-power-play/,"Finally, Bitcoin has barreled past the $100,000 threshold, a level predicted by many crypto analysts in the last few months. A longtime inactive cryptocurrency exchange rode on the BTC price surge and transferred more than 24,000 coins to a new wallet. Bitcoin Reaches A Milestone Analysts said that after a long wait, Bitcoin got enough momentum to push its price beyond the $100,000 mark. This is the first time that the firstborn crypto was able to reach that level. At 3:08 a.m. today, Bitcoin recorded $104,000, a new all-time high for the alpha crypto. Mt. Gox transferred 24,052 $BTC ($2.43B) to a new wallet, “1N7jW,” an hour ago, right after the $BTC price broke through the $100K milestone. However, the new wallet is likely just an internal address. Currently, Mt. Gox still holds 15,826 $BTC ($1.63B) across 31 known wallet… pic.twitter.com/W1kyoSDEHc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 5, 2024 In previous months, many market observers gave their forecast that BTC could possibly achieve a six-figure price per coin. Now, those predictions have become a reality after the cryptocurrency rode on the positive sentiment brought by the impending return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House. As of writing, Bitcoin is being traded at $103,152, up by 6.6% in the last 24 hours, with a total market capitalization of over $2 trillion. Moving To A New Wallet A crypto intelligence website revealed that a long-defunct cryptocurrency exchange platform has decided to move more than 24,000 BTC to a new location. The inactive Mt. Gox crypto platform transferred 27,871 BTC to an undisclosed address, which some analysts believe was fueled by the digital currency’s hitting the $100,000 milestone. Arkham Intelligence said that Mt. Gox moved a big chunk of its Bitcoin holdings amounting to more than $2.8 billion. Reports revealed that the defunct crypto exchange did the transfer on December 5, moving its BTC to a new wallet that has no previous connection to any Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers in the past. According to analysts, the address of the wallet begins with “1N7j” and the BTC transfer was charged with a fee of $3.78. Some crypto analysts believed that the new address could be an internal wallet. Mt. Gox still holds 39,878 Bitcoin valued at around $4.1 billion following its latest move, according to Arkham Intelligence data . BTC Transfer, Not The First Time The defunct exchange had remained dormant since November 12 before the massive move. Before this BTC transfer, Mt. Gox moved around 262.782 BTC worth $27 million to an unknown wallet on November 12. In another transaction, the crypto platform also moved over 2,000 Bitcoin with a value of $238 million. Since Mt. Gox began its massive BTC transfers this year, many have been speculating about ongoing repayments to its creditors. The crypto exchange suffered a massive hack in 2011, leading to its bankruptcy in 2014, owing victims and creditors over $23 billion.
