($GME) shares experienced a massive boost on Thursday after a cryptic post by Keith Gill, the influential figure behind the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy. The post immediately reignited investor interest, causing GameStop’s shares to spike and the Roaring Kitty meme to pump. Roaring Kitty’s Cryptic Post Sends $GME Stock Soaring 15% – What’s His Next Move? Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” has once again stirred up the markets with a cryptic post on social media platform X . Gill, a key figure in GameStop’s 2021 retail trading frenzy, shared an image of a Time magazine cover featuring a computer with an old video player. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Known online as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and “DeepF***ingValue” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, Gill posted an image of a Time magazine cover with a computer screen on the social media platform X. The post triggered a 15% spike in GameStop’s stock price, leading to trading halts on platforms like Robinhood due to heightened volatility. The ripple effect extended to the digital asset market, where a GameStop-inspired meme coin on the Solana blockchain skyrocketed by 65%. Gill, a former financial adviser from Massachusetts, initially gained fame in 2021 by championing GameStop as a retail investor opportunity. This sparked a retail trading frenzy that sent the stock soaring over 10,000% at its peak. Roaring Kitty Returns: Keith Gill Sparks Market Chaos After Three-Year Silence Gill’s recent social media activity comes after a three-year hiatus, during which his followers eagerly awaited his return. Many see him as a symbol of retail investors’ triumph over Wall Street, likening him to a modern David against Goliath. The GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, sparked by Gill’s bullish posts, extended to other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment. The collective effort by Reddit users to squeeze hedge funds resulted in billions of dollars in losses for institutional investors and drew the attention of regulators. The dramatic events of the Reddit rally were later dramatized in Craig Gillespie’s 2023 film Dumb Money. The 2021 rally also raised questions about market fairness, particularly after trading restrictions were imposed on retail investors. These measures drew allegations of manipulation, as hedge funds held large short positions in GameStop during the peak of the trading frenzy. By Thursday afternoon, trading activity around GameStop had intensified, with about 300,000 options contracts changing hands—approximately 1.5 times the usual trading volume, according to a Reuters report . The stock’s 30-day implied volatility, a measure of expected short-term price movements, also jumped to 132%, marking a three-week high. Among the most popular trades were contracts betting that GameStop’s stock price would exceed $30 by the end of the week, with 32,000 such options traded by late afternoon. A Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, Chewy (CHWY), surged nearly 28% after the return of Roaring Kitty , famous for the GameStop short squeeze. Gill posted a cryptic image on X on September 6 , sparking speculation among traders. The post featured a Toy Story meme with the Chewy logo, which some interpreted as a signal that Gill might be stepping back from his role at Chewy. Despite no technical utility, meme coins like CHWY thrive on social sentiment, making Gill’s posts influential for traders.

On Dec. 5, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100,000 barrier, just weeks after surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12, as reported by TradingView. Shortly after, Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $104,000 at 3:08 a.m. UTC, roughly 90 minutes after breaking the $100,000 threshold. The surge was fueled by over $31 billion in net inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tightened supply due to Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April. Donald Trump’s Victory Boosts Bitcoin Rally Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, alongside speculation of a strategic Bitcoin national reserve and increased corporate adoption led by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Additionally, Trump’s Dec. 4 nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair has sparked optimism. This move could eliminate regulatory barriers that have hindered the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Trump’s pro-crypto cabinet includes Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as nominees for Secretary of Treasury and Commerce, respectively, potentially creating the most crypto-friendly administration to date. Bitcoin Up 126% in 2024 Bitcoin’s value has increased by 126% since Jan. 1, when it traded at $44,000. Its market capitalization has now reached a record $2 trillion for the first time. While Bitcoin’s 2024 rally is impressive, it isn’t its most dramatic. In 2017, Bitcoin soared 1,900%, rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. Similarly, between March 2020 and November 2021, it surged 1,250%, climbing from $5,100 to $69,000.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 22:55:00

Yesterday, Coinbase announced the listing of Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin. “Moo Deng (MOODENG) is now live on http://coinbase.com & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” Moo Deng is the name of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand, this past summer. The hippo has become an internet sensation, inspiring memes and memecoins alike. Moo Deng means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Our favorite bouncy pork a.k.a Moo Deng ?? #moodeng @KhaokheowZoo @MooDengSOL pic.twitter.com/5cJl9oJD82 — Moo Deng (@moodengx) December 1, 2024 In November, Moo Deng went viral again by correctly “ predicting ” the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Despite Moo Deng’s internet fame, MOODENG has faltered in the hours following the Coinbase listing. Approximately 24 hours following the memecoin’s addition to Coinbase, MOODENG is down 12.4%. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto markets are largely surging following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) historic breakthrough of $100,000. In stark contrast with MOODENG’s struggles, another Solana-based memecoin ripped after Coinbase added support on Wednesday. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, pumped up 51% after the top US crypto exchange listed the memecoin.

Ceffu is an institutional partner of Binance, and this arrangement will support the EOS mainnet. The partnership will be critical in unlocking the new CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders while providing institutional-grade custodian services. Ceffu’s advanced custody infrastructure guarantees the institution’s safety on its EOS assets. Relying on multi-party computation and customized approval schemes highlights how seriously the firm has taken security matters. The arrangement will allow institutional fund handlers to use CeDeFi strategies that grasp the best of CEX and DeFi ecosystems. Through Binance liquidity and robust trading styles, EOS token holders can access the innovative yield solution tailored to institutional needs. With this partnership, though, there is a growing focus on institutional solutions. EOS seems to alienate retail holders and small-scale entities, so this partnership may bring very few benefits to small-scale blockchain users. EOS remains one of the top blockchain platforms With EOS featured on the Coinbase COIN50 index , its popularity and interest are growing among institutions. This recognition shows that EOS is among the leading blockchain platforms and an integral player in the crypto ecosystem. According to Yves La Rose, Founder & CEO of EOS Network Foundation, Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. He added that by partnering with Ceffu, they are creating new pathways for institutions to participate securely in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities. The EOS network is significant in this partnership. The third-generation blockchain that operates on the EOS virtual machine is set for high-speed and low-cost transactions. The design supports seamless Web3 for all players, developers, and users alike. Even though the partnership looks good, Ceffu’s ties with Binance might be a regulatory risk. Binance is sustainedly scrutinized in several jurisdictions. High innovations with strategic tokenomics build the EOS ecosystem Due to approved community tokenomics, EOS has seen regular growth, enhanced by performance improvements. One of its new tokenomics strategies is committing a funding portfolio for middleware with the executed Unicove doorway beaming the new entrance process and enhancing user experience. Also, a staking rewards plan distributes $450 worth of EOS. The plan, which has been in motion for more than five months, has led to more people taking EOS while extending the token lock-up time to almost one month. These simple yet strategic tokenomics are the cornerstone that strengthens the EOS ecosystem. They show how versatile, robust, and appealing the system is. Most EOS token holders see the partnership between EOS and Ceffu as a step in the right direction. It would guarantee the security of assets across various networks.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 23:29:00

Bitcoin Argentina, one of the nation’s top pro-crypto pressure groups, made its claims in an official statement published on December 4. The NGO claimed that the National Securities Commission (CNV)’s move to force all crypto exchanges in the company to register and share client data runs counter to the policies of the “libertarian” President Javier Milei. Crypto Exchange Regulations Hurt Argentina’s Cause, NGO Claims Earlier this year, the CNV began policing exchanges for the first time, requiring them to adhere to the kind of regulations now commonplace in Western Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea. However, Bitcoin Argentina said that the CNV’s new registry system is bringing “distortions and inefficiencies” to the crypto sector. President Javier Milei’s approval rating recovered last month as the economy showed signs of recovery and inflation cooled to its lowest point in nearly three years. https://t.co/H5y3uO7JyP — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 4, 2024 The NGO said the regulator should scrap its policies and “limit its scope” to fighting “money laundering.” The CNV has committed itself to creating the registry, with all “digital asset service providers (PSAVs)” obliged to apply for operating permits. However, the NGO claims that the regulator is trying to fix non-existent issues “in a sector that currently operates without problems.” La Nina could thwart Argentina's run at bumper crops https://t.co/sqW2JQQhLa pic.twitter.com/yENcfcXaTE — Reuters (@Reuters) December 5, 2024 “The current system is not a far-off, uncertain, or new market. It is not a sector in crisis or emergency. It is an existing one. And it works well. While the new rules will benefit some players in the ecosystem, they will stifle the growth of others. And it will do nothing to prevent the emergence of future scams.” Bitcoin Argentina And Bitcoin Argentina went a step further, claiming that the rules also “pose a risk for the CNV itself” and for crypto traders in the country. The NGO explained that this was due to the fact that it fails to “provide greater security tools” and “will even create a false sense of security and supervision.” Essentially granting firms the CNV “seal of approval” in “a market that is eminently risky, asymmetric, global, and unmanageable” would be a major risk, it said. “Argentina has a unique opportunity to commit to deregulation and maintain the freedom that has yielded such good results so far. We could model that for the rest of the world.” Ricardo Mihura, Bitcoin Argentina President ‘A Burden for Smaller Businesses’ The NGO’s President Ricardo Mihura said he “cannot understand how the CNV” had chosen to “deviate from the government’s deregulatory approach and propose an inefficient regulatory burden.” The NGO also warned of “immediate consequences” for “small businesses and self-employed workers,” who would be “forced out of the sector or dragged into illegality.” “Regulatory costs” could also cripple “new” Argentinian crypto projects in the future, Mihura noted.

Desde BitcoinAr se presentó esta semana una posición formal respecto del proyecto de regulación del Registro de Proveedores de Servicios de Activos Virtuales… pic.twitter.com/iy6rHal6lc — ONG Bitcoin Argentina (@BitcoinAR) December 4, 2024 And Rodrigo Andragnes, the NGRO’s founder claimed that the CNV should “take the necessary technical time to analyze whether regulating PSAVs really adds value to the community.” Crypto adoption has rocketed in Argentina in recent years, with stablecoin and Bitcoin buying on the rise. IMF Role? Most think the CNV’s crypto exchange regulations were intended as a gesture of good faith to the Intentional Monetary Fund, which has previously expressed concerns about the nation’s lack of crypto regulation. IMF approves third review of Ghana's $3 billion programme https://t.co/GvrDSptvmU pic.twitter.com/XxTGDS4NTv — Reuters (@Reuters) December 2, 2024 However, the media outlet c5n noted that the new registry system has sparked “criticism within the cryptocurrency community.” Some have even “questioned the position of President Milei” for “allowing such regulation.” Milei has previously spoken in favor of Bitcoin. And the CNV has also held several BTC adoption-themed meetings with its counterparts in El Salvador. It has also hinted at its softening stance on crypto by attending local crypto summits . Earlier this year, Vice President Victoria Villarruel held BTC-themed talks with El Salvador’s head of state Nayib Bukele .

What Next For Bitcoin Price Following Rally To $100,000 In a recent TradingView post, Xanrox suggested that the Bitcoin price will unlikely enjoy a sustained rally for now. He explained that this is unlikely because a sustained rally could easily put Bitcoin at $600,000 by December 2025, which is impossible. As such, he believes that BTC would need to slow down.

Xanrox remarked that the market needs to see a shakeout and a flash crash first before anything else. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $85,000 when this correction finally happens. Xanrox stated that the $85,000 level is a very reasonable support because it is the end of the massive FVG (fair value gap) on the daily candles. He added that this target is also the start of the first price action on the volume profile. The crypto analyst revealed that this is the level at which he is looking to buy Bitcoin. The crypto analyst indicated that this Bitcoin price rally to $100,000 is a bull trap, as he highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. He said this looks like a bull trap for retail traders because everyone would buy the breakout. As such, he envisages that Bitcoin would make a last push to sweep liquidity. A Major Correction Might Not Come Anytime Soon On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered a diverging opinion, suggesting that a major correction might not come anytime soon for the Bitcoin price. In his recent X post, he alluded to a previous post in which he stated that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally If this pattern holds true, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price won’t suffer its first major correction of between 15% to 30% until its hits $135,000 or even $159,000. Meanwhile, the accompanying chart put the market top for Bitcoin at $240,000, indicating that it will still have more room to move the upside even after this correction. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,800, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Monero (XMR) just hit a two-year high of $211, fuelled by growing interest in privacy coins. At the same time, Immutable X (IMX) has taken the Web3 gaming world by storm with its $1 million player rewards initiative alongside Yield Guild Games (YGG). But the crown jewel of short-term crypto plays might just be Qubetics ($TICS) . Its presale is smashing records, with $4.4 million already raised and projections of insane ROI that have investors buzzing. What makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the innovation. The project’s Multi-Chain Wallet aims to solve real-world headaches for users, from freelancers needing quick cross-border payments to businesses managing assets across multiple blockchains. This is more than hype—it’s crypto stepping up to meet the demands of the modern world. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Revolutionises Asset Management Qubetics is taking the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 11th stage of its presale, it has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising a whopping $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, this is an opportunity that screams potential. But you’ll need to act fast—the price is set to climb by 10% this weekend when the 12th stage begins. The standout feature of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet , a tool that’s set to revolutionise how we manage digital assets. Imagine being a freelancer working with clients in different countries, each paying you in a different cryptocurrency. Normally, you’d spend hours juggling wallets and calculating conversion fees. Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies all of this, consolidating your assets in one secure place and automating conversions at competitive rates. Click here to learn more about how Qubetics makes cross-border payments as easy as a walk in the park with its multi-chain wallet. For businesses, the potential is just as massive. Picture an e-commerce store accepting payments in multiple cryptos or a logistics company managing supply chain payments across different blockchains. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates the hassle, offering a seamless experience that saves time and money. And then there are the numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, a staggering 783% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS is expected to climb to $1, delivering 3,434% returns. If it reaches $15 after its mainnet launch, you’re looking at an unbelievable 52,912% ROI. Let’s break it down. A $12,500 investment at today’s price of $0.0282 could grow to $111,066 by the presale’s end. If $TICS hits $1, your $12.5K turns into $442,335. And if it rockets to $15? You’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $6.63 million. That’s not just a win; it’s a game-changer . Monero (XMR): Privacy Coins Make a Comeback Monero is back in the spotlight, hitting a two-year high of $211 before settling at $205.05. Privacy coins as a category have surged over 12% in just 24 hours, with Monero leading the charge. What’s behind the buzz? A landmark U.S. court ruling on Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts has reignited interest in privacy-centric cryptos. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to shield transaction details, offering a level of anonymity akin to physical cash. For advocates, this isn’t just a feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is increasingly under threat. Critics, of course, argue that privacy coins are magnets for illicit activity, but Monero has held its ground, even as regulatory scrutiny ramps up. The surge in Monero’s price also reflects broader market interest in privacy coins, with other tokens like Haven, Verge, and Zcash posting impressive weekly gains. As the debate over financial privacy heats up, Monero’s resilience makes it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for those betting on continued market momentum. Immutable X (IMX): Redefining Web3 Gaming Immutable X is making waves in the gaming industry, partnering with Yield Guild Games (YGG) to allocate $1 million towards player rewards. This isn’t just a feel-good initiative; it’s a strategic move to dominate the Web3 gaming landscape. The partnership aims to create new earning opportunities for players and developers while expanding the ecosystem with Immutable’s cutting-edge Passport wallet and zkEVM scaling solution. Why does this matter for short-term investors? The gaming industry is massive, and Immutable X is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 developers. Its sponsorship of YGG’s Play Summit and the GAM3 Awards in Manila underscores its commitment to fostering a community-driven gaming experience. As the hype around Web3 gaming grows, so does the potential for IMX to see significant price appreciation. IMX isn’t just about gaming; it’s about creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a gamer earning rewards or a developer building the next hit game, Immutable X offers a platform that’s both scalable and user-friendly. For short-term investors, the buzz around IMX and its increasing adoption in the gaming sector make it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term . As more developers and players flock to its platform, the likelihood of a price spike grows, making now the perfect time to get in on the action. The Final Word: Top Short-Term Crypto Picks for 2024 When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , Qubetics, Monero, and Immutable X stand out for their unique strengths and growth potential. Qubetics offers unparalleled ROI projections and game-changing tools like the Multi-Chain Wallet. Monero is riding the wave of renewed interest in privacy coins, while Immutable X is set to redefine gaming with its innovative approach to Web3. The clock’s ticking, though. The Qubetics presale price won’t stay this low for long, and the momentum behind Monero and IMX could lead to quick price spikes. Don’t sit this one out—take action now and position yourself for short-term gains that could make a lasting impact.

This bullish trajectory signals a seismic shift in its journey from niche digital currency to a global financial asset. During an interview, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offered insights into the asset’s historic rally and implications. He weighed in on regulatory shifts and leadership changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Surge to $103,900: What’s Driving It? Bitcoin crossed $103,900 for the first time, fueled by strong institutional interest and regulatory changes. Tenev highlighted how Bitcoin’s perception has shifted from being dismissed to being taken seriously. This notion was further supported by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who recently compared Bitcoin to gold. Powell positioned Bitcoin as a speculative asset that competes with gold, not the dollar. This reassured crypto supporters, affirming Bitcoin’s status as a store of value. Tenev also mentioned the growing idea of Bitcoin being used as a reserve asset, similar to gold in national reserves. Many see its limited supply and decentralized nature as valuable for wealth protection. Institutional investors and governments increasingly view Bitcoin as a long-term wealth safeguard. As Bitcoin’s value soared, Robinhood became a major player in facilitating crypto transactions. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto trades in November, a 400% increase from the previous month. This surge highlights growing retail investor interest, with Robinhood’s services making crypto more accessible. Tenev stressed that regulatory clarity is key to maintaining this momentum. Paul Atkins’ Nomination Brings Hope for Crypto-Friendly Regulation The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair has stirred optimism within the crypto industry. Known for his pro-business stance, Atkins is expected to bring a more balanced approach to crypto regulation. Tenev contrasted this with the current administration’s regulatory framework, which he described as hostile to crypto. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also supported Atkins’ nomination. Garlinghouse expressed hope that his leadership would prioritize clear guidelines over harsh enforcement. Tenev argued that supportive policies could drive innovation and stability for crypto firms, contrasting with Gary Gensler ’s more cautious regulatory approach. Clearer regulations, he believes, would boost confidence and growth in the crypto market. The Road Ahead: A Bullish Outlook Financial experts believe that Bitcoin’s price could reach $120,000 by the end of the year if current trends persist. This optimism is fueled by continued institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and a growing consensus that Bitcoin is here to stay . As Bitcoin cements its place as digital gold, discussions on its regulation and adoption will shape the financial future. With industry leaders driving innovation and policymakers like Atkins offering support, crypto assets’s future looks bright.

As December 2024 unfolds, a new wave of meme coins is here, sparking both curiosity and FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. What makes this month particularly special? It’s all about the coins that mix cheeky charm with serious growth potential. BTFD , Notcoin, and Memecoin are the headline-makers right now, each bringing a unique spin to the meme coin space. Whether you’re after explosive presales, viral campaigns, or chaotic unpredictability, these coins have something for everyone. Let’s dive into why they’re being hailed as the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BFTD: The Veteran Making Waves Again BFTD, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” stands out as a meme coin that has managed to balance its playful identity with meaningful innovation. In December 2024, BFTD has cemented its reputation as more than just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem offering significant value to its community. Investors are drawn not just by the meme culture but also by its ecosystem that includes P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a strong utility-first approach. Currently trading at $0.000064 in Stage 7 , BFTD’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling more than 23 billion tokens. With a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors stand to gain returns of over 800%. For example, an investment of $5,000 now could fetch approximately 78,203,125 tokens. When BFTD hits its listing price, that investment could grow to $46,921—a compelling reason why it’s hailed as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024 . The excitement doesn’t stop there. BFTD’s partnership with gaming platforms and its reward-driven ecosystem are key factors in its rising popularity. With over 2,400 holders and counting, BFTD is not just a meme coin but a movement. Its potential to rival the meme coin giants of the past makes it a must-watch this month. Notcoin: The Meme Coin with a Mission NOTCOIN takes meme culture to the next level by parodying the very concept of cryptocurrency. Its tagline, “This Is Not a Coin,” has sparked a wave of curiosity, turning it into a viral sensation. But behind its ironic branding lies a serious project that’s making waves in the crypto community. At its core, NOTCOIN is about decentralised governance. The coin’s holders vote on key project decisions, making it one of the most community-driven meme coins on the market. Its DAO structure is a refreshing departure from the typical top-down approach seen in many crypto projects. This unique governance model has earned NOTCOIN a dedicated following, cementing its place among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. . NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns are unmatched. Its recent stunt involving a billboard in Times Square that simply said “This Is Not a Coin” generated millions of impressions online. This kind of marketing, paired with its innovative features, is driving adoption at a rapid pace. At its current price of $0.00009, analysts predict it could reach $0.001 by mid-2025, making it a high-potential investment for those looking to ride the meme coin wave. NOTCOIN is also making strides in utility. It recently announced a partnership with a major social media platform to integrate tipping using NOTCOIN, bringing real-world use cases to its holders. Whether it’s for fun, governance, or potential profit, NOTCOIN offers something for every kind of investor. Memecoin: The Wild Card of December 2024 Memecoin is the wildcard in this month’s meme coin race. While its name might seem generic, its approach is anything but. MEMECOIN thrives on unpredictability, using its lack of a strict roadmap as a marketing tactic. This “no-plan plan” approach has drawn in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on chaos. The coin’s recent rise in popularity is fuelled by its outrageous marketing stunts and viral memes that capture the internet’s ever-changing zeitgeist. At its current price of $0.00005, MEMECOIN’s low entry point makes it an attractive option for new investors. While its long-term viability is uncertain, its potential for explosive short-term gains is undeniable. Many see it as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., purely for its entertainment value and speculative potential. Conclusion The world of meme coins is as dynamic as it is unpredictable, but one thing is clear: December 2024 belongs to BTFD and NOTCOIN. These two projects bring a mix of humour, utility, and community-driven energy that sets them apart. MEMECOIN adds an element of wild unpredictability to the mix, making it a must-watch for risk-takers. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., BTFD’s utility-rich ecosystem and NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns and governance model make them standout choices. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these high-potential projects.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 00:16:17

On Dec. 4, Kraken released its Crypto FOMO Survey 2024 , examining the impact of fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on U.S. crypto holders’ investment decisions. The survey polled 1,248 participants, revealing how emotions influence their approach to digital assets. Investors Feel They Missed the Boat A significant portion of respondents expressed regret over missed opportunities. Kraken reported that 88% of survey participants believe they’ve lost out on major gains. This sentiment has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally, which saw BTC hit the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 for the first time. Bitcoin has surged 126% since January, driving the broader crypto market. Altcoins have also seen substantial growth. XRP recently overtook Solana and Tether to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite feelings of missed opportunities, 84% of respondents remain optimistic about future crypto gains. Emotions Influence Decisions When asked about their greatest concerns, 60% cited sudden price surges as the biggest missed opportunity. Additionally, 81% admitted making investment decisions based on FUD, while 84% said they acted on FOMO during price spikes. The survey also revealed that 63% of participants believe emotional decisions have negatively impacted their portfolios. A Methodical Approach is Key While market sentiment plays a role in investment decisions, Kraken emphasized the importance of a calculated strategy. The exchange recommends leveraging technical analysis and planned trading strategies to navigate the volatile crypto market.

Here’s What to Watch For,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cutting-edge-coin-transform-blockchain-forever-heres-what-to-watch-for/,"Blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed, and with it comes a wave of groundbreaking innovations. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the crypto world lately, one name might already be buzzing on your radar— Lightchain AI . This isn’t just another blockchain project vying for attention. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI promises to merge the boundless possibilities of blockchain with the unparalleled power of AI. But can it transform blockchain forever? Let’s dig into what makes this cutting-edge coin so intriguing. Why Investors Can’t Stop Talking About Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has emerged as a beacon of innovation in the crowded crypto space. Here’s why investors, crypto enthusiasts, and tech pioneers are excited about its potential to transform the future of decentralized systems. 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Most blockchain systems rely on traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). While effective, these systems demand significant energy or financial commitments to validate transactions. Enter Proof of Intelligence (PoI) . Unlike PoW or PoS, PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computational AI tasks, such as training machine learning models or enhancing algorithms, while still maintaining the integrity and security of the network. This means Lightchain AI doesn’t just reward for validation—it pushes the boundaries of what a blockchain can achieve by tapping into the growing demand for advanced AI computations. 2. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Redefining Decentralized Applications At the heart of Lightchain AI ‘s innovation lies its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . Think of it as a powerful computational brain designed to supercharge decentralized applications (dApps). Where traditional virtual machines are limited by static capabilities, the AIVM is dynamic and adaptable. It allows developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks, from processing natural language data to running predictive analytics—all within a decentralized framework. The result? Smarter, more efficient applications that bring real-world AI power to blockchain technology. 3. A Transparent and Community-Driven Ecosystem Blockchain’s ethos has always been rooted in transparency and decentralization. Lightchain AI takes this to the next level with its Transparent AI Framework . Every decision made by its AI systems is auditable, fostering trust and accountability—a crucial factor for attracting institutional investors and enterprises. What’s more, Lightchain AI integrates decentralized governance, empowering token holders to propose and vote on key initiatives. Imagine having a say in the future of the very protocol you’re invested in—it’s not just about financial returns anymore; it’s about creating a lasting impact. The Lightchain AI Roadmap to Success Any project with bold claims needs a solid plan. Thankfully, Lightchain AI has a well-thought-out roadmap to guide its goals. Phase 1: Prototype Development Bringing the vision to life with early-stage development of PoI, AIVM, and the governance framework while building initial community support. Phase 2: Testnet Deployment Launching a test environment to fine-tune performance, gather user feedback, and ensure scalability. Phase 3: Mainnet Launch The big moment—fully activating the PoI and AIVM for widespread adoption, while simultaneously onboarding validators and expanding partnerships. With $1,063,817.84 already raised in its presale and a current price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is steadily building momentum. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Future of Blockchain The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting frontiers in tech, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Its ability to fuse AI computations with decentralized infrastructure has massive implications for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. Here’s why it stands out: Efficiency: PoI ensures resources are used for meaningful tasks, reducing waste and boosting productivity. Scalability: With AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI enables dApps to tackle increasingly complex AI operations. Impact: By making its AI systems transparent and accountable, Lightchain AI builds trust for enterprise-level adoption. But What About Risks? Like any innovative concept, Lightchain AI isn’t without its risks. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and investor returns can never be guaranteed. Additionally, as a cutting-edge project, Lightchain AI relies heavily on adoption and execution to fully realize its potential. That said, the team’s focus on usability and community-driven governance indicates strong fundamentals, which could make it a promising investment for long-term crypto enthusiasts. How to Get Involved with Lightchain AI You don’t have to wait for the official launch to be a part of this revolution. Lightchain AI’s presale is already live , offering early adopters discounted tokens and exclusive perks, such as governance voting rights and priority access to future ecosystem features.

The pool will also appeal to institutional and retail miners with a commission rate beginning at 0.4%. BitFuFu has also said that it will allocate all its self-mining hashrate to the new pool to boost its mining capability as a part of its expansion plan. Furthermore, the company has stated that as of now it owns 1,664 Bitcoins. BitFuFu Expands Offerings with New Bitcoin Mining Pool According to a latest release , BitFuFu has launched BitFuFu Pool, a private-label Bitcoin mining pool that offers commission rates from 0.4%. This new offering will be offered beginning next week through the BitFuFu application. The offering will be available to those who make purchases of cloud-mining products and miners. In addition, BitFuFu has decided to direct its entire self-mining hashrate to the new pool. This means that all of the computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining will now be channeled into BitFuFu Pool. This shift will boost the pool’s capacity and attract more miners looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to mine. More so, the company is also focusing on offering an array of services to both institutional and retail clients. These include real-time monitoring tools, firmware solutions, maintenance services, and a user-friendly platform for easy mining operations. The strategic development comes amid rising Bitcoin price and growing demand for more efficient mining services. However, after crossing the $100,000 mark, BTC price experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $97,640 in a sudden flash crash. This drop resulted in over $649 million in total liquidations across the crypto market and Bitcoin had $216.95 million in losses. Focus on Institutional Clients and Customized Services BitFuFu also mentioned that it will serve the institutional clients and provide them service by the means of consultation with the sales representatives. These services will assist the large scale miners to manage there business in the Bitcoin mining network. The BitFuFu Pool is currently primarily a Bitcoin mining pool, however, other digital assets are also on the roadmap. This expansion will thus enable the crypto mining company to expand its product portfolio and venture into other cryptocurrencies. The company’s strategic partners are going to be of great importance in this expansion. As of today, the crypto mining company holds a total of 1,664 BTC, reflecting its disciplined approach to treasury management. This strategy allows the company to accumulate Bitcoin through self-mining while also generating cash flow by providing cloud-mining services. Similarly, most recently, Hut 8 announced plans to raise $500 million through the sale of common stock under an ATM program. The proceeds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, enhancing its reserves. Additionally, the company revealed a $250 million stock repurchase program, aiming to buy back 5% of its outstanding shares over the next 12 months.

Additionally, for the first time since BTC crossed the $100,000 mark, it has failed to sustain this level, resulting in the liquidation of 208,389 traders’ positions. During this market dip, BTC’s price declined by 5.47% in just minutes, dropping from $98,338 to $92,957. However, since the drop, the price has rebounded as of press time. Bitcoin Current Price Momentum At press time, Bitcoin is trading near $96,935 and has recorded a price decline of over 2.10% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, this crash has attracted notable participation, as evidenced by the trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC’s trading volume surged by 98% during the same period. However, this price drop has created fear among traders, as there is no clear reason identified for the decline. This has raised concerns about whether the drop will happen again or if the market will now rebound.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 00:54:16

Decentralized finance in underserved regions Each partner brings their own unique expertise to the table. Creditcoin will lay the financial groundwork to create a blockchain-based ecosystem conducive to secure lending and borrowing. Spacecoin, on the other hand, focuses on connectivity by deploying advanced satellite technology to deliver internet access to underserved regions. Sui, a smart contract platform, is responsible for scalable and secure computing, while Walrus ensures efficient data management and decentralized storage availability. How Creditcoin, Spacecoin, Sui, and Walrus can work together Together, all parties can work on delivering a cohesive system and tackle challenges such as the lack of internet access and limited financial inclusion in certain areas. As mentioned, Spacecoin’s satellite network will provide connectivity in regions where the necessary infrastructure is lacking, allowing Creditcoin users worldwide to execute transactions more safely. In the meanwhile, Sui and Walrus scalability solutions are expected to streamline peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial interactions and data sharing without centralized intermediaries. Most importantly, the P2P module is expected to reduce operational costs and enhance transparency in the process. As such, the partnership aims to address the needs of the 37% of the global population that remains offline and/or underbanked. New global avenues in DeFi By integrating connectivity with DeFi solutions, the partnership opens up new avenues for potential clients in remote regions. New users will thus gain access to financial services and manage their assets online, fostering inclusivity and economic growth.

This stabilization comes after a period of downward pressure, raising speculations of a rebound on the horizon. With bulls showing signs of resilience, the stage is set for a comeback that could redefine BONK’s near-term trajectory. Will this level be the springboard for a recovery, or is further consolidation needed before the next move? Support Holds Steady: Signs Of A Bullish Rebound As market sentiment teeters between caution and optimism, determining the meme coin’s recent hold at the $0.00004002 support level is crucial in order for investors and traders to reevaluate their positions ahead of potential volatility. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says On the 4-hour chart, BONK is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $0.00004002 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $0.00006247 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, possibly opening the door to higher levels. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. When the RSI rises and reaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BONK the strength to push higher and test key resistance levels. BONK Performance On The Daily Time Frame BONK is showing signs of a potential upward movement on the daily chart, staying above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $0.00004002 support level. Its maintenance above this support provides a foundation for further growth. If BONK can maintain its position above this level and continue building momentum, it could pave the way for a breakout and more upside movement. Furthermore, the daily RSI shows signs of a rebound, maintaining a steady position above the 50% threshold. The continued trend above this level implies that the asset is in a favorable position for more gains, with the possibility of a sustained rally. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could indicate growing confidence among traders and signal positive price action for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness Thus far, BONK is at a pivotal moment, having found stability above the $0.00004002 support level and the daily 100-day SMA. If Bonk can sustain its position above this support and build on its current momentum, a potential recovery could be underway, possibly driving the price toward the $0.00006247 resistance level and beyond. Nonetheless, failure to maintain $0.00004002 may alter the meme coin’s direction to the downside, causing it to retest lower support zones such as $0.00002962 and $0.00002320.

While Q4 is generally a bullish quarter, the surge in Bitcoin’s price reportedly came on the back of increased institutional demand and strong buying activity from the US. Buying pressure coincides with the holiday season, which may enhance market euphoria due to the “Holiday Effect.” Will the phenomenon intensify BTC price before 2024 ends? Bitcoin could hit another record high before year-end Bitcoin price surpassed $100k on December 4 for the first time, leading to celebrations within the crypto community. Bitcoin maintained the range before dropping under the crucial level on December 5. According to CryptoQuant data, the rise was on the back of 2 things : institutional demand and sustained buying by US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from U.S. investors. pic.twitter.com/eZvKFCmVxs — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 5, 2024 At the time of writing, CoinGecko notes Bitcoin’s 24-hour range between $92,900 and $103,600. However, there is one reason to be optimistic that BTC will break the upper band due to the ‘Holiday Effect.’ Research has shown that returns are generally higher around the holidays and this phenomenon is called the Holiday Effect. Bitcoin’s $100k peak comes squished between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Papers cite that investor buying is because of “holiday euphoria” during this period. But , it is also likely that not all investors would participate in the market during this time. Considering it is also a festive time to spend with families or on vacations. Therefore, despite uncertainty about the trading volumes, stocks have seen the Holiday Effect. This also means, that if Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory, another record peak could be achieved before 2024 concludes. Bitcoin demand is a positive indicator What is noteworthy is that retail demand for Bitcoin is already on the rise since 2020. CryptoQuant research finds that the 30-day demand change from retail investors is currently at a record high. The reason is simple—retail investments could be backed by institutional trust. And the latter could be playing a role in the former. Bitcoin 30-day retail demand | Source: CryptoQuant The research shows that there is high demand even as long-term holders are selling to take profits. The report says, “Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top.” This essentially means that when a lot of everyday investors jump in, it can signal that Bitcoin’s price is nearing a short-term peak. However, this surge also shows more people are getting involved, which can boost overall market activity, the research suggests. The research underlined 2 potential scenarios . One where Bitcoin price moves sideways, as retail enthusiasm cools off. Second was if Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 mark. And since it did, the prediction is of another wave of excitement, potentially leading to a “euphoric” market phase where prices climb quickly. The key is to watch how retail and institutional investors interact as it is about long-term adoption. Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, told Cryptopolitan, “It [ $100k milestone] comes in a year that has seen Bitcoin more than double, including a 45-percent advance in less than four weeks following Trump’s presidential victory.” Shekhar also reminds us that it has been 16 years since Bitcoin’s creation and signals “mainstream adoption.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, believes that the $100k mark is not a number but a “psychological breakthrough.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-06 01:22:16

The Altcoin Season Index recently hit 86/100, signaling that smaller assets are outshining Bitcoin in performance. $ HBAR , $XRP, and Solana ($ SOL ) have led the charge, fueled by institutional interest, explosive parabolic moves, and ETF speculation. $ XRP , the original institutional darling, and XLM, its younger sibling, have become focal points for investors. Both share striking similarities: founders, bear-market scars, and ETF hopes, but their paths are diverging. Let’s dissect what makes these assets tick, and more importantly, whether they’re worth the hype—or just the latest victims of “chasing the pump.” Fundamentals: Story of Strengths and Weaknesses XRP’s Institutional Edge XRP has come a long way since its fight with the SEC. Now cleared, it’s riding on institutional narratives, with Ripple expanding its ecosystem by introducing its $RLUSD stablecoin. Institutions may soon get access via a spot ETF in early 2025 (pending SEC approval). These factors scream adoption potential, but there’s a darker side. Ripple still holds tens of billions of XRP, leading to inflationary pressure. This centralization raises questions: will institutions trust an asset so tightly controlled? And privacy concerns linger—something institutions care deeply about. XLM: A Grassroots Underdog XLM, once overshadowed by XRP, differentiates itself with a more decentralized vibe. Its 50% token burn in 2019 reduced supply drastically, giving it a more deflationary edge. However, its trading volume is 50% lower than XRP, and its network hasn’t seen the same explosive adoption narrative. Both assets seem poised for institutional adoption, but their tokenomics and growth models diverge significantly. XRP rides institutional coattails; XLM thrives on grassroots utility. Technicals: Reading the Charts XRP’s Parabolic Surge XRP’s 280%+ November gain has pushed it into overbought RSI levels unseen since the 2021 bull market peak. On the daily chart, RSI is above 80, while the weekly RSI washitting historic extremes—a sign of overextension. But this parabolic move doesn’t mean it’s game over. Let’s talk buy-the-dip zones—or more realistically, buy-the-dip zones, not levels. Here’s what stands out: 1. $2.29 (Fib 0.382): The first retracement area from the local top. Confluences with horizontal resistance turned support. 2. $1.91 (Fib 0.618): A deeper retracement, backed by the 50-day moving average and sitting below a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $1.96-$2.20. 3. $1.63 (Fib 0.786): Major multi-cycle support with a weekly confluence. 4. $1.28: The last low before November’s parabolic surge—a critical test of XRP’s strength. XLM’s Mirror Reflection XLM followed XRP’s November run with a 450% + gain. Its weekly chart shows similarities, but RSI levels are less extreme. $0.414 is a critical pivot point—lose it, and the sell-off could accelerate. The 200-week moving average is catching up, suggesting a potential safety net for long-term bulls. Altcoin Season Context The Altcoin Season Index at 86/100 confirms what we’ve seen: altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as market dominance shifts. However, this often comes with risks. Historically, strong altcoin rallies like this tend to precede sharp corrections. XRP and XLM, despite their gains, may be entering a distribution phase—a period when early buyers lock in profits, leaving new entrants to bear the risk. Source: coinmarketcap.com Summary: Timing the Market XRP and XLM are undeniably similar in history but vastly different in fundamentals. XRP’s centralized narrative contrasts with XLM’s grassroots approach, but both face headwinds of overextension, high market caps ($130 billion for XRP, $14.5 billion for XLM), and a “sell-the-news” backdrop. The best time to buy was during accumulation at $0.30 or $0.55, not after 300%-400% gains. The second best strategy? Patience. Don’t chase pumps; wait for discounts. As the saying goes: “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.” Buying into overbought RSI levels is a gamble, especially when macro conditions remain uncertain. With the DXY stabilizing and equity markets under pressure (Nasdaq and S&P500 are flatlining), December could bring the answers we need.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 01:36:00

Pudgy Penguins launched three years ago as a set of 8,888 NFTs depicting colorful and comical birds. Now, the team behind the project tells CoinDesk that they will release a token called PENGU this year on the Solana blockchain. Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Pudgy Rods and more. A further 22.02% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% are set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. ""With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle,"" the team shared in a statement.Pudgy is among the rare collections that managed to stay culturally relevant in the otherwise dreadful NFT business following the price crash from the 2021-2022 bull market. Many NFTs lacked real utility beyond being a digital brag. It was also difficult to fully realize gains after price bumps — as market liquidity was often inadequate to fill orders. The pivot comes as fun tokens and memecoins, unlike NFTs, have taken off and flourished in the last two years. Liquidity, relative cheapness, virality and ease-of-use are key reasons why people have flocked to these latest hot asset classes — even though fun tokens and memecoins fundamentally represent the same idea as NFT collections did: belonging to a passionate community. Official Pudgy Penguins channels have over 3 million followers across Instagram, X, TikTok and YouTube, and videos involving the characters have notched 32 billion views on Giphy. One of the brand's TikTok accounts is focused on spreading good vibes under the ""Pudgy Kindness"" moniker — popularizing it as a feel-good service in the mainstream, outside of crypto circles. It goes beyond screens too. Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection, and has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies that are carried at major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens. Pudgy Penguins is the third-largest NFT collection by market capitalization — $550 million in total — as of Thursday, data shows , trailing only CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club. The collection came to life in 2021, and each penguin is hand-drawn and features various distinct traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin.",Markets|Pudgy Penguins|NFT|Exclusive,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-06 02:00:11

Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, has successfully performed 2 billion transactions in a mere four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This marks a historic day for Cardano, marking not only its technical prowess but also a strong contender in DeFi.

Visa, recognized for its efficiency, handles approximately 0.72 billion transactions per day—less than half of what Hydra accomplished in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network has been processing over 9,900 transactions per second, surpassing Solana in transaction speed and confirming its image as a highly scalable blockchain technology. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has crossed 9,900 transactions per second surpassing Solana. pic.twitter.com/bAOJCOraMl — TapTools (@TapTools) December 2, 2024 Investors’ interest has also risen. ADA, Cardano’s native coin, just recaptured the $1 price despite the issue of 36.84 million tokens. Another projected unlock of $21.3 million worth of ADA represents only 0.05% of the circulating supply, implying that the influence on market dynamics may be modest. Nonetheless, Cardano’s ecosystem remains resilient, because of an emphasis on efficiency and innovation. Hoskinson’s Pride And Community Optimism Input Output’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is elated on the latest development. In a social media post commemorating Hydra’s milestone, he wrote, “Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right.” His satisfaction in Cardano’s accomplishments reflects the community’s confidence. Many people believe that Hydra’s capacity to execute enormous transaction volumes while lowering fees puts Cardano at the forefront of blockchain scalability. Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right https://t.co/uff9GusWyo — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 4, 2024 This optimism also applies to ADA’s potential price changes. A prominent community member recently stated that the blockchain’s developing DeFi ecosystem and strong emphasis on liquid staking could result in significant growth over the next market cycle. As Cardano continues to attract retail and institutional investors, expectations for ADA’s long-term value remain high. Shaping The Future Of DeFi Hydra’s achievement is more than simply a gain for Cardano; it demonstrates the expanding possibilities of blockchain technology. By outperforming traditional payment systems and other blockchains, Cardano has raised the bar for what is feasible in the DeFi market. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst As the blockchain industry continues to expand at a rapid pace, Cardano is quickly becoming more than simply a competitor. Recent results for Hydra point to even greater things to come for the platform. ADA’s price, at $1.23, shows a minor decline over the past 24 hours, but the 24.2% increase in the past week emphasizes mounting investor confidence. Cardano’s position on the blockchain is strengthened by Hydra’s capacity to handle billions of transactions in such a short period of time, hence maybe paving the path for more price rise. Driven by both retail and institutional interest, ADA’s value could experience constant increase as Cardano keeps proving its scalability and creativity.

New projects and existing powerhouses are shaking up the scene. Did you catch the news about the PGA Tour teaming up with LIV Golf for a massive $10 million prize paid entirely in Cronos (CRO)? Or Chainlink’s big play with Fortlake Asset Management, where they’re revolutionizing fund tokenization? These developments aren’t just headlines—they’re paving the way for crypto adoption across industries. But wait—there’s more. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the new kid on the block with game-changing features that promise to simplify digital payments like never before. Qubetics isn’t here to just exist; it’s solving problems that others haven’t cracked. From a non-custodial wallet with seamless integration into Apple Pay and Google Pay to a “No KYC” process, Qubetics is shaping up to be a real contender. The project is currently in Presale Phase 11, with tokens priced at $0.0282. With over 6,500 holders and $4.4M raised, it’s easy to see why early investors are calling it a golden opportunity. Let’s break it all down and see how Qubetics compares to big names like Chainlink and Cronos. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Everyday Crypto Payments Imagine this: you’re at your local coffee shop, and instead of fumbling through your wallet or scanning QR codes for crypto payments, you just tap your phone. That’s the vision Qubetics is bringing to life with its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. The wallet integrates with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop platforms, making crypto transactions feel as simple as swiping your debit card. What’s even cooler? The smart contract conversion mechanism. It converts crypto into fiat at the point of sale, so you don’t have to worry about wild price swings. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is focused on privacy. Their No KYC (Know Your Customer) feature ensures you can manage your assets without the hassle of uploading personal data. This is perfect for freelancers juggling international clients or small businesses tired of currency conversion fees. For instance, a small café could accept crypto payments without worrying about market volatility—it’s all converted to stable fiat instantly. As of now, 1 $TICS token is $0.0282, but don’t sleep on it. With weekly 10% price hikes during presale, this is a get-in-early moment. After the presale, prices are projected to hit $0.25, offering an impressive 900% ROI. So far, over 270M tokens have been sold. Qubetics isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement aiming to make crypto payments part of everyday life. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting the Blockchain Dots If you’ve been around crypto for a minute, you know Chainlink is the OG of connecting real-world data to blockchain networks. Lately, it’s been making moves with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which simplifies the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchains. Think of it like a universal translator, but for blockchains. This innovation is clutch in a world that’s becoming more interconnected. Chainlink isn’t stopping there. They’ve teamed up with Avalanche to launch low-latency Data Streams, powering GMX V2’s decentralized markets on both Arbitrum and Avalanche. These markets are already pulling in $50 billion in trading volume, and Chainlink is right in the middle of it all. And let’s not forget the numbers. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $23.63, with analysts predicting further upside as adoption grows. With Fortlake Asset Management tapping Chainlink for fund tokenization, traditional finance is finally catching up to blockchain tech. This makes Chainlink one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for long-term growth. Cronos (CRO): The Backbone of Crypto.com Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is quietly becoming a heavy hitter. With the announcement of the Crypto.com Showdown, where a $10 million prize will be paid entirely in CRO, it’s clear that Cronos is stepping into the limelight. This isn’t just a token—it’s an ecosystem, and it’s expanding fast. One of the standout developments is the launch of the Cronos zkEVM network. This zero-knowledge layer 2 network is all about speed and scalability, offering gasless transactions and a system secured by Ethereum. Translation? Cronos is solving the scalability issues that have plagued blockchain for years. Currently, CRO is trading at $0.208846, with potential for major growth as adoption increases. With partnerships across industries and a strong push for real-world use cases, Cronos isn’t just riding the wave—it’s making its own. Add this to your list of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, and you won’t regret it. Conclusion So, where should you park your crypto dollars this month? Based on the latest research, Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Cronos (CRO) are your top picks. Qubetics is redefining crypto payments with its non-custodial wallet and “No KYC” process. Chainlink is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world data, while Cronos is expanding its ecosystem with groundbreaking technologies.

Toncoin, linked to Telegram, has seen remarkable price growth, reflecting increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning it closer to its all-time high. Meanwhile, Fantom has experienced a significant price surge, marking a notable recovery from its recent low of $0.64, with its price soaring by 85% and positioning itself for a potential move towards $1.68. Amidst this market optimism, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a promising contender, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. Currently in Presale Phase 11, with each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is set to transform how we handle digital assets and everyday payments. Its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial institutions and payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay, whether you’re on iOS, Android, or desktop. This means managing your crypto assets could become as simple as using your regular payment apps. One of the most anticipated features is the smart contract conversion mechanism, which automatically converts digital assets into fiat currencies at the point of sale. This protects users from the volatility of the crypto market, ensuring stable and secure transactions. Moreover, Qubetics offers a No KYC process, allowing users to engage without extensive identity verification, thereby enhancing privacy and ease of use. Currently, in Presale Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282. With each phase introducing a 10% price increase and the final phase seeing a 20% hike, early investors have a unique opportunity. The project has already raised over $4.4 million, with more than 6,500 holders and over 270 million tokens sold. Post-presale, the price is poised to hit $0.25, indicating a potential ROI of 900%. For small businesses, this means accepting crypto payments without worrying about market fluctuations, as the smart contract conversion ensures they receive the exact fiat amount expected . For individuals, managing and spending crypto becomes as easy as using traditional currencies, with the added benefit of privacy through the No KYC process. Toncoin (TON): Riding the Bullish Wave Toncoin, the cryptocurrency linked to Telegram, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The surge in TON’s price reflects increasing bullish momentum and heightened trading activity, positioning the cryptocurrency closer to its all-time high. This bullish trend is further supported by technical indicators. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) reinforce the uptrend, with the price remaining well above the short-term averages. If TON maintains its trajectory, it could break the resistance of $7.198 and target the $8 level in December. However, a reversal could test support levels at $6.6 and $5.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for TON nearly touched the overbought threshold of 70 before pulling back to its current level of 63. This suggests that while the buying momentum has weakened slightly, it remains relatively strong, indicating that buyers maintain a slight edge. If the RSI climbs back above 70, as it did in could regain momentum and test levels above $7.2, signaling another bullish breakout. Additionally, the supply of TON on exchanges has decreased to 1.68 million, down from 1.75 million on December 1. This significant outflow suggests reduced selling pressure and a possible shift to long-term holding or staking, which could support the upward price trend as selling liquidity dries up. For trts an opportunity to capitalize on TON’s bullish momentum. Monitoring key resistance and support levels, along with technical indicators like the RSI and EMAs, can provide insights into potential entry and exit points. Staying informed about market trends and on-chain metrics is crucial for making infoions. Fantom (FTM): A Surge Toward New Heights Fantom (FTM) has been on a roll, delivering an 85% price surge after rebounding from a low of $0.64. Its current trajectory has analysts buzzing, with predictions of a push toward $1.68 in the coming weeks. This growth is fueled by strong technical indicators and increasing adoption within its ecosystem. Fantom’s unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture sets it apart, offering speed and scalability that traditional blockchains can’t match. Developers and users are flocking to Fantom because of its low transaction costs and lightning-fast confirmation times. Projects built on Fantom’s platform are gaining traction, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming and NFT marketplaces. This activity isn’t just hype—it’s creating real value and driving up demand for FTM tokens. As of now, FTM is trading around $1.32, showing robust momentum. Analysts believe breaking above the $1.50 resistance level could pave the way for a rally to $1.68 and beyond. For those seeking the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Fantom is an exciting choice with a proven track record of innovation and adoption. Conclusion: Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 As we close out the year, the crypto market is presenting opportunities for substantial returns, and these three projects are leading the charge.

Cronos is climbing charts, promising lucrative gains, while EOS battles a market dip, raising questions about its resilience. Amid this, Qubetics has emerged as a game-changer, offering innovative solutions and attracting over 6,500 holders with a staggering $4.4 million raised during its presale. While Cronos and EOS battle market volatility, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out by addressing real-world challenges with its revolutionary non-custodial wallet—a feature traditional systems have failed to perfect. With a mainnet launch on the horizon and predictions of $10-15 per token, Qubetics is turning skeptics into believers. Let’s dive into how these three altcoins stack up and why they’re the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics: Pioneering Financial Autonomy with Its Non-Custodial Wallet In a world where crypto wallets often compromise privacy and control, Qubetics flips the narrative. The project’s non-custodial wallet promises users full autonomy over their finances—no middlemen, no restrictions, just seamless access to your assets. Custodial wallets are prime targets for hackers. High-profile breaches, like the Mt. Gox hack that cost investors over $450 million, highlight this vulnerability. By eliminating third-party control, Qubetics ensures your assets remain yours—always. Custodial wallets often require extensive KYC protocols, exposing sensitive personal data. Qubetics’ decentralised model prioritises anonymity, offering a secure haven for users who value privacy. Centralised systems impose restrictions on transactions, particularly in regions with stringent regulations. Qubetics empowers users by removing these barriers, making global financial inclusion a reality. For more information, watch this video . Presale Numbers and Predictions The buzz around Qubetics is undeniable. With over 270 million $TICS tokens sold at $0.0282 each and a presale tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear investors see immense potential. Analysts predict the token could reach $10-15 post-mainnet launch, making it a prime contender among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Cronos: On the Rise with Promising Upside Potential Cronos ($CRO) has been making waves, recently gaining attention for its upside potential. Analysts suggest the token could climb 31% to reach its next target, driven by growing adoption and strategic partnerships. Cronos is more than just a token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem designed to support DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s interoperability with Ethereum and Cosmos gives it a competitive edge, enabling seamless integration across blockchain platforms. Despite market fluctuations, Cronos has shown resilience. Recent reports highlight its potential for significant gains, especially as the ecosystem attracts more developers and projects. At its current price, investors see it as a golden opportunity among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. However, like any altcoin, Cronos isn’t immune to risks. The token’s performance hinges on broader market trends and the success of its ongoing developments. Still, for those willing to ride the wave, it’s an enticing prospect. EOS: A Contender Facing Market Challenges EOS has long been hailed as a blockchain with groundbreaking scalability and speed, but 2024 hasn’t been kind. Recent reports show a 10% dip, leading some to question its stability. While EOS faces challenges, its robust technology cannot be ignored. The platform’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model allows for faster transactions and lower fees, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. However, competition from newer, more versatile blockchains has put EOS in a tough spot. For EOS to reclaim its status as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, it must adapt. The community’s push for updates and strategic partnerships could reignite interest, but for now, cautious optimism is the name of the game. Investors should keep a close eye on market movements and project developments. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, Qubetics, Cronos, and EOS should be on your radar. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking innovations and $10-15 price prediction, leads the pack. Cronos offers promising gains, while EOS holds potential despite its challenges. The clock is ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever. Dive into Qubetics’ presale , explore Cronos, and keep an eye on EOS. Your next big crypto win could be just around the corner.

BTC is now recovering losses and facing hurdles near $99,000. Bitcoin started a major decline after hitting a new all-time high at $104,015. The price is trading above $97,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $96,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain momentum if it closes above the key milestone level of $100,000. Bitcoin Price Recovers Losses Bitcoin price started another increase above the $98,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to clear the $99,500 and $100,000 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped it to a new all-time high. A high was formed at $104,015 and the price saw a major downside correction. There was a drop below the $100,000 and $95,000 levels. The price tested the $92,000 zone. A low was formed at $91,800 and the price is now recovering losses.

Bitcoin price is now trading above $97,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $96,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $99,360 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. The first key resistance is near the $100,000 level. A clear move above the $100,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $104,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $108,000 level. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $100,000 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $97,000 level. The first major support is near the $96,000 level. The next support is now near the $95,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

But before leaving, he has made a final strike against the crypto world. The SEC, under his watch, filed an 81-page document targeting Binance. It opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss its lawsuit, calling Binance Coin (BNB) and ten other tokens securities. Let’s unpack what this means for Binance and the broader crypto market. SEC’s Target: Eleven Cryptocurrencies The SEC is not happy targeting just Binance Coin. Along with BNB, it labeled ten more tokens as securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI. Source : courtlistener But the filing goes beyond naming tokens. The SEC accuses Binance of more than just selling them. It claims Binance promoted secondary markets for these tokens. Why does that matter? Because it allegedly encouraged investors to see these tokens as profit-making opportunities. Ripple’s partial victory earlier this year shaped the SEC’s arguments too. That case ruled XRP’s secondary sales weren’t securities. So now, the SEC is being extra careful to cover those gaps. How Binance is Being Called Out The SEC’s case rests on something called the Howey Test. In simple terms, this test asks three things to decide if something is a security: Was money invested? Was there a common goal? Did people expect profits from someone else’s work? The SEC says Binance ticks all three boxes. It claims Binance tied token value to its ecosystem’s growth, making users think they were investing. What’s more, the SEC argues secondary market trades are also securities. Binance has said otherwise, but this filing directly challenges that. Ethereum and Bitcoin: Why Are They Spared? Not everyone agrees with the SEC’s methods. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s legal chief, called out what he sees as selective enforcement. In a tweet, he asked why Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)—the two biggest cryptocurrencies—are always left out. Yesterday @SECGov filed eight-one pages of arguments that secondary trading of BNB and ten other tokens triggers liability under Howey. But do they offer ONE WORD explaining how this same bogus logic somehow avoids ETH? Or BTC? Nope. Because they can't. 1/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 5, 2024 It’s a fair question. ETH and BTC dominate the market. Yet, they’re nowhere in this filing. Ripple’s case may have influenced the SEC’s tactics here, but critics are still scratching their heads. What This Means for Crypto If the SEC wins, the fallout could be huge. Tokens labeled as securities might vanish from platforms like Binance. Developers and investors would face stricter rules, which could slow innovation and growth. The SEC’s goal is clear: take control of the crypto market. By targeting both token sales and secondary trades, it’s trying to set a firm legal standard. What’s Next? This filing isn’t a new lawsuit. It’s the SEC doubling down on its claims against Binance. But the exclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin? That raises serious questions about fairness. As Gensler prepares to leave, this feels like his last big move. For crypto, the stakes are massive. The court’s decision could either bring clarity—or turn the market upside down.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Vs SEC,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 03:05:06

Remember Turbo Coin (TURBO)? It started small, just another meme coin with big dreams, and shot to fame, creating life-changing wealth for early adopters. But if you hesitated, you likely missed its rocket to the moon. And let’s face it—missing out on Turbo feels like watching the parade from the sidelines. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the fresh face on the block that’s rewriting the meme coin game. With its jaw-dropping presale success—over $1 million raised in just ten days and 23 billion coins already sold—BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. A play-to-earn (P2E) game, 90% staking APY, and a vibrant community of over 2,400 holders are just a few of the reasons why this coin screams “Don’t miss this!” Let’s dive into how BTFD might just be the Best Meme Coin Presale with 1000X Potential you’ve been waiting for. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Redemption Arc Missed Turbo? Don’t sweat it. BTFD Coin offers a second shot at joining the next big thing before it hits the mainstream. Let’s break down why BTFD has crypto analysts and meme enthusiasts buzzing. A Community Like No Other At the heart of BTFD is its Bulls Squad—a community of investors rallying around the mantra “ Buy The Dip .” This isn’t just a coin; it’s a lifestyle. The Bulls Squad includes the fiery Raging Bull, the analytical Nerdy Bull, and the charming Baby Bull, who keep the community engaged, inspired, and ready to charge at every opportunity. The Numbers Don’t Lie BTFD’s presale has already surpassed expectations, raising over $1 million in just ten days. At Stage 7, the coin is priced at $0.000064, and it will list at $0.0006 after the presale ends. Let’s do some quick maths: a $2,500 investment at the presale price would fetch you 39,062,500 BTFD coins. By the time BTFD hits its listing price, that stash could balloon to $23,437.50. Now imagine if BTFD’s momentum propels it to a 1000X surge. Yes, we’re talking about the potential for millions. Unique Features Setting It Apart BTFD isn’t just riding on hype; it’s got the goods: Play-to-Earn Game: Imagine earning coins while gaming. The upcoming P2E game promises fun, rewards, and massive engagement. Staking Rewards: Offering a staggering 90% APY, staking your BTFD coins isn’t just lucrative; it’s a long-term growth strategy. Decentralised and Resilient: Built on Ethereum, BTFD ensures security, scalability, and accessibility for all. But wait—there’s more! You can buy BTFD with almost any major cryptocurrency. For example: 1 ETH buys 57,581,093 BTFD coins. 1 Bitcoin fetches a jaw-dropping 1,506,375,000 BTFD coins. 1 Solana gets you 3,742,656 BTFD coins. TURBO: The Wealth Train You Missed Turbo Coin started as a small community project, with no clear roadmap and minimal fanfare. Yet, its decentralised ethos and meme-driven charm struck a chord with crypto enthusiasts. Before anyone could blink, TURBO went from obscurity to a household name in the crypto world. Early investors who spent just a few hundred bucks walked away with six-figure payouts when the coin surged to unimaginable heights. But here’s the thing—Turbo wasn’t just about luck. It was about recognising the cultural power of memes and the strength of community-driven tokens. As of now, TURBO’s growth has steadied, making it a legendary “what could have been” story for latecomers. Had you thrown in $2,500 when TURBO was at its rock-bottom presale price, you might’ve been counting stacks instead of regrets. Missed it? It’s alright—because history is knocking on your door again with BTFD Coin. Why Analysts Are Eyeing BTFD Crypto analysts are already predicting BTFD will emerge as one of the Best Meme Coin Presales with 1000X Potential. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, token scarcity and burning mechanisms could further boost its value. Analysts foresee BTFD not just listing at $0.0006 but potentially climbing into the top meme coin ranks alongside giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out—Join the Presale Now! The crypto world doesn’t hand out second chances often, but BTFD Coin might just be yours.

ETH is gaining pace and might soon aim for a move above the $3,950 resistance zone. Ethereum remained in a positive zone and stayed above the $3,680 zone. The price is trading above $3,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $3,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,890 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Upsides Ethereum price remained well-bid above the $3,670 support zone. ETH formed a base and recently started a fresh increase above $3,720 beating Bitcoin . The bulls were able to push the price above the $3,780 resistance. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,956 swing high to the $3,680 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $3,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,890 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,956 swing high to the $3,680 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,950 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,980. A clear move above the $3,980 resistance might send the price toward the $4,000 resistance. An upside break above the $4,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,050 resistance zone or even $4,120. Another Pullback In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,890 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,820 level. The first major support sits near the $3,775 zone. A clear move below the $3,775 support might push the price toward the $3,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,650 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,620.

Here’s the Implication,https://timestabloid.com/reserve-for-every-xrp-wallet-dropped-to-1-xrp-on-dec-2nd-heres-the-implication/,"On December 2, 2024, the account reserve requirement for wallets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was reduced from 10 XRP to 1 XRP, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s evolution. This change reflects a broader effort to make XRPL more accessible and user-friendly for a diverse global audience. The decision has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency experts, who have varying perspectives on its potential impact on XRP’s price and ecosystem. The Reserve Reduction in Context The reserve requirement is a specific amount of XRP that must be held in a wallet to activate and maintain it. Originally set at 20 XRP, this reserve was lowered to 10 XRP in the past, and now to 1 XRP. Wietse Wind, founder of XRPL Labs and a prominent developer in the XRPL ecosystem, was a key proponent of this reduction. In a proposal detailed by Times Tabloid in October, Wind emphasized the importance of lowering the reserve to enhance accessibility. He argued that the previous reserve fee of 10 XRP hindered participation in regions with limited economic capacity, creating a barrier for many potential users and projects. By reducing this threshold to 1 XRP, the change aims to encourage broader adoption and engagement with the XRPL ecosystem. Speculation About XRP’s Price Wall Street veteran and financial expert Linda P. Jones highlighted an intriguing pattern in her analysis. She noted that reserve reductions on the XRPL have historically preceded price increases for XRP. She stated, “The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply a price of $4 to $16 per XRP soon?” Every wallet that holds XRP has a reserve requirement. It used to be 20 XRP, then it was reduced to 10 XRP. Dec. 2nd it was reduced to 1 XRP. The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an #XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply… pic.twitter.com/h7KMY1jVk3 — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 3, 2024 However, the correlation between reserve reductions and price increases remains speculative. An XRPL validator known as “Vet” responded , suggesting that the reduction is driven by increased price, greater network capacity, and lowering entry barriers for XRPL users, rather than being a direct indicator of future price movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Implications of Reserve Changes The reduction in the reserve requirement has also prompted discussions about the cost of self-custody for XRP holders. A user named “333” on X observed , “The more XRP goes up, the more it will cost to self-custody. Some people may not have 20, 30, or 50 dollars to spend to have their wallet. Some will be priced out of simply owning.” This perspective underscores the balance that must be struck between accessibility and maintaining network security. While a lower reserve may foster broader adoption, significant price increases for XRP could inadvertently create barriers for smaller investors, potentially pricing them out of the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Price Surpasses $100,000 In a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed his excitement and support, stating, “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump’s Bitcoin endorsement aligns with his campaign promises to position the United States as the “crypto capital of the world.” His administration, set to begin on January 20, 2025, is expected to implement significant regulatory changes through agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve These proposed adjustments are critical to fostering the growth of the digital asset ecosystem, which Trump believes will be a cornerstone of his presidency and a notable shift from President Biden’s administration and treatment of the nascent financial sector. The timing of Trump’s announcement coincides with the resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stated that his last day at the agency will also be January 20. This transition is anticipated to pave the way for former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is expected to take the helm with a pro-crypto vision. Legal chief Dan Gallagher of Robinhood Markets expressed confidence in Atkins, noting, “Paul Atkins was made for this job,” and predicting that he would tackle the industry’s concerns regarding “regulation by enforcement” from day one. BTC Valuation Surpasses Major Public Companies The recent surge past $100,000 has propelled Bitcoin’s market capitalization to over $2 trillion, making it a more substantial asset than most public companies, including tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet. This valuation also surpasses the government bond markets of several countries, including Spain and Brazil, and approaches the market capitalization of the FTSE 100 Index in the UK. Analysts are optimistic about the future, with Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies, stating that reaching $100,000 indicates the beginning of a new phase in the bull market, one that appears resilient to external shocks. Manuel Villegas, a digital assets analyst at Julius Baer, added that the demand for Bitcoin remains strong, suggesting the possibility of a supply squeeze in the coming year, similar to previous trends. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Bounces Back: Is a New Rally Brewing? Moreover, Trump’s return to the White House could signal a shift in government involvement in Bitcoin. During a Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump proposed the idea of creating a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin, starting with assets seized by the US government. Allies like Robert Kennedy Jr. and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis have even suggested that the government could purchase 1 million Bitcoin, worth approximately $100 billion at current prices, as a means to back the US dollar. Starting Thursday, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $104,150 per coin, marking a substantial 6.6% surge within 24 hours. However, since that peak, the price has retraced to around $103,000 The question now is whether this upward trend can be sustained or if profit-taking by investors will lead to a correction for the leading digital asset. The future outlook will also depend on the next key support level, with $100,000 as a critical point that could facilitate further price increases.

However, the coin is up by more than 50 percent in the past week. XRP is currently consolidating at a high level above its 2021 bull market peak. Today, the price is moving sideways, which is typical after a rally. Even though XRP has dropped from its recent high, it’s still relatively close to where the rally began. Current Wave Structure XRP is in a larger third wave of a bullish cycl e. This move includes smaller subwaves, and we are actively tracking these. Right now, XRP might be in the fourth wave of this structure, but the overall rally is not over yet. While there’s potential for a deeper correction, the focus remains on higher prices. Support and Resistance Levels There’s not enough data to confirm if a major correction is starting, but analysts are watching key support levels. The price may find support between $1.15 and $1.79 if it pulls back, but this is still speculative. Market Action: Corrective or Bullish? XRP seems to be in a corrective phase right now, which could mean sideways consolidation or a sharper pullback. Corrections often lead to indecision, so we might see small ups and downs without a clear trend. Future Price Targets If the price moves higher, the next targets are around $3.20 to $3.30 (previous highs) and possibly $4.20. However, the next big move depends on support levels holding up and whether the rally continues. Micro Support Areas On the smaller time frame, support is located between $2.33 and $2.06, with additional support at $2.21. There has been no impulsive price reaction yet, so the market is still uncertain.

He named David Sacks, a tech heavyweight and former COO of PayPal, as his White House Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptocurrency Czar. This announcement comes just a day after Trump selected Paul Atkins, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate, to chair the SEC. This is a big change for the crypto industry, which suffered tremendous losses due to the SEC’s overreach and unfair regulations. These regulations complicated trading for not only US citizens but also stopped big companies from entering the crypto space for a very long time. Post-election, many new companies are heading towards Bitcoin from all sorts of sectors, like AI, Healthcare, Automobiles, and Technology. In the meanwhile, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,679 on December 5, 2024, showcasing its immense growth since its all-time low of $67.81 on July 6, 2013. While it has dipped 6.11% from its peak, the staggering 143,450% rise from its lowest point underscores its long-term growth trajectory and resilience in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $ 97,341. Why David Sacks? Trump’s choice of Sacks is no surprise. Sacks is a highly respected entrepreneur with a stellar track record in the tech world. He’s invested in major companies like Facebook, SpaceX, Airbnb, and Palantir through his venture fund, Craft Ventures. He also co-founded Yammer, a software company Microsoft acquired for over $1 billion. In his new role, Sacks will be responsible for guiding U.S. policy in two critical areas: artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Trump highlighted the importance of Sacks’ role, saying he would work to make America a global leader in these fields while ensuring free speech is protected from what he called “Big Tech bias and censorship.” Clear Crypto Rules on the Way One of Sacks’ key tasks will be to develop a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry. This clarity has been a long-standing demand from crypto companies struggling with regulatory uncertainty. Trump said Sacks’ work will help the U.S. crypto market thrive. Moreover, Sacks will also chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, where he will drive innovation in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. Industry Cheers for Sacks The tech and crypto community is excited about this move. Chris Pavlovski, CEO of Rumble, called it a win for free speech and praised Sacks’ expertise. Dennis Porter, a crypto advocate, said Sacks’ industry knowledge and bold approach make him the perfect fit for this role. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulated David Sacks on his appointment as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, praising his deep understanding of technology and his alignment with pro-innovation policies for crypto and AI under President Trump. Garlinghouse called this a “dream team,” reflecting high optimism for Sacks’ role in advancing tech innovation in the U.S. This appointment signals Trump’s focus on positioning the U.S. as a tech powerhouse, balancing innovation with regulatory clarity and free speech safeguards.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 03:43:23

He says as crypto and crypto ATMs are easy to find and allow quick permanent transactions this makes them which makes them an “attractive avenues for criminals looking to launder money”. As it’s an initial step for the AUSTRAC to reduce the illegal use of cryptocurrency in Australia, the agency will continue to keep an eye on crypto ATMs moving into 2025. AUSTRAC says those caught breaking the rules could face hefty financial penalties AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas announced a new team at AUSTRAC will ensure crypto ATM operators obey rules aimed at reducing the risk of dirty money flowing through their machines.

On top of that, they must file a report concerning any suspicious activities if the withdrawn or deposited cash is more than $6,500 (10,000 Australian dollars).

There was a move below the $2.40 and $2.30 levels. However, the bulls remained active above the last low and support at $2.15. The price is now moving higher and trading above $2.20. It is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2.866 swing high to the $2.166 low. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.35 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.38 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is at $2.50. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2.866 swing high to the $2.166 low. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance or even $2.850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.380 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.200 level. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support and the trend line. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Accompanying his post was a detailed chart outlining the “Double Tops” RSI pattern observed over multiple market cycles and its implications for XRP’s price trajectory. According to the analyst, this repeating phenomenon indicates XRP’s potential ascent to double-digit price levels. The Double Tops RSI Pattern Explained Egrag’s analysis delves into XRP’s historical weekly RSI behavior, identifying a consistent movement across past market cycles: In the first top, the RSI peaks, followed by a sharp decline. For the Second Top, the RSI climbs again, forming the final peak of a bull run. This two-step RSI pattern has reportedly coincided with significant price movements in XRP’s history, signaling the culmination of bullish trends. Based on this historical data, Egrag believes that XRP may again follow this pattern, potentially achieving unprecedented price levels. In his words, “Double RSI Tops = Double Digits.” #XRP Weekly RSI Pattern: Double Tops, Double Digits! Let’s take a closer look at the Weekly RSI for #XRP Over the years, the Weekly RSI for #XRP reveals a fascinating rhythm: 1⃣ First Top – The RSI peaks and then dives aggressively . 2⃣ Second Top – The RSI climbs again,… pic.twitter.com/z5zwiFyGD3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 5, 2024 Egrag’s Price Projections and Market Outlook When asked by a fellow user, Superman_Crypto, whether XRP would directly reach double-digit prices or experience a correction first, Egrag provided a detailed response. He projected that XRP could initially hit a range of $4.85 to $6.40, followed by a significant correction, and then embark on another upward surge. Egrag elaborated on his expectations for corrections, stating that a 70% correction from $6.40 could see XRP retrace to $1.92, which he identified as a strong support level before a subsequent 5-10X rally. Similarly, a 70% correction from $4.85 would bring the price to $1.46, again followed by a potential 5-10X recovery. To manage such volatility, Egrag advised his followers to employ both dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and dollar-sell averaging, acknowledging the unpredictability of XRP’s ultimate peak price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Parallels and Investor Sentiment The RSI pattern highlighted by Egrag draws parallels to XRP’s previous bull runs. Historically, XRP has exhibited rapid price increases during bullish phases, often followed by equally sharp corrections. Egrag’s analysis has resonated with many in the XRP community , particularly given the asset’s recent price performance and growing institutional interest. However, some investors remain cautious, emphasizing the importance of considering broader market conditions and regulatory developments. As XRP continues to garner attention from institutional players and retail investors, the coming months could provide critical insights into whether the asset fulfills the ambitious forecasts set forth by analysts like Egrag.

This triggered some of the altcoins like Ethereum that traded close to $4000 but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance. However, among the top gainers was JasmyCoin, which broke the 2-year consolidation and marked highs close to $0.06 for the first time since January 2022. Therefore, the JASMY price is believed to revamp a significant upswing after undergoing a small consolidation, as the bulls seem to be poised for a 100% upswing. Ever since the token rose above the multi-year consolidation zone around $0.02, the buzz around the crypto was why the JASMY price is surging so much. JasmyCoin reacted to the BTC price rally positively, which was fueled by a couple of collaborations to strengthen the DePin space. The platform has collaborated with IOTEX, aiming to drive DePin innovation & empower users across the market. Now that the price is displaying massive bullish momentum, the question rises: whether the price can make it to $0.1 this weekend? JASMY price is displaying huge potential in maintaining a strong ascending trend as the upper cap remains pretty higher than the current levels. The RSI displays the possibility of a pullback but the 50/200 day MA is poised for a bullish crossover, indicating the revival of a bullish trend. Now that the price maintains an 18% jump after an 80% rise in the past trading day, the next upper target could be around $0.061 at 1.4 FIB. Although the price is facing significant upward pressure, the bulls are trying hard to push the prices higher. Therefore, the token is believed to test the resistance at $0.0595 in a short while from now. A breakout could push the prices higher but a rejection may lead to consolidation until the markets display the next bullish move. JASMY crypto is becoming one of the strongest in the long term. With its use cases and growing adoption, it has great potential for future gains. Therefore, the price target may not be restricted to $0.1, as the token carries huge potential to achieve the range between $0.2 and $0.25 if the bulls hold a tight grip over the rally.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|JASMY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 04:58:02

XRP Could Hit $3 Analysts are confident that XRP is still on the way to reaching $3 per coin, saying that the recent pullback in its price does not dampen the enthusiasm of market experts on crypto. They added that despite the price dip, investors continue to have a positive sentiment on its future. WallStreetBets, a pseudonymous analyst, emphasized in a post the significance of being bullish on XRP as the coin experiences the ebbs and flows before being catapulted to the $3 level. “If you’re not long XRP right now, you don’t respect yourself,” WallStreetBets wrote in an X post.

Data shows that in the last three days, XRP decreased by nearly 16% and is currently being traded at $2.3. Despite this correction, WallStreetBets and other analysts are still optimistic about the crypto, seeing the pullback as preparing the coin for a prolonged uptrend.

There were key announcements like the Solana ETP in Canada and the launch of a $60 million Solana startup fund, followed by VanEck’s filing for a Solana ETF. The filing has sparked increased interest, as VanEck sees Solana as a competitor to Ethereum, praising its scalability, speed, and low costs—factors that make it ideal for payments, trading, gaming, and decentralized finance. However, in a latest development, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared on X that she has confirmed the SEC has informed at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the SOL spot ETFs. Sources suggest that the SEC is unlikely to approve any new crypto ETFs under the current administration. https://twitter.com/ComfyGwei/status/1864877051515175268 When a user speculated that at least one ETF could be approved, Terrett replied and said, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” James Seyffart and other analysts predict that the Solana ETF might not launch until 2025, particularly if there is a regime change at the SEC. However, the progress made recently, combined with ongoing ETF filings for other crypto assets, signals the potential for more growth in the crypto market over the coming years. In Other News…. The SEC has responded to a request to dismiss its amended lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Binance.US, as well as former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The SEC’s brief opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that Binance operated an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC also alleges that Binance sold several cryptocurrencies, including BNB, as unregistered securities. Binance had previously sought to dismiss these allegations, challenging the SEC’s interpretation. Reflecting on the same, Ripple CLO said, “Instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with new leadership just weeks away, Gensler’s SEC filed an 81-page brief in the Binance case yesterday, recycling the same failed arguments—including the absurd (and unsupported) claim that crypto has no inherent value.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 05:00:56

But ever since Pepe began popping in 2023, memecoins have been printing gains and making everyone from the TradFi squares to the Bitcoin maxis very, very angry. Now bigger than ever, this unstoppable rise of memecoins has been dubbed the memecoin supercycle. And with its unique approach as the first ever memecoin portfolio, Vantard has been killing it. $910k raised and posting 74.74% gains—investors are having trouble containing their excitement. The memecoin supercycle: Offering a golden ticket to gain city Memecoin mania started in Q1 and hasn’t really cooled down since. If this graph doesn’t excite you, nothing else will. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin is steadily rising. Jacking up risk-on sentiment and creating a storm of potential for altcoins to start popping in 2025 when investors inevitably rotate their BTC profits into something offering bigger gains. An opportunity no investor wants to miss out on—enter memecoins. Popularized by memecoin flag waver Murad Mahmudov , the memecoin supercycle is the theory that’s proving more accurate by the day. It’s the theory that memecoins will be the best play for all of next year thanks to their viral and retail appeal, powering rapid and outsized gains. Why Vantard makes winning the memecoin supercycle easy But that graph above can be deceptive. Because we all know that for every high flyer, there are countless pieces of memecoin vapourware wallowing in wallets of shame. You could go neck-deep in meme coins, getting 3 hours of sleep a night in the hope of picking a winner. Or you could let the memecoin experts do the hard work for you. That’s what Vantard is. Vantard’s quants work day in and day out, sourcing the best memecoins for the Vantard portfolio. All Vantard investors will get a slice of this pie. A pie that’s currently up 74.74%. Vantard’s beauty is that it effortlessly exposes you to all the best memecoins on the market with a single investment, keeping you ahead of the market and saving you from doing all-nighters. If you’d been exposed to bluechip memes like Popcat earlier this year, you’d be up over 15,000% . Similarly, bluechip in the making, Gigachad has delivered gains of as much as +7000% . Vantard’s quants are digging deep, exposing holders to future blue chips and the promising low-cap gems so that you’re covered for next year. Vantard has the power to be memecoins’ answer to ETFs ETFs shifted crypto investing to easy mode, opening up piles of untapped capital. Vantard is set to do the same as millions of meme-curious investors who can’t stand the FOMO any longer but don’t know which dog or cat to choose. The difference is Bitcoin is likely offering around a 2x at best right now. Memecoins offer you a 50x or 100x in your sleep. The memecoin supercycle won’t be around forever, though. And investors likely have roughly a year to bank as much as possible. The earlier you allocate, the better.

Shortly after celebrating a historic milestone by crossing $100,000 for the first time, Bitcoin suffered a sharp price drop of 5.47% within minutes, briefly dipping below $93,000. The sudden decline erased over $300 million in long positions, prompting heated reactions from traders and analysts alike. Meanwhile, financial commentary outlet FT Alphaville stirred controversy with a sarcastic “apology” to Bitcoin proponents, reigniting debates about the cryptocurrency’s resilience and the media’s long-standing skepticism. FT Alphaville Slammed for Spiteful ”Apology” as Bitcoin Hits $100K Milestone Bitcoin's rise to an all-time high above $100,000 on Dec. 5 has ignited celebrations across the crypto community while sparking controversy elsewhere. Among the voices making headlines is FT Alphaville, a daily commentary service by the Financial Times, which issued what many have dubbed a ”spiteful apology” to Bitcoin supporters. The op-ed, published on the day of Bitcoin's milestone achievement, has triggered widespread backlash on X. In a piece authored by Bryce Elder, city editor of FT Alphaville’s op-ed section, the outlet extended a biting ”apology” to those who may have refrained from investing in Bitcoin based on its coverage. The article took a sarcastic tone, stating: “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up.” Elder further defended the outlet's critical stance on Bitcoin over the years, dismissing claims that its skepticism was rooted in support for traditional finance (tradfi). “We’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.” The op-ed reiterated Alphaville's long-standing criticisms of Bitcoin, labeling it a ”negative-sum game,” ”chronically inefficient,” and a ”compromised” store of value. Elder doubled down on the publication's past analyses, claiming that Bitcoin’s price remains an “arbitrary hype gauge disconnected from any utility.” The reaction from the crypto community on X was swift and unforgiving. Many dismissed the piece as a ”Cope-Pology” or a ”faux apology,” accusing FT Alphaville of lacking humility despite years of misplaced skepticism. One commenter remarked, ”Imagine being so wrong and still having this lack of humility,” reflecting the sentiment of many Bitcoin proponents who felt vindicated by the cryptocurrency's historic price milestone. Others highlighted the irony of the apology, calling it an admission of failure masked in sarcasm. FT Alphaville's critical stance on Bitcoin is nothing new. Since its first article on Bitcoin in June 2011—when the cryptocurrency was trading at $15.90—the publication has consistently framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble. Over the years, its writers have targeted every aspect of Bitcoin, from its price to its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2014, Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve risk examiner, likened Satoshi to a ”reckless” doctor prescribing penicillin without diagnosis. Williams argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule ignored the natural ebbs and flows of economic cycles, calling it a ”poorly designed” experiment destined for failure. Despite such criticisms, Bitcoin's meteoric rise from niche internet experiment to a globally recognized asset has made it one of the most debated topics in financial media. Bitcoin's Critics Stand Firm Even as Bitcoin crosses the $100,000 threshold, it still faces staunch criticism from prominent figures in traditional finance. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin as “rat poison squared,” while JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has referred to it as a “fraud” in the past. Meanwhile, financial commentator Peter Schiff has consistently predicted Bitcoin's collapse, often mocking its supporters. These critics now find themselves in the spotlight for their erroneous predictions. In November 2019, many publicly claimed Bitcoin would never hit $100,000—a claim that Bitcoin’s historic rally has decisively debunked. Bitcoin's price surge has also shifted how the media covers the cryptocurrency. While earlier narratives largely framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble or scam, recent coverage has begun to recognize its resilience and adoption by institutions. As noted by Bitcoin proponents, the media's evolving perception mirrors broader societal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. The controversy surrounding FT Alphaville’s “apology” shows the tension between traditional financial media and the burgeoning crypto space. While Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a significant milestone, it also highlights a growing divide in how the asset is perceived. Whether the op-ed was a genuine apology or a sarcastic jab, one thing remains clear: Bitcoin’s story is far from over, and its critics will continue to grapple with its ever-changing narrative. Bitcoin's Sudden Price Plunge Wipes Out $300M in Long Positions, Shaking the Market A sharp and unexpected drop in Bitcoin's price sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market on Dec. 5, liquidating over $300 million in long positions within minutes. The dramatic 5.47% decline briefly pushed Bitcoin below $93,000 before it rebounded, leaving traders and analysts speculating on the implications for the broader market. Between 10:23 am and 10:28 am UTC, Bitcoin fell from $98,338 to $92,957, a rapid decline that erased nearly 10% of its market value in just 180 seconds. The sudden movement caused significant liquidations, with data from CoinGlass revealing $303.48 million in long positions wiped out within the hour. While Bitcoin's price has since rebounded to $96,410, the brief dip below $93,000 has left many traders reeling. The event places the spotlight on the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even as Bitcoin recently celebrated its historic breach of the $100,000 price level. Traders Weigh In Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, provided an optimistic take, suggesting the sharp correction may have cleared excessive leverage in the market. “That wipe cleared out most of the lever on BTC. Only reason we go lower is if it spooked enough people into taking profit,” Hartmann commented on X, estimating a 70% chance that the market flush has ended. Pseudonymous crypto trader Smiley Capital highlighted the unprecedented nature of the event, calling it historic: “It took Bitcoin 3 minutes to drop ~10%, which equals ~200B drop. 180 seconds. 200 billion dollars lower,” Smiley Capital noted in a post on X. While the abrupt decline may signal a momentary setback, analysts believe it could indicate a period of consolidation rather than the end of Bitcoin's bull run. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, suggested Bitcoin might enter a short-term plateau. “While we don’t see this as the end of the Bitcoin bull run, it does signal we are entering a consolidation phase in the days/weeks ahead,” Sycamore wrote on X. The last major consolidation phase occurred between March and October of this year, when Bitcoin traded between $53,000 and $72,000 following its then-all-time high of $73,679. If history repeats itself, the market could stabilize within a similar range before resuming its upward trajectory. Bitcoin’s rapid rise to $100,000, culminating in a new all-time high of $104,000 on Dec. 4, has been fueled by strong institutional demand and tightening supply. The year saw over $31 billion in net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, combined with reduced Bitcoin issuance following April's halving event. Despite the bullish backdrop, such rapid price increases are often accompanied by heightened volatility. Analysts suggest the market’s reaction to the Dec. 5 plunge will offer insights into its resilience and potential for further growth. Bitcoin's ability to recover quickly from the sudden drop may reaffirm its growing maturity as an asset class. However, the event serves as a reminder of the market’s susceptibility to extreme volatility, especially in times of heightened leverage and speculative trading. While the near-term outlook may involve consolidation, the broader picture remains one of optimism. Many analysts continue to predict higher price targets for Bitcoin, with some forecasting a potential climb to $124,000 or beyond by the end of the year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 05:28:22

He loves Solana,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar/,"David Sacks, a venture capitalist and podcaster, will work as the White House AI and crypto czar under President-elect Donald Trump’s new administration. On Thursday, the president elect announced on Truth Social that David Sacks will be the AI and crypto czar for the White House. This position is first of its kind created by him specially for crypto-related policies. He wrote that the AI and crypto czar will determine America’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policies. David will form a legal framework on cryptocurrencies and head a presidential council on science and technology issues. Trump also added that “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas” by protecting free speech online and guiding the nation away from the hold and censorship of big tech companies. Trump’s announcement is a sign that his coming administration is rewarding Silicon Valley people who backed his campaign. It also signals that the administration will support policies that many crypto business venturers prefer. Sacks became Trump’s major support after a prominent shift in his stance David was a casual Trump supporter until this year. He became a major ally, hosting a fundraiser at his big San Francisco house. Tickets to the event were each worth $50,000, and those who paid $300,000 got additional benefits, such as a photo with Trump personally. It was a big transition in Sacks’ attitude since he openly criticized Trump a couple of weeks after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Back then, David said on his All-In podcast that the Republican nominee was obviously to blame for those events and he “disqualified himself from being a candidate at a national level.”.

It’s a big deal, and there’s no way around it. The job? To guide the country’s policy on two of the most important fields in tech right now—artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. But can he actually pull it off? That’s the real question. Sorce : Donald Trump Truth Social Profile Is This Role Too Much for David Sacks? Let’s be real. This job is not easy. Sacks will need to balance a lot. He’s supposed to be the middleman between the White House, Congress, and agencies like the SEC. His job is to finally give crypto the clear rules it’s been begging for, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI’s potential for privacy breaches, national security risks, and job losses is a huge problem, and Sacks will have to face it head-on. The question is: Can he handle it? Does He Have What It Takes? Look, David Sacks isn’t new to big challenges. He’s been involved in companies like PayPal and founded Yammer. But stepping into a role like this is a whole different beast. It’s one thing to run a company; it’s another to regulate industries that are moving faster than you can blink. He’ll have to deal with both AI and crypto, all while pushing back against Big Tech bias and protecting free speech online. Can he really juggle all of this and lead effectively? What’s at Stake? If Sacks gets this right, he could play a major part in keeping the U.S. on top when it comes to AI and cryptocurrency. But if he slips up? We could fall behind. These industries aren’t going anywhere—they’re shaping the future. The U.S. needs clear guidelines, and fast. There’s a lot riding on how Sacks handles it. What Happens Next?

Although Bitcoin dipped to $97,000, analyst are expecting an explosive altcoin rally . With altcoins like XRP already showing impressive growth, the market is gearing up for a major breakout, signaling the start of a potential altcoin season. Top Altcoins to Watch for Big Gains In a recent video analysis, Van de Poppe has identified several new altcoins with the potential for substantial growth in the coming months. According to him, these new coins paired with BTC will perform well in the current bull cycle. One of his top picks is Optimism (OP) , a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, is one of his top picks. With Ethereum’s scalability issues addressed, he expects Optimism to outperform Ethereum itself in the upcoming rally. He also points to SEI , a Layer-1 project that has recently undergone a price correction. Van de Poppe believes SEI could see a 3-4X increase against Bitcoin once it breaks key price levels. Omni , a smaller altcoin, is also under the analyst’s radar, as it has shown signs of breaking out from consolidation after a listing on Binance. Other Altcoins like Hedera Hashgraph , and Stellar (XLM ) are following suit, showing tremendous growth, but there’s still more room to run. Apart from these new coins, he is also bullish on Ethereum . With over $300 million invested in Ethereum ETFs , institutional investors are showing increased interest, signaling strong market potential. Crypto Market Today As of December 5, the Altcoin Season Index remains strong at 87, signaling that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Van de Poppe anticipates Bitcoin will consolidate after breaking through the $100,000 resistance level, which could pave the way for altcoins to surge. While Bitcoin experienced a brief dip, currently trading at around $97,000, its upward momentum could still benefit altcoins in the coming months. The last altcoin season in early 2021 saw altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Chainlink surge, and a similar trend may unfold this time around. With Bitcoin stabilizing, the coming months could see explosive growth for altcoins. FAQs How can Ethereum ETFs impact the altcoin market? Over $300M in Ethereum ETFs signal growing institutional interest, potentially driving up Ethereum’s value and boosting altcoins overall. Which crypto will skyrocket in 2024? Analysts predict Optimism (OP), SEI, and Ethereum may see explosive growth, driven by market trends and increased institutional interest. Which crypto can give 1000x in 2024? Low-cap altcoins like Omni could have 1000x potential, but they carry high risks.

How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 05:37:00

The blockchain network, which has witnessed significant growth across its DeFi, gaming, and real-world assets ecosystems, ranks as the 20 th largest cryptocurrency by market. Per CoinGecko data, Sui’s market cap is currently over $12.3 billion, which has increased sharply amid the 110% and 560% surge in SUI price over the past month and past year respectively. SUI traded at lows of $0.3648 in October 2023, which puts the current price level of $4.14 a notable 1,060% up. Analysts say Sui price could target $5 after its latest leg up. Copper adds USDC on Sui On Thursday, the Sui network hit upward momentum as a series of positive developments catalyzed bulls’ endeavors. Digital assets custody and collateral management provider Copper provided one of these positive announcements. In a blog post , Copper said it had added support for the USDC stablecoin on Sui. Circle’s USDC is a 1:1 USD redeemable stablecoin and is live on Copper’s custodial ecosystem, the company noted. Sui @SuiNetwork · Follow USDC on Sui now has the support of @CopperHQ ’s enterprise-grade custody infrastructure, adding even more momentum to Sui’s top 10 DeFi ecosystem! 9:17 pm · 5 Dec 2024 353 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies The integration comes nearly two months after Circle announced native USDC on Sui and will see institutional investors benefit from a reliable and secure USD-pegged stablecoin ecosystem. Stablecoin issuer Circle added native USDC on Sui in October. Adam VandenBoogaard, co-head of revenue for Americas at Copper, said: “Support USDC on the Sui blockchain is a notable step in strengthening our partnership with Sui. With much more to unlock across the stablecoin and Real-World Asset spaces, we’re committed to connecting the institutional finance world to on-chain opportunities on the Sui Network.” Integration key to DeFi Sui has seen its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem grow to a total value locked of over $2 billion. The addition of USDC via Copper’s integration will drive growth in this space even further. Sui Foundation head of ecosystem development Jameel Khalfan noted this in a statement. Currently, Sui ranks among the 10 largest DeFi chains. Jameel added, “Adding support for this asset within Copper’s enterprise-grade custody services will only add to the astounding growth of Sui as a destination for DeFi users.” The positive news for Sui also includes Phantom Wallet’s support. The layer-1 blockchain announced on Thursday that the DeFi and NFTs wallet is “coming to the Sui ecosystem.” Users will benefit from multi-chain support, native bridges, and asset swaps among other features.

Speaking about the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, Roubini noted Bitcoin's inherent volatility and lack of fundamental utility as a medium of exchange. Roubini criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for failing to meet the basic requirements of a currency. He argued that Bitcoin is neither a scalable means of payment nor a stable store of value. “Bitcoin is not an economic unit of account, it is not a stable store of value and it is not a scalable means of payment,” he said, citing its history of extreme price swings. Drawing attention to the example of El Salvador, where Bitcoin has begun to be used as legal tender, he said that less than 1% of transactions in the country are carried out using cryptocurrency. “I don’t think Bitcoin will ever become a currency,” he added. Related News: Giant Whale Sells Last Altcoins After Market Rally, Profiting 100,000x on This Altcoin Roubini also disagreed with the claims that Bitcoin provides protection against inflation or the devaluation of fiat currencies. “Historically, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with the stock market,” Roubini said, explaining that its price tends to rise and fall with stocks rather than acting as a counterweight during periods of inflation. Unlike gold, which has traditionally been a reliable hedge during inflationary periods, he argued that Bitcoin’s performance has not been in line with such expectations. Roubini also voiced concerns about regulatory developments in the crypto space. While acknowledging that retail use is increasing, he warned that looser regulation could lead to another speculative bubble. “The risk is that we are moving towards too little regulation, which could pave the way for scams and market failures similar to what we saw with FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried,” he said. He warned that a lack of oversight could increase systemic risks in the crypto ecosystem, resulting in another bubble and bust cycle. “Many players in this space are shady and weak regulation only increases the risk of fraud and volatility,” Roubini said. *This is not investment advice.

This move also shook the Worldcoin price, which was stuck in a tight consolidation phase as the bears restricted the trade within predetermined price levels. Meanwhile, the November breakout helped the price to rise above the range, which is now primed to rise by another 25% after securing a 25% upswing. Worldcoin is among the tokens that have failed to rise even 20% close to its yearly highs, which have already been surpassed by many. The prolonged accumulation may have attracted huge trader’s attention and as a result, the platform witnessed a massive increase in volume. With the levels hitting $2 billion from the lows below $400 million, the future prospectus of the WLD price remains extremely bullish as it has more room to grow. After facing a massive downfall, the bulls failed to trigger a strong rebound and as a result, the token remained accumulated for a long time. Meanwhile, the bulls caused some variations in between, which formed a bullish pattern later. Luckily, the recent price rise pushed the levels above the neckline of the Adam & Eve pattern and after a retest, the token has begun its journey towards higher highs. The WLD price is currently trading around $4 with over 21% in the past 24 hours and a cumulative growth of over 100% in the past 30 days. Although the price remains 65% away from its ATH at $11.82, the token demonstrates bullish performance and high volatility. Therefore, now that the price has launched a massive upswing, the next levels to watch could be around $4.4 while the pivotal resistance to achieve could be around $5.1, which may validate a rise from the bearish influence. Therefore, if the token continues to hold similar bullish momentum and reaches $5, then the probability of reaching a double-digit figure could be validated. However, this move could consume more time than expected, probably in the first few days of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 05:52:20

And Why Has Donald Trump Made Him Crypto Czar? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Former PayPal executive and renowned venture capitalist David O. Sacks has been appointed by Donald Trump as the White House’s first “AI & Crypto Czar.” This new role is part of Trump’s plan to position America as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, two rapidly growing fields shaping the future. The announcement came shortly after Bitcoin reached its $100k milestone . Why Trump Appointed David Sacks Only? In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced Sacks’ appointment and highlighted his mission to create a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector. However, Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks arose from his impressive track record as a tech entrepreneur and investor. Sacks, a founding-era COO of PayPal and a key member of the “PayPal Mafia,” has built and supported some of Silicon Valley’s most successful ventures. His expertise in technology and finance makes him tackle the challenges and opportunities in AI and crypto effectively. Meanwhile, some experts even hint that Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks is seen as a reward for his loyal support during the campaign. Sacks played a pivotal role in fundraising for Trump, helping to raise $12 million during a high-profile event earlier this year. What Changes Could Sacks Bring? David Sacks will focus on creating clear rules for cryptocurrencies to remove confusion and help the U.S. digital asset industry grow. His goal is to support crypto businesses and position the United States as a global leader in digital innovation. According to Trump, he will “steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” ensuring a balanced digital landscape that supports open discourse. Sacks will also focus on safeguarding free speech in the online space Additionally, Sacks will chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, guiding the administration’s policies on emerging technologies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : David Sacks Crypto Czar: Trump’s Visionary Choice to Shape US Tech Policy , Sacks Close Ties to Trump and Musk Sacks has been a strong Trump supporter of Trump, hosting fundraisers and rallying tech industry donors.

As of Thursday, JASMY broke out of a seven-month consolidation phase, climbing to $0.054. The Altcoin Outperforming Major Cryptos In addition to its impressive yearly performance, JasmyCoin has seen notable gains over shorter time frames, recording increases of 118%, 162%, and 211% over the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively.

Market experts anticipate that the overall market’s bullish trend could continue at least until the second quarter of 2025, suggesting further growth potential for JASMY, which remains 98% below its all-time high of $4.79, reached during the 2021 bull market. However, with further gains expected in the coming months, potentially reaching a cycle top by October 2025, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto, will play a key role as it often leads the way for further price appreciation like the altcoin in question. But, what exactly is JasmyCoin, and why has it attracted significant investment in recent weeks? JasmyCoin Eyes Key Resistance Levels JasmyCoin is the native token of the Jasmy platform, which aims to democratize data usage by integrating blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The platform provides a decentralized and secure infrastructure that allows individuals to control and monetize their personal data. Users can safely store and manage their data while granting businesses access with their consent. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this altcoin is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 50 billion tokens. Its primary uses include data transfer and storage, payment for services, facilitating market entry for institutional investors, offering crypto loans, and optimizing tax strategies. In contrast to Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains of 120%—following its recent all-time high of $104,000—JASMY has significantly outperformed the largest digital asset. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin saw a trading volume increase of 64% compared to Wednesday, while JasmyCoin recorded a nearly 100% surge in trading volume during the same period. As JasmyCoin continues its upward trajectory, technical analysis reveals critical resistance levels at $0.063, $0.067, and $0.070 on its JASMY/USDT daily chart—heights not seen since January 2022. These levels could pose challenges to further price surges for the altcoin. Conversely, key support levels to monitor include $0.040, which is vital for maintaining bullish momentum, and $0.031. Holding these support levels will be crucial for the altcoin as it aims to inch closer to the $0.10 mark.

Meanwhile, Binance.US listed the popular meme coin PEPE. This could be attributed to the growing acceptance of meme coins, which now has a collective market cap exceeding $140 billion. On a philanthropic note, the DOGS meme coin launched a charity portal, and pledged impressive donations to nonprofits and animal welfare. New Solana Meme Coin Raises Eyebrows Michael Bouhanna, a vice president at Sotheby’s auction house, again made waves in the crypto world with the launch of a second Solana-based meme coin. On Dec. 4, Bouhanna teased the release of his latest art-themed meme coin, Nothing (VOID), on his social media account. Shortly after, a wallet associated with him minted the VOID token. The launch led to a very lucrative trading event where one trader purchased 462 million VOID tokens for close to $8,200 worth of Solana (SOL) and sold 439 million of them just 30 minutes later for over $1 million. This isn’t Bouhanna’s first venture into the meme coin space. Earlier, he created another token called Comedian (BAN) , that is inspired by the viral $6-million banana artwork that was famously purchased by Tron founder Justin Sun. However, the BAN token’s launch became controversial after allegations of insider trading emerged. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain accused Bouhanna of making $1 million in profits through insider wallets associated with the BAN token. According to the firm, Bouhanna previouslyinvested in other meme coins with limited success, suggesting that the launch of BAN was motivated by a desire to profit from the hype. Bouhanna denied the allegations , and argued that the wallet in question does not belong to him and that the reported profits were largely unrealized. He described the creation of BAN as a personal hobby with no connection to his role at Sotheby’s. Bouhanna also clarified that he initially intended to launch the token anonymously to avoid any association with his professional profile. However, the community quickly linked the project to him, and created a narrative that BAN was affiliated with Sotheby’s. Bouhanna then claimed this narrative was used to promote the token without his consent. The community’s reaction to Bouhanna’s involvement in meme coins has been mixed. While some applauded his creativity, others criticized his actions and questioned the ethics of launching such tokens. Some users tagged Sotheby’s , and asked whether the auction house condoned these kinds of activities by its executives. Hawk Tuah Meme Coin Sparks Outrage Another meme coin also recently faced some controversy. The launch of Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) meme coin ignited widespread outrage across social media after a dramatic pump-and-dump scenario that unfolded shortly after its release. The crypto was launched at 10:00 pm UTC on Dec. 4, and the token quickly reached a peak market cap of $490 million before crashing by 91% in just three hours. On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps and Dexscreener revealed that between 80% and 90% of the HAWK token supply at launch was controlled by a combination of insider wallets and snipers. These entities very quickly bought large portions of the token’s supply during its early trading moments. Solana block explorer Solscanner pointed out a specific wallet that sniped 17.5% of the token’s supply for 4,195 Wrapped Solana (WSOL), valued at $993,000 at the time. Over the next 90 minutes, the wallet sold 135.8 million HAWK tokens, netting a profit of $1.3 million. In a Dec. 5 X post, Welch denied allegations of insider activity or any distribution of free tokens to influencers. She stated that the team did not sell any tokens and took measures to try and reduce sniper risks by launching on the decentralized liquidity protocol Meteora, which included high fees at the start of the launch. Despite these claims, the big price decline and the dominance of snipers and insiders in the token’s early supply fueled skepticism. The fallout from the HAWK token’s price crash has been quite severe, and several users reported major losses. One user on X shared that they lost $43,000 after investing in the token, while another reportedly swapped $1.4 million worth of MOODENG into HAWK and lost $1.3 million in the process. Some people suggest that Welch and her team may face legal repercussions as a result of the controversial token launch. Multiple users on X even claimed to file complaints with the SEC, and law firms started soliciting the affected investors. Burwick Law invited those who lost money on HAWK to contact them to explore their legal rights. Binance.US Lists PEPE On the other hand, things are going much better for other meme coins. Binance.US recently announced the listing of the popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE). The listing allows users to trade it against Tether (USDT) starting Dec. 5. Data from CoinMarketCap indicated that PEPE has a market cap of over $9 billion. PEPE’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The listing is part of a broader trend among crypto exchanges which are increasing their offerings of meme coins. This movement gained a lot of momentum after the election of crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump. Coinbase, for example, recently listed meme coins like Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF), while Binance.US added Bonk (BONK) to its roster in November. Meme coins collectively boast a market cap of more than $140 billion. The rise of meme coins sparked mixed reactions from the crypto community. Supporters like Murad Mahmudov argue that meme coins provide a legitimate use case for cryptocurrencies by reducing speculation premiums on altcoins. Critics, including Jimmy Song , view meme coins as overly speculative and detrimental to investors. Pepe is a cartoon frog that was created by artist Matt Furie in 2005. Since then, it has become a cultural phenomenon and a key symbol in the crypto space. Its popularity extends beyond just PEPE to other meme coins inspired by Furie’s work, like Brett (BRETT), Andy (ANDY), and Landwolf (WOLF). DOGS Launches Charity Portal The DOGS meme coin announced plans to donate more than 6 billion tokens, which are valued at almost $4.5 million, to nonprofit organizations worldwide. This announcement was made after the launch of a charity portal in late November that allowed registered nonprofits to apply for funding. DOGS plans to redirect unclaimed airdrop tokens to support charitable causes. As part of its charitable efforts, DOGS partnered with Best Friends Animal Society, and committed $150,000 to help care for homeless animals in the United States. This collaboration fits in perfectly with DOGS’ mission to support shelters in achieving a 90% no-kill rate by 2025. DOGS founder Andrew refered to the partnership as a call to action for the crypto community. Through this initiative, DOGS will fund one month of care for adopted dogs, with its mascot, Spotty, serving as an ambassador in events and promotional campaigns. The DOGS token was inspired by Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov’s iconic dog drawing. It symbolizes Digital Resistance and reflects TON’s rebranding after Durov’s arrest in France earlier this year. The dog symbol dates back to 2011 when Durov resisted demands to censor liberal and dissident voices in Russia. DOGS launched an airdrop in September, and quickly reached 17 million users . One of the main goals of the airdrop was to increase crypto awareness on Telegram and promote animal welfare by using the DOGS Mini App, which has over 53 million users. Despite its initial success, DOGS has faced a 50+% decline in value.

Flexible loans in USDT, BTC, and ETH are currently supported, with collateral assets such as USDT, BTC, and ETH accepted. There are plans to expand the range of loanable and collateral assets for Flexible Crypto Loans in the future. Meanwhile, the first phase of HTX’s limited-time “Borrow & Earn” event will also kick off, with a prize pool of 2,700,000,000 $HTX up for grabs.

Despite being up by more than 15 percent in the last seven days, ADA is currently showing no signs of bullish momentum. To start, let’s take a look at the broader picture for ADA. Short-Term Focus: Right now, the focus is on higher prices, with the potential for a pullback into the orange support region between $0.64 and $0.94. This could offer an opportunity for those looking to enter at better levels. On the smaller time frames, the analyst shared potential upside extensions, but if the price breaks below the support range between $1.11 and $1.21, it could signal a larger wave four pullback. If the price falls below $1.05, that would invalidate this structure. The target levels to watch for are around $1.42, $1.72, $2.36, and possibly even $2.95 in a euphoric phase. However, these targets depend on the price action during the next pullback. Bitcoin’s Influence: Bitcoin’s dominance has increased a bit, and for now, the focus is back on Bitcoin. However, altcoins like ADA aren’t necessarily suffering; they are just moving sideways. This pullback is still part of the overall setup, so higher prices are still in play. Key Resistance and Breakout Signals: If ADA breaks above the recent high around $1.25, it could signal an upside breakout. The more significant signal will come with a break above the yellow wave 1 high at $1.32 or $1.33, but the analyst said that ADA is not quite there yet. Near-Term Price Targets: If the third wave is unfolding, the price could hit the $1.42 level next. If the microstructure remains valid, we could see higher targets around $1.49 or $1.55.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 06:09:40

The flagship cryptocurrency’s ascent has led Standard Chartered to predict that BTC could double in price to $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin Can Double In Price By 2025 End, Predicts Standard Chartered Bitcoin, the top digital asset with a market cap of more than $2 trillion when writing, has finally entered the six-figure price territory. Reinvigorated by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, BTC has climbed a remarkable 48% since November 5. In a note shared earlier today, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick remarked that the firm’s BTC target by end of 2025 of around $200,000 is “achievable.” The analyst added: We would turn even more bullish if BTC saw more rapid uptake by U.S. retirement funds, global sovereign wealth funds, or a potential US strategic reserve fund. In 2025, we expect institutional flows to continue at or above the 2024 pace. MicroStrategy is running ahead of its USD 42 billion three-year plan, so its purchases in 2025 should match or exceed its 2024 purchases. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood had similar thoughts as she emphasized that despite Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 milestone, the digital asset is still in the “early innings.” In a post on X, Wood sounded optimistic about appointing pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief. She also referenced US Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell’s recent remark describing BTC as a virtual, digital version of gold. Wood compared gold’s total market cap to that of Bitcoin, saying: At $2,700, gold is a ~$15 trillion market, compared to bitcoin at only ~$2 trillion. Even after breaking through $100,000, bitcoin still is in early innings. Indeed, ARK Invest believes that Bitcoin is a much bigger idea than gold. The chart below from CoinMarketCap shows the top assets in the world ranked by total market cap. While gold reigns supreme with a market cap of almost $18 trillion, BTC is steadily catching up with the precious metal. Notably, BTC has already surpassed silver in market cap. The Case For Further Gains In BTC Although Bitcoin has had an impressive year in price action, many sidelined investors may believe they have missed the boat. However, data seems to suggest quite the opposite. According to a recent report , retail investors have yet to fully join the ongoing crypto bull market, suggesting the current rally is largely led by institutional investors. BTC surpassing the $100,000 price level may spark some interest in retail investors to begin buying cryptocurrencies and further fuel the current market rally. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant predicts that Bitcoin may top $146,000 in this cycle.

Key Insights from Supply Distribution Data,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-100k-just-the-beginning-key-insights-from-supply-distribution-data/,"Bitcoin has reached a landmark moment in its history earlier today, crossing the $100,000 price mark for the first time and cementing its position once again as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As it stands, BTC all-time high is at roughly $103,679. This significant achievement has prompted a detailed analysis of its supply distribution, offering valuable insights into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders and the broader implications for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Silent Whales: Rising Exchange Inflows Hint at Market’s Next Big Move Supply Distribution and Market Behaviour Amid the excitement of Bitcoin’s new all-time high, an analysis from CryptoQuant’s analyst, Crazzyblockk, sheds light on how this milestone impacts the cryptocurrency’s realized cap and the broader market structure. While the milestone reflects growing global adoption and investment confidence, it also raises questions about the potential trajectory of the market. According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s supply is currently divided between two key groups of holders: long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs). CryptoQuant data reveals that out of Bitcoin’s total supply, over 14.5 million BTC are held by LTHs, while nearly 5 million BTC are in the hands of STHs. Despite the price surge, only 52% of Bitcoin’s realized cap is attributed to STHs, a stark contrast to previous market peaks where this figure typically exceeded 80%. Historically, Bitcoin’s realized cap trends reveal distinct behaviors during market cycles. During bear market phases, most realized cap shifts towards LTHs as accumulation intensifies, signaling the end of the bearish trend. Conversely, during bull market peaks, the realized cap tends to be dominated by STHs, driven by speculative trading and short-term profits. However, the current distribution shows a higher concentration among LTHs, indicating a deviation from traditional market patterns. Implications for Bitcoin’s Market Momentum According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the relatively low realized cap held by STHs in the current market cycle suggests reduced selling pressure, which may support sustained price growth. The analyst revealed that with a significant proportion of Bitcoin held by LTHs, market confidence appears strong, potentially providing a buffer against abrupt price corrections. This stability is crucial as it reflects long-term investor trust and reduces the likelihood of speculative volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move? Coinbase Premium Suggests a Short-Term Rally May Be Brewing In addition, the analysis also highlights that this supply distribution aligns with a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The reduced participation of STHs in the realized cap indicates room for further upward movement as more capital may enter the market without triggering a significant sell-off. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is a historic achievement, but the current supply dynamics suggest the potential for further upward movement, given the stability provided by LTHs and the relatively low participation of STHs in the realized cap.

However, some analysts are concerned about its operating mechanism. The platform facilitated the launch of the M3M3 token to serve as a test run for this concept, with the token quickly gaining traction among the crypto community. Understanding the M3M3 platform M3M3 is Meteora’s attempt to address the challenges in the meme coin market, where the majority of tokens fail to sustain long-term value. Data confirms the grim state of meme coins, as out of 1.2 million new tokens launched last month on pump.fun, only 1.4% migrated to decentralized exchanges, and a mere 0.05% surpassed a $1 million market capitalization. This is largely due to the high rate of rug pulls. Earlier in the year, a crypto.news report confirmed that deployers of Solana-based meme coins facilitated rugpulls, leading to a combined loss of $26 million for investors in March. Most recently, the Hawk Tuah token collapsed 90% hours after launch amid rug pull allegations. $HAWK didn’t disappoint 96% of the supply in one cluster nice 🤡 https://t.co/AP645QzkfI pic.twitter.com/ERHTG7v5oa — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 4, 2024 Meteora looks to address these issues by promoting a player-versus-platform (PPP) model for meme coins. This would represent a shift from a player-versus-player (PvP) environment, where quick liquidity withdrawals often leave holders at a loss. The new PPP model will introduce a staking approach, according to the announcement. This staking mechanism essentially encourages token holders to stake their assets, reducing selling pressure and fostering long-term stability. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗠𝟯𝗠𝟯 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀: • Stake your memecoin to earn the fee rewards in M3M3. • The more you stake, the more you earn. • Only the top stakers share in the fee rewards. • If you unstake your tokens, you must wait before you can withdraw them. pic.twitter.com/uZF1aAIpac — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) December 4, 2024 How the M3M3 staking model works The M3M3 system incentivizes staking by presenting rewards derived from locked liquidity swap fees. These fees are distributed among the top stakers in the form of Solana ( SOL ) tokens, which can be claimed immediately, and meme coin rewards that are automatically restaked. The model potentially creates a positive feedback loop: as more participants stake, the competition increases, driving token purchases and enhancing liquidity, which in turn generates more rewards. Unstaking comes with conditions, as participants must wait a designated period before withdrawing tokens. This mechanism discourages short-term speculation and promotes sustained participation. A saturated market Meanwhile, M3M3 enters a crowded market of token deployment platforms, including Pump.fun, SunPump, and Snek.fun. PancakeSwap also recently launched Springboard on BNB Chain. Each competitor has carved out a niche by facilitating meme coin launches and liquidity generation. For instance, Pump.fun focuses on hype-driven token launches, while SunPump leverages on-chain buyback and burn mechanisms. Meanwhile, Springboard allows free token launches. However, M3M3’s introduction of staking rewards could set it apart by addressing the issue of value retention. By comparison, M3M3 leverages a staking mechanism inspired by the “(3,3)” model to create a sustainable ecosystem. Possible strengths and drawbacks The M3M3 model has several advantages. First, it incentivizes token holders to stake rather than sell, reducing market volatility. Second, it reportedly provides a steady income stream through fee rewards, even during market downturns the official website claims. Also, its configurability makes it attractive to launchpads seeking staking solutions for new projects. However, the platform is not without challenges. Its reliance on staking to sustain demand may falter if rewards become insufficient to attract participants. The potential for high entry barriers, as only top stakers benefit significantly, could alienate smaller investors.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

The confusion is evident in BTC's trading on Thursday, as it finally rose to six figures, tapping record highs near $103,900 before plummeting to $91,100, ultimately ending the day in UTC at approximately $97,000, data from TradingView and CoinDesk show. The trading range was so large that it engulfed all the price action since Nov. 20. This led to the formation of a ""high wave candle,"" characterized by a small real body that shows the gap between the open and closing prices, along with large shadows (wicks) that reflect unusually wide price swings throughout the day. It's a sign that the bulls now have less than full control, with sellers looking to reassert themselves, serving as a cautionary indicator for those looking to chase the market at this moment. This cautionary signal becomes even more significant given that the pattern has appeared at record highs, representing a failure to maintain gains above the closely-watched $100,000 mark. ""The long upper shadows mean that sometime after the session's open, buying pressure thrust the security's price to an extended high. During the same session, selling pressure drove the price to a protracted low. Yet, by the session's close, the price returned almost to the opening price. That's confusion,"" CMT 's explainer for high-wave candles says. The high wave candle gets its name because Japanese traders liken the extended shadows, or wicks, to large ocean waves. The high wave candle, coupled with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, a momentum indicator, points to consolidation or a temporary bearish shift in the market trend. A bearish divergence occurs when the momentum oscillator sich as the RSI doesn't confirm the new high in prices. The message is consistent with several analysts expressing concerns about overcrowding in long positions and the potential for price pullbacks. Moreover, directional plays become challenging while prices remain locked within Thursday's range, indicating ongoing market confusion.

At that time, the market “capped out at ~$70K and ~$5K respectively back then, with $BTC only now reaching that target – lesson in there,” Burniske noted.

He emphasized that “no one ever lost money” by taking profits, adding that any foregone gains during the process would amount to psychological discomfort rather than actual losses. “No one ever lost money taking profits, the foregone gains as you harvest on the way up are psychological pain only.

Burniske’s advice comes as Bitcoin has finally surpassed $100,000, setting a new all-time high of nearly $104,000. However, the BTC price has since pulled back to $95,000. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $98,067, with the total crypto market capitalization at $1.94 trillion.

On-chain data flagged that the beleaguered firm moved a whopping 3,620 coins, sparking concerns as the broader market witnessed over $1 billion in crypto liquidations recently. BTC price backtracked below the $100K level, raising severe market concerns amid the bankrupt exchange’s massive transfers. Bitcoin News: Bankrupt Crypto Exchange Shifts 3,620 BTC Raising Market Concerns According to the latest data by Arkham Intelligence , Mt Gox was recorded as shifting 3,620 BTC to two unknown wallets via a couple of transactions. Per the data, the bankrupt crypto exchange moved 3,493 coins, worth $340 million, to the unknown wallet address 1MAXy6…Ez3NQ9. Further, the exchange shifted another 126.577 coins, worth $12.33 million, to the unknown wallet address bc1qkf…ffm7sf. Overall, these transactions garnered significant attention as they could potentially be used in preparation for creditors’ reimbursement. Also, it’s noteworthy that these creditors may decide to sell the funds when received, thereby bringing heightened selling pressure to the flagship crypto ahead. Market participants remain apprehensive as this Bitcoin news could cause the crypto to face significant turbulence. Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that the defunct crypto exchange moved massive amounts of the same coin previously. CoinGape reported Mt Gox to have transferred 24K BTC quite recently, adding to concerns in light of creditor reimbursement plans. Crypto’s Price Slips Below $100K At the time of reporting, BTC price backtracked substantially, down 4% to $87,859. Its 24-hour low and high were $91,998.78 and $103,583, respectively. Notably, the flagship coin rides a rollercoaster ride against the backdrop of the broader crypto market movement that witnessed a flash crash intraday. Notably, the crash comes against the backdrop of over $1 billion in liquidations recorded across the crypto market, per recent Coinglass data. Further, the beleaguered firm’s recent transfers amid the massive liquidation have kept traders and investors on their toes. Nevertheless, broader sentiments amid a bullish Q4 remain optimistic, as also seen by Bitcoin rebounding from a $91K intraday low to near $98K. Market watchers continue to extensively eye the coin for further price action shifts amid a Q4 power play in the crypto realm. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that BTC miner Marathon Digital recently completed its $850 million convertible note offering at 0% interest. The proceeds from this offering are to be used in BTC purchases, emerging as optimistic Bitcoin news for the broader market. This saga has in turn sparked contrasting sentiments, carving a bullish outlook for the coin’s future despite Mt Gox’s movements.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty said Sacks will push President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans forward. It will also bring upside momentum to the cryptocurrencies he supports, including XRP and ZRX. Crypto Czar David Sacks Is SEC v Ripple, XRP Expert US President-elect Donald Trump on December 5 appointed David O. Sacks as the “White House AI & Crypto Czar.” Trump added that Sacks will guide the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency policies, two areas extremely vital to the future of American competitiveness. This is good news for Ripple and XRP community as he rooted for the company during the SEC lawsuit. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Moreover, he will work towards establishing a legal framework for the crypto industry, bringing crypto regulatory clarity to promote and thrive the industry in the United States. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty React Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulated David Sacks on the appointment. Garlinhouse said, “He understands tech inside and out, and importantly, will push forward President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans.” Stuart Alderoty thinks Sacks is another great pick by the Trump administration. Paul Atkins’ nomination as SEC Chairman to replace Gary Gensler by Trump sparked a massive bullish sentiment in the crypto industry. Alderoty said it will bring the “pro-business, pro-innovation, and fresh perspective we need.” He is also excited to work with David Sacks and the industry to finally establish clear rules of the road for crypto in the US. “The future starts now!” he claimed. XRP News: Ripple Vs SEC Lawsuit Nears End David Sacks has followed the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit and XRP news. An old video has emerged where he said Ripple won the case as Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security. John Deaton reacted to the video, claiming the win was a total victory for XRP. The price is now trading resiliently above $2.35 with a $134 billion market cap. As someone very involved in the @Ripple XRP case, the win was a total victory regarding everything important. And as @Jason said to @DavidSacks let’s see how XRP trades later. Hate it or love it, XRP above $2 with a $133B market cap is resilient. https://t.co/mYx06iLLBt — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 6, 2024 Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo and pro-XRP lawyers strongly claim that the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit appeal will likely get dropped or dismissed. Trump’s pro-crypto team, including Paul Atkins and David Sacks, has increased the odds of lawsuit resolution. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed his support for Atkins, calling him an “outstanding choice” to lead the watchdog. Meanwhile, speculation over whether the U.S. SEC will continue its legal battle or allow the deadline to pass as the January 15 deadline approaches. Amid the bullish news, XRP price has rallied 400% amid the change in leadership in the government agencies. The price currently trades at $2.36, up nearly 2% in last 24 hours and 50% in a week.

BTC futures recorded nearly $500 million in net liquidations, with $420 million of those stemming from longs, or bets on higher prices. ETH futures recorded a smaller $85 million in liquidations. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, they don't have enough funds to keep the trade open. Over 156,000 individual traders were liquidated, and the largest single liquidation order was on crypto exchange OKX – a BTC/USD trade worth $18 million. The data shows that some 89% of all traders affected were long traders, or those that bet on higher prices.

If you missed Mog Coin’s successful ICO, you’re not alone in your quiet longing for a better chance. Mog Coin rode the wave of internet nostalgia and delivered big rewards to its early adopters. But for those who missed the boat, the story isn’t over. Enter BTFD Coin , a meme coin built not just on humour but on solid fundamentals and a bullish outlook. Its presale has already raised over $1 million in under 10 days, selling more than 23 billion tokens to a community of over 2,400 holders. If Mog Coin was a cultural moment, BTFD Coin could be your chance to write your own crypto success story. Mog Coin: The Meme King That Captured Internet Hearts Every cat lover in Scandinavia will tell you that nothing unites people like a good feline meme. Mog Coin, inspired by the iconic Mog meme, brought a touch of warmth and whimsy to the cryptocurrency world. Launched with a focus on community and nostalgia, Mog Coin was a masterstroke in marrying internet culture with blockchain technology. During its ICO, Mog Coin was priced at just $0.000015 per token, and early investors quickly saw returns as the coin’s value surged. By the end of its first quarter, Mog Coin had doubled its market cap, supported by engaging campaigns and an active DAO that funded projects benefiting animal welfare—a cause close to many Nordic hearts. But its true charm lay in its purring potential. With every transaction, a portion was burned, making it a deflationary token. Mog Coin didn’t just offer a meme; it promised long-term rewards to its holders. Unfortunately, like an elusive aurora borealis, Mog Coin’s ICO was fleeting, leaving many investors wishing for a second chance. BTFD Coin: The New Meme Coin Set to Shine If Mog Coin was the cosy cat curled up by the fireplace, BTFD Coin is the daring bull charging into the snowstorm. BTFD Coin embodies the popular crypto mantra “Buy The Dip”, urging investors to see market downturns as opportunities, not setbacks. It’s a meme coin designed for those who believe in growth and resilience—a mindset that resonates well with Scandinavians who know how to weather life’s storms. BTFD Coin is more than just a cheeky name; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem designed for investors who want fun and functionality: Staking Rewards: Offering a staggering 90% average APY, BTFD Coin lets you grow your investment over time without lifting a finger. P2E Gaming: Its innovative play-to-earn game combines entertainment with tangible rewards, making it a hit for crypto gamers and casual players alike. Community Power: Led by the charismatic Bulls Squad , the project has fostered a vibrant community culture where every holder feels like a key player. Ethereum’s Strength: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD Coin benefits from top-tier security and scalability, ensuring its long-term success. Plus, BTFD Coin’s presale is turning heads. Now in its 7th stage, the token is priced at $0.000064 per coin, with over $1 million raised and 23 billion tokens sold. It has already attracted 2,400+ holders, proving that this is no ordinary meme coin—it’s a movement. Investment Example: What Could $60,000 Do for You? At the current price of $0.000064, you’d receive 937,500,000 tokens. If the coin hits its projected post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to an impressive $562,500. That’s enough to fund a dreamy trip across all of Scandinavia—or invest further for long-term gains! The Bottom Line: A Bullish Nordic Opportunity Mog Coin’s ICO may have been a fleeting Nordic light, but BTFD Coin is the sunrise that promises a bright new day for meme coin enthusiasts. With its strong presale numbers, unique ecosystem, and promise of high returns, it’s shaping up to be one of the best meme coin presales to join this month. Don’t let this opportunity slip away like the last one. Embrace the bullish spirit and join the BTFD Coin presale now. Remember, the dip isn’t a setback; it’s an invitation to greatness.

FED Chairman Jerome Powell also stated at the New York Times Dealbook Summit that Bitcoin competes with gold rather than the US dollar. Anthony Georgiades, founder and general partner at Innovating Capital, noted the growing role of institutions in Bitcoin’s price action. He pointed to significant inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have brought nearly $8 billion to the market in November alone. He added that while institutional activity is driving the current momentum, individual investors could soon shift their focus to altcoins, setting the stage for a broader market rally. Related News: Giant Whale Sells Last Altcoins After Market Rally, Profiting 100,000x on This Altcoin Georgiades also noted the enduring appeal of memecoins like Dogecoin, especially for new cryptocurrency users. While acknowledging their speculative nature, he noted that memecoins often serve as an accessible entry point for individuals exploring the crypto space. Despite the risks, they continue to generate engagement and expand the crypto community. The analyst remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term outlook, pointing to the need for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption to maintain momentum. He cited recent ETF approvals and ongoing regulatory changes as critical steps toward a more mature market. *This is not investment advice.

As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-plunge-2-as-rising-bitcoin-dominance-could-crush-xrp-bulls/,"The post XRP Price to Plunge $2? As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, which experienced an impressive 335% gain in just one month, is now facing the threat of a significant price drop. After reaching its yearly high of $2.85 on December 3, XRP has already declined by nearly 18%. However, crypto expert Pav Hundal has raised concerns that if Bitcoin dominance continues to increase, XRP could drop to $2. With money already starting to shift back into Bitcoin, this could lead to a large sell-off in XRP, potentially wiping out long positions. Bitcoin Dominance Is the Real Threat Bitcoin dominance, which is currently sitting at 55.28% , has dropped slightly this week. However, Hundal hints that if it rises to 60-70%, the market could see a big shift as investors move their money from altcoins like XRP back into Bitcoin. XRP’s recent surge has made it a popular asset among traders, with open interest in XRP reaching new highs. This surge in leveraged positions, paired with XRP’s price retracing, could result in massive liquidations if the market continues to decline. Hundal mentioned that XRP longs are still being added, even as prices fall, signaling that the market may be approaching a “dangerous zone.” Meanwhile, the XRP/BTC ratio, which shows how strong XRP is compared to Bitcoin, is currently 0.00002375. This has increased by 2.7% since December 5 and by 47% over the past month. Additionally, Hundal suggests that if Bitcoin’s price becomes stable, it could calm the market and increase trading activity. XRP’s recent price surge has caught the attention of many investors—read our XRP price prediction to see where it’s headed next and stay ahead of the curve! Ripple Effect of Ripple’s Delay Adding to the uncertainty, Ripple’s recent delay in launching its RLUSD stablecoin has caused concerns among investors. This delay has led XRP to lose its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, falling behind USDT. XRP Bulls in Trouble? As of now, XRP is trading at $2.37, reflecting a slight price drop seen in the last 24 hours. If the price drops just 7% more, around $104 million in XRP long positions could be wiped out. XRP’s failure to break through the $2.50 resistance is putting even more pressure on the token, and the market cap has dropped below $134 billion. However, the next support level for XRP is near $2.20, with a potential further decline toward $2.00 if the bearish trend continues. But if it can clear the $2.50 resistance, we could see a rise to $2.70 or even $3.00. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These big purchases could lead to price increases for the underlying asset, which is predicted to continue its run and hit $1.5 next. ADA’s Current Run The so-called ‘Trump Pump’ initially missed ADA. While the rest of the market, led by BTC and DOGE, was charting massive gains, Cardano’s token remained relatively still at around $0.3. That all changed during the first weekend after the elections when IOG Founder Charles Hoskinson said he would work alongside the Trump administration to establish crypto regulations in the States. ADA skyrocketed immediately by double-digits and kept climbing in the following weeks amid the overall resurgance in the market, as well as other big hints by Hoskinson. The cryptocurrency’s ascent culminated on December 3, when it jumped to just over $1.3 for the first time in almost three years. Since then, though, ADA has retraced slightly to $1.2 after an 8% correction. The question now arises of what would push the asset further north and whether it can reach some of the big predictions made by analysts, including a price tag of up to $6. Whales on the Move Crypto whales tend to impact the market due to their ability to purchase or offload large portions of a certain asset. Consequently, their behavior could determine the upcoming price movements of a token. Recall that Cardano whales accumulated 130 million coins during the retracement at the end of November and the asset’s price jumped in the following days from $0.9 to the aforementioned peak of $1.3. The popular analyst Ali outlined another massive purchase by these large investors for more than 100 million ADA within the span of 24 hours. #Cardano whales bought over 100 million $ADA in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/IrZjA54tGy — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2024 This could lead to even further gains for ADA, as many experts have predicted that its next target is precisely $1.5, which means another 25% surge from its current levels. Ali, for instance, believes the asset has formed an “ascending triangle like it was extracted from a textbook” that could drive ti to that target.

However, analysts are pointing out that Litecoin (LTC) and crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) also see high volumes. Rollblock’s record-breaking crypto presale is racing toward $7 million sold as this top altcoin prepares for over 100x growth out of its highly anticipated ICO. Cardano Monthly Rally Fueled by Relentless Technical Upgrades In a little over one month, the Cardano price has gone from one of the year’s worst performers to one of its best. Cardano’s monthly rally of 270% has dragged it from a deep loss for 2024 to an almost 100% gain. Analysts attribute this impressive rebound to Cardano’s commitment to constant innovation. No sooner had Cardano completed its Chang upgrade than it announced its next big upgrade: midnight. The Midnight upgrade’s focus on the rapidly expanding DeFi sector has analysts expecting even more explosive growth for the Cardano price in 2025. Litecoin Stays at Centre of Expanding Web3 Thanks to Brand A growing Web3 economy has been a boon for the Litecoin price this month. Litecoin’s 35% rally in this week alone has brought its total monthly return to over 100%. Litecoin’s long-established brand makes it one of the top choices for merchants in the growing Web3 economy. These Web3 merchants are willing to overlook Litecoin’s slipping transaction technology in favor of the sense of security that its brand provides for customers. At the current rate of Web3 expansion, the Litecoin price is expected to continue its rapid ascent through 2025. Rollblock CoinMarketCap Listing Sends Sales Volumes Soaring Rollblock’s relative sales volumes are outperforming even Cardano and Litecoin thanks to its fresh listing on the popular CoinMarketCap website. Rollblock has now broken numerous crypto presale records as it races toward the $7 million market capitalization milestone. This top altcoin has already broken numerous presale records thanks to the enormous popularity of its crypto-gambling platform. Moreover, The vast potential of the $500 billion in revenue that is there for the taking in the gambling industry. This platform hosts more than 7,000 of the industry’s best provably fair casino games on the blockchain. It means fast, free and seamless access from anywhere in the world. Rollblock now offers the same blockchain excellence for sports betting after its recent expansion. Rollblock’s listing on the CoinMarketCap platform is expected to supercharge the rate of sales as even more investors learn about its excellent crypto gambling platform and its signature profit-sharing program. Rollblock’s program for profit sharing operates by employing up to 30% of weekly revenue to perform buybacks from the market. Instantly burning 60% of these buybacks maintains a constant upward pressure on the price, while handing out the other 40% as staking rewards creates an additional incentive for purchasing and holding RBLK. The increase in Rollblock’s sales volumes has already brought it to the brink of closing the eighth stage in its crypto presale, with hours left for its current price of $0.038.

This historic price action has prompted analysts at the trading firm Bernstein to assert that Bitcoin is well-positioned to replace gold within the next decade. Bitcoin Poised To Outshine Gold Over Next Decade, Bernstein Says In a client note released earlier today, Bernstein analysts, led by Gautam Chhugani, expressed confidence that Bitcoin will eventually assume gold’s role as a reliable safe-haven asset. The note stated: We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing Gold over the next decade, and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin is up an impressive 141%. However, the lion’s share of these gains came following the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Historic $104,000: Key Factors Fueling The Surge The cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in optimism following Trump’s victory, as the president-elect is expected to create a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Since November 4, the total crypto market cap has climbed from $2.4 trillion to $3.9 trillion at the time of writing – a staggering 62.5% increase. In the note, Bernstein predicts that BTC may rise to $200,000 by late 2025. The trading firm’s forecast aligns with Charles Edwards’ – founder of Capriole Investments – prediction that BTC can potentially double in value within weeks, as its relatively smaller market cap enables more rapid price movements. BTC Adoption Major Driver Behind Its Success Bernstein’s bullish outlook was reinforced by Gil Luria, a D.A. Davidson analyst, who identified mainstream adoption as the key driver behind Bitcoin’s success. However, he cautioned that Bitcoin still has a “long path ahead” before it is widely accepted as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Luria added: Bitcoin’s main current application as a store of value — an appreciating, low-correlation asset that replaces gold as a hedge against a decline in economic stability. While Bitcoin is yet to achieve widespread use as a currency, it has gained significant traction as a reliable asset class for corporate balance sheets. Recently, Hut 8, a leading crypto-mining firm, announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic, tell their 63,200 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) metric is singling a weakening market. The BFI evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. When it declines, the risk of a market correction increases. “Not to rain on the parade, but Bitcoin has crossed $100,000, yet the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) is starting to weaken. Should we be concerned? This indicator often sends early warning signals, and once confirmed, they’re hard to ignore. Take the market peak in Q1 this year as an example: the BFI showed the exit point ahead of a significant correction. For now, we’ll keep monitoring, but the bull run still has fuel left.” Source: Negentropic/X Prior to Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 resistance level, the analysts said the net realized profit/loss metric, which tracks whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a loss or a profit, indicated holders were waiting for higher price targets before they’d likely start taking profits. “Bitcoin traders hold out for higher levels. Another sign of Bitcoin’s price consolidation is traders’ reluctance to take profits in this range. They’re aiming for higher levels, expecting gains once Bitcoin starts challenging key resistances. Once Bitcoin overcomes its resistance and establishes itself above $100,000, we’ll likely witness spikes to the upside on this chart, signaling trader confidence turning into action.” Source: Negentropic/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,579 at time of writing, down 6.8% from its new all-time high of $103,679.

""He will safeguard free speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,"" Trump said in a post on his social media app Truth Social. ""He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S."" Sacks, a South African-born American entrepreneur, will also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Sacks is part of the so-called ""PayPal Mafia,"" referring to former PayPal ( PYPL ) staff and founders who went on to start other tech companies. The group includes prominent Trump supporters - Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk and Palantir ( PLTR ) chairman Peter Thiel.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has issued a warning for crypto ATM operators via a Dec. 6 statement , noting that non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws will result in enforcement actions and penalties. Coin ATM Radar data shows Australia as the third-largest hub for Bitcoin and crypto ATMs globally, with over 1,300 machines in operation. However, AUSTRAC, which put the number at around 1,200, claims only a small fraction of the country’s 400 registered digital currency exchanges operate these machines, making them a focal point for regulatory scrutiny. According to AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas, cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs have become “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate “near-instant and irreversible transfers.” You might also like: Australia’s AUSTRAC warns of crypto’s growing role in illicit activities As such, the agency will focus on eliminating non-compliant, high-risk operations throughout the next year to reduce the criminal misuse of cryptocurrency in Australia. “We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation, which is why this taskforce will work to eliminate non-compliant high-risk operations.” Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO Crypto ATM operators in Australia must adhere to anti-money laundering obligations, including registering with AUSTRAC, conducting Know Your Customer checks, monitoring transactions, and reporting suspicious activities, including large cash transactions involving amounts over 10,000 AUD (roughly $6,430). The task force will monitor the sector to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with these rules and minimize the risks the kiosks pose, such as facilitating money laundering, scams, and other illicit activities. The recent warning aligns with AUSTRAC’s stance that digital currencies and exchanges pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks. In its 2024 National Risk Assessment Report , the agency identified cryptocurrencies as a “high” risk channel to enable illicit activities. It warned that these risks are expected to increase over the next three years. Beyond Australia, some other jurisdictions have also turned their focus to regulating crypto ATMs to curb illicit activities. In late August, German regulators confiscated 13 crypto ATMs in a sting operation and warned that unlicensed operators would face severe penalties, including jail time of up to 5 years. Similarly, in the UK, during a money laundering case against an illegal operator, the Financial Conduct Authority declared that no crypto ATMs are legally operating in the country.

Howells accidentally discarded the hard drive during an office cleanup in 2013, and since then, his requests to search the landfill have been consistently rejected by Newport City Council. The council argues that discarded items in the landfill become their property and cannot be sold or retrieved. Howells has offered the council 25% of the recovered funds to gain permission for the search , but the council remains firm, citing legal and logistical challenges. Howells has assembled a team of data recovery and excavation experts who have pinpointed the likely location of the hard drive. Their plan involves a targeted excavation designed to minimize environmental impact. During a hearing at a Welsh court on December 2, his legal team argued that the project is being managed on a contingency basis, with the experts only receiving payment if the Bitcoin is recovered. The council's legal team dismissed the proposal, calling it an attempt to purchase something they claim cannot legally be sold. The hard drive, buried in the landfill for over a decade, represents one of the biggest losses in Bitcoin history. Social media users have compared Howells' misfortune to other famous cryptocurrency mishaps, such as the man who spent 10,000 Bitcoin on two pizzas in 2010, which would be worth billions today. Despite the obstacles, Howells continues to fight for permission to search the landfill. If his plans are approved, the recovery process would still be extremely challenging, likened to searching for a needle in a haystack. If denied, Howells’ story will remain a cautionary tale about the risks of handling digital assets.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-06 09:01:00

Gray Swan Events to Prepare For,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-2025-gray-swan-events-could-shape-crypto-markets/,"The post Crypto Market Turmoil in 2025? Gray Swan Events to Prepare For appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you are into crypto, you would be well experienced with its unpredictability. It is full of surprises. One day, prices soar and the next they might fall. According to Gareth Nicholson , Chief Investment Officer at Nomura, 2025 might bring some huge turmoil events to the global financial markets. He had made a 100 pages report for the next year that also contains some “Gray Swan Events”. Let’s understand what these events are and how they can affect the crypto market in the upcoming year. Nomura's list of 6 potential gray swan events is pretty sobering tbh: 1. Nvidia crash 2. Carry implosion 3. US 10YY > 6% 4. US growth shock 5. Geopolitics gets out of hand 6. China stimulus falls short pic.twitter.com/YmNcht8c3p — David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) December 6, 2024 What These Gray Swans Mean for Crypto Gray Swan Events are such events which have very low or almost no chance of happening but if they happen, leaves huge impacts. Nicholas has mentioned the below mentioned events in his report in Nomura’s 2025 Outlook. 1. NVIDIA Crash: Trouble for Crypto Mining NVIDIA is more than just a tech giant—it’s at the core of crypto mining. If its value drops sharply, miners might struggle to get the hardware they need. This could slow down blockchain networks and leave smaller cryptocurrencies exposed to attacks. If miners can’t access affordable tech, it could also lower confidence in the entire crypto ecosystem. A crash like this could lead to panic selling, and as a result, Bitcoin and altcoins may tumble. 2. Carry Trade Unwind: Liquidity Fades If this happens people will not have funds to invest more in crypto and they can even withdraw their crypto portfolios. Even big investors, in order to secure their money, might pull out their funds from the crypto market, triggering panic sales and plummeting. Still, some investors may see Bitcoin as a safer bet during tough times, viewing it as a hedge against traditional markets. But it’s a gamble either way. 3. Rising Treasury Yields: Pressure on Bitcoin If US Treasury yields go above 6%, it might make more sense for investors to park their money in safer, steady options. For crypto, this could reduce its appeal. People might move away from high-risk assets like Bitcoin and opt for more stable returns. However, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation could grow in this scenario. Higher Treasury yields might weaken the dollar, and Bitcoin could be seen as a better alternative. In the end, how people view Bitcoin—either as “digital gold” or just a speculative investment—will determine its fate. 4. US Growth Shock: What Happens If the Economy Slows Down? If the US economy unexpectedly slows down in 2025, it could cause big problems for markets worldwide. A shock like this would reduce the amount of money available for investment, making it harder for people to access funds and causing markets to drop. The crypto market, already seen as high-risk, might take an even bigger hit as investors pull back from risky assets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could see their prices fall as the global financial environment tightens. 5. Geopolitical Tensions: Can Bitcoin Handle It? When political conflicts happen, markets usually take a hit. Investors often turn to safer assets like gold, which can cause crypto to struggle. The world has witnessed this multiple times like during the conflicts in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin might stand out in these tough times. Since it’s decentralized, people in areas with financial restrictions could see it as a way to keep their money safe. While political tensions may cause short-term drops in the crypto market, Bitcoin could gain more support in the long run as people look for alternatives to traditional finance. 6. China stimulus falls short If China’s economic stimulus plan doesn’t live up to expectations, it could cause a slowdown in demand for Bitcoin. Investors might lose confidence in China’s ability to boost its economy, which could spill over into global markets, including crypto. Instead of pushing Bitcoin’s price higher, this scenario could result in lower investor sentiment and increased volatility, as markets react to the disappointment. Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now part of the larger financial ecosystem. Events like an NVIDIA crash or rising Treasury yields could bring both challenges and new opportunities. The key to navigating 2025 will be staying informed, flexible, and prepared for the unexpected Gray Swan Events. Crypto’s future will depend on how well it adapts to these changes. By preparing yourself, you can make the most of whatever happens in the coming year.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:01:34

With its focus on capital-efficient innovation, community-driven participation, and 100% revenue sharing among token holders, Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation, a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara, two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate. The Upcoming Public Sale The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format. The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06. Key Sale Details: Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply). Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30. Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients. For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M, Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M. The Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem. About Ocelex Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer 2. Ocelex democratizes sophisticated liquidity strategies, seamlessly connecting everyday traders with expert-level capabilities. It features a competitive ecosystem of Automated Liquidity Managers (ALMs) and strategists, all striving to optimize returns, minimize risks like impermanent loss, and boost overall efficiency for every user.

The altcoin surged 35% over the past day, hitting a seven-month high of $2.45 on Nov. 6, bringing its market cap to over $1.67 billion. The recent rally positioned DYDX as the leading gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, ranking 94th according to data from CoinGecko at press time. dydx ( DYDX ) ‘s price surge also extended its fortnightly gains to over 83% while boosting its monthly gains to more than 125%. Daily trading volume for the token jumped 113.9% over the previous day to over $369 million. Why did DYDX price soar today? DYDX’s recent rally was primarily driven by reports that President-elect Donald Trump appointed David O. Sacks as the White House Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency. The news gained traction as Sacks’ venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, has made a significant investment in DYDX. This connection between the newly appointed crypto czar and the token fueled strong bullish sentiment among its investors, propelling DYDX to recent gains.

With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%).

With its focus on capital-efficient innovation , community-driven participation , and 100% revenue sharing among token holders , Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation , a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara , two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users.

These documents , which reveal important details about U.S. military actions, civilian deaths, and interrogation techniques, will be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, making them impossible to erase or hide. Why It Matters The Afghan War Logs were a huge deal when they were released in 2010. They showed the truth about the war in Afghanistan, including things the public didn’t know. To make sure this information can never be lost or hidden, Assange’s team is putting them on Bitcoin’s blockchain, where they’ll stay forever. Even if WikiLeaks’ website gets shut down, these documents will always be available. How It Works Project Spartacus will use Bitcoin’s blockchain to store these 76,911 files. They’ll be turned into small pieces of Bitcoin called satoshis, using a tool called Ordinals. This process will start on December 12, 2024, and will take some time because there are so many documents. Once they’re on the blockchain, they can’t be changed or erased. Interestingly, this project is more than just storing documents—it’s also about remembering Julian Assange’s role in the fight for free speech. Assange’s team isn’t trying to raise money from this project; instead, they want to honor his legacy by putting these important files on Bitcoin, a decentralized system that can’t be controlled or stopped by any government. Bitcoin’s Power to Protect Information What makes this project so special is Bitcoin’s ability to protect information from censorship. Julian Assange’s story is tightly connected to Bitcoin’s early days and its mission of resisting censorship. When traditional banks blocked WikiLeaks from receiving funds, Bitcoin became a lifeline, raising over $30 million to help with Assange’s legal battles. This showed the world how Bitcoin could stand strong where traditional systems failed. Even Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, noticed this and worried about the sudden spotlight on the new currency back in 2010. Assange proved how Bitcoin could support free speech by keeping WikiLeaks running despite global financial roadblocks, making it a real-world example of Bitcoin’s power to fight censorship. With Project Spartacus, WikiLeaks is not just preserving history—it’s making sure it’s never erased.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:06:49

At one point, it even managed to outpace USDT and claim the third spot. It’s up by more than 45% in the past seven days, clearly being the best-performing altcoin from the top 10. However, over the past few days, things have changed a bit, and XRP is now in a state of correction, down 5.3% in the past day alone. Source: TradingView As you can see in the chart above, XRP topped at around $2.9 the other day, and it has been declining since then, losing about 20% in the process. Interestingly enough, this happened when Donald Trump selected Paul Atkins as the new chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In Trump’s own words: “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” So, if the next SEC Chair is relatively pro-crypto, why is the XRP price going down ? Well, it’s important to look at things from perspective and understand that the cryptocurrency increased by almost 400% in less than 30 days at one point (before the recent correction). Nothing ever goes up in a straight line, and corrections are due. Another reason besides the market getting overheated could be the precise fact that Trump announced his candidate for the SEC Chairman. Many traders may have bought up the cryptocurrency in anticipation of his choice, essentially turning the event into a “sell-the-news.” On top of everything else, there’s also the fact that the entire market is seemingly going through a correction over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, for once, dropped to as low as $92,000 in a flash crash before recovering to where it’s currently trading.

Here’s What Experts Are Saying,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-is-rlusd-a-threat-to-xrp-heres-what-experts-are-saying/,"The post XRP News : Is RLUSD a Threat to XRP? Here’s What Experts Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price dropped sharply from $2.59 to $2.31 within 24 hours, bringing its market cap down by 12% to $131.42 billion. This decline pushed XRP out of its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency, falling behind Tether (USDT). Futures trading volume also plummeted from $32 billion to $16 billion, signaling reduced market activity. The decline is largely tied to increased selling pressure and market speculation, potentially influenced by the delay in Ripple’s RLUSD token launch. With this fluctuation, the community is in doubt that RLUSD may impact XRP which is initially planned to operate on Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). But analysts refuse such claims here’s what it means for you! RLUSD and XRP: A Partnership, Not a Rivalry Vincent Van Code, a key community voice, cleared up confusion about Ripple’s RLUSD token, emphasizing it won’t replace XRP but instead enhances the XRP Ledger (XRPL). XRP remains at the core of XRPL, streamlining cross-border transactions and solving inefficiencies in traditional forex systems by directly pairing various currencies with XRP like AUD/XRP or USD/XRP, saving costs and improving efficiency. A standout feature of XRPL is its auto-bridging capability, which simplifies currency conversions. For instance, sending RLUSD to someone in RLYEN is seamless, thanks to XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) pools. These pools stabilize prices and ensure smooth operations, even during market volatility. XRP continues to power the system as its indispensable backbone. Ripple’s Strategy Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, highlights that XRP is vital to the XRPL because it is decentralized and doesn’t rely on a middleman. While RLUSD adds new features to the system, it works alongside XRP rather than replacing it. Experts believe RLUSD’s launch might help increase XRP’s value over time, with predictions ranging from small gains to a potential high of $10 in a year. According to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse RLUSD will largely target the big institutional players. He even added that, once RLUSD is available, it will use both RLUSD and XRP in its cross-border payments solution making the experience more enhanced for the users. Though it is still not clear if RLUSD is a threat to XRP or not, XRP’s sudden rise towards the end of the year made it clear that XRP has all the possibility to rise, and RLUSD launch can only be a bonus to this bullish momentum.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|MINING|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:12:04

Speaking to Bloomberg TV on December 6, Summers argued the idea served more to please campaign donors than to benefit the nation. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary likened the proposal to historical strategies like accumulating gold reserves at Fort Knox or maintaining a national oil reserve but argued Bitcoin lacks the same strategic purpose. “Why would the government support a sterile inventory of Bitcoin? It’s purely about pandering to special interests,” Summers added. A Divided Debate on Bitcoin’s Role in Debt Management The remarks follow Trump’s campaign suggestion to retain the 198,000 BTC seized by the U.S. government—an amount valued at over $19 billion. Trump-aligned lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, have even proposed legislation to have the U.S. acquire 1 million BTC, representing approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply, as a long-term asset. Lummis’ push for a Bitcoin reserve is rooted in the idea of leveraging it to reduce the nation’s $36 trillion debt . However, critics argue that this approach is overly optimistic. Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, recently noted during a crypto summit that while a Bitcoin reserve might be beneficial, it is no substitute for structural fiscal reforms. “You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits,” Roy said. Balancing Innovation and Practicality While Summers dismissed the Bitcoin reserve idea, he acknowledged that not all of Trump’s crypto rhetoric is without merit. “I think we need to support financial innovation wherever it may go,” he remarked, suggesting that overzealous regulatory measures could be hindering the crypto industry’s growth. Summers’ stance reflects a broader skepticism within traditional finance circles about Bitcoin’s utility as a reserve asset . Despite his criticism, Summers, who once advised crypto giant Digital Currency Group, emphasized the importance of fostering innovation in financial technology.

The token will trade under the ticker $PENGU, arriving after three years of adoption for the Penguins collection. Introducing $PENGU , the official coin of Pudgy Penguins. Launching in 2024. Learn more below. pic.twitter.com/J715bODcM6 — Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) December 6, 2024 Luca Netz , the CEO of Pudgy Penguins, announced a virtual meeting on December 7, with more potential information for the token launch. The token will try to reach multiple communities, in addition to current users. Pudgy Penguins is still connecting real-world shopping behaviors with crypto culture, and PENGU will also be used to that end. The token launch arrives shortly after Pudgy Penguins received a funding round from Animoca Brands . The PENGU token will launch on Solana, gaining access to some of the most active meme communities and wallet users. The token will run with a total supply of 88,888,888,888. The team will receive 17.8% of that supply, with a one-year cliff unlock and three years of vesting. More than 25% will be reserved for the community, with 24% reserved for other communities and incentives. The remaining PENGU will go toward the company reserves and for liquidity purposes. A small allocation will go to any remaining FTT token holders. Alameda Research and the FTX market operators were among Pudgy Penguin holders, though they have since moved on, leaving the project to the community. The token announcement has activated scam attempts around the token allocation. For now, there has been no token generation event (TGE), and the official Pudgy Penguins is yet to announce the mechanism of airdropping the tokens. The token launch is inviting scammers with fake links and Telegram bots, which may lead to NFT or asset losses. Can NFT make a comeback? Top collections retain high floor prices, but the mass rush to NFT is not there yet. The two events that may revive the sector are the MagicEden airdrop and the relaunch of OpenSea . MagicEden ME airdrops are often touted as having a value of a few hundred dollars. However, some users are reporting zero allocation, despite holding valuable NFTs and having a trading history. OpenSea announced it expects a relaunch in December, while also sparking expectations for an airdrop. Recently, the market operator sent out a message to its community, asking how long users relied on its platform for NFT swaps. It may be precisely the airdrop hopes that are boosting some collection holders. A retroactive snapshot from 2021 or 2022 activity levels would make many early NFT adopters return to the market. NFT-based tokens may become a new asset class, though arriving rather late in the game, as most altcoins already had their strongest rallies for the year.

These expirations often spark sudden price swings, and the tension is already building. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 5% in a single day, falling from its all-time high to $98K, while Ethereum has slipped to $3,890. Bitcoin: $2.29 Billion Options Set to Expire Data from Deribit shows that 23,481 Bitcoin contracts, valued at approximately $2.29 billion, are expiring today. The put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin stands at 1.11, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The maximum pain point, the level at which most options expire worthless, is at $97,000. Bitcoin has already seen a sharp drop, falling nearly 5% to $98,000, down from its recent all-time high of $100,000. Analysts from Greeks.live commented on this volatility, highlighting the resilience of the crypto market. 6 Dec Options Delivery Data 23,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.11, a maxpain point of $97,000 and a notional value of $2.3 billion. 147,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.62, a maxpain of $3,500 and a notional value of $570 million. Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/APzvJ1ohe3 — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 6, 2024 However, Bitcoin’s rise to $103,000 is incredible, but the recent sharp drop cleared out many leveraged positions. Still, the overall market is strong, and sentiment remains positive with solid buying in the spot market. Despite this optimism, high funding rates for leveraged contracts show that traders may have overextended their bullish bets. This raises concerns about more possible pullbacks. Ethereum: $585 Million in Contracts Expiring Ethereum is also facing significant expirations, with 148,733 contracts worth around $585 million set to expire . Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s put-to-call ratio is 0.55, indicating a more bullish sentiment. The maximum pain point for Ethereum stands at $3,500, slightly below its current price of $3,890. Ethereum’s lower put-to-call ratio suggests that traders are more optimistic about its price recovery compared to Bitcoin. However, the impact of these expirations on both assets is expected to be short-term. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Ethereum? As these massive options contracts expire, prices may move toward their maximum pain levels, causing temporary volatility.

Among those contenders is Lunex Network , a new project attracting attention with its multichain interoperability and DeFi solutions. With over $4.4 million raised in its presale so far and a unique revenue-sharing model, Lunex Network is appealing to Fetch.ai and Arbitrum investors seeking high-growth potential assets. Arbitrum One Hits $20 Billion TVL Milestone Arbitrum One has hit $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) and is now a top Layer-2 blockchain. This milestone demonstrates the solid foundation of Arbitrum and the growing faith of investors in Layer-2 solutions. The Arbitrum Foundation is continually developing its ecosystem towards AI and tech advancements. Such growths reflect Arbitrum’s intent to remain at the forefront of blockchain advancements. As of December 5, Arbitrum’s ARB gained 17.46% to $1.18 and its market cap hit $4.84 billion. However, despite the rise, Arbitrum’s trading volume decreased by 3.01% to $1.38 billion. Nevertheless, the TVL growth shows Arbitrum One’s expanding presence in the blockchain space and its potential to rewrite decentralized finance down the road. Fetch.ai (FET) Breaks Out with 12% Surge, Eyes $2.70 Following Earn-and-Burn Announcement Fetch.ai (FET) has made waves following the launch of its “Earn-and-Burn” mechanism, which aims to reduce token supply by burning up to 100 million tokens in December. This move has sparked bullish momentum, pushing Fetch.ai out of weeks-long consolidation in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Breaking above $1.68, Fetch.ai surged to $1.94 within 24 hours, marking a solid 12% gain. The next major resistance levels lie at $2 and $2.15, with a successful break potentially paving the way to $2.70 for Fetch.ai—an impressive 71% upside. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 65, indicating upward potential without being overbought. If Fetch.ai holds above its breakout zone, the rally is likely to continue. Lunex Network: Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with Seamless Interoperability and Lucrative Staking Rewards Lunex network promises explosive growth due to its unique ability to join isolated blockchains together as a Network. This allows traders to swap over 50,000 crypto pairs at the best rates. Rather than utilizing outdated security protocols, Lunex Network (LNEX) leverages the latest smart contracts technology to facilitate crypto transactions. The platform includes an advanced, user-friendly, and efficient interface for trading, staking, and liquidity all without the KYC verification procedure. Users keep complete control over their assets and all trades are conducted over the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, Lunex Network does away with third-party wallets, giving security-conscious traders a break. Lunex Network also boasts a lucrative revenue-sharing system, with staking rewards offering up to 18% APY in as little as 30 days. Traders can increase their passive income by adding more Lunex Network tokens to their staking pool without losing their existing APY. The deflationary nature of the $LNEX token, supported by Lunex Network’s open-market buyback mechanism, further drives its value. Priced at just $0.0038 per token, Lunex Network is attracting both retail and institutional investors who have poured over $4.4M into the project so far. Analysts project a 2000% surge by the end of its presale, with potential for an additional 1,000% rally in 2025.

Based on these trends, IntoTheBlock expect a more conservative growth range of 100%-200% from the halving price, suggesting a peak between $130,000 and $190,000. IntoTheBlock analysts particularly wrote: So while some are calling for a million dollars per Bitcoin, a more reasonable expectation would be a 100%-200% return from the halving price, placing the top between 130k and 190k. However the analysts also pointed out: “That is, unless Bitcoin becomes a global reserve asset of course.” Analyzing Market Trends and Investor Behaviour Meanwhile, a CryptoQuant analyst has provided additional insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance and market behaviour. According to the analyst, Bitcoin purchases continue to rise, with the Coinbase Premium Index reflecting strong buying activity in the United States. The index, which tracks the difference in price between Coinbase Pro and Binance, shows sustained positive data, indicating active participation by US investors. The analyst emphasized the importance of monitoring this index alongside broader trend analysis. For example, during periods classified as “fear phases,” where buyers retreat and bearish momentum fails to materialize, the market often creates opportunities for strategic entry points.

By focusing on simplifying user experiences—whether through gasless transactions or robust network performance—these initiatives are transforming blockchain from a niche technology into a practical tool for everyday users. Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko Lauds Meme Coins for Driving Network Resilience Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently credited the rise of meme coins with stress-testing the blockchain into becoming more resilient, transforming its past outages into opportunities for engineering innovation. Speaking at the Emergence conference in Prague, Yakovenko offered insights into how the network has evolved and thrived under pressure. ”Blessed are the meme coin traders, for those who can overcome their spam will inherit the metaverse,” Yakovenko quipped during the discussion. He likened the impact of meme coins to that of NFTs, saying, ”As with NFTs...we're blessed to solve a whole bunch of engineering problems with meme coins. It just makes the network and all the systems more robust.” Yakovenko highlighted that Solana’s developers have built a reputation for tackling extraordinarily difficult challenges. This ethos, which he referred to as “chewing glass,” has been instrumental in creating a high-performance blockchain capable of withstanding the rigors of unpredictable usage. The Solana network, which suffered a series of well-publicized outages in 2022, has significantly improved its reliability. In 2023, it experienced just one outage, occurring in February, shortly after the January launch of Pump.fun, a meme coin-driven platform. The reduction in downtime marks a dramatic improvement over the network’s earlier performance, signaling that the team’s iterative approach is paying off. ”We were just lucky enough to ship fast enough to have those bugs behind us,” Yakovenko said, explaining the changes to Solana’s development strategy. The network’s evolution required addressing intricate technical challenges associated with multi-core systems. These systems, Yakovenko noted, can experience cascading issues — from memory bandwidth bottlenecks to transaction throughput delays — that compound and disrupt performance. ”These problems...I have never seen anyone predict them in research, let alone have solutions for them,” Yakovenko added. The Solana team’s ability to iterate quickly in response to real-world usage, often spurred by the chaos brought by meme coin activity, has been key to overcoming these challenges. A Single State Advantage Yakovenko argued that Solana’s architectural design—its single state execution environment—plays a critical role in its scalability and usability. Unlike layer 2 solutions, which often require additional bridges and infrastructure, Solana’s unified state allows for faster, simpler, and cheaper transactions. “Raydium did not expect that every meme coin is going to use their pools for launches,” Yakovenko said, referring to the popular decentralized exchange on Solana. “But nobody had to ask Raydium, ‘Hey, can we do this?’ [and] nobody had to go and create additional bridges. It just became easy, and that ease of use and lack of fees and friction creates a thriving ecosystem.” Yakovenko pointed out that while other blockchain networks could theoretically replicate this functionality using layer 2 solutions, the inherent complexity and developer inertia often favor Solana’s streamlined approach. “In theory, it’s possible,” Yakovenko mused. “But developers are lazy and will take the path of least resistance.” The rise of meme coins on Solana has come as both a surprise and a natural progression in hindsight. Yakovenko shared his initial reaction to the phenomenon, admitting that he hadn’t anticipated the level of popularity these tokens would achieve on the network. However, upon reflection, the trend aligns with broader patterns in digital economies. “In almost all digital economies, entertainment is the biggest place where money is made,” Yakovenko noted. “When I start to think of it backwards, it’s almost obvious in retrospect.” The Solana network’s ability to turn challenges into strengths has positioned it as a robust blockchain ecosystem. From outages to innovations, the journey has been marked by adaptability and resilience. As Solana continues to grow, its commitment to performance, ease of use, and cost-efficiency ensures it remains a major player in the blockchain space, prepared to face the next wave of challenges—and opportunities—that come its way. Plena and Solana Partner to Revolutionize DeFi Accessibility with Gasless Transactions Blockchain technology has long been touted as a tool for breaking free from centralization, but its complex user experience has kept many from fully engaging with its benefits. Complicated onboarding processes, gas fee management, fragmented ecosystems, and a lack of intuitive wallet recovery options have created significant barriers to adoption. Now, a partnership between Plena, a crypto super app, and Solana, one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks, promises to simplify these challenges and usher in a new era of user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi). While blockchain’s potential to disrupt centralized systems is well-documented, the infrastructure has been notoriously difficult for newcomers to navigate. Managing volatile native tokens for gas fees, understanding complex wallet mechanics, and interacting with fragmented DApps have created a steep learning curve. These barriers have kept DeFi out of reach for many, despite its transformative potential. Simplifying the user experience is essential for bringing blockchain to mainstream audiences. The Plena-Solana partnership represents a critical step toward making DeFi intuitive, accessible, and widely adopted. Plena, a crypto super app with built-in account abstraction, has announced its integration with Solana. Account abstraction allows users to engage with blockchain services seamlessly by abstracting away technical complexities. This enables single-click swaps and trades, gasless transactions, and access to decentralized applications (DApps) like Jupiter — all within Plena’s unified interface. Through this partnership, Plena aims to make DeFi as effortless as using a traditional financial app. By integrating with Solana, a blockchain renowned for its speed, scalability, and affordability, the collaboration promises to eliminate common entry barriers and expand DeFi’s reach. Solana has emerged as a leading “consumer blockchain,” capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with near-zero fees. This speed and scalability have made it the go-to network for developers creating consumer-focused applications. Its vibrant ecosystem, bolstered by the meme coin craze, has driven confidence among users and developers alike. Recently, Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes hit all-time highs, even surpassing Ethereum and layer 2 solutions. This momentum solidifies Solana’s position as a decentralized trading powerhouse, perfectly suited for partnerships like the one with Plena. One of the most groundbreaking aspects of the Plena-Solana integration is the introduction of gasless transactions. Traditionally, users need native tokens like SOL or ETH to pay for gas fees when interacting with DApps or executing trades. This requirement often confuses newcomers and deters adoption. Plena eliminates this hurdle by enabling users to perform swaps, send tokens, and trade meme coins without holding SOL for gas fees. By abstracting this layer of complexity, Plena makes DeFi more accessible, allowing users to engage without needing to juggle multiple wallets or depend on centralized exchanges. This approach not only reduces friction but also enhances privacy and user control. Solana’s liquidity is another major advantage for decentralized trading. With billions of dollars in weekly trading volume, it has become a central hub for DeFi activities. Plena aims to make this liquidity more accessible by pairing Solana’s scalable network with a user-friendly interface. Plena’s super app, already boasting over 1.3 million active users, will introduce this audience to Solana’s ecosystem, unlocking extensive DEX volumes without the technical challenges that have traditionally plagued DeFi platforms. Available on the App Store, Google Play, and Telegram, the app bridges the gap between sophisticated blockchain technology and everyday users. The Future of DeFi: Intuitive and Inclusive The integration of Plena with Solana represents a pivotal moment in blockchain’s evolution. By focusing on gasless transactions, seamless asset bridging, and a simplified user experience, the partnership sets a new standard for consumer blockchain applications. Users can now tap into Solana’s liquidity with minimal friction, making DeFi as accessible as traditional financial services. This collaboration also shows the broader trend of improving blockchain usability. By removing barriers and making DeFi intuitive, projects like Plena are paving the way for mass adoption. With Solana’s unmatched speed and scalability powering this transformation, the DeFi landscape is poised for significant growth. The partnership between Plena and Solana demonstrates how blockchain technology is evolving to meet the demands of a broader audience. By simplifying complex processes, eliminating gas fees, and leveraging Solana’s high-performance infrastructure, Plena is setting a benchmark for user-friendly DeFi solutions. As blockchain continues to mature, integrations like this signal a future where decentralized finance is not just a tool for early adopters but a cornerstone of mainstream financial systems. With over a million users already on board, Plena’s expansion into the Solana ecosystem marks a significant step toward making DeFi accessible to everyone.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 09:35:40

However, crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of a change when SEC chairman Gary Gensler leaves office in January 2025. As reported by Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett, the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will be rejecting at least two of the five Solana (SOL) spot ETFs 19b-4 filings. Terrett shared the news on her X account, adding that the financial watchdog’s general consensus is that ETFs will no longer be approved under the outgoing administration. In a response to their post, a user asked if there’s a likelihood of one Solana ETF being approved, to which the journalist replied, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” Source: X _Many investors worry about what will become of Solana as other crypto coins get their ETFs approved. Is Solana missing out? Or the coin and it’s blockchain are okay as they are? Investors still hopeful of a future Solana ETF approval Across several social media platforms, the crypto community showered blame on the regulatory views of Joe Biden’s administration and SEC chair Gary Gensler. Crypto supporters believe the current regime used too much bureaucracy in the regulatory landscape of digital currencies. Nate Geraci, president and co-founder of The ETF Institute, believes the approval of new crypto spot ETFs was highly unlikely after Donald Trump’s presidential elections victory. “No surprise, but won’t be any movement on spot crypto ETF filings until new leadership is in place.” Geraci remarked. Several pro-crypto advocates on X are hopeful spot crypto ETF applications will be approved when Donald Trump enters office in January next year. Moreover, they expect the stringent regulatory landscape will loosen up when incoming US SEC chair Paul Atkins takes charge. One user expressed their belief that everything the SEC opposes will be authorized after Trump’s inauguration. They went on to say there’s no sense of delaying it for a couple months other than toying with the crypto community’s emotions. Source: X The current battle for SOL and XRP ETFs is what was in the days of BTC and ETH ETFs. Many are taunting that under Trump, many more altcoin ETFs will take market root because of the promise he made once he took office as POTUS. Bitcoin, and Ether ETFs performances show Solana investors missing out on profits The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed remarkable inflows and growth milestones, collectively attracting over $17 billion in net inflows within nine months. Over the last couple of months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has led the Bitcoin ETF inflows charge, currently boasting over $50 billion in assets under management, per CoinGlass data . Recent updates from CoinGlass also reveal a significant surge in inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. On December 3 alone, these funds recorded $675.97 million in inflows, a 90% increase from the $353.67 million seen the previous day. This marked the fourth consecutive day of net inflows, totaling over $1.45 billion during this period. BlackRock’s IBIT witnessed $693.25 million in single-day inflows, bringing its holdings to over 500,000 BTC. The fund now accounts for approximately 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply and has nearly $50 billion in assets under management, solidifying its position among the top ETF launches of 2024. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $52.17 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB secured $16.21 million and $7.8 million, respectively. In the Ether space, spot ETFs have seen net inflows reach $1.3 billion since their launch in July 2024. That said, Ethereum spot ETFs have faced several challenges in FY 2024, including restrictions on staking and options trading and limited distribution through major brokerages. Source: X Without ETF approval, Solana investors continue missing out on the substantial inflows and institutional attention enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a Solana ETF is not approved soon, this could hinder SOL’s acceptance in traditional investment portfolios, potentially negatively impacting growth and price trends. At the time of writing, Solana’s price is hovering around the $237-$240 region, up 2% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko updates . Analysts believe the price could gain ground to $290 if the coin breaks past its consolidation phase, but there’s growing skepticism that it could reach $300 following the news of Solana spot ETF application rejections.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

Ripple is finalizing the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, pending NYDFS approval. Meanwhile, Singapore-based Dtcpay is transitioning to a stablecoin-only model by 2025, focusing on USDC, USDt, FDUSD, and WUSD to improve payment reliability and scalability. Chainalysis, under its new CEO Jonathan Levin, also expects some stablecoin regulatory clarity by 2025. USDC Becomes First to Meet Canada’s New Listing Rules Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced that its United States dollar-pegged token achieved compliance with Canada's forthcoming listing requirements set by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This milestone positions USDC as the first stablecoin to meet the criteria under the CSA’s Value-Referenced Crypto Asset (VCRA) framework, which allows it to remain listed on licensed Canadian crypto trading platforms beyond the Dec. 31, 2024 compliance deadline. The VCRA classification applies to crypto assets that are designed to maintain a stable value by referencing fiat currencies, other values, or a combination thereof. Circle’s compliance was also solidified through its alignment with the Ontario Securities Commission's regulations. The company is led by Jeremy Allaire, and he believes in the potential for USDC to better cross-border payments and improve Canada’s retail and institutional settlement systems by offering lower transaction costs, increased consumer protections, reduced settlement risks, and heightened competition in payments. This latest development is part of Circle’s broader global expansion, which includes its French subsidiary achieving compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. This allows it to issue both USDC and the euro-backed stablecoin, Euro Coin (EURC), across the EU. In Asia, Circle’s Singaporean subsidiary received a payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in June of 2023. Currently, USDC holds a market cap of more than $40.3 billion, trailing only Tether (USDT) in the $201.2 billion stablecoin market . Top stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, also recently revealed plans for the city to start adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet as part of a strategy to diversify investments. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a combination of assets. These coins achieve stability through mechanisms like full backing by reserves or algorithmic adjustments to their supply. Stablecoins are often used in digital transactions, and they offer a more reliable and less volatile alternative for payments, savings, and trading in the crypto ecosystem. New Chainalysis CEO Expects Stablecoin Regulation Clarity in 2025 Chainalysis recently appointed Jonathan Levin, its chief strategy officer and co-founder, as its new CEO after the departure of Michael Gronager in October. Levin assumed the role on Dec. 3, which was announced in a Dec. 5 statement. The company also welcomed Paul Auvil, former chief financial officer at Proofpoint, as an independent director on its board. Under Levin’s leadership, Chainalysis plans to expand its international presence, and to enhance protections for cryptocurrency users globally as well as develop private-sector solutions for digital asset custody. Levin shared that while policymakers are unlikely to change their approach to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and national security concerns, he hopes to see more clarity on stablecoin regulations, particularly concerning their issuance, redemption, and regulatory oversight. In October, Chainalysis reported a surge in Bitcoin transactions in the United States after the approval of more spot crypto exchange-traded funds. On the other hand, it also noted a decline in stablecoin activity compared to other countries. The share of stablecoin transactions on U.S.-regulated exchanges dropped from about 50% in 2023 to under 40% in 2024. However, Levin expects some major regulatory developments in the United States, including the potential repeal of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which mandates financial institutions to account for customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Although lawmakers voted to overturn the rule, it was vetoed by President Joe Biden in May. Levin also expects more detailed guidance and no-action letters addressing new crypto applications and tokens. RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval Ripple has been at the forefront of stablecoin news lately, and the company finally addressed the speculation surrounding the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple clarified that the token did not launch on Dec. 4 as rumored. In a statement on X, Ripple confirmed that RLUSD’s release is still pending final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The company plans to work very closely with the regulator to meet the highest standards before proceeding with the launch. RLUSD is a 1:1 U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and will be fully backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasury securities, and cash equivalents. Since August, the stablecoin has undergone beta testing on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet. Ripple has plans to expand RLUSD’s reach to additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and the stablecoin is designed to complement and enhance XRP within Ripple’s ecosystem. Ripple shared that it will provide updates as they become available. The crypto community is very eagerly awaiting the launch but has been warned to remain vigilant against potential scams. Ripple itself also warned people about an increase in fraudulent activity, and reminded users that it will never request XRP or solicit funds from them. Dtcpay Shifts to Stablecoin-Only Transactions Dtcpay, a Singapore-licensed crypto payment platform, announced plans to phase out support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) in favor of a stablecoin-only model. The transition is set to be completed by January of 2025, and will focus on supporting stablecoins like Tether’s USDt, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). The move aligns with Dtcpay’s mission to provide a more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience, as stablecoins already account for a large chunk of its transaction volume. Dtcpay was launched in 2019 and was formerly known as Digital Treasures Center. It secured a major payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2022, which allowed it to offer digital payment token (DPT) services. Since then, the platform has supported fiat and cryptocurrency payments for in-store and online transactions, including partnerships with major companies like Singapore’s Pontiac Land Group. Dtcpay wants to make it a priority to provide its users with diverse stablecoin options through the addition of FDUSD and WUSD . FDUSD is backed by reserves and operates on Ethereum and Binance-backed BNB Chain, and currently ranks as the sixth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. WUSD, issued by the Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network, is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio and fully backed by fiat reserves.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-06 09:45:45

Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is Manta Price Up Today? Following Bitcoin’s surge toward $100K, the price of Manta faced increasing buying pressure. This has also pushed the on-chain metrics of Manta price. Will Manta Price Reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network has been expanding its offerings and establishing multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta Reach $100?

Furthermore, the PNUT token has attracted more than 72k on-chain holders due to the deep liquidity of more than $20 million on different Solana-based DEXes led by Raydium, and Jupiter. Lucky PNUT Trader Exits Via Binance According to on-chain data analysis by Lookonchain , a lucky memecoin trader spent 2,717 SOL units, worth about $450k on November 5, 2024, to purchase 6.16 million $PNUT. Following the meme coin’s listing on Binance in mid-November, the underlying value surged over 17x in the subsequent weeks to trade about $1.36 on Friday, December 6, during the mid-London session.

The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has positively influenced many cryptos, especially those with high market capitalisation. Meanwhile, most experts confirm the beginning of the Alt Season. Unsurprisingly, crypto enthusiasts are eager to know what is next for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Bitcoin Halving Pattern and Price Predictions In the previous halving cycle, which began on May 11, 2020, and ended on April 19, 2024, the Bitcoin market experienced a surge of approximately 645.68%. At the beginning of the current cycle, the BTC price stood at around $63762.59. So far, in the current cycle, the market has showcased an increase of 53.8%. Experts project $120K as a reasonable target for Bitcoin in 2025. They also acknowledge the possibility of the price hitting $150K. However, they believe the highest the price can reach next year is $200K. Institutional Accumulation and Puell Multiple Outlook Experts note that the Puell Multiple chart, a metric for estimating the level of sell pressure in the market coming from miners, supports the assessment of Bitcoin going up to at least $120K next year. Currently, the Puell Multiple index stands at 1.241. At the start of this month, it stood at 1.76. On April 20, it hit a yearly peak of 2.77. On September 11, it touched a low of 0.48. Notably, in November, it fluctuated within the range of 1.3 and 0.93. Experts also emphasise the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Global Political Shift Towards Crypto In the latest US presidential election, pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump attained a massive victory over the ruling Democratic government, which had launched several regulatory crackdowns against the cryptocurrency industry. Recently, Trump announced his decision to nominate pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the successor of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who had invited the ire of the crypto community for his tougher regulatory approach. Since the US political landscape tilted towards the pro-crypto side, many global leaders have openly expressed their support for the crypto sector, especially Bitcoin. Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that it is impossible to ban Bitcoin and his country cannot ignore new technologies like digital currencies. Interestingly, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, while answering whether the rising interest in Bitcoin can be perceived as an indication of the emerging lack of trust in the US dollar, stated that Bitcoin poses no threat to the US dollar but actually competes with gold. Altcoin Season Duration and Insights While discussing the Alt Season, experts highlight crypto expert Miles Deutscher’s post, noting that the last altcoin season lasted at least 88 days. Emphasising the predictions of Deutscher, experts forecast that the altcoin market would achieve significant gains in 2025.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 09:53:01

While Solana and XRP ETFs are expected to be approved, FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC is preparing to reject spot SOL ETF applications. Terrett, who posted from his X account, said that the current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified at least two SOL spot ETF applicants that their 19/b-4 filings will be rejected. Terrett also cited sources as saying that no new cryptocurrency ETF applications will be approved during the current SEC administration. “SPECIAL NEWS: I have confirmed that the SEC has notified at least two of the five potential issuers that it will reject their 19/b-4 applications for spot Solana ETFs. “From what I’ve been told, the consensus here is that the SEC will not approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration.” This development from the SEC has senior analysts not expecting a major move until Paul Atkins became the US SEC Chairman in January. Speaking about the development in Solana ETFs, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said: “Not surprising, but there will be no movement on spot crypto ETF applications until there is a new SEC chairman… Lame duck.” Solana continues to trade at $238. *This is not investment advice.

The firm’s analysts expect Bitcoin to become a core component of institutional asset allocations and corporate treasuries. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote, “We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing gold.” This prediction comes as Bitcoin surges past the $100,000 mark for the first time, driven by a 141% surge in 2024 alone. The historic rally picked up steam after the U.S. presidential election on November 5, with investors betting on the incoming Trump administration to adopt policies favorable to the crypto industry. Bernstein projects Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by late 2025. Bitcoin kickstarts long-awaited bull run Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 barrier late Wednesday night, reaching a peak of $103,844.05. By Thursday afternoon, it pulled back slightly to $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics. The rally has been fueled by institutional support and political developments, including Trump’s plan to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler with Paul Atkins . Gary is viewed as a major obstacle to the sector’s growth. Trump’s announcement energized the market, as did his post on Truth Social, where he took credit for Bitcoin’s milestone. “You’re welcome,” he wrote. His administration promises to push for policies to support Bitcoin’s growth, such as removing taxes on crypto transactions and creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Bernstein isn’t alone in its optimism. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson called Bitcoin a low-correlation asset that could replace gold as a hedge against economic instability. “Bitcoin’s main application right now is as a store of value,” Luria said . However, he did point out that Bitcoin’s price still moves more in line with risk assets than gold does, making it less stable as a hedge. Luria attributed Bitcoin’s growth to its adoption rate rather than macroeconomic factors. Employment, regulation , tax policy, and globalization all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s value. Despite its rising profile, Luria acknowledged that Bitcoin still has hurdles to clear before it can function as a widely accepted medium of exchange or unit of account. “There is still a long path ahead,” he said. Bitcoin is here to stay The roots of Bitcoin’s appeal lie in its origins during the 2008 financial crisis. Created as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, Bitcoin promised a way to bypass banks and governments. Satoshi Nakamoto ’s Bitcoin Whitepaper described it as “peer-to-peer electronic cash,” laying the groundwork for what has now become a 2 trillion-dollar market. Over the years, Bitcoin has endured skepticism, hostility, and regulatory crackdowns, but its resilience has made it a favorite among both retail and institutional investors. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, called the $100,000 milestone a “paradigm shift.” He pointed to the pro-crypto policies expected under Trump as a key driver of Bitcoin’s continued success. While Novogratz warned that Bitcoin’s price won’t always move in a straight line upward, he remains bullish on its long-term potential. Bitcoin is now up more than 133% for the year, with a 42% gain since the November election. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed in on Bitcoin’s role in the financial ecosystem during the DealBook conference. “Bitcoin is just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell said, adding that it competes with gold rather than traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. It’s not exactly an endorsement, but it’s the closest we can get to when it comes to Powell.

The election of Trump is expected to significantly reduce crypto regulation, making now a good time to consider investing in DAPP. DAPP is still down from its inception in April 2021, but it has significantly outperformed the S&P Cryptocurrency DeFi Index over the past 3-year and 1-year time frames. DAPP is a high-risk, high-reward investment suitable for a speculative growth category within a well-diversified portfolio, rated as a buy. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) is a diversified yet relatively bold bet on the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The DAPP portfolio gives investors strong exposures to Bitcoin, digital asset exchanges, crypto miners, and other blockchain-based infrastructure companies. DAPP is +142% over the past year - no doubt supercharged by the thesis that Trump 2.0 will be much more friendly than the Biden administration toward all things crypto. That said, note that DAPP is still down significantly from its inception in April 2021 (see chart below). I would argue that, given the prospects for significant reductions in crypto regulation and the Trump 2.0 momentum factor, now is a good time to consider an allocation in the DAPP ETF. Today, I'll take a closer look at the DAPP and you can decide if it might be a good fit within your well-diversified portfolio. Data by YCharts Investment Thesis The election of Trump in November will likely lead to a step-function change in the regulatory outlook for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrencies in general. Indeed, Trump has said he wants the U.S. to become the ""Bitcoin superpower of the world"" and supports the establishment of a ""National Bitcoin Reserve"". Indeed, Trump recently announced crypto advocate Paul Atkins as his nominee for Chairman of the SEC. While there are other factors driving the recent price appreciation of BTC (see the Barron's article Why Did Bitcoin Surge Past $100,000 ), the response in the price of Bitcoin since the election is undeniable and has been both fast and furious: coinmarketcap.com As you can see from the graphic above, CoinMarketCap.com reports the current circulating supply of BTC is estimated to be 19.79 million and the total BTC market cap now exceeds US$2 trillion. As you know, the total possible BTC supply (i.e., the theoretical maximum mined limit) is capped at 21 million, which is estimated to be mined by the year 2140 . The point here is that there are only ~1.2 million BTC left to be mined (~5.7% of the total). With that as background, let's take a look to see how VanEck has positioned the DAPP ETF for investor success going forward. I'll start with a review of the top holdings. Top-10 Holdings The top-10 holdings are shown below and were taken directly from the VanEck DAPP ETF webpage where you can find more detailed information on the fund: Van Eck The #1 holding with an 11.7% weight is MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy is arguably no longer a software company at all, but is, instead, a whale holder of a large reserve of Bitcoin. Indeed, Seeking Alpha reports that MSTR bought a whopping $1.5 billion worth of BTC from November 25 to December 1. The purchases were made using the proceeds of a recent $21 billion stock offering. As of December 1, MicroStrategy held an aggregate of ~402,100 Bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of around $23.4 billion. Given the current BTC price (at pixel time) of $101,400, those BTCs are now worth $40.8 billion. MicroStrategy stock has soared on the ""Trump trade"" and is up 600%+ over the past year: Data by YCharts Coinbase Global ( COIN ) is the #2 holding with an 8.9% weight. COIN provides financial and technology infrastructure for consumers who want a marketplace to trade cryptocurrencies and/or securely accept crypto assets as payment. COIN announced its Q3 report on October 31st. Highlights included: Revenue of $1.2 billion (-17% qoq but +81% yoy) Net income of $75 million The 7th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA ($449 million in Q3) A $1 billion share buyback plan COIN stock is +133% over the past year and trades with a forward P/E=62x (on adjusted earnings). Block ( SQ ), the old ""Square"", is the #3 holding with a 6.6% weight. Block operates the popular ""Cash App"", along with supporting commerce and financial products, hardware, and software services. Block has established a strong long-term track record of revenue growth: Seeking Alpha Block stock is +50% over the past year and trades with a TTM P/E=58.4x and a forward P/E=28.0x . The #7 holding with a 5.4% weight is Applied Digital Corp. ( APLD ). Applied provides and operates digital infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing (""HPC"") and AI industries. APLD operates via three segments: Data Center Hosting Business, Cloud Services Business, and HPC Hosting Business. The company is expected to more than double revenue by 2026 (to $394 million). The Dallas-based company is +90% over the past year, but is still losing money (see Q4 FY24 results ), issuing shares (see here and here ), and taking on debt . Bitcoin miners are well represented in DAPP's top-10 holdings with Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), in aggregate, equating to a little over 10% of the entire portfolio. New York-based Cipher develops and operates industrial-scale Bitcoin mining in the U.S. Riot Platforms is also engaged in Bitcoin mining in the U.S. and operates through 3 segments: Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Engineering. The stocks of these two companies have been on divergent paths this year as RIOT has faced significant financial and operational challenges : Data by YCharts Performance As mentioned earlier, and despite the excellent performance over the past 12 months, the DAPP ETF is still down significantly from its price at inception in April 2021. The fund's 3-year average annual returns (-11%) reflect that fact: Van Eck That said, DAPP's 3-year and 1-year performance numbers significantly beat the S&P Cryptocurrency De-Fi Index (-29.3% and +38.4%, respectively). The following graphic compares the 1-year returns of the DAPP ETF as compared to two leading Bitcoin ETFs: The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ): Data by YCharts Interestingly enough, the DAPP ETF has been almost directly correlated to the Bitcoin ETFs over the past 6-months, with the 12-month returns being almost identical. ETF Basics: The following bullets summarize some of the ETF metrics that investors typically care about: Expense Ratio: 0.51% Total Net Assets: $211 million # of Holdings: 22 30-day SEC yield: 0% TTM P/E Ratio: 20.4x Price-to-Book Ratio: 3.34x As you can see, the DAPP ETF is certainly more expensive as compared to a low-cost S&P500 fund (VOO's expense fee is 0.03%). However, VanEck has a history of relatively expensive ETFs that deliver strong returns for investors (the SMH Semiconductor ETF, for example, is a favorite of mine). The DAPP ETF is still a ""young fund"" and $211 million of AUM is relatively tiny in the ETF universe. Likewise, the total number of holdings (22) is quite small. The (VanEck reported...) P/E and price-to-book ratios look almost too good to be true and are actually below that of the S&P500. Not sure how that works, considering many of the top holdings in the DAPP ETF are not yet GAAP earnings positive. Risks The risks of investing in DAPP are, to put it mildly, huge. I already mentioned the relatively low AUM and total number of holdings - both of which could lead to liquidity issues on a crypto-rout. Volatility is very high: back in Q2 of 2022, the DAPP ETF dropped a whopping 71%. Many of the companies in the DAPP portfolio are not yet GAAP earnings positive, and may never be. The DAPP ETF's portfolio of companies may have elevated risks as compared to ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin (like the FBTC and IBIT ETFs mentioned earlier) because these companies have balance sheets, employee payrolls, and operational expenses whereas pure Bitcoin, obviously, does not. Given the massive recent gains in Bitcoin and the crypto-related companies, you may have already ""missed the boat"" on the Trump 2.0 momentum thesis. Upside risks include investors not having any direct exposure to Bitcoin and/or blockchain-based companies, and totally missing out on a continued bull market in the space. Summary & Conclusion Followers who have read my articles on portfolio management know that many investors can afford to have a ""speculative growth"" category within their otherwise well-diversified portfolio. Indeed, I have written previous articles on why Bitcoin is an excellent choice for this category (i.e., high-risk, high reward). See my November 2020 Seeking Alpha article Bitcoin Penetrates Further Into The 'Mainstream' - It Should Penetrate Your Portfolio Too , for example. For investors who want to make an arguably more leveraged bet on Bitcoin/crypto as compared to the straight-up Bitcoin ETFs, I advise you to consider the DAPP ETF, which I rate as a buy to profit from market momentum driven by the Trump 2.0 thesis.",APLD|CIFR|COIN|FBTC|IBIT|MSTR|RIOT|SQ|DAPP,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-06 11:30:00

In a remarkable show of volatility, Bitcoin pumped from $98,100 to $104,100, dumped to $91,950 and pumped again above $98,000 – all in 24 hours. From the new all-time high (ATH) to the pump-and-dump local bottom, BTC moved approximately $240 billion in market cap. As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency trades at $98,296, returning to its consolidation range before the action. Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar, one-hour (1H) price chart.

The bulls (long-position traders) were the most affected during the action, losing $416.79 million of BTC in 24 hours. According to data from CoinGlass , the largest single liquidation order was a $18.94 million BTC-USDT-SWAP order on OKX. Moreover, Bitcoin dominated the crypto liquidations by 54.5%, and altcoins held strong during BTC’s 24-hour pump and dump. Nevertheless, a total of 165,955 traders were affected in the leveraged market, losing over $892 million to liquidations. Liquidation Heatmap & Total Liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin price prediction moving forward the volatility As things develop, Finbold has reported different price predictions for Bitcoin, which align for an overall bullish outlook. So, despite the recent pump and dump that suggested weakness above $100,000, analysts are optimistic about what is next. First, an exclusive Finbold report analyzed Bitcoin’s monthly historical price action in December since 2013, forecasting a positive outlook. According to this prediction, BTC will trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024. Looking further, TradingShot identified a chart pattern that could put Bitcoin at $140,000 by February 2025 . Meanwhile, the financial giant Standard Chartered sees BTC trading at $200,000 by the end of 2025 after correctly calling the $100k this year. However, Bitcoin’s volatility can still cause investors to see more “pump and dump” events, such as yesterday’s. On that note, the best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki believes that these BTC crashes offer opportunities for accumulation. Yet, investors and traders should be cautious and avoid losing money to market liquidations, having a solid plan on Bitcoin. Featured image from Shutterstock.

But let’s not get carried away. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen an explosive bull run, and history shows it can come crashing down quickly, too. US President Trump’s vow to establish the country as the global crypto hub and his selection of pro-crypto regulators are key drivers of this surge. Retail traders fuel the frenzy Retail investors, often the first to arrive at market peaks, are back. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 cryptos has more than doubled since Trump’s November 5 election win, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 46% gain in the same period. But even with these jaw-dropping numbers, the index is still only a third of its pandemic-era peak. This is a critical phase in the bull cycle: the latter half, where big returns are possible but risks are magnified. Breadth and leverage are elevated but not overextended. NFTs are also seeing a resurgence. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index jumped 106% in November, its best month since the start of 2022. Even so, the index is far below its record high, proving the fragility of this rebound. South Korea, a hotbed for crypto activity, saw trading volumes on local platforms hit $254 billion in November. For context, this figure surpasses the turnover on the Kospi, the country’s benchmark equity index. It’s bullish all over Trump’s choice for the SEC chair (a known crypto supporter) and the appointment of the first White House crypto czar have made markets bullish all over. Meanwhile, meme stocks like GameStop and AMC are seeing sharp intraday rallies. As we reported , a cryptic social media post from Keith Gill, the infamous “Roaring Kitty” of the 2021 investing craze, added to the frenzy. Bitcoin’s record-breaking week coincided with the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearing 45,000. Investors are pouring into everything from junk bonds to stocks, initially driven by easy monetary conditions. MicroStrategy has become the poster child for this speculative mania. The company’s stock has soared 464% this year, driven by its massive Bitcoin holdings worth around $41 billion. MicroStrategy plans to buy another $40 billion in Bitcoin, funding these purchases through convertible notes that investors can exchange for equity if the stock price rises. This strategy is as risky as it is ambitious. If Bitcoin prices drop, the impact on MicroStrategy’s stock could be catastrophic. The parallels to the meme stock rally of 2021 are unmistakable—everything works until it doesn’t. Signs of froth are everywhere. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett pointed out that the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio is now at 5.3, just shy of the 5.5 peak during the 2000 tech bubble. He warns of an “overshoot” in early 2025 if the S&P 500 climbs another 10% to 6,666 points. Bitcoin’s market cap now exceeds $2 trillion, making it comparable to the world’s 11th-largest economy. But while investors may be partying like it’s 2021, history suggests the music will eventually stop.

Bitcoin Price Today: Here’s Why BTC Crashed Below $100K Bitcoin price crashed 13.53% between December 4 and 5, wiping out an excess of $1.5 billion worth of positions in just 19 hours. On December 5 alone, more than $1 billion worth of longs and short positions got wiped from the cryptocurrency market. BTC Crash, Crypto Liquidations But why did Bitcoin suddenly dip below the historic $100,000 level, and will it recover? Let’s discover! Meitu, dubbed as the chinese MicroStrategy, sold its crypto holdings, which led to the sudden drop in Bitcoin price on December 4. The Chinese selfie application operator sold 940 BTC and 31,000 ETH, realizing nearly $80 million in profits, the company’s Wednesday statement noted.

Value of BTC trades at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, bringing the year-to-date gain from 56% on October 20 to roughly 130% as of December 6. The YTD performance has slumped due to the recent BTC crash. Although many altcoins have shot up over triple digits, Bitcoin is catching up. Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 70%, and is well below BTC. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. Will Bitcoin End 2024 on Positive Note? Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note. Many even expect a six-digit target for BTC by the end of November, and this is due to the historical returns . History shows that Bitcoin has always performed massively in the fourth quarter. Historical Bitcoin Price Performance With that said, if Bitcoin price hits a new ATH in November or December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, could finally hit the $2 trillion mark. Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization While Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago, with Ethereum, the duo controls nearly 65% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Despite the seven-month consolidation, Bitcoin’s $1.93 trillion market cap remains strong, anticipating it reaching $2 trillion before 2025. BTC: A composition of 24-hour Trading Volume Being the top crypto has its benefits; more people tend to flock toward the asset. Likewise, BTC’s 24-hour trading volume stands at No data found for bitcoin on 44 minutes ago. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, contributes a major portion of this volume. Binance’s share of BTC’s 24-hour trading volume comprises spot and perpetuals trading. While spot volume hovers around 11%, perpetual volume is 41%. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, etc, follow Binance. Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin Network Upgrades Since 2009 Here are some key milestone upgrades to the Bitcoin network over the past decade. 2020-2024: Taproot Upgrade (2021): Improved Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality, allowing for more complex transactions and enhanced privacy.Muir Glacier Upgrade (2020): Delayed the “ice age” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring the continued smooth operation of Bitcoin. 2017-2019: Segregated Witness (SegWit) Upgrade (2017): Increased the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed on the network, and improved the overall scalability of Bitcoin. Schnorr/Tapscript Upgrade (proposed): Aims to further improve the efficiency and scalability of Bitcoin transactions, but has not yet been activated. SegWit2x (canceled): A proposed upgrade that aimed to increase the block size limit, but was ultimately canceled due to lack of consensus. 2015-2016: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 Upgrade (2016): Introduced several improvements, including better wallet management and enhanced security features. BIP66 Upgrade (2015): Standardized the way Bitcoin transactions are verified, improving the overall security and reliability of the network. 2013-2014: Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 Upgrade (2014): Introduced a new wallet format and improved the overall performance of the Bitcoin client.

Bitcoin’s dominance over gold hits largest margin in history,https://finbold.com/new-store-of-value-bitcoins-dominance-over-gold-hits-largest-margin-in-history/,"The recent Bitcoin ( BTC ) spike above $100,000 has elevated the asset to outperform gold by the largest margin in history. Specifically, Bitcoin is now valued at 36.78 ounces of gold per BTC, a historic high against the traditional store of value, according to data shared by Barchart on December 6. Bitcoin and gold price performance. Source: Barchart The data indicates that from its early years, Bitcoin’s price trajectory has been marked by volatile but meteoric rises. In contrast, gold’s performance has remained steady and relatively flat over the same period, highlighting its traditional role as a safe-haven asset rather than a high-growth investment . While gold has long been hailed as the ultimate store of value, Bitcoin’s ascent signals a possible paradigm shift in how investors are choosing to preserve wealth. This development lends credence to Bitcoin’s emerging status as ‘digital gold.’ Interestingly, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has highlighted the possibility of Bitcoin outperforming gold, noting that the digital currency is a competitor to gold but not to the dollar. Despite Bitcoin’s rapid growth, the asset significantly trails the precious metal, which boasts a market cap of almost $18 trillion compared to Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion. Skepticism on Bitcoin replacing gold Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility has led some gold advocates to dismiss its potential as a gold replacement. Economist Peter Schiff, for instance, remains a vocal proponent of gold, emphasizing that Bitcoin is destined to crash to zero. In a November 25 X post , Schiff argued that Bitcoin lacks the intrinsic value needed to serve as a store of value. According to the gold enthusiast, Bitcoin’s appeal is purely speculative, driven by Fear of Missing Out ( FOMO ) and faith rather than fundamentals. He claimed Bitcoin’s rising price relies on attracting more buyers and likened investing in it to a risky game where participants must sell before the bubble bursts. You don't store value by holding #Bitcoin . Unlike #gold , Bitcoin has no actual value to store. Holding Bitcoin is a bet that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise, as FOMO ensures that more people will buy and have faith in Bitcoin in the future than have faith in it today. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 25, 2024 Unlike gold, which Schiff champions for its tangible value, Bitcoin, he argues, is a bet on momentum rather than a reliable hedge. Conversely, other figures like author and investor Robert Kiyosaki have dismissed the debate between gold and Bitcoin, emphasizing that both asset classes serve the same purpose. For the celebrity financial educator, both can act as a safeguard, especially during his long-projected historic market crash . Gold and Bitcoin price movement Regarding price movements, Bitcoin and gold have had a stellar year. Gold was on track to target the $3,000 mark , but bullish momentum stalled after the United States presidential election. Regarding gold’s outlook, legendary trader Peter Brandt noted in a December 5 X post that the metal’s price action displays a potential diamond pattern —a rare formation that typically signals indecision and possible trend reversals. Currently, gold is trading near $2,653, with the diamond structure forming between resistance at $2,748.2 and support at $2,629.6. Gold price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt A breakout above or below these levels could dictate the next major move, but the prevalence of similar patterns across assets has made traders hesitant to trust this signal fully. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish sentiment despite experiencing a sharp drop below the $100,000 level. Bitcoin was trading at $98,070 at press time, having corrected by over 4% in the last 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin has the potential to reclaim the $100,000 resistance level, supported by its hold above $95,000. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

On December 5, 2024, Gill posted a cryptic image on X, which appeared to be an altered Time magazine cover from 2006. This mysterious post sent Ripples through the market, sparking a rally in both GameStop and AMC stocks. Gill is no stranger to influencing stock prices—his posts played a major role in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, where the stock skyrocketed over 1,600%, shaking the financial world and crushing hedge funds that had bet against it. GameStop’s Price Surge After Gill’s recent post, GameStop’s stock jumped by 16%, reaching $30.87. It later closed at $28.60, still showing a 6% drop over the past five days. The sharp rise caused a brief trading halt, showing that people still react strongly to Gill’s posts, highlighting the unpredictable nature of meme stocks. AMC Follows Suit The post also pumped the prices of AMC Entertainment, another favorite stock among retail traders, also saw a 12% increase, reaching $5.55. While this is a far cry from AMC’s all-time high of $261 in 2021, it highlights how the meme stock movement continues to resonate in the market. AMC, much like GameStop, became a symbol of retail investors challenging Wall Street hedge funds, and Gill’s involvement continues to drive interest. Memecoin GME Makes Waves In addition to the stocks, an unofficial GameStop Solana-based memecoin (GME) saw a remarkable rise of 72% following Gill’s post, briefly reaching $0.007672. Though it later pulled back to $0.006488, the coin’s price movement highlights the connection between Gill’s online presence and the memecoin market, which thrives on speculative trading. Roaring Kitty’s Return After a quiet period following the GameStop rally in 2021, Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) returned to social media in May 2024, sparking renewed interest in meme stocks and crypto. His posts in September and December have shown that his influence is still strong, causing big price movements. However, his impact has also attracted legal attention. In June 2024, a GameStop investor sued him for stock manipulation, but the case was dismissed, highlighting the legal scrutiny surrounding Gill’s influence on the market. Impact of Speculative Trading Crypto analyst Evan noticed that GameStop’s stock jumped 5% right after Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill) posted on X. He joked about how this shows the market doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to since a single post can move stock prices, which goes against the idea that prices should always reflect all available info.

Eric Trump, Donald Trump’s second eldest son , shared a post on X that included a screen grab of the latter’s post on Truth Social. According to the younger Trump, his father, the 45th president of the United States, was ecstatic about the development and claimed credit for it. He then ended it with a typical Make America Great Again Rhetoric. Image Source: X Bitcoin’s Latest Price Action The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization went above $104k in the trading session earlier yesterday but has since dropped below $100k once again. However, one of the biggest and most storeyed price resistances in digital currency history has been subdued, and commentators took a moment to celebrate this occasion. Some called it a watershed moment in the history of the digital currency revolution, while others called it a launchpad for further price action going into 2025. Did Trump Cause Bitcoin to Go Above $100k? Donald Trump loves to take credit for positive developments from around the world. Bitcoin did benefit from Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, but to say that he is the sole reason or even the biggest one behind the $100k move is highly inaccurate. Trump famously opposed Bitcoin during his 2016-2020 presidency and once compared the premier digital currency to a scam in a 2018 presidential address. He also stated his desire to ban the cryptocurrency in America. However, Bitcoin paid no heed to his threats and continued to grow strongly over time. It was only in 2022 that Trump changed his original position and started courting crypto users and their votes. By then, the blockchain economy had grown to become a huge industry with tens of millions of users in the US. They readily started to support Trump, as the alternative was the Democrats, who wanted to censure the trillion-dollar decentralized economy even further. Trump was one of many factors that helped Bitcoin go above $100k, but the real challenge will be upon him soon. So far, all of his rhetoric has been talking and political point-scoring. It remains to be seen whether he will walk the walk on the matter once he takes oath as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-06 11:42:07

An analyst assessing the state of Bitcoin and XRP has warned of a potential bloodbath in XRP as Bitcoin dominance increases. Pav Hundal, chief analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx, noted that if Bitcoin dominance continues to grow, XRP could fall and the majority of long positions in XRP could be liquidated. “The real danger for XRP bulls, who are currently heavily leveraged, is a return to Bitcoin dominance. A rotation from XRP to Bitcoin would likely lead to a long liquidation bloodbath.” Stating that investors' expectations for an increase have increased after the incredible rise in XRP, the analyst said that investors are open to long positions even as the XRP price falls. At this point, citing CoinGlass data, the analyst noted that XRP's open interest (OI) reached $ 3.44 billion on December 5, pointing out that this figure is much higher than the $ 2 billion recorded during the price increase in April 2021. Finally, the analyst added that he predicts that spot volumes and prices for XRP and altcoins could increase again once Bitcoin stabilizes and its dominance declines. *This is not investment advice.

And one has added its own twist by also adding Ripple’s native coin XRP to its balance sheet. Worksport To Incorporate BTC And XRP Into Its Corporate Treasury Worksport, a New York-based company that trades on the Nasdaq and sells pickup truck covers, announced Thursday that it was investing up to 10% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin and XRP. This is equivalent to $5 million. The decision to buy up these two cryptocurrencies is intended to safeguard Worksport’s assets against inflation and to boost transaction efficiency. Worksport CEO Steven Rossi described Bitcoin and XRP as “increasingly reliable stores of value” due to their “inflation-resistant” properties. Apart from adding BTC and XRP to its corporate treasury, the company said it would also accept crypto for payments on its e-commerce platform. Worksport expects a 37% reduction in transaction costs with cryptocurrency payments. $WKSP Worksport To Adopt Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and XRP for Corporate Treasury.

(@WorksportLtd) December 5, 2024 “By strategically allocating a portion of our treasury to these digital assets and accepting crypto payments, we’re enhancing our financial strategy and aligning ourselves with the future of global finance,” Rossi noted. Why XRP? Worksport joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that have taken the plunge and used excess cash reserves to purchase digital assets this year. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy was the first public company to put BTC on its balance sheet back in 2020, in an effort to accrue the best returns for shareholders instead of holding excess cash. The software firm now holds a staggering 402,100 BTC , worth around $39 billion at the coin’s current market price. However, it’s extremely rare for firms to opt for altcoins such as XRP. Rossi, who has personally invested in XRP, shared his belief in the industry’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap during an interview. “XRP has been doing quite well recently, and it reaffirmed that these are early assets that really challenge central banking,” he posited. While XRP has registered some extreme volatility, the Worksport boss believes it’s stabilizing and will bring long-term value. Besides the spectacular price rally, the fact that there’s also a handful of spot XRP exchange-traded fund applications on the SEC’s desk might also make the digital asset more appealing for corporate adoption.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-06 11:54:15

The event may add to the market volatility, with the distinct possibility of a new direction after the contracts expire. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are preparing for more volatility ahead of the weekly options expiry. The December contracts are already setting the pace for prices at the end of 2024. The expiry arrives at a time when the BTC spot price is volatile in the short term, even though it is showing a recovery trend. BTC rallied again to $98,237.17, while still trading at the ‘greed’ sentiment level. As of December 6, BTC had a weekly options expiry of 23K contracts, with a notional value of $2.3B and maximum pain at $97,000. The put/call ratio of 1.1 suggested a relative balance between long and short positions. ETH options accrued just $570K for the week but with a put/call ratio of 0.62. The ratio suggests a stronger bullish attitude for ETH, as the price approaches $4,000. Even without other factors, trading ahead of weekends and options expiry boosts volatility in the short term. For BTC, options expiry also precedes bigger price rallies. The November expiry of $13.6B in options preceded the recent rally to $104,000. What caused the BTC flash crash to $93,000? The BTC rally ground to a halt as it endured a worrying flash crash to $93,000. The options expiry event may have added to the volatility. The flash crash liquidated up to $450M in leveraged positions. The event continued on Friday, with a total of $1B liquidations of exposed positions. Other explanations include rapid liquidation, as well as normalizing the BTC levels to available liquidity. The selling may be due to relatively large put option positions, which would be liquidated at a lower price range. BTC recovered above $97,000, but may still face price pressures from long positions at a lower price range. One liquidation target holds more than $84M in leveraged positions at $95,322, as well as $73.52M in leveraged positions at $94,011. The recent volatile price moves may not reflect long-term opportunities, but they are still leading to re-estimations on whether BTC can go higher, or if it has already achieved its cycle peak. Options trading also gives an outlook on expected performance. The biggest liquidity of call options can be seen at $100,000, followed by a buildup at the $110,000 and $120,000 levels. Those options point to cautious trading for year-end levels. The most actively traded options expiring on December 27 point to $110,000 as a possible scenario for BTC. | Source: Deribit BTC price moves in December may be swayed even more by the options set to expire on the 27th. One of the biggest contracts with $229M in notional value is a call option at $110,000. For more cautious traders, the $96,000 and $120,000 call options have almost similar volumes, exploring both the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. Will ETH finally show its bullish side? The bullish options ratio for ETH suggests an expectation for a breakout above $4,000. The $3,600 resistance level has turned into support in the past few days. ETH traders may also attack the accrued short positions, all of which are above the current price. The liquidation heatmap points to $877M in attackable positions. ETH benefitted from highly active ETF inflows reaching an all-time peak. In the past day, ETF inflows expanded to $428.44M, surpassing the last few months of inflows. For now, ETH still lags behind BTC in activity and leveraged liquidity. However, the slowdown of the BTC rally may lead to a rollover into ETH in expectation of a breakout. ETH traded at a spot price of $3,869.86, with trading volumes close to the higher range for the past month. ETH’s performance is also tied to the expectations of an altcoin season, which also involves multiple tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem.

So, that's the bitcoin market right now. The bulls pushed prices above $103,000 early Thursday, only for the bears to bite back, crashing prices to $91,000. As it stands, we’re trading steadily around $98,000. Talk about undecided ... The crash shook out leveraged crypto futures bets worth around $1 billion, bringing a degree of normality to what had become an overheated market. That's possibly a blessing in disguise, because had BTC surged all the way up to $120,000, the eventual leverage shakeout would have been even more severe and could have potentially damaged investor confidence. The glass-half-full perspective is supported by bitcoin spot ETFs, which managed to pull in a net $766 million despite the chaos. But there's a glass-half-empty side too. The ProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF, which tracks twice the inverse of bitcoin’s daily performance, also saw a net inflow as well as record trading volume. While the $7 million added is small compared with the long spot ETFs, it shows the bears are ready to make their presence felt. If it all feels a little shaky, there's more to come, with the chance of downside volatility if U.S. nonfarm payrolls data points to a resilient labour market and sticky wage pressures. That would prompt a recalibration of Fed rate-cut expectations and possibly hurt crypto prices. Weak data, conversely, could yield a price bounce, although trading directionally might be tricky while prices are this indecisive. In other news, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of David Sacks as Crypto and AI Czar (which might seem like the opposite of crypto’s decentralization ethos) is being viewed positively for Solana’s ETF prospects. Why? Because at one point, Sacks was associated with the crypto hedge fund Multicoin, one of Solana's early investors. It seems farfetched, but hey it's a typical bull-market narrative. Looking at the broader market, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is quickly approaching the $4.6 billion market value of Arbitrum's ARB token in a move that indicates application-specific layer 2s like Hyperliquid are becoming the ""real value capture mechanisms for DeFi applications,"" according to Gautham Santosh, founder of Polynomial Protocol. Gautham noted on X that building on general-purpose layer 2s could mean constructing someone else's moat, essentially translating your success into their token value. He points out that while Arbitrum-based perpetual protocol GMX generates 54% more revenue than Hyperliquid, its market cap stands at just $376 million or just 8% of Hyperliquid's. That's a lot to take in for today. So, as trader Alex Kruger said on X, ""If you're not a full-time trader, focus on portfolio construction."" Stay alert out there!

It becomes the second-largest cat-themed token behind Solana-based popcat (POPCAT) The memecoin is known for its distinctive branding around the meme of a cat laughing with tears (often represented by the ""joycat"" emoji 😹) and sporting Pit Viper sunglasses. This token doesn't boast any intrinsic utility, thriving instead on its community-driven ethos and the virality of meme culture within the cryptocurrency space. Meme coins often rely on community hype, and MOG has successfully captured a zeitgeist with its humorous and culturally resonant branding driving demand. Its cult community often appears to 'mog' other token communities (a slang term for outperforming) on social posts or in replies on X — and that has become a meme itself, further fueling the token’s popularity. Derivatives Positioning BTC and ETH perpetual funding rates have normalized from previously overheated levels, with the ETH rate remaining elevated compared with BTC, suggesting a bullish bias for the ETH/BTC ratio. The positioning in SOL perpetuals is even more bullish. The open interest-normalized cumulative volume delta has declined for most major tokens in the past 24 hours, indicating that the sell-off primarily resulted from the unwinding of long positions rather than fresh shorts. Despite BTC's quick retrace to sub-$100K levels, calls continue to trade at a premium to puts, although the spread is narrower than it was early Thursday. A similar dynamic is observed in ETH options. A large bull call spread crossed the tape on Deribit, involving a long position in the $106,000 strike call and shorting the $110,000 strike call, both expiring on Dec. 27, according to data source Amberdata.

However, the path forward is not without challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation , set to take effect on December 30, will introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework, potentially outpacing the US in offering clarity to crypto businesses. To maintain its leadership, the US must seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that strikes a delicate balance: one that fosters innovation while safeguarding consumers and investors. This will require moving beyond the reactive, enforcement-first strategies of the past and embracing a more proactive, principles-based approach. The turning point Since 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has largely relied on enforcement actions to address perceived regulatory gaps in the crypto industry. This approach, while well-intentioned, has contributed to significant uncertainty. In 2023 alone, the SEC initiated 46 enforcement actions—a 53% increase from the previous year—further highlighting the inadequacy of applying legacy financial regulations to this rapidly evolving space. Recent proposals, such as granting the Federal Reserve authority over stablecoin issuers as ‘depository institutions,’ demonstrate the tension between traditional regulatory frameworks and crypto’s unique characteristics. Stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) thrive on their flexibility and global reach, attributes that don’t neatly align with the requirements of traditional banking regulations. Fortunately, the outcome of the recent elections suggests a shift in public sentiment. Voters are signalling a preference for regulatory clarity and more constructive dialogue between lawmakers and the crypto industry. Momentum for change One of the most notable shifts occurred in Ohio, where incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, known for his critical stance on crypto, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Backed by industry heavyweights like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz, Moreno’s campaign underscored the growing influence of the crypto sector in shaping political outcomes. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure coming to an end in January, new leadership at the agency—potentially someone like Dan Gallagher , an advocate for balanced regulation—offers some hope for a fresh approach. Gallagher’s experience and pragmatic stance could help bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Gallagher’s experience and pragmatic stance could help bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, remarked that this is America’s most pro-crypto Congress ever. This optimism is justified, as Congress appears poised to revisit critical legislation like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act ( DCCPA ). If passed, this bill could grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a more prominent role in overseeing digital asset markets, reducing the SEC’s outsized influence and providing much-needed regulatory clarity. Balancing innovation and regulation While the promise of pro-crypto legislation is encouraging, lawmakers must tread carefully to avoid the pitfalls of overregulation. For example, the EU’s MiCA framework has drawn criticism for its “ systemic risks ” and the potential to stifle innovation by imposing stringent requirements on certain crypto assets and markets. Similarly, recent moves by French regulators to clamp down on prediction markets, such as Polymarket, underscore the risks of applying outdated regulatory models to innovative technologies. Such actions, while aimed at investor protection, may inadvertently hamper market growth and limit consumer choice. The goal for the US should be a regulatory regime that promotes innovation, encourages competition, and facilitates market access for startups and larger institutions. By fostering an environment of trust and transparency, lawmakers can protect consumers without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the crypto industry forward. A bright but uncertain future With a historic pro-crypto mandate, the US is at a pivotal moment. The opportunity to reclaim its position as a global leader in financial innovation is within reach, but the path ahead remains to be determined. Success will depend on the willingness of lawmakers and regulators to embrace collaboration, prioritize clarity, and foster an ecosystem that balances innovation with robust consumer protections. As this new chapter unfolds, one thing is clear: the future of crypto in America holds immense potential. Whether that potential is realized will depend on the actions taken in the months and years to come.

However, some cryptocurrencies are showing indications that they are perhaps reaching a top. Is this the case for Sui ($SUI), Aptos ($APT) and Near Protocol ($NEAR)? $SUI reaches its cup and handle measured move Source: TradingView The $SUI price has been on the up for some time now. Breaking out of a cup and handle formation earlier in November, the price has since reached its measured move at $4.15. After surpassing this level, the price has been quickly sold back down, leaving a couple of small candle wicks behind. It remains to be seen whether this will now become support, or whether the price might come back down - perhaps all the way to retest the 1.618 at $3.25. If there is continuation of the upside move, and in all probability there probably is room for this, the 2.618 Fibonacci is a target above at $5. Major resistance approaching for $APT Source: TradingView On the weekly chart for $APT, it can be seen that the price is rising towards $16 after hopefully being able to hold above the 0.618 Fibonacci at $13.58. Given that there is a descending trendline that is coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci, there is likely to be a lot of resistance at this level. $NEAR needs to get above its next price step Source: TradingView The $NEAR price has broken out of the long-time descending trendline that began in early 2022. In the weekly chart above, it can be noted that some nice price structure has been built. Two price steps now exist at $5.65 and $8.53. It’s this next step at $8.53 that $NEAR bulls need to lift the price above. This could then act as support for the rest of the bull market. However, the Stochastic RSI has reached its top on the weekly time frame, and therefore upward price momentum could start to dissipate, and a rejection at the 0.382 Fibonacci could be the upshot. The weekly RSI is at the top for not just the three cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, but also for most other cryptocurrencies. This is something to bear in mind, and there is likely to be a correction coming at some point. Stay alert. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The buying pressure that elevated the levels beyond $100K appears to have turned into a selling pressure. Therefore, after a tough fight, the bears successfully dragged the levels below $98,000. The buying volume does not appear to have substantiated the selling pressure and as a result, the BTC price may go lower and test the pivotal support shortly. The BTC price was expected to undergo a retracement after rising above the much-awaited milestone of $100K. As almost all the BTCs were in profits, the probability of a spot price reversal was much less. Meanwhile, the data from Coinglass shows that the traders had leveraged huge long positions across $100K to $103K, which have been liquidated. As a result, the price has faced a significant pullback. More than $400 million in longs were liquidated, which is said to be one of the largest liquidations in the past few months. With this, the leverage seems to have whipped out to a large extent, paving the way for a healthy upswing. Currently, the price remains above the crucial demand zone, just below $97,000 and as long as the token remains within the range, the possibility of marching towards upper resistance remains high. Mainly because a massive amount of BTCs were bought around this range. As per the data shared by an analyst, ALI , more than 1.42 million BTCs were bought by 1.45 million addresses around the range of $95,043 and $97,899. Hence, these can be considered as one of the strongest support levels at present and as long as bulls defend them, the probability of a rebound continues to hover over the BTC price rally. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to remain within a bullish range regardless of the bears offering strong upward pressure, trying to send the levels lower.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-06 12:12:32

According to a recent statement from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the agency has created an internal task force to oversee crypto ATM operators and crack down on those who fail to comply with local mandates. Australia has witnessed an uptick in cryptocurrency-related crimes, with bad actors exploiting the anonymity and rapid transaction capabilities of digital assets. These crimes range from money laundering and fraud to the use of money mules in facilitating illicit activities, according to intelligence data cited by AUSTRAC. Notably, criminals often misuse crypto ATMs, which AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas described as “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate instant and irreversible transfers. Such activities are expected to increase as crypto adoption grows, Thomas noted, stating: We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, and we’ve heard of some victims losing their life savings, which is just heartbreaking. As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation. To minimize these risks, over the next year, the task force will work to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. This includes verifying that operators are registered with AUSTRAC, conducting thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and reporting large cash deposits or withdrawals exceeding AUD 10,000 (approximately $6400). Failure to comply with these requirements would lead to “significant financial penalties,” Thomas continued, emphasizing that “AUSTRAC won’t hesitate in taking action.” “This is the first step in AUSTRAC’s focus to reduce the criminal use of cryptocurrency in Australia,” he added. Australia currently ranks third globally in the number of crypto ATMs, with data from Coin ATM Radar indicating a total of 1,308 machines, with Sydney and Melbourne hosting the highest numbers. However, the agency claims that only a small fraction of these machines are operated by registered operators. Australia is keeping the crypto sector in check Australia remains cautious of the crypto sector and has time and again issued warnings about the various risks involved with this rapidly expanding asset class. Earlier this year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) warned about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies ahead of the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). ASIC has also been going after crypto companies, which it believes have been offering unregistered securities. Meanwhile, in its 2024 risk assessment report, AUSTRAC flagged cryptocurrencies as a “high-risk” tool that could promote money laundering activities. Australia’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies comes as the nation has witnessed a surge in crypto crimes . An August report from the Australian Federal Police found that locals lost over AUD$180 million to crypto investment scams in just 12 months. During the same month, ASIC took down over 600 websites that were allegedly promoting crypto-related scams.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 12:22:00

This could be a pivotal moment for the NFT brand which has been lately struggling due to the slowdown in the NFT market. As a result, the popular NFT brand is looking to expand its footprint in the fun games and meme coin market and revive its prospects. PENGU Token Will Have A Total of 88 Billion Tokens Supply According to an official post on X, PENGU will debut on the Solana network with a total supply of 88,888,888,888 tokens. The goal is to provide fans and newcomers a chance to connect with the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. However, users must note that the Pudgy Penguins NFTs will continue to operate on the Ethereum blockchain network. To incentivize community participation, Pudgy Penguins ensures a fair and equitable distribution of the tokens. Approximately 23.5% of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be allocated to holders of the project’s NFT collections, including Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, and Pudgy Rods. Additionally, 22.02% will be distributed to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% is designated for providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. In an official statement, the Pudgy Penguin team noted: “With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle”. How Can the Pudgy Tokens Succeed The launch of the PENGU token could be a pivotal moment for the Pudy Penguin ecosystem including the future of NFTs, blockchain games and meme coins. Despite the NFT market downturn, the platform stands out for its ability to attract public interest. Below are the three major advantages of launching PENGU on the Solana blockchain. Expanding ecosystem : Solana’s rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem, known for its scalability and increasing adoption in the DeFi sector, makes it a popular choice for token creation. Community-driven approach : By allocating a significant portion of tokens to Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token holders, the project seeks to deepen connections with its dedicated fanbase while attracting new participants. Cultural significance : Pudgy Penguins, as an established and recognizable brand, is well-positioned to promote Pengu beyond the crypto space, leveraging its broader appeal. Earlier this year in August, NFT marketplace Magic Eden also took a similar route by launching its own ME tokens as a measure to expand its crypto offerings. Launched on the Solana blockchain, this token also facilitates cross-chain trading. Magic Eden said that it would integrate the ME tokens with third-party protocols and dApps.
