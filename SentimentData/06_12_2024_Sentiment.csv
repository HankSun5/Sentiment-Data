($GME) shares experienced a massive boost on Thursday after a cryptic post by Keith Gill, the influential figure behind the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy. The post immediately reignited investor interest, causing GameStop’s shares to spike and the Roaring Kitty meme to pump. Roaring Kitty’s Cryptic Post Sends $GME Stock Soaring 15% – What’s His Next Move? Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” has once again stirred up the markets with a cryptic post on social media platform X . Gill, a key figure in GameStop’s 2021 retail trading frenzy, shared an image of a Time magazine cover featuring a computer with an old video player. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Known online as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and “DeepF***ingValue” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, Gill posted an image of a Time magazine cover with a computer screen on the social media platform X. The post triggered a 15% spike in GameStop’s stock price, leading to trading halts on platforms like Robinhood due to heightened volatility. The ripple effect extended to the digital asset market, where a GameStop-inspired meme coin on the Solana blockchain skyrocketed by 65%. Gill, a former financial adviser from Massachusetts, initially gained fame in 2021 by championing GameStop as a retail investor opportunity. This sparked a retail trading frenzy that sent the stock soaring over 10,000% at its peak. Roaring Kitty Returns: Keith Gill Sparks Market Chaos After Three-Year Silence Gill’s recent social media activity comes after a three-year hiatus, during which his followers eagerly awaited his return. Many see him as a symbol of retail investors’ triumph over Wall Street, likening him to a modern David against Goliath. The GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, sparked by Gill’s bullish posts, extended to other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment. The collective effort by Reddit users to squeeze hedge funds resulted in billions of dollars in losses for institutional investors and drew the attention of regulators. The dramatic events of the Reddit rally were later dramatized in Craig Gillespie’s 2023 film Dumb Money. The 2021 rally also raised questions about market fairness, particularly after trading restrictions were imposed on retail investors. These measures drew allegations of manipulation, as hedge funds held large short positions in GameStop during the peak of the trading frenzy. By Thursday afternoon, trading activity around GameStop had intensified, with about 300,000 options contracts changing hands—approximately 1.5 times the usual trading volume, according to a Reuters report . The stock’s 30-day implied volatility, a measure of expected short-term price movements, also jumped to 132%, marking a three-week high. Among the most popular trades were contracts betting that GameStop’s stock price would exceed $30 by the end of the week, with 32,000 such options traded by late afternoon. A Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, Chewy (CHWY), surged nearly 28% after the return of Roaring Kitty , famous for the GameStop short squeeze. Gill posted a cryptic image on X on September 6 , sparking speculation among traders. The post featured a Toy Story meme with the Chewy logo, which some interpreted as a signal that Gill might be stepping back from his role at Chewy. Despite no technical utility, meme coins like CHWY thrive on social sentiment, making Gill’s posts influential for traders.

On Dec. 5, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100,000 barrier, just weeks after surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12, as reported by TradingView. Shortly after, Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $104,000 at 3:08 a.m. UTC, roughly 90 minutes after breaking the $100,000 threshold. The surge was fueled by over $31 billion in net inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tightened supply due to Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April. Donald Trump’s Victory Boosts Bitcoin Rally Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, alongside speculation of a strategic Bitcoin national reserve and increased corporate adoption led by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Additionally, Trump’s Dec. 4 nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair has sparked optimism. This move could eliminate regulatory barriers that have hindered the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Trump’s pro-crypto cabinet includes Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as nominees for Secretary of Treasury and Commerce, respectively, potentially creating the most crypto-friendly administration to date. Bitcoin Up 126% in 2024 Bitcoin’s value has increased by 126% since Jan. 1, when it traded at $44,000. Its market capitalization has now reached a record $2 trillion for the first time. While Bitcoin’s 2024 rally is impressive, it isn’t its most dramatic. In 2017, Bitcoin soared 1,900%, rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. Similarly, between March 2020 and November 2021, it surged 1,250%, climbing from $5,100 to $69,000.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 22:55:00

Yesterday, Coinbase announced the listing of Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin. “Moo Deng (MOODENG) is now live on http://coinbase.com & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” Moo Deng is the name of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand, this past summer. The hippo has become an internet sensation, inspiring memes and memecoins alike. Moo Deng means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Our favorite bouncy pork a.k.a Moo Deng ?? #moodeng @KhaokheowZoo @MooDengSOL pic.twitter.com/5cJl9oJD82 — Moo Deng (@moodengx) December 1, 2024 In November, Moo Deng went viral again by correctly “ predicting ” the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Despite Moo Deng’s internet fame, MOODENG has faltered in the hours following the Coinbase listing. Approximately 24 hours following the memecoin’s addition to Coinbase, MOODENG is down 12.4%. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto markets are largely surging following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) historic breakthrough of $100,000. In stark contrast with MOODENG’s struggles, another Solana-based memecoin ripped after Coinbase added support on Wednesday. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, pumped up 51% after the top US crypto exchange listed the memecoin.

Ceffu is an institutional partner of Binance, and this arrangement will support the EOS mainnet. The partnership will be critical in unlocking the new CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders while providing institutional-grade custodian services. Ceffu’s advanced custody infrastructure guarantees the institution’s safety on its EOS assets. Relying on multi-party computation and customized approval schemes highlights how seriously the firm has taken security matters. The arrangement will allow institutional fund handlers to use CeDeFi strategies that grasp the best of CEX and DeFi ecosystems. Through Binance liquidity and robust trading styles, EOS token holders can access the innovative yield solution tailored to institutional needs. With this partnership, though, there is a growing focus on institutional solutions. EOS seems to alienate retail holders and small-scale entities, so this partnership may bring very few benefits to small-scale blockchain users. EOS remains one of the top blockchain platforms With EOS featured on the Coinbase COIN50 index , its popularity and interest are growing among institutions. This recognition shows that EOS is among the leading blockchain platforms and an integral player in the crypto ecosystem. According to Yves La Rose, Founder & CEO of EOS Network Foundation, Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. He added that by partnering with Ceffu, they are creating new pathways for institutions to participate securely in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities. The EOS network is significant in this partnership. The third-generation blockchain that operates on the EOS virtual machine is set for high-speed and low-cost transactions. The design supports seamless Web3 for all players, developers, and users alike. Even though the partnership looks good, Ceffu’s ties with Binance might be a regulatory risk. Binance is sustainedly scrutinized in several jurisdictions. High innovations with strategic tokenomics build the EOS ecosystem Due to approved community tokenomics, EOS has seen regular growth, enhanced by performance improvements. One of its new tokenomics strategies is committing a funding portfolio for middleware with the executed Unicove doorway beaming the new entrance process and enhancing user experience. Also, a staking rewards plan distributes $450 worth of EOS. The plan, which has been in motion for more than five months, has led to more people taking EOS while extending the token lock-up time to almost one month. These simple yet strategic tokenomics are the cornerstone that strengthens the EOS ecosystem. They show how versatile, robust, and appealing the system is. Most EOS token holders see the partnership between EOS and Ceffu as a step in the right direction. It would guarantee the security of assets across various networks.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 23:29:00

Bitcoin Argentina, one of the nation’s top pro-crypto pressure groups, made its claims in an official statement published on December 4. The NGO claimed that the National Securities Commission (CNV)’s move to force all crypto exchanges in the company to register and share client data runs counter to the policies of the “libertarian” President Javier Milei. Crypto Exchange Regulations Hurt Argentina’s Cause, NGO Claims Earlier this year, the CNV began policing exchanges for the first time, requiring them to adhere to the kind of regulations now commonplace in Western Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea. However, Bitcoin Argentina said that the CNV’s new registry system is bringing “distortions and inefficiencies” to the crypto sector. President Javier Milei’s approval rating recovered last month as the economy showed signs of recovery and inflation cooled to its lowest point in nearly three years. https://t.co/H5y3uO7JyP — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 4, 2024 The NGO said the regulator should scrap its policies and “limit its scope” to fighting “money laundering.” The CNV has committed itself to creating the registry, with all “digital asset service providers (PSAVs)” obliged to apply for operating permits. However, the NGO claims that the regulator is trying to fix non-existent issues “in a sector that currently operates without problems.” La Nina could thwart Argentina's run at bumper crops https://t.co/sqW2JQQhLa pic.twitter.com/yENcfcXaTE — Reuters (@Reuters) December 5, 2024 “The current system is not a far-off, uncertain, or new market. It is not a sector in crisis or emergency. It is an existing one. And it works well. While the new rules will benefit some players in the ecosystem, they will stifle the growth of others. And it will do nothing to prevent the emergence of future scams.” Bitcoin Argentina And Bitcoin Argentina went a step further, claiming that the rules also “pose a risk for the CNV itself” and for crypto traders in the country. The NGO explained that this was due to the fact that it fails to “provide greater security tools” and “will even create a false sense of security and supervision.” Essentially granting firms the CNV “seal of approval” in “a market that is eminently risky, asymmetric, global, and unmanageable” would be a major risk, it said. “Argentina has a unique opportunity to commit to deregulation and maintain the freedom that has yielded such good results so far. We could model that for the rest of the world.” Ricardo Mihura, Bitcoin Argentina President ‘A Burden for Smaller Businesses’ The NGO’s President Ricardo Mihura said he “cannot understand how the CNV” had chosen to “deviate from the government’s deregulatory approach and propose an inefficient regulatory burden.” The NGO also warned of “immediate consequences” for “small businesses and self-employed workers,” who would be “forced out of the sector or dragged into illegality.” “Regulatory costs” could also cripple “new” Argentinian crypto projects in the future, Mihura noted.

Desde BitcoinAr se presentó esta semana una posición formal respecto del proyecto de regulación del Registro de Proveedores de Servicios de Activos Virtuales… pic.twitter.com/iy6rHal6lc — ONG Bitcoin Argentina (@BitcoinAR) December 4, 2024 And Rodrigo Andragnes, the NGRO’s founder claimed that the CNV should “take the necessary technical time to analyze whether regulating PSAVs really adds value to the community.” Crypto adoption has rocketed in Argentina in recent years, with stablecoin and Bitcoin buying on the rise. IMF Role? Most think the CNV’s crypto exchange regulations were intended as a gesture of good faith to the Intentional Monetary Fund, which has previously expressed concerns about the nation’s lack of crypto regulation.

And the CNV has also held several BTC adoption-themed meetings with its counterparts in El Salvador. It has also hinted at its softening stance on crypto by attending local crypto summits .

What Next For Bitcoin Price Following Rally To $100,000 In a recent TradingView post, Xanrox suggested that the Bitcoin price will unlikely enjoy a sustained rally for now. He explained that this is unlikely because a sustained rally could easily put Bitcoin at $600,000 by December 2025, which is impossible. As such, he believes that BTC would need to slow down.

Xanrox remarked that the market needs to see a shakeout and a flash crash first before anything else. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $85,000 when this correction finally happens. Xanrox stated that the $85,000 level is a very reasonable support because it is the end of the massive FVG (fair value gap) on the daily candles. He added that this target is also the start of the first price action on the volume profile. The crypto analyst revealed that this is the level at which he is looking to buy Bitcoin. The crypto analyst indicated that this Bitcoin price rally to $100,000 is a bull trap, as he highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. He said this looks like a bull trap for retail traders because everyone would buy the breakout. As such, he envisages that Bitcoin would make a last push to sweep liquidity. A Major Correction Might Not Come Anytime Soon On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered a diverging opinion, suggesting that a major correction might not come anytime soon for the Bitcoin price. In his recent X post, he alluded to a previous post in which he stated that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally If this pattern holds true, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price won’t suffer its first major correction of between 15% to 30% until its hits $135,000 or even $159,000. Meanwhile, the accompanying chart put the market top for Bitcoin at $240,000, indicating that it will still have more room to move the upside even after this correction. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,800, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Monero (XMR) just hit a two-year high of $211, fuelled by growing interest in privacy coins. At the same time, Immutable X (IMX) has taken the Web3 gaming world by storm with its $1 million player rewards initiative alongside Yield Guild Games (YGG). But the crown jewel of short-term crypto plays might just be Qubetics ($TICS) . Its presale is smashing records, with $4.4 million already raised and projections of insane ROI that have investors buzzing. What makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the innovation. The project’s Multi-Chain Wallet aims to solve real-world headaches for users, from freelancers needing quick cross-border payments to businesses managing assets across multiple blockchains. This is more than hype—it’s crypto stepping up to meet the demands of the modern world. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Revolutionises Asset Management Qubetics is taking the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 11th stage of its presale, it has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising a whopping $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, this is an opportunity that screams potential. But you’ll need to act fast—the price is set to climb by 10% this weekend when the 12th stage begins. The standout feature of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet , a tool that’s set to revolutionise how we manage digital assets. Imagine being a freelancer working with clients in different countries, each paying you in a different cryptocurrency. Normally, you’d spend hours juggling wallets and calculating conversion fees. Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies all of this, consolidating your assets in one secure place and automating conversions at competitive rates. Click here to learn more about how Qubetics makes cross-border payments as easy as a walk in the park with its multi-chain wallet. For businesses, the potential is just as massive. Picture an e-commerce store accepting payments in multiple cryptos or a logistics company managing supply chain payments across different blockchains. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates the hassle, offering a seamless experience that saves time and money. And then there are the numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, a staggering 783% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS is expected to climb to $1, delivering 3,434% returns. If it reaches $15 after its mainnet launch, you’re looking at an unbelievable 52,912% ROI. Let’s break it down. A $12,500 investment at today’s price of $0.0282 could grow to $111,066 by the presale’s end. If $TICS hits $1, your $12.5K turns into $442,335. And if it rockets to $15? You’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $6.63 million. That’s not just a win; it’s a game-changer . Monero (XMR): Privacy Coins Make a Comeback Monero is back in the spotlight, hitting a two-year high of $211 before settling at $205.05. Privacy coins as a category have surged over 12% in just 24 hours, with Monero leading the charge. What’s behind the buzz? A landmark U.S. court ruling on Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts has reignited interest in privacy-centric cryptos. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to shield transaction details, offering a level of anonymity akin to physical cash. For advocates, this isn’t just a feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is increasingly under threat. Critics, of course, argue that privacy coins are magnets for illicit activity, but Monero has held its ground, even as regulatory scrutiny ramps up. The surge in Monero’s price also reflects broader market interest in privacy coins, with other tokens like Haven, Verge, and Zcash posting impressive weekly gains. As the debate over financial privacy heats up, Monero’s resilience makes it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for those betting on continued market momentum. Immutable X (IMX): Redefining Web3 Gaming Immutable X is making waves in the gaming industry, partnering with Yield Guild Games (YGG) to allocate $1 million towards player rewards. This isn’t just a feel-good initiative; it’s a strategic move to dominate the Web3 gaming landscape. The partnership aims to create new earning opportunities for players and developers while expanding the ecosystem with Immutable’s cutting-edge Passport wallet and zkEVM scaling solution. Why does this matter for short-term investors? The gaming industry is massive, and Immutable X is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 developers. Its sponsorship of YGG’s Play Summit and the GAM3 Awards in Manila underscores its commitment to fostering a community-driven gaming experience. As the hype around Web3 gaming grows, so does the potential for IMX to see significant price appreciation. IMX isn’t just about gaming; it’s about creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a gamer earning rewards or a developer building the next hit game, Immutable X offers a platform that’s both scalable and user-friendly. For short-term investors, the buzz around IMX and its increasing adoption in the gaming sector make it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term . As more developers and players flock to its platform, the likelihood of a price spike grows, making now the perfect time to get in on the action. The Final Word: Top Short-Term Crypto Picks for 2024 When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , Qubetics, Monero, and Immutable X stand out for their unique strengths and growth potential. Qubetics offers unparalleled ROI projections and game-changing tools like the Multi-Chain Wallet. Monero is riding the wave of renewed interest in privacy coins, while Immutable X is set to redefine gaming with its innovative approach to Web3. The clock’s ticking, though. The Qubetics presale price won’t stay this low for long, and the momentum behind Monero and IMX could lead to quick price spikes. Don’t sit this one out—take action now and position yourself for short-term gains that could make a lasting impact.

This bullish trajectory signals a seismic shift in its journey from niche digital currency to a global financial asset. During an interview, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offered insights into the asset’s historic rally and implications. He weighed in on regulatory shifts and leadership changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Surge to $103,900: What’s Driving It? Bitcoin crossed $103,900 for the first time, fueled by strong institutional interest and regulatory changes. Tenev highlighted how Bitcoin’s perception has shifted from being dismissed to being taken seriously. This notion was further supported by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who recently compared Bitcoin to gold. Powell positioned Bitcoin as a speculative asset that competes with gold, not the dollar. This reassured crypto supporters, affirming Bitcoin’s status as a store of value. Tenev also mentioned the growing idea of Bitcoin being used as a reserve asset, similar to gold in national reserves. Many see its limited supply and decentralized nature as valuable for wealth protection. Institutional investors and governments increasingly view Bitcoin as a long-term wealth safeguard. As Bitcoin’s value soared, Robinhood became a major player in facilitating crypto transactions. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto trades in November, a 400% increase from the previous month. This surge highlights growing retail investor interest, with Robinhood’s services making crypto more accessible. Tenev stressed that regulatory clarity is key to maintaining this momentum. Paul Atkins’ Nomination Brings Hope for Crypto-Friendly Regulation The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair has stirred optimism within the crypto industry. Known for his pro-business stance, Atkins is expected to bring a more balanced approach to crypto regulation. Tenev contrasted this with the current administration’s regulatory framework, which he described as hostile to crypto. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also supported Atkins’ nomination. Garlinghouse expressed hope that his leadership would prioritize clear guidelines over harsh enforcement. Tenev argued that supportive policies could drive innovation and stability for crypto firms, contrasting with Gary Gensler ’s more cautious regulatory approach. Clearer regulations, he believes, would boost confidence and growth in the crypto market. The Road Ahead: A Bullish Outlook Financial experts believe that Bitcoin’s price could reach $120,000 by the end of the year if current trends persist. This optimism is fueled by continued institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and a growing consensus that Bitcoin is here to stay . As Bitcoin cements its place as digital gold, discussions on its regulation and adoption will shape the financial future. With industry leaders driving innovation and policymakers like Atkins offering support, crypto assets’s future looks bright.

As December 2024 unfolds, a new wave of meme coins is here, sparking both curiosity and FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. What makes this month particularly special? It’s all about the coins that mix cheeky charm with serious growth potential. BTFD , Notcoin, and Memecoin are the headline-makers right now, each bringing a unique spin to the meme coin space. Whether you’re after explosive presales, viral campaigns, or chaotic unpredictability, these coins have something for everyone. Let’s dive into why they’re being hailed as the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BFTD: The Veteran Making Waves Again BFTD, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” stands out as a meme coin that has managed to balance its playful identity with meaningful innovation. In December 2024, BFTD has cemented its reputation as more than just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem offering significant value to its community. Investors are drawn not just by the meme culture but also by its ecosystem that includes P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a strong utility-first approach. Currently trading at $0.000064 in Stage 7 , BFTD’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling more than 23 billion tokens. With a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors stand to gain returns of over 800%. For example, an investment of $5,000 now could fetch approximately 78,203,125 tokens. When BFTD hits its listing price, that investment could grow to $46,921—a compelling reason why it’s hailed as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024 . The excitement doesn’t stop there. BFTD’s partnership with gaming platforms and its reward-driven ecosystem are key factors in its rising popularity. With over 2,400 holders and counting, BFTD is not just a meme coin but a movement. Its potential to rival the meme coin giants of the past makes it a must-watch this month. Notcoin: The Meme Coin with a Mission NOTCOIN takes meme culture to the next level by parodying the very concept of cryptocurrency. Its tagline, “This Is Not a Coin,” has sparked a wave of curiosity, turning it into a viral sensation. But behind its ironic branding lies a serious project that’s making waves in the crypto community. At its core, NOTCOIN is about decentralised governance. The coin’s holders vote on key project decisions, making it one of the most community-driven meme coins on the market. Its DAO structure is a refreshing departure from the typical top-down approach seen in many crypto projects. This unique governance model has earned NOTCOIN a dedicated following, cementing its place among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. . NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns are unmatched. Its recent stunt involving a billboard in Times Square that simply said “This Is Not a Coin” generated millions of impressions online. This kind of marketing, paired with its innovative features, is driving adoption at a rapid pace. At its current price of $0.00009, analysts predict it could reach $0.001 by mid-2025, making it a high-potential investment for those looking to ride the meme coin wave. NOTCOIN is also making strides in utility. It recently announced a partnership with a major social media platform to integrate tipping using NOTCOIN, bringing real-world use cases to its holders. Whether it’s for fun, governance, or potential profit, NOTCOIN offers something for every kind of investor. Memecoin: The Wild Card of December 2024 Memecoin is the wildcard in this month’s meme coin race. While its name might seem generic, its approach is anything but. MEMECOIN thrives on unpredictability, using its lack of a strict roadmap as a marketing tactic. This “no-plan plan” approach has drawn in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on chaos. The coin’s recent rise in popularity is fuelled by its outrageous marketing stunts and viral memes that capture the internet’s ever-changing zeitgeist. At its current price of $0.00005, MEMECOIN’s low entry point makes it an attractive option for new investors. While its long-term viability is uncertain, its potential for explosive short-term gains is undeniable. Many see it as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., purely for its entertainment value and speculative potential. Conclusion The world of meme coins is as dynamic as it is unpredictable, but one thing is clear: December 2024 belongs to BTFD and NOTCOIN. These two projects bring a mix of humour, utility, and community-driven energy that sets them apart. MEMECOIN adds an element of wild unpredictability to the mix, making it a must-watch for risk-takers. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., BTFD’s utility-rich ecosystem and NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns and governance model make them standout choices. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these high-potential projects.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-06 00:16:17

On Dec. 4, Kraken released its Crypto FOMO Survey 2024 , examining the impact of fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on U.S. crypto holders’ investment decisions. The survey polled 1,248 participants, revealing how emotions influence their approach to digital assets. Investors Feel They Missed the Boat A significant portion of respondents expressed regret over missed opportunities. Kraken reported that 88% of survey participants believe they’ve lost out on major gains. This sentiment has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally, which saw BTC hit the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 for the first time. Bitcoin has surged 126% since January, driving the broader crypto market. Altcoins have also seen substantial growth. XRP recently overtook Solana and Tether to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite feelings of missed opportunities, 84% of respondents remain optimistic about future crypto gains. Emotions Influence Decisions When asked about their greatest concerns, 60% cited sudden price surges as the biggest missed opportunity. Additionally, 81% admitted making investment decisions based on FUD, while 84% said they acted on FOMO during price spikes. The survey also revealed that 63% of participants believe emotional decisions have negatively impacted their portfolios. A Methodical Approach is Key While market sentiment plays a role in investment decisions, Kraken emphasized the importance of a calculated strategy. The exchange recommends leveraging technical analysis and planned trading strategies to navigate the volatile crypto market.

Here’s What to Watch For,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cutting-edge-coin-transform-blockchain-forever-heres-what-to-watch-for/,"Blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed, and with it comes a wave of groundbreaking innovations. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the crypto world lately, one name might already be buzzing on your radar— Lightchain AI . This isn’t just another blockchain project vying for attention. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI promises to merge the boundless possibilities of blockchain with the unparalleled power of AI. But can it transform blockchain forever? Let’s dig into what makes this cutting-edge coin so intriguing. Why Investors Can’t Stop Talking About Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has emerged as a beacon of innovation in the crowded crypto space. Here’s why investors, crypto enthusiasts, and tech pioneers are excited about its potential to transform the future of decentralized systems. 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Most blockchain systems rely on traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). While effective, these systems demand significant energy or financial commitments to validate transactions. Enter Proof of Intelligence (PoI) . Unlike PoW or PoS, PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computational AI tasks, such as training machine learning models or enhancing algorithms, while still maintaining the integrity and security of the network. This means Lightchain AI doesn’t just reward for validation—it pushes the boundaries of what a blockchain can achieve by tapping into the growing demand for advanced AI computations. 2. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Redefining Decentralized Applications At the heart of Lightchain AI ‘s innovation lies its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . Think of it as a powerful computational brain designed to supercharge decentralized applications (dApps). Where traditional virtual machines are limited by static capabilities, the AIVM is dynamic and adaptable. It allows developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks, from processing natural language data to running predictive analytics—all within a decentralized framework. The result? Smarter, more efficient applications that bring real-world AI power to blockchain technology. 3. A Transparent and Community-Driven Ecosystem Blockchain’s ethos has always been rooted in transparency and decentralization. Lightchain AI takes this to the next level with its Transparent AI Framework . Every decision made by its AI systems is auditable, fostering trust and accountability—a crucial factor for attracting institutional investors and enterprises. What’s more, Lightchain AI integrates decentralized governance, empowering token holders to propose and vote on key initiatives. Imagine having a say in the future of the very protocol you’re invested in—it’s not just about financial returns anymore; it’s about creating a lasting impact. The Lightchain AI Roadmap to Success Any project with bold claims needs a solid plan. Thankfully, Lightchain AI has a well-thought-out roadmap to guide its goals. Phase 1: Prototype Development Bringing the vision to life with early-stage development of PoI, AIVM, and the governance framework while building initial community support. Phase 2: Testnet Deployment Launching a test environment to fine-tune performance, gather user feedback, and ensure scalability. Phase 3: Mainnet Launch The big moment—fully activating the PoI and AIVM for widespread adoption, while simultaneously onboarding validators and expanding partnerships. With $1,063,817.84 already raised in its presale and a current price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is steadily building momentum. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Future of Blockchain The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting frontiers in tech, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Its ability to fuse AI computations with decentralized infrastructure has massive implications for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. Here’s why it stands out: Efficiency: PoI ensures resources are used for meaningful tasks, reducing waste and boosting productivity. Scalability: With AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI enables dApps to tackle increasingly complex AI operations. Impact: By making its AI systems transparent and accountable, Lightchain AI builds trust for enterprise-level adoption. But What About Risks? Like any innovative concept, Lightchain AI isn’t without its risks. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and investor returns can never be guaranteed. Additionally, as a cutting-edge project, Lightchain AI relies heavily on adoption and execution to fully realize its potential. That said, the team’s focus on usability and community-driven governance indicates strong fundamentals, which could make it a promising investment for long-term crypto enthusiasts. How to Get Involved with Lightchain AI You don’t have to wait for the official launch to be a part of this revolution. Lightchain AI’s presale is already live , offering early adopters discounted tokens and exclusive perks, such as governance voting rights and priority access to future ecosystem features.

The pool will attract both institutional and retail miners by offering competitive commission rates starting at just 0.4%. As part of its expansion strategy, BitFuFu has also announced its plan to allocate its entire self-mining hashrate to the new pool, which will enhance its mining capacity. In addition, the company has shared that it currently holds 1,664 BTC. BitFuFu Expands Offerings with New Bitcoin Mining Pool According to a recent report , BitFuFu has introduced BitFuFu Pool, a private-label Bitcoin mining pool that promises competitive commission rates beginning at 0.4%. This new service will be available starting next week through the BitFuFu app, which is accessible to users purchasing cloud-mining products and miner services. As part of its broader business model, BitFuFu has decided to direct its entire self-mining hashrate to the new pool. This means that all of the computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining will now be channeled into BitFuFu Pool. This shift will boost the pool’s capacity and attract more miners looking for an efficient and cost-effective way to mine. The company is also focusing on offering an array of services to both institutional and retail clients. These include real-time monitoring tools, firmware solutions, maintenance services, and a user-friendly platform for easy mining operations. The pool’s commission rates will make it an attractive option for miners who are looking to maximize profits. This strategic move aligns with the rising Bitcoin price and the growing demand for efficient mining solutions. After crossing the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin price experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $97,640 in a sudden flash crash. This drop triggered over $649 million in total liquidations across the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the way at $216.95 million in losses. Focus on Institutional Clients and Customized Services BitFuFu also stated that it will cater to institutional clients by offering customized services through consultations with sales representatives. These services will help large-scale miners optimize their operations in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. BitFuFu Pool is initially focused on Bitcoin mining, but there are plans to expand to other digital assets in the future. This expansion will allow the crypto mining company to diversify its offerings and tap into other cryptocurrencies. The company’s strategic partners will play a crucial role in this expansion. As of today, the crypto mining company holds a total of 1,664 BTC, reflecting its disciplined approach to treasury management. This strategy allows the company to accumulate Bitcoin through self-mining while also generating cash flow by providing cloud-mining services. Similarly, most recently, Hut 8 announced plans to raise $500 million through the sale of common stock under an ATM program. The proceeds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, enhancing its reserves. Additionally, the company revealed a $250 million stock repurchase program, aiming to buy back 5% of its outstanding shares over the next 12 months.

Decentralized finance in underserved regions Each partner brings their own unique expertise to the table. Creditcoin will lay the financial groundwork to create a blockchain-based ecosystem conducive to secure lending and borrowing. Spacecoin, on the other hand, focuses on connectivity by deploying advanced satellite technology to deliver internet access to underserved regions. Sui, a smart contract platform, is responsible for scalable and secure computing, while Walrus ensures efficient data management and decentralized storage availability. How Creditcoin, Spacecoin, Sui, and Walrus can work together Together, all parties can work on delivering a cohesive system and tackle challenges such as the lack of internet access and limited financial inclusion in certain areas. As mentioned, Spacecoin’s satellite network will provide connectivity in regions where the necessary infrastructure is lacking, allowing Creditcoin users worldwide to execute transactions more safely. In the meanwhile, Sui and Walrus scalability solutions are expected to streamline peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial interactions and data sharing without centralized intermediaries. Most importantly, the P2P module is expected to reduce operational costs and enhance transparency in the process. As such, the partnership aims to address the needs of the 37% of the global population that remains offline and/or underbanked. New global avenues in DeFi By integrating connectivity with DeFi solutions, the partnership opens up new avenues for potential clients in remote regions. New users will thus gain access to financial services and manage their assets online, fostering inclusivity and economic growth.

This stabilization comes after a period of downward pressure, raising speculations of a rebound on the horizon. With bulls showing signs of resilience, the stage is set for a comeback that could redefine BONK’s near-term trajectory. Will this level be the springboard for a recovery, or is further consolidation needed before the next move? Support Holds Steady: Signs Of A Bullish Rebound As market sentiment teeters between caution and optimism, determining the meme coin’s recent hold at the $0.00004002 support level is crucial in order for investors and traders to reevaluate their positions ahead of potential volatility. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says On the 4-hour chart, BONK is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $0.00004002 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $0.00006247 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, possibly opening the door to higher levels. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. When the RSI rises and reaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BONK the strength to push higher and test key resistance levels. BONK Performance On The Daily Time Frame BONK is showing signs of a potential upward movement on the daily chart, staying above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $0.00004002 support level. Its maintenance above this support provides a foundation for further growth. If BONK can maintain its position above this level and continue building momentum, it could pave the way for a breakout and more upside movement. Furthermore, the daily RSI shows signs of a rebound, maintaining a steady position above the 50% threshold. The continued trend above this level implies that the asset is in a favorable position for more gains, with the possibility of a sustained rally. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could indicate growing confidence among traders and signal positive price action for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness Thus far, BONK is at a pivotal moment, having found stability above the $0.00004002 support level and the daily 100-day SMA. If Bonk can sustain its position above this support and build on its current momentum, a potential recovery could be underway, possibly driving the price toward the $0.00006247 resistance level and beyond. Nonetheless, failure to maintain $0.00004002 may alter the meme coin’s direction to the downside, causing it to retest lower support zones such as $0.00002962 and $0.00002320.

33767162,[object Object],1733446822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,How XRP Will Play A Role In The Dogecoin Price Reach $3-$5 In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-dogecoin-price-3-5/,"Despite its notable gains throughout this year, the Dogecoin price has yet to break above its all-time high in 2021, but analysts continue to remain bullish . Interestingly, recent analyses from crypto analysts have compared the Dogecoin price action to that of the XRP price rally, with the general consensus being new all-time highs for both cryptocurrencies in the coming months. A notable observation by crypto analyst, ProfessorAstrones, has added intrigue to this discussion, as he links XRP’s market movements to a rally in Dogecoin’s price. Dogecoin Price Action Mirrors XRP’s Rally Dynamics ProfessorAstrones, a pseudonymous crypto analyst, shared his perspective on social media platform X, noting that XRP’s market liquidity could flow into Dogecoin and drive its price to new heights. According to the DOGEUSDT 4-hour chart that accompanied his analysis, Dogecoin’s current price movement is defined by a tightening range formed by a descending trendline and an ascending trendline. Interestingly, this chart structure resembles that of the flag of a bullish pennant, which often signifies an upward breakout is close. According to him, the Dogecoin price is still on track to reach a closer target of $1 and long-term targets of $3 and $5 by 2025. All these are bullish targets, and attaining even the $1 would necessitate a break above the current all-time high of $0.7316. Interestingly, his Dogecoin price outlook is also based off of a projection rotation of liquidity in the crypto market. Specifically, he predicted a scenario where capital that has fueled XRP’s price rally will eventually flow into Dogecoin. “$XRP money will flow into $DOGE,” the analyst said . What this basically means is that as XRP investors start taking profits, their focus may pivot toward Dogecoin, which, like XRP, is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies among retail investors. Interestingly, this outlook of money rotation between XRP and Dogecoin is supported by other crypto analysts. One such voice is @CryptoGodJohn, who expressed a similar view on social media platform X. According to his own outlook, he anticipates that money will flow into Dogecoin once XRP reaches a local price peak in this market cycle. Parallels Between Dogecoin and XRP Charts Jacob Canfield, another popular crypto analyst, shared his thoughts on the price similarities between Dogecoin and XRP, highlighting the classic trading structure of both assets. He observed that the Dogecoin price has been forming higher lows while successfully turning previous resistance levels into support, much like XRP on the lower time frames. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.441 and is up by 5% in the past 24 hours. XRP, on the other hand, is currently trading at 2.37, having declined by about 10% in the past 24 hours. Whether there will be a liquidity rotation between XRP and Dogecoin in the current bull cycle remains to be seen.",Altcoin News|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-06 01:00:22
