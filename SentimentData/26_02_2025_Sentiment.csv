As these costs escalate, alternatives like Stacks and BitTorrent are transforming digital commerce with their decentralized technologies. Stacks adds smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin, enabling financial applications without modifying its core structure, and BitTorrent offers efficient peer-to-peer file sharing powered by blockchain incentives. However, for online sales, Web3Bay emerges prominently by cutting out intermediaries and slashing transaction fees. With the security of smart contracts and sellers retaining a larger share of their profits, Web3Bay is carving out a space as a formidable contender to fee-intensive platforms like eBay. eBay Fees Are Too High – Here’s Why Sellers Are Turning to Web3Bay As platforms like eBay and Amazon hike their fees, online sellers are in search of cheaper alternatives. Between listing fees, final value fees, and payment processing charges, sellers are parting with a substantial portion of their profits. In response, Web3Bay offers an appealing solution by removing intermediaries and facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions via blockchain. This shift is attractive to many sellers because of the potential for lower costs and increased control. eBay can take up to 15% in fees per sale, not including additional charges from payment processors like PayPal or credit cards. In contrast, Web3Bay eliminates these costs, allowing sellers to keep more of what they earn. Moreover, smart contracts on Web3Bay provide secure transactions without the need for centralized oversight, reducing the likelihood of chargebacks and disputes. The market reaction is telling; Web3Bay has successfully raised over $1.5 million in its presale, now in Stage 4, with over 375 million 3BAY tokens sold at $0.00456 each. This traction is seen as a sign that online selling is ripe for decentralization—a fairer setup free from exorbitant platform fees. With its growing popularity, Web3Bay could soon replace eBay as the preferred online transaction platform. Stacks: Boosting Bitcoin with Smart Contract Capabilities Launched initially in 2017 as Blockstack, Stacks was developed to introduce smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin. Distinguished by its Proof of Transfer (PoX) mechanism, Stacks secures its operations through Bitcoin without needing to alter the primary network. The Nakamoto upgrade in April 2024 further enhanced transaction speeds and finality, encouraging wider adoption. By February 2025, Stacks had achieved significant growth, with the Grayscale Stacks Trust managing assets close to $1.57 million. The anticipated sBTC Cap-2 launch on February 25, 2025, is set to broaden Bitcoin’s financial applications. Currently, STX trades at around $0.901, demonstrating stability and potential for gradual appreciation. Projects like ALEXLabBTC and VelarBTC contribute to the ecosystem’s expansion by providing rewards and incentives. As Stacks continues to evolve, its deep integration with Bitcoin solidifies its role as a pivotal player in decentralized finance, attracting both developers and investors. BitTorrent: Pioneering Decentralized File Sharing BitTorrent, established in 2001, dominated peer-to-peer file sharing long before TRON’s acquisition in 2018 and the subsequent introduction of the BitTorrent Token (BTT) in 2019, which incentivizes network participation. Recently, BTT was listed on HashKey Global on February 19, 2025, enhancing its liquidity and market presence. Trading at about $0.000000849, the token experiences slight fluctuations but holds promise for growth, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $0.00000206 by the end of 2025. Despite the challenges of market volatility, BitTorrent’s ongoing integration with TRON and blockchain-based solutions continues to bolster its utility, maintaining its status as a significant entity in decentralized data sharing. This ensures efficient and secure file transfers, drawing more users and investors into BitTorrent’s ecosystem. Key Insights! As the trend in online commerce leans towards decentralized solutions, sellers are reconsidering their dependency on platforms like eBay. Stacks is expanding the utility of Bitcoin through smart contracts, and BitTorrent is advancing the scope of decentralized file sharing. However, in the realm of reducing costs and enhancing profit margins, Web3Bay stands out as a practical alternative. By eliminating excessive fees and facilitating direct transactions, Web3Bay offers sellers more autonomy over their financial outcomes.

Among the top picks is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 2 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is giving investors an early-bird opportunity to invest in the project at $0.015. MUTM has raised over $1.3 million, attracting more than 2,560 holders in record time. The momentum is unstoppable, thanks to its game-changing lending protocol and an upcoming 33.33% price hike to $0.02 that has created massive FOMO. The token is set to launch at $0.06 after 11 presale stages, rewarding phase 2 investors with a 300% ROI. If the 39x prediction holds true, MUTM could hit $2.42 in the next bull run. Mutuum Finance: Redefining DeFi Lending As XRP faces price volatility, Mutuum Finance is rising as a better alternative for investors. The platform is revolutionizing decentralized finance with its advanced dual-lending system, integrating both Peer-to-Contract (P2P) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model utilizes smart contracts to manage lending pools, enabling users to deposit stablecoins like USDT, while borrowers secure loans backed by crypto assets such as ETH. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates intermediaries, allowing borrowers and lenders to customize loan agreements with complete control over terms. This innovative hybrid approach enhances security, flexibility, and profitability, offering liquidity providers up to 10% APY. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance is fostering an ecosystem where both lenders and borrowers benefit from seamless transactions, transparent protocols, and a user-centric experience. By eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, the platform not only reduces borrowing costs but also maximizes returns for liquidity providers. This ensures a more inclusive and sustainable financial ecosystem, making it a standout in the DeFi market. Designed for Security, Stability, and Growth Mutuum Finance is committed to transparency and security, undergoing extensive third-party audits and utilizing open-source smart contracts. To ensure long-term stability, the platform is set to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin and implement a buyback mechanism funded by platform fees to support price appreciation. Additionally, staking rewards incentivize long-term holders, strengthening confidence in the ecosystem. Momentum is rapidly building, with over 2,560 investors already on board. Mutuum Finance is also implementing advanced risk management protocols to safeguard users’ assets. The combination of smart contract audits and innovative lending structures ensures a high level of reliability, making it an attractive option for both institutional and retail investors looking for stable, high-yield opportunities in DeFi. A Lucrative Early Investment Opportunity Phase 2 of the MUTM presale presents a prime opportunity to acquire tokens at $0.015. As the presale progresses through 11 price stages, the value will rise to $0.06 at launch, offering phase 2 investors up to 300% returns before public trading begins. Analysts project that MUTM could reach $1 post-launch, positioning it as one of 2025’s most promising DeFi tokens. Investors from phase 1 have already gained 50%, with more than $1,314,515 raised. Mutuum Finance’s structured roadmap and strategic development efforts further solidify its long-term potential. With a dedicated team focused on innovation and scalability, the platform is set to evolve beyond lending, incorporating features such as multi-chain compatibility. This positions MUTM as a multifaceted DeFi powerhouse with vast growth potential. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Rewards To drive adoption, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway, with 10 winners set to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Additionally, a referral program rewards users who bring in new investors, further accelerating community-driven growth. Mutuum Finance is setting a new standard in DeFi lending with its innovative dual-lending model, robust security measures, and a rapidly growing community. As the presale moves through its stages and prices continue to rise, early investors have a rare opportunity to secure a significant position before MUTM enters public trading. With analysts predicting a potential 39x post-launch surge, those who act now could see exponential returns in the next bull cycle. Don’t miss out on this game-changing opportunity to invest in Mutuum Finance today and be part of the next big DeFi project.

While ADA battles to regain momentum, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is gaining traction, drawing attention with its groundbreaking fusion of blockchain and real estate. As traditional crypto assets face challenges, PropiChain presents a fresh opportunity, offering real-world utility and significant growth potential. So why is the Cardano price movement currently on a slow recovery and why is PCHAIN considered the perfect alternative? Cardano Price Tug-of-War: Breakout or Breakdown? The Cardano price slow recovery has caught the attention of analysts, with a recent technical forecast suggesting a potential 24% price swing in the near term. According to analyst Ali Martinez, the Cardano price action is currently confined within a critical range of $0.74 to $0.83. A breakout above $0.83 could push the Cardano price beyond the psychologically significant $1 mark, signaling a renewed bullish trend. However, failure to hold above $0.74 might trigger a deeper retracement to $0.56, reinforcing the asset’s ongoing volatility. Despite its struggle to reclaim previous highs, Cardano has shown resilience, recently climbing to $0.79 with modest gains. Market sentiment has been cautiously optimistic, fueled by renewed interest in crypto ETFs and broader institutional involvement. While the recovery remains slow, analysts highlight the importance of these key technical levels in determining ADA’s next major move. Investors now await a decisive breakout that could set the tone for the Cardano price trajectory in the coming months. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Blockchain Revolution in Real Estate As investors seek opportunities against the Cardano price movements, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has emerged as a compelling alternative. PropiChain is rapidly gaining traction by offering something the crypto space has long needed, real-world utility. The real estate market has long been plagued by inefficiencies, from slow transactions to high entry barriers and complex legal structures. PropiChain addresses these challenges through a decentralized real estate marketplace that enables anyone to invest in prime properties via tokenization. Converting physical real estate assets into digital tokens, PropiChain opens up investment opportunities that were once exclusive to institutions. Instead of requiring substantial upfront capital, investors can now buy fractional shares, democratizing access to high-value properties. What sets PropiChain apart is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart contracts, streamlining property transactions and improving market transparency. AI-driven analysis provides real-time insights and predictive valuations, reducing speculation while ensuring data-driven investment decisions. Smart contracts automate leasing agreements, rental payments, and asset transfers, cutting transaction times from weeks to mere minutes. Beyond the physical property market, PropiChain is venturing into the metaverse through its PropiVerse initiative. This expansion allows users to explore virtual properties and invest in digital real estate, bridging the gap between traditional and Web3-driven property ownership. With the rapid acceleration of Web3 adoption, PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of a real estate revolution that blends physical and digital asset ownership. Security is a cornerstone of PropiChain’s ecosystem. The platform has undergone rigorous audits by BlockAudit , a globally recognized blockchain security firm, ensuring the integrity of its smart contracts and transaction framework. Additionally, its listing on CoinMarketCap has further cemented investor confidence, distinguishing it from the many unverified DeFi projects in the space. PropiChain Presale: 200x ROI Potential Draws Investor Attention PropiChain’s presale has become a hotbed of early adopters looking to capitalize on its potential. Currently, PCHAIN is priced at just $0.01, with upcoming rounds set to increase to $0.023 and a launch price of $0.032. Investors who enter at this stage could see gains of up to 700% before public trading even begins. Market analysts have projected an astonishing surge for PCHAIN , with forecasts suggesting a potential climb to $8 per token: a staggering 2,000% return. A modest $1,000 investment at presale prices could transform into $20,000, surpassing the historic returns seen in last year’s Cardano price action. Beyond price appreciation, PropiChain offers additional incentives, including staking rewards of up to 225% APY, governance rights, and lending opportunities using PCHAIN as collateral. As traditional real estate investors and crypto enthusiasts alike take notice, PropiChain is emerging as a dominant player in the evolving landscape of blockchain-powered property investment. With the time on the presale running fast, now is the perfect time to shift to PCHAIN to register massive returns compared to the Cardano price stagnation.

Many of the most popular memecoin projects launched in 2025 are based on the Solana blockchain, greatly improving the value of the platform’s token. However, many within the crypto space have begun to raise questions about the volatility of the memecoin market and its adverse effects on the general crypto market. Meanwhile, Solana is being looked at as a key facilitator of the recent memecoin popularity surge. As a result, savvy investors have begun shifting focus towards PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a platform that embodies long-term growth and stability. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is making major moves toward transforming the real estate industry by leveraging AI and Metaverse technologies. The platform utilizes tokenized fractional ownership to open up the real estate market to a global audience. With investor interest growing during its ongoing token presale, PropiChain is clearly considered a major alternative investment to Solana. Market Uncertainty Raises Questions About Solana’s Potential Solana has divided opinions in the crypto market, with very interesting signs for future growth closely followed by questions surrounding the platform’s memecoin support. The SEC is currently evaluating multiple Solana ETF applications, with results anticipated towards the end of the year. Successful filings could see huge growth for the Solana token, whereas SEC rejections may be detrimental to Solana’s perceived potential. However, memecoin volatility has been a hot topic in crypto, with many shining a limelight on Solana’s involvement. The recent collapse of the LIBRA token added fuel to the fire, with traders losing billions as a result. Following this event, Solana’s reputation took a major hit, leading investors to consider more stable alternatives. The company’s price has dropped 36.53% to $167.41 , while its market cap is down 3.55% to $81.81B . Consequently, traders have begun moving toward PropiChain (PCHAIN), the platform aiming to solve persistent issues in the real estate market. The decentralized blockchain is built on detailed tokenomics that ensure the long-term stability of the token. Top crypto investors are jumping on board the PCHAIN train with token prices at an incredibly affordable rate. Innovative Features Propelling PropiChain past Solana PropiChain has made waves in the crypto market, and its AI-powered features are seen as the platform’s headline act. PropiChain leverages AI to deliver real-time, personalized property valuation, market analysis, and investment opportunities. The platform allows even newbie investors to get their hands on the most accurate market data from highly reliable sources. Meanwhile, the strive for a global real estate market is moving ever closer with PropiChain’s Metaverse integration, which allows users to explore properties from anywhere in the world. With this technology, a global investor can view, negotiate for, and customize U.S. properties without ever needing to be physically present. This feature also exponentially increases the buyer pool for real estate property owners. Furthermore, fractional property ownership has been implemented, allowing small-scale investors to own a piece of a high-value property without needing to pay the full market price. This means that for as little as $1,000, coveted properties in the most popular locations, such as Los Angeles and New York, can easily be yours. Finally, PropiChain’s detailed smart contract architecture makes complex processes such as lease renewals and rent payments easy and transparent. Based on pre-agreed terms, leases can be automatically renewed without needing drawn-out negotiations and shady agents. Meanwhile, rents are paid swiftly from the tenant’s digital wallet and sent directly to the property owner. PropiChain Guarantees Big Rewards for Early Investors PropiChain users can have peace of mind knowing that their investments and personal data are always kept safe. The platform, especially its smart contracts architecture, has been carefully audited by BlockAudit , a leading security firm. This showcases PropiChain’s dedication to protecting its users’ information and maintaining the platform’s trustworthiness. On top of that, early investors in PropiChain will be delighted to discover platform advantages that go beyond just investment gains. These wonderful benefits include referral rewards, discounts on properties, exciting staking opportunities, governance rights, and a variety of other perks. After an entry on CoinMarketCap hinted at possible PCHAIN listings on other major crypto exchanges, analysts anticipate that returns following the listing might soar to 800%. This implies that a $1,000 investment could yield profits exceeding $80,000 in no time. The PCHAIN Presale is the Biggest of the Year – Don’t Miss the Ride! The PropiChain token is currently priced at $0.011, expected to increase to $0.023 during the third presale phase, with a future listing price of $0.032.

This will provide more investment options for people interested in cryptocurrency. Polkadot is a blockchain network that allows different blockchains to work together. It has been steadily growing, and its cryptocurrency, DOT, has a market value of about $6.6 billion. Interestingly, the Grayscale Spot Polkadot ETF filing has already changed the market, with DOT rising by 4% after the announcement. This indicates that investors believe there will be more demand for Polkadot if the ETF gets approved. If approved by the SEC, the Grayscale Spot Polkadot ETF would join the list of cryptocurrency ETFs, giving investors a safe way to invest in digital currencies without directly owning the assets. Nasdaq File for CoinShares XRP and Litecoin ETFs Meanwhile, Nasdaq submitted 19b-4 forms to the SEC to launch CoinShares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs , earlier in the month. These steps are also crucial for increasing the institutional use of digital assets and giving investors an easier way to invest in two popular cryptocurrencies, The SEC will review these filings to ensure they meet U.S. securities laws. If the SEC approves them, CoinShares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs could pave the way for other cryptocurrency ETFs. This could also help connect traditional financial markets with the fast-changing world of digital assets.

In a new post to the social media platform X, Ardoino makes his argument for why USDT is the “most successful tool” for the US dollar maintaining its hegemony. “Tether built, over the last decade, the widest physical and digital distribution network, spacing from thousands of kiosks in Africa and South America to digital remittances platforms, from payment backbones to institutional tools. Every single day our teams and portfolio companies are with their boots on the ground in countless areas within developing countries, helping communities and growing utilization, trust and education into USDT and by reflection into the US economy.” Ardoino notes that USDT is held by more than 400 million people, growing at a pace of 35 million new wallets per quarter, or 140 million new wallets per year. He also says USDT is doing especially well in developing countries. Tether’s success, says Ardoino, has come at the price of a target on their back. “While our competitors’ business model should be to build a better product and even bigger distribution network, their real intent is ‘Kill Tether.’ Every single business or political meeting that they have culminates with this intent. While might seem an overstatement, it’s a fact and it’s being reported independently by hundreds of people inside and outside the digital assets industry in touch with the US administration.” The CEO frames any competitors’ attacks on the stablecoin firm as an attack on the sovereignty of the US dollar. And according to Ardoino, Tether is the 18th largest US dollar holder by the size of US treasuries.

Imagine robots building robots – it’s no longer science fiction! Apptronik’s latest collaboration with manufacturing giant Jabil marks a significant stride in this direction, just weeks after securing a massive $350 million funding round to ramp up production of their flagship Apollo robot. But what does this mean for the future of robotics and automation? Let’s dive in and explore this fascinating development. Why is Apptronik’s Jabil Partnership a Game Changer for Humanoid Robots? Following closely on the heels of a March 2024 pilot program with Mercedes-Benz, Apptronik’s deal with Jabil signifies a doubling down on real-world testing and, crucially, manufacturing collaboration. While the Mercedes-Benz partnership is still in the pilot phase, the Jabil agreement goes a step further. Beyond deploying humanoid robots on Jabil’s factory floors for assessment, this partnership is designed to evolve into a full-fledged manufacturing alliance. Here’s the exciting part: once Apptronik’s Apollo robot proves its commercial viability within Jabil’s operations, Jabil will transition into a manufacturing partner, producing Apollo robots directly within their own factories. This sets the stage for a potentially revolutionary outcome – humanoid robots contributing to the creation of… more humanoid robots ! It’s a cyclical vision that could dramatically accelerate the growth and adoption of humanoid robotics across industries. What Tasks Will Apollo Humanoid Robots Perform at Jabil? For now, Apptronik is keeping specific deployment numbers under wraps. However, they’ve indicated that the pilot phase will involve an undisclosed number of Apollo systems tackling “simple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks” within Jabil’s facilities. These tasks include: Sorting Parts: Precisely categorizing and organizing components within the manufacturing environment. Transporting Materials: Moving parts and materials efficiently across the factory floor, streamlining workflows. This real-world validation is critical. Each task Apollo successfully completes on Jabil’s factory floor brings it closer to proving its worth in large-scale manufacturing . The better Apollo performs, the faster it can transition from pilot project to an integral part of a production line – potentially one that will eventually produce more Apollos. The Race for Humanoid Robotics Leadership: Who are Apptronik’s Competitors? Apptronik is not alone in the quest to bring humanoid robots into industrial settings. They are part of a dynamic and competitive field that includes other notable companies like: Agility Robotics: A key player, and notably, the only one among the frontrunners to have moved beyond pilot phases with their robot deployments. Boston Dynamics: Famous for their advanced and dynamic robots, though their industrial applications are still developing.

Table of Contents Rollblock: The gaming platform set on disrupting the industry Cardano developers work on on-chain upgrades Solana loses 36% after meme launch scandals Conclusion The crypto market is firing again on all cylinders, and investors are scouring the charts for the next big opportunity. While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) remain popular plays, traders have recently been shifting to the transformative casino Rollblock (RBLK). Analysts predict a potential 50x rally for Rollblock, making it a must-watch token for savvy investors in 2025. Rollblock: The gaming platform set on disrupting the industry Rollblock is shaking up the online gaming sector with its fully transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem. December saw an incredible 600% surge in new users and $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed. The gaming platform is currently live and generating massive revenue, with over 7,000 games and the launch of a new sports prediction league. The process of onboarding recently got even easier thanks to its integration of Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard to enable fiat deposits. Rollblock securely encrypts all of its user transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that everything is fully verifiable and that there can be no hint of bet manipulation. What really makes Rollblock unique is its deflationary revenue-sharing model. The platform takes up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens on the open market, with 60% of these tokens burned forever and 40% distributed as staking rewards that offer up to 30% APY for holders. With a string of major exchange listings on the horizon in the coming months, stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.06. Investors can also take advantage of a limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases this week. You might also like: Is Solana heading back below $100? Why XRP, RBLK could be better alternatives Cardano developers work on on-chain upgrades Cardano has fallen by 7.63% the past week, currently trading at $0.6907. This brings Cardano’s monthly candle to a woeful 28.70% decline as the crypto was unable to hold its price above $1 in recent weeks. Despite this disappointing price performance, Cardano has continued to innovate and its upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade will introduce high frequency blocks and enhance the chain’s scalability and speed. Founder Charles Hoskinson has stressed that developers are working around the clock to ensure a successful launch, which could prepare the price of Cardano to reach as high as $3 in the coming months. Solana loses 36% after meme launch scandals Solana has also faced challenging trading conditions recently, falling by 14% this week to reach $145.50. In the past month, Solana is down by a worrying 40.46% as huge numbers of long-term holders have been selling following the recent scandal around insider trading. Meme coin launches on Solana, including Melania and Libra, were the victims of sniper bots enabled by the teams responsible for launching the tokens. While the dust settles on this controversy, Solana could well retest the resistance at $150. Conclusion While Cardano and Solana continue to battle downward momentum, Rollblock offers an alternative, with investors jumping in before the next price jump.

This significant drop marks the largest one-day percentage loss since that date. Investors are closely monitoring the platform’s developments and market strategies to assess its potential for recovery and growth. Stellar: Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions Stellar (XLM) is a blockchain-based platform aimed at simplifying cross-border payments. By connecting financial institutions and payment systems, Stellar enables quick, reliable, and low-cost international money transfers. This functionality is invaluable for remittances and businesses operating in multiple countries, as it reduces the time and cost associated with traditional banking systems. Recently, Stellar’s market performance has been under scrutiny.

In an interview on “Bloomberg Crypto” with Sonali Basak and Tim Stenovec, Tenev said, “The business has been doing tremendously well.” He pointed to strong fourth-quarter 2024 results, highlighting a record $1 billion in revenue and $50 billion in customer deposits for the year. When asked about the market correction tracked by Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven index, Tenev suggested the dip was temporary. Last week’s post-earnings rally faded into today’s broader market downturn, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) slipping below $87,000. Robinhood shares fell by 8%, closing at $45.92 but still up 16% since the start of the year. The stock dip followed a wider market slump, but Tenev did not attribute it to any specific cause beyond normal fluctuations. Despite the decline, Tenev remains optimistic about user engagement. “Our customers…have a long-term perspective on these things,” he said, noting that many see market declines as opportunities to buy technology stocks and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin at lower prices.

With institutional adoption rising, on-chain activity booming, and Bitcoin showing signs of strength, the stage is set for massive gains. But the real question is: which cryptos have the potential to skyrocket? While many tokens will pump, only a few will deliver long-term value, real-world adoption, and game-changing utility. The opportunity to invest early in the next best crypto before the market explodes is now. One of the biggest names making waves in the space is Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative blockchain project designed for real-world use cases. It’s changing the game with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a Web3 solution that simplifies asset management across multiple blockchains. But Qubetics isn’t the only one to watch. Other top contenders, like Injective, Arweave, Stacks, and Chainlink, are also positioned for exponential growth. Let’s dive into why these cryptos are poised to dominate the next bull run. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator with a Game-Changing Wallet Managing digital assets across multiple blockchains is a nightmare for most users. High fees, slow transactions, and the hassle of juggling different wallets make crypto adoption difficult. Qubetics aims to solve this problem with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a next-gen solution that seamlessly connects users to leading blockchains. This Web3-powered wallet offers a single interface to store, send, and receive assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—eliminating the need for multiple apps. For businesses, this technology is a game-changer. Imagine an e-commerce company accepting crypto payments from various blockchains without dealing with complicated integrations. With Qubetics, transactions settle instantly, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. For freelancers, handling payments in different cryptocurrencies becomes effortless, ensuring fast, secure transfers without relying on centralized platforms. Even everyday users benefit from having full control of their assets without security risks from third-party custodians. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator uniting major blockchains. This innovation brings unmatched accessibility and financial freedom to users, making it a key player in the next bull run. But what truly makes Qubetics stand out is its ongoing best crypto presale, offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS before it surges in value. Currently in its 23rd presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $14.1 million, with 489 million $TICS tokens sold and 21,300+ holders. The presale follows a strict 7-day stage structure, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.0888, but once the presale ends, projections show massive returns. If $TICS reaches $0.25, investors will see a 181.52% ROI. At $1, returns skyrocket to 1026.08%, while a $5 target pushes ROI to 5530.44%. And for those who hold until the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, hitting $10 or $15 means life-changing gains of 11160.88% and 16791.32% respectively. For example, a $100 investment at the current price would yield 1,238.70 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that $100 turns into $1,026. At $10, it becomes $11,160, and at $15, it explodes to $16,791. With this kind of upside, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s an opportunity that serious investors can’t afford to miss. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics isn’t just another presale token; it’s a disruptive Web3 aggregator with real-world utility. With a presale structure that rewards early adopters, this is easily one of the next best crypto projects set to explode before the bull run. 2. Injective (INJ): The Future of DeFi and Interoperability Injective is revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering a lightning-fast, fully decentralized exchange protocol. Unlike traditional DeFi platforms, Injective provides zero gas fees, ultra-low latency, and full interoperability across blockchains. With support for Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana, this protocol enables seamless cross-chain trading while eliminating front-running issues that plague centralized exchanges. Recent upgrades, like the Injective v2 release, have strengthened its ecosystem by introducing layer-2 scaling and institutional-grade security. Additionally, its integration with Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) framework allows assets to move fluidly across networks, unlocking a new era of DeFi usability. As global interest in decentralized trading and derivatives grows, Injective is positioned as a dominant force in the space. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With next-gen DeFi solutions and unmatched cross-chain capabilities, Injective is set to capture a massive market share when the bull run ignites. 3. Arweave (AR): The Backbone of Permanent Decentralized Storage In an era where data permanence is more crucial than ever, Arweave delivers a decentralized solution for storing information forever. Unlike traditional cloud storage providers that charge recurring fees, Arweave enables users to pay once for lifetime storage. This makes it a perfect fit for NFTs, legal documents, and blockchain archives. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Solana and Ethereum, have strengthened its adoption. Developers are increasingly integrating Arweave into Web3 applications, ensuring that critical data remains immutable and accessible. As decentralized storage becomes a key component of blockchain infrastructure, Arweave stands at the forefront of this revolution. Why This Coin Made it to This List: The demand for permanent, censorship-resistant storage is surging, making Arweave an essential blockchain layer for Web3 innovation. 4. Stacks (STX): Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Stacks is redefining Bitcoin’s role in the blockchain space by introducing smart contracts and DeFi applications to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin has always been the most secure network, it lacked programmability—until Stacks changed the game. Stacks’ Clarity smart contract language enables developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin while benefiting from its unmatched security. The recent launch of sBTC (synthetic Bitcoin) is further fueling the adoption of Bitcoin-based DeFi. With institutional money flowing into Bitcoin at record levels, Stacks is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand. Why This Coin Made it to This List: As Bitcoin adoption accelerates, Stacks is unlocking its true potential by enabling smart contracts and DeFi within its ecosystem. 5. Chainlink (LINK): The Bridge Between Blockchain and the Real World Chainlink remains the gold standard for decentralized oracles, enabling smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data. From DeFi to insurance and supply chain management, its oracle services power some of the biggest blockchain applications. Recent partnerships, including integrations with SWIFT, major banks, and enterprises, have cemented its dominance in the space. With Chainlink staking gaining traction, LINK holders now benefit from additional utility and passive income opportunities. As blockchain adoption continues to expand, Chainlink will be the go-to solution for reliable off-chain data feeds. Why This Coin Made it to This List: No blockchain project can function at scale without trusted oracle services, and Chainlink remains the undisputed leader in this field. The Final Call Before the Bull Run The crypto market is primed for its next explosion, and picking the right projects before the surge is crucial. Qubetics, Injective, Arweave, Stacks, and Chainlink each bring something unique to the table, making them the next best crypto contenders for massive growth. With Qubetics offering a best crypto presale that rewards early investors, the window to join this crypto presale is closing fast. Those who act now could be the biggest winners when the market goes parabolic.

Its Web3 aggregator technology, cross-chain wallet, and strong ROI projections make it one of the most promising presale projects. Will Chainlink remain dominant in the next bull run?

The Bybit hack is said to have been perpetuated by the same group of North Korean-backed hackers responsible for the $620 million Ronin Network exploit in 2022. Now, the crypto exchange has gone on the offensive to deal with the group as best as it can, at least until law enforcement comes up with a more permanent solution. Bybit introduces the Lazarus Bounty platform Bybit’s Lazarus Bounty platform , named after the infamous North Korean hacking group believed to be responsible for the breach, is its latest effort to retrieve the cryptocurrency it lost. The North Korean hacking group was linked to the crime by popular blockchain investigator, ZachXBT. Arkham made a post on its X account stating that ZachXBT had “submitted definitive proof” linking the Lazarus group to the attack. The submission was shared with the Bybit team to aid their investigation into the matter. The Lazarus Group has a documented history of targeting cryptocurrency platforms and pulling off large scale heists. The group has been involved in other high profile incidents including the $620 million theft from the Ronin Network in March 2022 and a $41 million theft from Stake.com in September 2023. The methods and scale of these attacks have similar patterns with that of the Bybit incident, giving even more validity to ZachXBT’s accusation. Arkham continued to monitor the activity of the hacker’s account across the cryptocurrency network. “The Bybit Hacker is making 2-3 transactions per minute, and stops every 45 minutes for a 15 minute break. They move ETH from one address at a time, before moving onto the next one,” the blockchain data tracking platform said. On-chain sleuths continue to track the Bybit hacker’s transactions. Source: Arkham Intelligence . Bybit built the Lazarus bounty platform in two days due to the urgency of the situation. Ben Zhou, Bybit’s CEO, mentioned on X that a newer version of the site will be released soon as it makes more improvements to make the site look and function better. He also stated his openness to suggestions and feedback. We only pre entered some of your findings , which might not be full, if you have more, please help to submit a bounty on the site, or send to me through dm, really appreciate your help all the way. We want to give you the full credits for your hard work. The site was built in 2… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 25, 2025 The Lazarus bounty platform serves as a centralized hub for cybersecurity experts, blockchain analysts, and ethical hackers to collaborate on a global scale. Each of these individuals can come together through the platform to track and recover the stolen assets. There’s also the attractive 10% incentive that would make anyone willing to help. 10% of the stolen $1.4B would amount to a whopping $140M, the largest bounty in the history of cryptocurrency. The 10% is split 50:50 between individuals that successfully freeze the stolen funds and those who contribute by helping trace the funds. Individuals can become bounty hunters by connecting their wallets on the site and helping to trace the fund. When a submitted trace leads to some of the funds being frozen the 5% bounty is paid upfront. Bybit also introduced a blacklisted wallet API that provides a continuously updated list of wallet addresses identified as suspicious or associated with the hack, enabling security pros and other cryptocurrency platforms to monitor and or prevent transactions involving these addresses. The aftermath of the Bybit heist On February 21, 2025, Bybit experienced a security breach during a routine transfer from its cold wallet to a warm wallet. Hackers exploited this process, seizing control of the cold wallet and siphoning 401K ETH, valued at around $1.5B, to an unknown address. This incident is now recognized as the largest cryptocurrency heist in history. Despite the significant loss, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, reassured the platform’s users of the company’s solvency. He stated that all client assets remained backed 1:1 and that wallets unaffected by the security breach and withdrawals from the platform would continue to operate normally. Bybit is actively collaborating with blockchain forensic analysts to trace the stolen funds, and so far, the exchange has been successful in recovering some of the lost funds. The mETH, Mantle, and SEAL teams successfully recovered 15K cmETH tokens worth around $43M. First recovery in the ByBit hack. ~$43m (15,000 cmETH) has been clawed back from the hacker. I saw the recovery possibility soon after the hack and SEAL connected me with Mantle/mETH team who made it happen. Huge shoutout to SEAL, Mantle, and mETH teams for their quick action. — Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) February 22, 2025 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that his company froze 181K USDT connected to the hack as well. Bybit has also introduced a bounty program to aid the recovery of the stolen funds. The exchange is offering up to 10% of the recovered amount to ethical hackers who assist in the retrieval of the stolen cryptocurrency. Security professionals monitoring the situation have received thousands of tips about the hack and the hacker’s efforts to split up the loot. Bybit is also working with law enforcement agencies in Singapore and is in discussions with the Ethereum Foundation about potential solutions. Several cybersecurity firms and blockchain security teams such as Mandiant, Verichain ZeroShadow, and Chainalysis, to name a few, joined in the effort to trace bad actors and prevent the hackers from laundering the funds. Crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Bitget, along with blockchain networks including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and AVAX, are working to restrict the movement of the stolen assets. To prevent future security vulnerabilities and incidents, Bybit has committed to a comprehensive review and enhancement of its security infrastructure. This review entails implementing advanced authentication measures, conducting regular security audits, and educating its users on best practices to safeguard their assets.

Upbit Sanctions Under Fire The FIU’s ruling was a response to revelations that Upbit “supported a total of 44,948 virtual asset transfer transactions” with “19 unreported, overseas-based virtual asset business operators.” Per Seoul Daily and Newsway , the FIU’s order means that new Upbit customers will not be able to transfer or receive crypto in their wallets for the entire three-month period. The FIU will also follow up with fines, which will be finalized at a later date. Dunamu CEO Lee Seok-woo was also hit with a disciplinary warning, while the firm’s compliance and transaction reporting chiefs were forced to step down.

(Source: CoinGecko) Another eight employees were also hit with “disciplinary action.” But several unnamed crypto industry figures claimed that the move would only help Upbit to boost its profit margins and “cement its position as a monopoly .” The critics claimed that the sanctions would be “ineffective” as they only block new customers from transferring their crypto to third-party wallets or other exchanges. @Official_Upbit faces billions in fines for over 700,000 KYC violations as South Korea tightens its crypto regulations. #Upbit #FSC https://t.co/SZzYlT4ted — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Could Sanctions Backfire? The measures do not stop Upbit from accepting new users, nor does it restrict their activities, provided they only buy or sell tokens on the Upbit platform. The sanctions also allow new Upbit users to make fiat KRW transactions, meaning that customers “can withdraw KRW and use it on another exchange.” As such, they added, “given that Upbit has over 70% of the domestic market share,” the sanctions “are unlikely to cause customers” to ditch their Upbit accounts in favor of a rival platform. The experts added that as most crypto exchange users value “convenience” above all, “customers who trade virtual assets are significantly less likely” to go through the hassle of moving their coins off the Upbit platform. As such, they continued, the sanctions would likely end up benefiting Upbit, rather than harming it. The experts said the measures would end up becoming “a means to prevent Upbit users from leaving the platform, rather than a sanction.” The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). (Source: News Tomato/YouTube/Screenshot) Fines to Follow The sanctions are also unlikely to hit Upbit in the pocket, the critics added. They explained that forcing new customers to stay on the Upbit platform would help the exchange continue making money from commission fees. And the critics said that the restrictions could also create artificial coin price discrepancies on domestic platforms. They called for “symbolic fines” rather than “ineffective sanctions or disciplinary actions.” One of the unnamed insiders said: “Restricting transfers will only strengthen Upbit’s position as a monopoly. In the end, questions will likely be asked about the FIU’s sanctions.” However, the FIU could well follow up with heavy fines. A spokesperson for the regulator explained that the FIU had not yet reached a “final decision” on fines. The regulator said that it would make an announcement on fines after “future disciplinary hearing discussions.” In South Korea, self-service kiosks have been proliferating.

Since breaking its all-time high in January, SOL has retraced over 55%, leaving bulls struggling to regain momentum. The broader crypto market is facing a period of uncertainty, and Solana has been one of the hardest-hit altcoins in recent weeks. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation Bears have remained in control, consistently driving prices lower as investors lose confidence. The once-thriving meme coin speculation that fueled Solana’s rally has now turned into a major headwind, accelerating the selloff and preventing a stable recovery. Analysts believe further declines could be on the horizon, especially if SOL fails to reclaim key support levels. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, noting that Solana has broken below a crucial demand level, signaling increased risk of additional downside. According to Jelle, SOL’s current price structure suggests that bears still have control, and unless a strong bounce occurs soon, lower price targets could come into play. With market sentiment at extreme lows, all eyes are on Solana to see if it can stabilize or if further declines are inevitable. Solana As Market Turns Bearish Solana is trading below critical demand levels that previously sustained its long-term bullish structure. Bulls have lost control, and bears continue to dominate, pushing the entire market lower. Since reaching all-time highs in January, SOL has dropped over 55%, erasing months of gains and signaling extreme fear among investors. As selling pressure intensifies, Solana has become one of the hardest-hit altcoins, with meme coins suffering the most. The speculative frenzy that once fueled Solana’s surge has now turned into a major risk, with rug pulls and liquidity issues shaking investor confidence. Jelle’s analysis on X reveals that when he sold his SOL bags, he didn’t expect the price to drop this hard. He also notes that Solana has lost both monthly and weekly support levels, which could indicate further declines. The breakdown below these key demand zones has intensified bearish sentiment, making a recovery more difficult in the short term. The upcoming week will be crucial for Solana’s price action, as the market leans increasingly bearish. If SOL fails to reclaim lost support, it could face another wave of selling pressure, potentially pushing it into lower demand zones around the $140 mark. However, if bulls manage to regain control and push the price back above $185, it could trigger a short-term relief rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Serious Price Compression – What Happened Last Time With the broader market struggling and uncertainty rising, Solana’s next move will determine whether it can stabilize or continue its downward trajectory. Investors remain cautious as fear dominates sentiment, but some still believe in a potential recovery if market conditions improve. The coming days will be crucial in deciding Solana’s fate in this volatile market. Price Struggles To Hold $140 Solana is trading at $139 after a brutal selloff that saw the price drop over 22% since Sunday. The entire crypto market has been hit with extreme selling pressure, but SOL continues to struggle more than other altcoins. Bearish momentum remains strong, and bulls are finding it difficult to establish a clear support zone. If Solana can hold above the $140 mark, there is a chance of a short-term recovery. Bulls must step in and push the price above $150 to signal strength and prevent further downside. However, current sentiment remains weak, and any failure to reclaim lost levels could lead to further declines. If SOL loses $140, the next significant demand zone sits around the $125–$130 range. Breaking below this level would confirm a deeper correction, potentially pushing SOL into its lowest price since August 2024. Investors are growing cautious as market volatility increases, and Solana’s price action remains uncertain.

40838549,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=682672,1740527178,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40838549.jpeg,Elon Musk’s Europe meddling affects Tesla’s market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-europe-meddling-affects-teslas-market/,"Tesla’s sales in Europe collapsed by 45% in January, even as demand for electric vehicles surged across the continent, according to a report from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. The Elon Musk-led company registered just 9,945 cars last month, down from 18,161 a year ago. The Association pointed out that Musk’s political involvement is becoming a problem for Tesla in Europe. Polls in Germany and the UK show that his support for far-right parties and attacks on political leaders are turning buyers away. Unlike the US, where Tesla’s brand is deeply tied to Musk’s influence, European consumers are less forgiving of his shenanigans. Though the sales slump isn’t just about politics. Tesla is revamping its Model Y production lines, which has led to inventory shortages in certain markets. That alone could explain part of the decline in registrations, but it doesn’t account for the fact that rival EV makers are thriving in the same conditions, said the Association. Tesla stock crashes after post-election surge fades Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock also plunged over 8% on Tuesday, wiping billions off its market value and dragging it below the $1 trillion mark, according to data from Google Finance. Tesla has now lost 25% of its value since the beginning of the year, making it one of the worst performers among major tech stocks. Clearly, investors aren’t buying Tesla’s rebound story anymore. After a brief rally following Donald Trump’s election victory, Tesla’s stock has erased all gains. The shares have plummeted 35% since December 16, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5% in the same period. Musk’s personal wealth has taken a hit as well. His net worth has plunged by more than $100 billion, though he still holds the title of world’s richest person, with $380 billion to his name. Tesla’s China ambitions hit a wall TSLA’s latest slide was triggered by a Reuters report on Monday, which revealed that Tesla’s long-awaited “navigate on city streets” feature in China was a disappointment. Owners who tested the partially automated driving update found that it failed to meet Musk’s promises. The backlash piled onto Tesla’s growing list of challenges in China, where it is already struggling to keep up with local competitors. Musk’s battle to expand Tesla’s self-driving technology in China is at a standstill too, as the company has been unable to secure regulatory approval due to escalating trade tensions between China and the US. According to Musk, Chinese authorities won’t allow Tesla to move its training data out of the country, while the US has banned Tesla from processing that data inside China. That standoff has frozen Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) expansion in China, making it a bargaining chip in trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington. Tesla’s reliance on China is now a liability. China was once Tesla’s fastest-growing and most profitable foreign market, but now it’s slipping away. BYD has overtaken Tesla with a 35% market share in China, while Tesla’s share has shrunk to just 7%. The company’s Shanghai gigafactory, once seen as a breakthrough, has now helped Chinese competitors scale faster than Tesla expected. Tesla recalls over 376,000 vehicles over power steering failures As if falling sales and stock crashes weren’t enough, Tesla is now dealing with a massive recall in the US. The company is recalling 376,241 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built between February 28, 2023, and October 11, 2023, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The recall is reportedly due to a critical flaw in Tesla’s power-assisted steering system. Tesla told regulators that printed circuit boards in affected vehicles can become overstressed, which can cause power steering to fail when a car stops and then accelerates again. The issue forces drivers to use extra force to steer, increasing the risk of accidents. Tesla claims there are no known crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the defect and says an over-the-air software update will fix it. But all in all, Tesla’s long-running battle with US regulators has taken a turn, thanks to Musk’s new role in the Trump administration. Trump recently appointed Musk to lead a team focused on shrinking the federal government workforce, which has already led to major cuts at the NHTSA—the very agency investigating Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) systems, a connection that Democratic critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren were quick to point out.

While cryptocurrencies like XRP and Dogecoin have transformed global payments and popularized online tipping, they fall short of addressing the escalating issue of chargeback fraud faced by e-commerce sellers. XRP excels in rapid, cost-effective transactions, and Dogecoin captivates with its community-driven approach. However, these platforms do not directly tackle the persistent headache of chargeback fraud. Enter Web3Bay with its innovative blockchain-based smart contract escrow system that secures payments until all transaction conditions are fulfilled, essentially nipping disputes in the bud. As digital currencies become more mainstream, Web3Bay is staking its claim as the go-to solution for secure, dispute-free transactions in the e-commerce space. Web3Bay’s Solution to Chargeback Fraud Chargeback fraud has been a thorn in the side of online merchants for too long, with traditional platforms like PayPal and Amazon often siding with buyers, resulting in sellers losing both product and payment. Web3Bay steps up with a blockchain-based smart contract escrow system that ensures transactions are final, secure, and free from disputes. Specifically, Web3Bay uses smart contracts to hold buyer payments until predetermined conditions are satisfied. Once a seller ships a product and the buyer confirms receipt, the funds are automatically released. If a dispute does arise, the blockchain ledger’s transparent, tamper-proof records provide a reliable defense against fraudulent claims. Unlike centralized platforms where buyers often have the upper hand in disputes, Web3Bay’s decentralized setup promotes fair resolutions based on indisputable data. With $1.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 375 million coins sold at $0.00456 each, Web3Bay is demonstrating robust market confidence. As traditional e-commerce platforms grapple with fraud prevention, Web3Bay’s blockchain-powered strategy offers a dependable alternative for online sellers. XRP: A Journey Through Technological Advancements Launched by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP was designed to facilitate quick, inexpensive international payments. Rather than relying on a traditional proof-of-work system, it uses a consensus protocol among a network of validators to verify transactions swiftly. As of February 19, 2025, XRP trades at $2.61, marking a dramatic increase from $0.5624 just a year ago—a whopping 364% jump. This surge has propelled XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now estimated at around $143 billion. Moreover, early investors have seen substantial gains, especially following positive regulatory developments and growing financial sector adoption. The recent nod towards an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has further enhanced investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin: The Ascent from Meme to Marketable Asset Initiated in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a humorous project inspired by the “Doge” meme, Dogecoin has since evolved into a legitimate decentralized network that supports mining and transactions using a proof-of-work mechanism. As of February 19, 2025, Dogecoin’s price stands at $0.254001, up from $0.0894 the previous year, recording an impressive 184% increase. This growth has significantly boosted its market capitalization, reflecting its expanding acceptance and utilization in a variety of transactions. Early adopters have enjoyed robust returns as Dogecoin shifted from an internet gag to a widely recognized digital currency, buoyed by endorsements from high-profile figures and its integration across multiple platforms, adding to its popularity and value appreciation. Concluding Thoughts While XRP has carved a niche in facilitating speedy international payments and Dogecoin has built momentum through its vibrant community and widespread adoption, the challenge of chargeback fraud remains a significant concern for online sellers. Web3Bay differentiates itself with a blockchain-based escrow system that ensures definitive, transparent transactions. By eradicating fraudulent chargebacks and providing undeniable payment security, Web3Bay emerges as a compelling choice for e-commerce, offering the protection that sellers desperately need.

Ripple (XRP), and RCO Finance are the two altcoin giants that are being weighed by investors to determine the most bullish voice for long-term investment. RCO Finance checks all the marks with its distinct strengths and lasting contributions to the AI investment space. With so much to offer in terms of access to over 120,000 assets, an AI Robo Advisor, and much more, analysts believe that this project could outrun XRP this year. Here’s why RCO Finance could champion the race for the most bullish altcoin. Analysts Says XRP Gears Up For A Massive Move Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared an updated prediction for the trajectory of the XRP price. The analysts shared that due to the increased whale activity on the platform, there was an accumulation of over 20 million XRP within 24 hours. This whale movement hints at a possible rally for the XRP price given the increased investor interest. In response to the increased accumulation of XRP, Ali shared that XRP was prepared for a 14% price move . Additionally, the Ripple team recently shared that 25% of XRP would be held back to reduce circulation and boost its value. All these developments have positioned XRP as a key contender in the space following its bullish trajectory. However, RCOF steals the show because XRP’s bullish outlook hasn’t been reflected in its price due to its drop of over 7.3% within the last seven days. Why RCO Finance Emerges As A Top Choice For AI-Savvy Investors RCO Finance is an innovative AI platform designed to give investors access to top-notch investment strategies to boost their chances in the competitive forex market. This DeFi project utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to simplify and enhance the trading and investment process; hence, experts say it could beat projects like XRP in this coming bull cycle. In contrast to traditional trading platforms, RCO Finance offers features like access to over 120,000 assets in over 12,500 asset classes, an AI Robo Advisor, a No KYC model, and much more. Through these features, RCO Finance offers no third-party interference and a completely automated and no-code solution. These features enable investors of different financial backgrounds to leverage advanced tools to enhance their investments. For those who want to build a strong and diversified portfolio, you can leverage RCO Finance’s vast range of assets in over 12,500 asset classes. These instruments include bonds, crypto, stocks, and tokenized real-world assets like commodities and real estate. This variety of assets gives you the opportunity to diversify your portfolio and maximize your returns. Moreover, RCO Finance offers 1000x leverage where you can maximize your returns with little capital. So, with this leverage, you can amplify your investments across decentralized and traditional financial markets. However, the star of the RCO Finance platform is the AI Robo Advisor, which uses advanced AI/ML instruments to deliver personalized investment strategies. This Robo Advisor meets the needs of investors of different categories, matching their financial objectives, risk tolerance, and market options, With the Robo Advisor, you are always one step ahead because you have access to exclusive forecasts and prediction of market trends. This Robo Advisor helps traders to accurately predict market shifts and booms. For instance, after the long awaited launch of the Pi Network (PI) mainnet, token faces a price slump dropping to a low of about $0.62 . This price slump could deter many investors from leveraging the project however, analysts predict a surge of over 230% for the project in the next three months. If you’re considering getting PI as a new investor and don’t know if it’s a good choice, the Robo Advisor can give you accurate predictions and analysis of the project’s future performance.

Her move comes in the wake of some Ethereum community members’ criticism of her leadership and sustained criticism of the Foundation. In the blog post , Miyaguchi wrote: This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly. Aya Mayaguchi She added that she is deeply grateful and enthusiastic about what’s ahead. Miyaguchi decided to run for President one year ago. However, recent events allowed her to gain clarity of mind after deeply reflecting on what matters to her. Miyaguchi reflected on recent weeks, noting that they had revealed something profound about Ethereum. She observed that moments of tension—when discussions arise about the network’s performance or market dynamics—often bring the deepest truths to light. What inspires her most, she said, is how people across the world talk about Ethereum as if it were their own. She emphasized that Ethereum belongs to everyone precisely because it belongs to no one. Ethereum Foundation is not looking to control the digital asset, but to improve its value In her blog, the incoming President reaffirmed the Ethereum Foundation’s dedication to reinforcing the resilience of the Ethereum ecosystem. She emphasized the importance of maintaining balance across various layers of its development. She stressed that Ethereum must navigate all layers to ensure its long-term relevance rather than exist solely within the fast-paced world of innovation or the slower-moving realm of societal and cultural evolution. Today, I’m excited to turn the page and share that I will be closing this chapter as Executive Director of the @ethereumfndn soon and stepping into a new role as its President. Let’s continue building in the garden. Read my full statement : https://t.co/sn3Rpsatqy https://t.co/4Gz3WdLPLD — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) February 25, 2025 We do not control Ethereum; we protect its ethos while connecting an alive ecosystem of people, ideas, and values. The Foundation does not think of itself as an owner but rather a steward, actively seeking to correct imbalances while resisting the movement towards centralization. A crucial part of this approach is the Ethereum Foundation’s “subtraction” philosophy, which is often confused with mere minimalism. Rather, as the foundation points out, it is an underlying design principle of reducing the imbalances and ensuring that no single party can overpower the direction of Ethereum’s course. Focusing on credible neutrality and justified decentralization can help ensure that Ethereum remains a public good over the long term rather than a product and any organization associated with it in the short term. Ethereum co-founder is all praises for Miyaguchi’s role in the Foundation Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin took to X to commend Aya Miyaguchi for her impactful seven-year tenure as executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. He emphasized that an executive director’s role is to create an environment where others can thrive, attributing the foundation’s successes—including seamless Ethereum hard forks, client interoperability workshops, Devcon, and the network’s strong culture and mission-driven focus—to her leadership. Buterin also revealed that the Ethereum Foundation is restructuring its leadership. Amid these changes, many in the community advocate for former EF researcher Danny Ryan—who was instrumental in Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake—to take on the lead director role. The Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism from the community, particularly for its lack of transparency and complex organizational structure. In response, Vitalik Buterin has taken steps to make the foundation more engaged. For example, following concerns that EF primarily interacts on-chain only when selling ETH to fund operations, the foundation deployed 50,000 ETH (valued at approximately $80 million) on Aave, Compound, and Spark. Aya Miyaguchi, in particular, faced backlash from both the Ethereum community and some EF insiders after an interview surfaced in which she appeared to dismiss a “culture of competing and winning.” Additionally, critics argue that she has not moved quickly enough on Ethereum’s scaling solutions. Addressing the controversy, Buterin emphasized that he alone has the authority to decide who leads the Ethereum Foundation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

With 499,096 BTC sitting on its balance sheet—worth about $44 billion—many are asking one question: Will Strategy be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin? At press time, Bitcoin has slipped far below Strategy’s average purchase price of $66,350 per BTC, meaning the company is now staring at billions in unrealized losses. If the downturn continues, it’d put Strategy’s entire financial structure at risk. This is the first real test of Strategy’s model since it became a Bitcoin-first company in 2020. How much trouble is Strategy really in? Strategy has built its entire business model around Bitcoin accumulation, funding purchases with a mix of debt and equity raises. The company holds $8.2 billion in debt, against its $44 billion Bitcoin holdings—a leverage ratio of about 19%. Most of this debt is tied up in convertible notes, financial instruments that allow creditors to convert their loans into $MSTR shares if the stock trades above a certain price. Just about the only way a “forced liquidation” occurs if there is a “fundamental change” at the company. Asked about the risks of forced selling, Saylor dismissed the idea outright. “Even if Bitcoin went to $1, we would not be liquidated,” he said. “We would just buy all of the Bitcoin.” That might sound confident, but according to data from EpochVC, a forced liquidation could happen under one key condition: a “fundamental change” in the company’s structure, which would need a stockholder vote or a corporate bankruptcy. Per its own bylaws, both of these options will likely force Strategy to sell off its Bitcoin reserves. While bankruptcy might seem unlikely, Strategy’s biggest risk is in 2027 and beyond when the first batch of convertible notes matures. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Tuesday that if Bitcoin prices crash by 50% more and remains consolidated, creditors could refuse to roll over debt, leaving Strategy scrambling for cash. Saylor holds 46.8% of the voting power, which gives him a ton of control over any liquidation decisions. In spite of Saylor, shareholders now face a choice. Do they keep betting on Michael’s vision, doubling down on $MSTR despite its losses? Or do they walk away, forcing the company into a financial corner? At press time, Bitcoin was worth $88,756, according to data from CoinGecko. Saylor has been urging the US government to stockpile Bitcoin, arguing that owning 4 to 6 million BTC could “pay off the entire national debt.” Speaking at the annual CPAC conference, Saylor said the US could acquire 20% of Bitcoin’s supply “for free” and that doing so would strengthen the US dollar. He warned that other nations might act first, stating: “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the network. You wouldn’t want the Saudis buying it first, or the Russians, or the Chinese, or the Europeans.” States push for Bitcoin reserves, Trump already exploring federal option Saylor’s comments come as several US states move closer to mandating their own Bitcoin reserves. Most recently, Utah’s Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee gave a favorable recommendation to a bill that would require the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserves. At the federal level, Donald Trump last month signed an executive order creating a working group to explore the idea of a US Bitcoin reserve. Saylor claimed that if the federal government wanted to, it could rapidly accumulate 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, with his comment about buying it “for free” seemingly referencing the US Treasury’s ability to print dollars indefinitely. The US already holds Bitcoin, but far less than Saylor proposes Right now, the US government owns around 183,422 BTC—just under 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. By comparison, the British government holds 61,245 BTC, while Germany liquidated roughly $2.8 billion in BTC last year. Saylor has pushed this strategy before. In December, he presented a similar Bitcoin reserve plan to Microsoft’s board of directors, claiming the tech giant could generate $5 trillion in shareholder value by 2034 if it started accumulating BTC. So far, neither Microsoft nor any other major tech company has taken his advice. Not everyone agrees with Saylor’s vision. MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab founder Christian Catalini argued in a blog post this week that Bitcoin does not meet the criteria for a reserve asset. “Strategic reserves are meant to ensure stability and provide immediate access during a crisis,” Catalini wrote. “Countries store dollars or oil because they need them to repay debts, settle cross-border obligations, and keep essential systems running when supply chains falter.” He also suggested that buying Bitcoin on a massive scale could weaken the dollar’s global dominance. “If the US began amassing Bitcoin, it might be seen as a hedge against the dollar itself—raising alarms and giving rivals like China or Russia an opening to claim that the US no longer trusts its own currency,” he warned. While some lawmakers are pushing the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, skepticism remains about whether the US government will ever take action on Saylor’s plan.

Bitcoin Market Delivered Shock As Price Plummets 7% In Past Day Bitcoin had already been following a bearish trajectory during this month, but it appears the asset’s decline has seen an acceleration in the last 24 hours as its price has dropped by more than 7%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Once Again Arrives At This Bear-Bull Boundary—Will A Break Happen? Below is a chart that shows how the coin’s crash has looked: From the graph, it’s visible that BTC briefly dipped under the $87,000 mark during the plummet, but it would appear it has since found a small rebound back to $89,000. Bitcoin hasn’t been alone in this bearish price action, as the rest of the digital asset sector has taken a dive inside this window as well. Most of the altcoins have also in fact printed worse returns than BTC. Severe liquidations have occurred over at the derivatives side of the sector as a result of this sector-wide drawdown, according to data from CoinGlass. In total, liquidations have reached a whopping $1.5 billion in the last 24 hours. Naturally, a consequence of the crash was that BTC’s profit-loss distribution saw a notable change. More Than 12% Of BTC Addresses Are Now Underwater In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the latest trend in its Historical In/Out of the Money indicator. This metric basically tells us about the percentage breakdown of BTC addresses between profit, loss, and break-even. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each address on the network to see what average price it received its coins at. If this cost basis is greater than the current price, then the metric puts the address into the loss category, which the analytics firm terms as ‘out of the money.’ Similarly, holders of the opposite type fall into the profit category, or ‘in the money.’ The addresses that have an average acquisition price equal to the BTC spot value can be assumed to be just breaking even on their investment, or ‘at the money.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Experts Warn Of 6-Month Slump To $73,000 Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by IntoTheBlock, which specifically shows the trend in the Out of the Money portion of the Bitcoin userbase: As displayed in the above graph, the metric has gone up alongside the latest crash in the BTC price, as a large amount of addresses have entered into a state of loss. In total, over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s holders are underwater now, which is the highest level since October of last year.

The exchange had previously suffered a major security breach, resulting in a loss of ETH-based tokens. Mirana Ventures, linked to Bybit’s co-founders, took action by acquiring and transferring Ethereum. Bybit Hack: $600M ETH Restored To Cover Losses In the latest Bybit hack update, the top crypto exchange has received $600 million in ETH deposits from Mirana Ventures. This development follows a major security breach in which Bybit lost approximately $1.5 billion in ETH-based assets. The deposits aim to mitigate the financial impact of the hack and restore the exchange’s holdings. According to Arkham Intelligence , Mirana Ventures acquired this ETH by liquidating $500 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $100 million in Tether (USDT). These transactions were executed through FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and Wintermute OTC. The capital injection has helped stabilize Bybit’s ETH reserves after the significant loss. Bybit had previously secured a bridge loan to ensure customer asset protection and enable withdrawals. Following the deposits from Mirana Ventures, the pace of withdrawals has slowed, indicating that the exchange’s liquidity concerns are being addressed. Mirana Ventures Facilitates ETH Injection Post-Hack Mirana Ventures played a key role in replenishing Bybit’s lost ETH reserves. The firm, whose anchor capital providers include Bybit’s co-founders, executed the transactions to help cover the shortfall caused by the hack. The Ethereum acquisition and transfer occurred over three days, making Mirana Ventures the largest ETH depositor since the incident. The funds were sourced by selling BTC and USDT holdings through multiple over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms. These transactions allowed Mirana Ventures to accumulate Ethereum and deposit it into Bybit’s reserves. The involvement of major OTC firms ensured that the asset transfer was executed without significant market disruption. The deposits from Mirana Ventures have strengthened Bybit’s financial position following the hack. While the exchange has yet to recover from the $1.5 billion loss fully, the Ethereum injection has helped stabilize operations. Role of North Korean Lazarus Group Investigations into the Bybit hack have pointed to the North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group as the perpetrators . The group has been linked to multiple high-profile cryptocurrency thefts and is known for targeting exchanges and financial institutions. Hackers targeted Bybit with advanced malware, breaching its security and moving stolen ETH to multiple addresses, complicating recovery efforts. Authorities and cybersecurity firms continue to monitor the movement of the stolen funds. Bybit’s Response and Future Measures Following the hack, Bybit implemented immediate measures to address security vulnerabilities and secure user funds. The exchange secured a bridge loan to facilitate withdrawals and maintain customer trust. With the recent ETH deposits from Mirana Ventures, Bybit has managed to reduce its shortfall, restoring part of its lost reserves. The exchange has also reassured users that withdrawal demands have slowed, indicating improved confidence in its stability. Moreso, after the Bybit hack, the top crypto exchange recovered nearly $700 million worth of Ethereum within 48 hours through OTC deals and institutional loans. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou assured users that the exchange has fully restored its 1:1 client asset backing, reaffirming confidence in its security measures. The platform has now resumed normal operations, mitigating the impact of the security breach.

Analysts have spotlighted three standout projects: Remittix (RTX), Lightchain AI (LCAI), and Web3Bay (3BAY) . Each brings unique innovations to the blockchain space—Remittix with its seamless crypto-fiat payment integration, Lightchain AI with its fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain, and Web3Bay revolutionizing e-commerce through decentralization. While all three projects have garnered significant attention, Web3Bay stands out with its explosive presale performance, raising over $1.5 million and attracting massive whale accumulation. This surge in investor interest is fueling FOMO as early participants aim to lock in potential 4,200% gains before the next presale price hike. With whales acquiring millions of tokens and retail demand skyrocketing, Web3Bay is quickly becoming the best presale opportunity of February. Web3Bay Presale Dominates February Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape with its decentralized marketplace, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This model not only reduces transaction costs but also enhances privacy, transparency, and user autonomy. At its core, Web3Bay aims to disrupt the $6 trillion global e-commerce industry, offering buyers and sellers a platform that eliminates the traditional barriers of centralized marketplaces. Investor confidence in Web3Bay is soaring, with its presale already raising over $1.5 million and selling more than 375 million 3BAY tokens. What’s driving this momentum is the significant whale accumulation, where large investors are purchasing millions of tokens in bulk. This whale activity has triggered a wave of FOMO among retail investors, with many rushing to secure tokens before prices climb. The current presale price of $0.004562 is set to increase in upcoming stages, with early investors positioned to reap up to 4,200% ROI at launch. Web3Bay’s ecosystem offers practical benefits beyond token appreciation. Holders of the 3BAY token gain transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. Users can save up to 5% on marketplace purchases, stake tokens to earn passive income, and vote on key platform decisions. This community-driven approach ensures that users aren’t just participants—they actively shape Web3Bay’s evolution. Analysts agree that its real-world utility, massive presale success, and strong investor backing make it the top presale to buy in February. As whales continue to accumulate and presale stages sell out rapidly, those waiting on the sidelines risk missing out on one of 2025’s most promising opportunities. Remittix Transforms Global Payments with Crypto-Fiat Integration While Web3Bay revolutionizes e-commerce, Remittix (RTX) is tackling inefficiencies in cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers are often slow, costly, and riddled with foreign exchange fees. Remittix solves these issues by seamlessly integrating digital and fiat currencies, allowing users to send money abroad with instant conversions and minimal costs. The RTX token is central to the platform’s ecosystem, granting users access to payment solutions and staking opportunities. Holders can stake their tokens for annual returns between 4% and 8%, providing both utility and passive income potential. Businesses benefit from the RTX Pay API, enabling crypto payments with direct fiat settlements across 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. Security remains a top priority for Remittix. The platform employs advanced encryption and fraud prevention measures, ensuring safe transactions while eliminating the possibility of chargebacks. Compared to traditional payment services, which often charge between 5% to 10% in fees, Remittix offers a flat 1% rate, making it a compelling alternative for individuals and businesses alike. Lightchain AI Leads the Future of Blockchain with Advanced Technology Lightchain AI (LCAI) is pioneering the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, aiming to build a secure, scalable network that meets the demands of modern applications. By integrating AI into its protocol, Lightchain AI enhances automation, security, and efficiency across various industries. Its decentralized governance model allows token holders to influence the platform’s development, ensuring that community voices are central to future upgrades. The LCAI token grants access to the network’s features, enabling developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). These smart contracts leverage AI to optimize processes such as supply chain management, financial services, and predictive analytics. As businesses seek ways to harness both AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI’s technology positions it as a leader in this emerging sector. Lightchain AI’s presale has drawn significant attention, with investors eyeing the platform’s potential for long-term growth. The project’s emphasis on continuous upgrades and community involvement has made it particularly appealing to developers and enterprises seeking innovative solutions. Analysts believe that as adoption grows, LCAI’s market presence will strengthen, offering both immediate and future value for token holders. Web3Bay Takes the Crown Among February’s Top Presales February 2025 presents several exciting presale opportunities, with Remittix, Lightchain AI, and Web3Bay leading the charge. Remittix’s solution for cross-border payments and Lightchain AI’s AI-blockchain integration offer compelling use cases with solid growth potential. However, Web3Bay’s explosive presale momentum, whale accumulation, and real-world application in the e-commerce sector make it the best investment choice this month. With over $1.5 million raised, whales purchasing millions of tokens, and a projected 4,200% ROI, Web3Bay isn’t just another presale—it’s a chance to invest in a platform set to revolutionize online shopping. As presale stages close and demand continues to rise, the window to buy at discounted prices is narrowing. Act now, secure your 3BAY tokens, and position yourself for extraordinary gains in 2025 and beyond.

The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act bill was sponsored by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and three other Democrats. Durbin, who has a record as a staunch opponent of cryptocurrency, introduced the bill on the Senate floor on Feb. 25. “Mr. President, it is past time we placed some common-sense guardrails on the largely unregulated industry,” he said . The bill gives ATM operators greater liability Durbin ran through the main provisions of the bill while introducing it. No text of the bill is available at the time of writing. In general, it provides greater customer protection against scams and broadens the responsibilities of ATM operators for scam prevention. Specifically, crypto ATM operators would be required to warn customers about scams and take other reasonable measures to prevent fraud at their machines. It also would require them to use analytics to detect fraud. Durbin noted that some crypto ATM operators already do that. Durbin recounted how the elderly and newcomers to crypto are often the victims of scams involving ATMs. Several of the bill’s provisions are aimed at protecting these segments of the population. New customers would have a two-week window when they are limited to $2,000 a day in deposits and a $10,000 total. For new customers’ transactions over $500, the crypto ATM operator will be required to confirm the transaction with a live telephone call. The phone call is intended to confound scammers, who often keep their victims on the phone through the entire fraudulent transaction. All customers would be eligible for a full refund for a fraudulent transaction if they inform the police within 30 days. All crypto ATMs would be required to provide a paper receipt for transactions with information useful to law enforcement. Crypto ATM fraud is on many radars Durbin and six other Democratic senators sent a letter to the ten leading crypto ATM providers in September asking about their efforts to combat fraud. There are over 31,000 crypto ATMs in the United States. Federal Trade Commission data show that fraud at crypto ATMs is increasing rapidly. Consumers lost $100 million in crypto ATM fraud in 2023 and $65 million in the first half of 2024. The median loss in 2024 was $10,000. People over 60 were three times more likely to fall victim to such scams. At least 15 states have proposed legislation to protect consumers from crypto ATM fraud. In New Jersey, a complete ban on crypto ATMs has been proposed. Legislation to combat fraud at crypto ATMs has been advanced in several states this year alone. They include Arizona , Rhode Island and Iowa . The attorney general of Pennsylvania issued a warning about crypto ATMs the same day Durbin introduced his bill. The attorney general of Delaware issued a similar warning in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a post on X, he claimed that other stablecoin issuers are trying to use lawfare to kill the USDT issuer instead of building a better product. According to Ardoino , USDT has been the most successful tool for establishing US dollar dominance in emerging markets, but that has only made it a bigger target for competitors instead of motivating them to improve their products. He said: “While our competitors’ business model should be to build a better product and even bigger distribution network, their real intent is “Kill Tether. Every single business or political meeting that they have culminates with this intent.” Although he did not name any particular competitor, he noted how several people have reported on stablecoin issuers lobbying with the US administration to enact regulations that might affect Tether. Stablecoin bill could cut offshore issuers from US Treasuries Interestingly, Ardoino comments were in reaction to a post by Hiframework CEO Vance Spencer , who alleged that the proposed stablecoin law contains requirements that will ban offshore centralized stablecoin issuers from accessing US Treasuries. Spencer wrote: “The soon-to-be revealed stablecoin markup apparently has requirements to shut off access to the treasury market to centralized international stablecoin issuers – which is straight up batshit crazy.” He described the move as an attempt at regulatory capture by some of the US-based stablecoin issuers based in the US. As for Ardoino, he has promised to fight against the attacks, saying that Tether will prevent competitors from using their quest for a monopoly to endanger the millions of millions of people who rely on USDT. The company will not be fighting that battle alone. Several others in the crypto sector also believe that protecting the stablecoin industry is necessary. Spencer stated that it is important for the industry to take a stand on the Stablecoin and Market Structure bills, just as it did when FTX promoted a toxic bill in 2021. Community debates effect of such move Meanwhile, many in the crypto community believe that any attempt to limit Tether access to US Treasuries is bad for the crypto industry and the US in general. Castle Island venture founder Nic Carter noted that the dollar system is largely offshore, and that is a good thing for the US, and any law that stops foreigners from holding US debt is bad for the international dollar system. He wrote: “The dollar system is already very much offshore. With treasuries there are trillions held offshore in every construct you can imagine. We want foreigners to hold our debt. The whole system is premised on it.” Spencer also observed that the demand for stablecoins is overseas, and the only way for the US dollar to be the future of stablecoins is for competitive offshore stablecoins to grow. He said: “Please tell me how limiting access to hundreds of billions of dollars of demand for treasuries helps us preserve dollar hegemony across the globe, or fix our debt problem.” Interestingly, Tether is the 18th biggest holder of the US Treasuries, with over $115 billion of its reserves in the US Treasury. As Ardoino noted, the stablecoin now has over 400 million users and grows at 35 million wallets per quarter. He stated that this shows the importance of strengthening the US dollar and spreading its use in developing countries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

After reaching an all-time high of $109,000 in January, Bitcoin has now seen a significant drop of 7%, bringing its current price to approximately $87,400. This decline raises concerns about the sustainability of the broader bull market as investor sentiment shifts towards fear. Could A Drop Below $80,000 Be Imminent? Market expert Jesse Olson recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to question whether Bitcoin is nearing a local top or possibly “the” top for this market cycle. Olson referenced historical data suggesting that previous pivot points for Bitcoin often signal significant downturns. He highlighted two notable instances: In April/May 2021, the Bitcoin price experienced a pivot point about 20% below its local top, leading to a price drop of 56%. In November 2021, the pivot was around 15% from “the” top, resulting in a staggering 77% decline. Currently, the price sits approximately 15% below the recent peak, and Olson notes a pending sell signal on BTC’s 3-day chart, indicating potential further downside. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation The expert also mentioned that while Bitcoin has hit Target 2 of 4 in his analysis, several indicators suggest the price could drop below $80,000, with higher time frames beginning to show bearish signals. Arthur Hayes Warns Of Bitcoin Downturn Adding to the bearish sentiment, market expert Arthur Hayes expressed concerns in a recent post on X, warning of a potential extension of Bitcoin’s downturn. Hayes highlighted that many holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, are hedge funds that have gone long on the ETF while simultaneously shorting Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures to earn a yield greater than short-term US treasuries. Should Bitcoin’s price continue to fall, Hayes suggests that these funds may unwind their positions, selling IBIT and buying back CME futures. This profit-taking strategy could lead to further declines in Bitcoin’s price, potentially pushing it down toward the $70,000 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? Despite the prevailing bearish outlook, analyst Doctor Profit presents a more optimistic perspective. He emphasizes that the production cost of Bitcoin is currently at $95,000, meaning the market price is below this critical threshold. Historically, prices trading below production costs have signaled prime buying opportunities for investors. Doctor Profit argues that this situation creates a compelling case for potential investors, as the market often sees price rebounds when production costs are higher than market prices.

On February 25, Bitcoin’s price fell approximately 4% to around $88,000, intensifying concerns about the sustainability of Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Market analysis firm The Kobeissi Letter highlighted that the company’s approach heavily relies on its capacity to raise additional capital backed by its expanding Bitcoin holdings. They cautioned, “In a situation where their liabilities rise significantly higher than their assets, this ability could deteriorate.” Analysts Maintain Optimism Despite the recent stock downturn, financial analysts remain optimistic about Strategy’s future. On February 6, Benchmark analysts raised the company’s price target to $650, expressing confidence in Strategy’s continued aggressive capital raising to support its Bitcoin acquisition plans throughout the year. This positive outlook is rooted in the company’s strategy to generate “Bitcoin yield,” focusing on the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares. Strategy aims for a Bitcoin yield of 15% in 2025, suggesting a robust financial performance linked to its cryptocurrency assets. Debt-Fueled Bitcoin Purchases Since 2020, Strategy has invested over $33 billion in Bitcoin, acquiring the cryptocurrency at an average cost of approximately $66,000 per coin. This aggressive acquisition strategy has been financed through a combination of stock issuance and approximately $9.5 billion in convertible debt. Notably, the majority of this debt does not mature until 2027 or later, reducing the immediate risk of a Bitcoin price downturn necessitating the liquidation of holdings. The Kobeissi Letter emphasized that for such a scenario to force liquidation, Bitcoin’s price would need to fall by more than 50% from current levels and remain depressed beyond 2027. Stock Performance and Market Outlook On February 25, Bitcoin’s price dipped below the $90,000 threshold for the first time since November 2024, coinciding with sell-offs in U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Consequently, Strategy’s shares dropped over 10% to approximately $245. This marks a significant decline from its all-time high of $473 in November, shortly after the company announced its ambitious goal to acquire $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2027. Other companies with similar Bitcoin treasury strategies, such as Semler Scientific, have also experienced comparable stock retracements, with Semler down more than 20% year-to-date. Despite these challenges, Benchmark analysts remain confident in Strategy’s ability to generate “Bitcoin yield,” viewing the BTC-per-share metric as a key indicator of the company’s financial health. This focus suggests that, while market volatility presents risks, Strategy’s long-term approach to integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury may offer substantial returns, provided the cryptocurrency’s value appreciates over time.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-26 01:46:22

The conversation , among leadership changes and community scrutiny, touched on the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Ethereum’s economic model, and long-term scaling strategies. In a Reddit comment, top EF researcher Justin Drake said that the first step of the two-phase Pectra update is expected to begin rolling out in the coming months. Notably, the update will double the number of “blob” transactions per block from three to six, which Drake said will “crush the blob fee market”. The foundation’s security team also opened a $2 million bug bounty competition to stress test the hard fork, which will run until March 24. Buterin defends economic strategy amid L2 and custody concerns As Layer 2 solutions are more widely used, EF researchers stressed the importance of the Ethereum base layer. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin hit back at concerns over the network’s economic positioning, repeating the case for taking a cut of revenue from the L2s and “native roll-ups.” He also warned of the dangers staking providers, wallets, and custody services could pose and urged interoperability standards to maintain Ethereum’s decentralization. “The goal is neutrality of Ethereum, not neutrality of the Ethereum Foundation — often, the two align, but sometimes they misalign, and when that happens, we should go for the former,” Buterin said in response to a question about a potential “corporate takeover” of Ethereum. Discussions also occurred on raising the base fee for blob transactions (EIP-7762). Although some community members welcome a rise in fees, EF researchers maintain that keeping costs low will spur higher uptake and economic growth. EF researcher Barnabé Monnot expressed concerns that such a change would require the network to determine an appropriate tax level, similar to fiscal policy. As the data layer continuously grows, this poses a scaling challenge for Ethereum. Drake and co-researcher Dankrad Feist took the rejection of the theory a step further, saying that EigenLayer’s so-called altDA solution does not put Ethereum’s revenues in danger. Instead, they believe there is room for various approaches to data availability—blobs, EigenDA, etc.—to coexist. Drake even speculated about Ethereum settling 10 million transactions per second within 10 years, producing $1 bn in daily revenue. The AMA also mentioned ongoing scaling strategy development for Ethereum, as the major Layer 2 solutions — Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and Scroll — are looking to integrate natively roll-up. EF’s Ansgar Dietrichs said the competitive roll-up landscape had spurred innovation in areas like zero-knowledge proofs and interoperability. With Ethereum development now more focused on detailed engineering and less on rapid experimentation, Buterin adds that he still sees light at the end of the tunnel for many of these technical questions. Ethereum Foundation faces leadership scrutiny as Miyaguchi transitions to new role AMA’s discussions come as Ethereum has faced mounting criticism that the network is losing ground to rival blockchains, such as Solana, and that Ethereum leadership has been ineffective and too hands-off in its support of builders. Calls for the Foundation to replace the executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, intensified in January, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at changes in the top positions for months. Still, Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that she is soon assuming a new role as president of the Switzerland-based nonprofit. Within the new role, Miyaguchi wrote that she will continue supporting the Ethereum Foundation’s “institutional partnerships.” Miyaguchi has served as executive director since 2018. In the blog post, Miyaguchi underscored the Foundation’s focus on credible neutrality, saying its “role has never been to control or own all domains in Ethereum” but rather promote values that align with decentralization. Under Miyaguchi’s leadership, Ethereum underwent significant transformations. In 2022, the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, reducing its carbon footprint by 99% through the so-called merger. Additionally, Ethereum adopted a layer-2-focused roadmap, leveraging scaling solutions to enhance its efficiency and expand its capabilities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic stablecoin that maintains a soft peg with the U.S. dollar via an automated delta-hedging strategy that shorts Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures to balance changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies. Ethena Labs’ latest move adds credibility to USDe’s reserves Ethena Labs has integrated Chaos Labs’ Edge Proof of Reserves Oracles to enhance the risk management framework for its synthetic dollar token, USDe. This consolidates the trust between the team and the community as Edge Proof oracles will independently verify the total dollar value of USDe’s reserves and the reserve coverage of USDe’s supply. The oracles also confirm that reserves are governance-approved and delta-neutral. Edge oracle proof of reserves. Source: Ethena Labs The Edge Proof of Reserves (PoR) oracles work by constantly monitoring the reserve levels of tokens which it compares to the collateral backing them. All of this happens smoothly by integrating off-chain data from custodians and centralized exchanges into the on-chain environment to ensure scalable and robust support for institutional-grade applications. The integration will also provide automated alerts to inform users of any data anomalies or if reserve levels fall below the required thresholds. All verified data can be accessed on Ethena’s transparency page and attestor interfaces, so stakeholders don’t have to worry about being out of the loop at any point in time. “This integration ensures continuous, independent verification of reserves, fostering greater transparency and security for all users. By leveraging real-time, tamper-resistant data, Ethena reinforces its commitment to a robust and reliable synthetic dollar,” Ethena Labs said in its announcement. Pairing up with Chaos Labs’ Edge oracle will also leverage the oracle provider’s reputation and capabilities. The oracles ensure security and privacy along with real-time and transparent data verification, including for reserves held off-chain or across different blockchains. They have secured over $70 billion in volume, providing risk management to decentralized finance (DeFi) giants like AAVE, Jupiter, GMX, and Tether. Ethena Labs executives praise Bybit’s disaster response Ethena Labs, and many other protocols in the crypto ecosystem collectively breathed a sigh of relief after it became apparent that the Bybit hack — now touted as the largest heist in crypto history — would not bring the exchange down to its knees. A graph showing the largest crypto thefts of all time. Source: Kobeissi Letter The CEO of Ethena Labs has since taken to X, formerly Twitter, to praise Bybit’s CEO for taking the bull by the horns and reacting quickly to mitigate damages. “Don’t think I’ve ever seen a team handle crisis communications as well as they did,” the impressed CEO wrote . “Stood up to face the music immediately to provide transparent answers to the community. An example for us all to look up to.” The CEO’s post also revealed details of how Ethena reacted to the crisis, claiming it handled the largest single day of redemptions and unwound all unrealized exposure to Bybit within an hour of the news breaking. The timely response was great, but Ethena Labs is going even further in its quest to ensure its community can continue to have faith in its ability to carry out its daily activities while keeping them protected. As earlier stated, Bybit was attacked by malicious actors, eventually alleged to be the infamous Lazarus Group, late Friday. The exploit led to the loss of $1.4 billion in various cryptocurrencies, and affected many projects including Ethena Labs which faced a potential crisis as its investors worried about a significant depeg for USDe. On Bybit’s part, the company’s CEO, Ben Zhou, reassured customers that withdrawal channels were still open, though processing times were delayed due to congestion. Zhou would later share a heartfelt post on X, where he expressed gratitude for the solidarity the crypto space has shown Bybit in the aftermath of the hack. Ben Zhou, the co-founder of Bybit. Some protocols stepped in to make it harder for the hackers to get the funds out and other exchanges like Binance and Bitget loaned Bybit some funds to ensure they didn’t have to suspend withdrawals, which would have undoubtedly caused mass panic in the minds of investors who are still healing from the FTX debacle. With the worst behind it, the company is focusing on recovering its stolen funds and rebuilding its coffers. On Saturday, Bybit offered 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to on-chain sleuths who could help the firm recover the stolen assets. Zhou has also shared an SOS to any bridges willing to freeze or recover the funds stolen from his exchange. On February 24, Zhou revealed in an update that his exchange has now fully closed the ETH gap following the hack and will publish a new audited POR report soon. The Bybit hack affected Ethena Labs’ USDe Ethena’s USDe was one of the tokens that saw some volatility over the weekend due to the Bybit hack. The instability caused it to plunge to 0.982 against USDT and 0.988 against USDC, as investors worried that the protocol was disproportionately exposed to Bybit’s ether (ETH) derivatives market. While Bybit executives sprung into action doing damage control, Ethena Labs also got busy assuring its investors that all assets backing USDe were held off-exchange on a custodian named Copper, which allows users to post collateral without depositing the asset on a CEX and that it had a reserve fund that was more than enough to offset any losses from the Bybit exploit. The quick disclosure calmed investors and prevented mass hysteria even though Ethena Labs initially had $30 million in exposure to Bybit through its financial derivatives. Tom Wan, the head of data at Entropy Advisors highlighted Ethena Labs’ resilience in how it honored $123 million in redemptions on February 21, 2025, about 2% of the $6 billion total supply. USDe supply is now down to $5.88 billion. Wan also noted that $248M USDe was unstaked from the staking contract, with the largest redemption coming from the Spark PSM3 contract’s $202M on February 21. The contract alone accounted for 81% of the unstake total. The USDe staking ratio dropped from 67% to 63.5% (-3.5%). Fortunately, sUSDe’s APY fared better, increasing to 9.15%, slightly above the savings rate of USDs (8.75%). USDe recorded the largest daily selling volume at $203M on February 21 on the secondary market, offset by a buying volume of $180M. Chart showing sUSDe’s and USDe’s trading volume in February. Source: @tomwanhh (X/Twitter) Although USDe briefly dipped to $0.98 on February 21, the median DEX price and price peg held steady at $0.9993. Bybit is one of the key venues for USDe, so the USDe balance held in CEXs dropped from 580M to 388M (-33%) after the hack. However, the simultaneous increase into the Ethereal DEX early deposit vault indicated investors still had confidence in the Ethena network and Ethena Labs. Good news from South Korea Ethena Labs did not come out of the Bybit hack unscathed, but it mitigated the damage well below the worst-case scenario. Already, Ethena Labs has assured investors all is well and even debuted its Chaos Labs partnership to provide increased transparency. On another note, earlier today, Bithumb, the leading exchange in South Korea with the largest number of subscribers in 2024, announced that it had added $ ENA to the KRW market and launched an airdrop event linked to the announcement. According to details from the exchange’s blog, those who trade ENA for two consecutive days will receive ENA. The blog also contained details about what $ENA is and some restrictions put in place to provide a safe trading environment. Some of the restrictions include how buying orders are restricted for 5 minutes after the start of trading while selling orders are restricted for 5 minutes after the start of trading at prices less than -10% of the standard price and more than +100% of the standard price. Automatic orders are only possible after the first transaction after the start of trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

AVAX struggles to stabilize after a significant decline, while SUI faces a potential downside due to a bearish technical pattern. These fluctuations highlight the short-term nature of many crypto investments. Meanwhile, Web3Bay presale success—raising over $1.5 million and selling 375 million tokens—suggests that investors are looking beyond market cycles toward real-world utility. With a clear roadmap leading to a decentralized e-commerce marketplace, Web3Bay offers something more than just price speculation. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Resilience Amid Market Turbulence Avalanche (AVAX) has faced significant challenges recently, experiencing a 38% decline over the past month due to a widespread market sell-off. However, despite this downturn, AVAX is demonstrating resilience. Currently, trading at $24.50, the token has seen a slight increase of $0.55 (approximately 2.3%) from the previous close, with intraday highs of $24.55 and lows of $23.46. According to analyst Ali Martinez, a critical support level at $20 is essential for AVAX to maintain stability and prevent further losses. Furthermore, additional analysis suggests that AVAX may still be in a corrective phase, with immediate support at $19.80 and a broader support zone between $12.49 and $16.74. To initiate a recovery, AVAX must surpass the key resistance level of $32.34, potentially signaling a positive shift in momentum. As a result, investors are closely monitoring these support and resistance levels to assess AVAX’s potential for stabilization and future growth. Sui (SUI) Faces Potential Downturn Amid Bearish Pattern Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.31, reflecting a slight increase of $0.12 (approximately 0.0376%) from the previous close. During intraday trading, the token has experienced a high of $3.35 and a low of $3.15. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez has identified a head and shoulders pattern on the SUI/USDT chart, a bearish reversal indicator suggesting potential downward movement. Specifically, the pattern’s neckline is positioned at $3.00; a decisive drop below this level could confirm the bearish trend, potentially targeting a decline toward $1.60. On the other hand, maintaining support above the $3.30-$3.35 range and surpassing the $3.60-$3.80 resistance zone may invalidate the bearish outlook, paving the way for a bullish reversal. Consequently, traders are closely monitoring these critical support and resistance levels to inform their strategies. Web3Bay’s 2025 Roadmap: From Testnet to Fully Decentralized Marketplace With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and more than 375 million tokens sold at a batch price of $0.00456, Web3Bay is gaining strong traction as it moves toward its next phase. Currently, in Stage 4, the project is gearing up for key developments aimed at delivering a fully decentralized e-commerce platform. The first major milestone is the testnet launch, which will allow early adopters and developers to interact with Web3Bay’s core features, ensuring smart contracts and decentralized transactions function smoothly. Shortly after, Web3Bay will integrate cross-chain compatibility, expanding usability across multiple blockchain networks for seamless transactions. Moreover, strategic partnerships with blockchain payment processors and logistics providers are also in the pipeline to enhance real-world adoption. Following these integrations, the transition to a fully decentralized marketplace will be the final step, where users will have full control over transactions, and governance will be entirely DAO-driven. Additionally, the roadmap includes plans for NFT-based ownership verification, staking rewards, and DeFi integration, creating a broader Web3 commerce ecosystem. As the presale progresses, investors are closely watching Web3Bay’s execution strategy, with early supporters positioning themselves for potential long-term value growth. By 2025, the project aims to redefine how digital and physical assets are traded, giving users complete ownership without centralized intermediaries. Short-Term Swings vs. Long-Term Growth Price fluctuations in Avalanche (AVAX) and Sui (SUI) demonstrate how quickly market sentiment can shift. AVAX is working to recover from recent losses, while SUI faces bearish signals that could lead to further declines. For traders focused on immediate price action, these movements create opportunities and risks. However, Web3Bay’s presale performance, raising over $1.5 million with 375 million tokens sold, reflects a different investment approach—one centered on long-term adoption and real-world application. As speculative tokens navigate market cycles, Web3Bay’s roadmap toward a fully decentralized marketplace offers a clearer path to sustained value.

The company confirmed at its investor day on Tuesday that merchants, freelancers, and global sellers will soon be able to pay, get paid, and settle transactions with PYUSD in ways that weren’t possible before. The plan is simple but aggressive—integrate PYUSD into bill payments, Hyperwallet’s mass payouts, and eventually, crypto settlements for all PayPal checkout transactions. The push isn’t just about giving users another payment option—it’s about turning PYUSD into a default digital cash system. Merchants will use PYUSD for bill payments this year PayPal is rolling out a PYUSD-powered bill-pay feature that will allow over 20 million small-to-medium-sized businesses to pay their vendors using the stablecoin. Michelle Gill, who leads PayPal’s small business and financial services unit, broke down the move at the company’s investor event in New York. “A lot of the payments we’re expecting are going to be cross-border because merchants in the US are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad,” Gill said . “The thesis was: Can we facilitate that on PYUSD rails so as not to have the currency conversion, the friction, as well as time?” The idea is to eliminate unnecessary banking fees and delays by keeping all transactions inside PayPal’s ecosystem. Instead of wiring payments through traditional banking networks—which often come with currency conversion costs, long wait times, and extra fees—businesses will be able to send PYUSD instantly, with no middlemen involved. PayPal already completed its first business transaction using PYUSD last year, proving that the rails are ready. Now, it’s about getting merchants to actually use it. PYUSD is coming to Hyperwallet’s mass payout system Beyond merchant payments, PayPal is bringing PYUSD to Hyperwallet, a mass payment service that helps businesses send money to contractors, freelancers, and sellers globally. PayPal bought Hyperwallet for $400 million in 2018, and now, it’s turning it into a crypto-powered payout engine. PYUSD payouts will go live in the first half of this year, and the goal is clear—give businesses a faster, cheaper, and more efficient way to send large-scale global payments without needing to rely on banks. That’s a big deal for freelancers, gig workers, and independent sellers who use Hyperwallet to get paid by companies worldwide. Instead of waiting days for bank transfers or dealing with high wire fees, they’ll be able to receive PYUSD instantly, straight into their PayPal accounts. CEO Alex Chriss, who took over in September 2023, made it clear that crypto payments are no longer just an idea—they’re happening now. “We’ve been talking about blockchains for like a decade now,” Chriss said. “The concept of these things never becomes real until you actually can start to spend it. And I think that’s what we’re enabling.” Venmo is becoming a serious business tool At PayPal’s first investor day in four years, Chriss laid out his long-term vision for Venmo, shifting it from a peer-to-peer money app to a full-scale business payments platform. The company now expects Venmo revenue to surpass $2 billion by 2027, a major jump from $900 million in 2021. It’s already making moves to turn Venmo into a go-to payment tool for businesses, with more merchants adding “Pay with Venmo” as an option. To push Venmo beyond the consumer market and into the world of business transactions, PayPal has partnered with companies including DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster.In its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this month, PayPal said the number of merchants using Pay with Venmo increased 50% from a year earlier. The Venmo debit card is now a major focus, with total payment volume expected to grow at 20% annually, while “Pay With Venmo” is expanding at double that rate, according to a CNBC report . PayPal’s stock has taken a massive hit in recent years, with its market cap dropping over 80% from mid-2021 to late 2023. Chriss is trying to reverse that by focusing on transaction margins and steady revenue growth. At investor day, he laid out a financial roadmap, projecting high single-digit transaction margin growth and low double-digit earnings per share growth by 2027. The company is also bringing in new partners to expand Venmo’s reach. Instacart and MoonPay joined as partners last quarter, showing that Venmo is becoming a bigger player in crypto transactions and online commerce. “While we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers,” Chriss said on the earnings call. “This gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

33767162,[object Object],1740537000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price About To Complete 4th Falling Wedge Breakout Of The Cycle Toward $1,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-falling-wedge-breakout/,"The Dogecoin price could be gearing up for an explosive rally to $1 as technical indicators suggest the meme coin is about to complete its fourth Falling Wedge pattern . A crypto analyst reveals that past breakouts from similar formations have led to strong price rallies, with the highest gain of 445% recorded in previous cycles. Falling Wedge Signals Major Breakout For Dogecoin Price According to Trader Tardigrade on X (formerly Twitter), Dogecoin is set to breakout of its fourth Falling Wedge pattern, signaling the potential of a surge above $1 . The analyst presented a technical analysis of the Dogecoin price, using past Falling Wedges and historical price action to support his bullish outlook. For more clarity, a Falling Wedge is a bullish technical pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price action creates two downward converging trendlines, signifying a period of consolidation during a downtrend, with the expectation of a price breakout or an uptrend continuation. Based on the analyst’s chart, the Falling Wedge has historically signaled strong bullish momentum for Dogecoin, with each breakout triggering a price rally that surpassed the last. After a breakout from the Falling Wedge in November 2023, the meme coin performed exceptionally, recording an 88% gain that pushed it to the $0.11 price high. Similarly, in March 2024, Dogecoin broke out of its second Falling Wedge and initiated a rapid 208% price rally to new highs. At the time, the cryptocurrency hit a peak of between $0.22 and $0.25. In November, which marked the meme coin’s third Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin experienced a price surge, jumping by 445%, to reach $0.4. Based on these historic bullish trends, Trader Tardigrade predicts that DOGE could mirror a similar Falling Wedge break-out pattern, potentially triggering a powerful price surge to $1.5. This would represent a 650% increase from its current price of $0.2, in line with past Falling Wedge breakouts that have consistently fueled higher gains. Analyst Says DOGE 2025 Bull Run Incoming In another more recent X post , Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin is experiencing downward pressure, which has caused its price to plummet by 57%. However, according to the analyst‘s report, this crash isn’t a cause for alarm, as Dogecoin has historically rebounded swiftly after experiencing similar declines of over 55% in previous bull cycles. During the 2017 and 2020 bull cycles, DOGE experienced a 60% and 56% decline, respectively. After retesting a key level in both cycles, the cryptocurrency underwent a rapid price rally to new highs. Based on this trend, Trader Tardigrade predicts that once Dogecoin reaches a similar retest level , a massive bull run could be imminent.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Period|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|meme coin|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-26 02:30:00

While innovative, its growth trajectory has been steady rather than explosive. Kaspa (KAS): At $0.089199 , KAS is a relatively new entrant focusing on rapid block intervals. Despite its technological promise, it hasn’t yet achieved widespread adoption. Aptos (APT): Valued at $5.58 , APT aims to deliver safe and scalable Layer 1 blockchain solutions.

Bulls have lost control, but despite the selling pressure, XRP remains strong above the $2 mark—a critical level that must hold to prevent further declines. The recent downturn has added to market uncertainty as investors look for signs of stabilization. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation Top analyst Ali Martinez shared an analysis on X, revealing that XRP is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, signaling a potential downside. According to Martinez, XRP could target $1.65 if the breakdown continues, making the next few weeks crucial for its price action. The overall market remains under pressure, with altcoins struggling to reclaim key levels. Bulls could push for a recovery if XRP manages to hold above $2 and regain momentum. However, failing to defend this support could result in a deeper correction, putting additional pressure on the broader crypto market. XRP Bulls Try To Reclaim Bullish Momentum XRP is trading below key levels as it tries to reclaim bullish price action amid the broader market selloff. The entire crypto market has been under pressure after Bitcoin lost its weekly support, triggering panic and increasing selling pressure across altcoins. XRP, like most major assets, has struggled to hold its ground, dropping sharply over the past few days. Martinez’s analysis on X reveals that XRP is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, signaling a potential move lower. According to Martinez, XRP could target $1.65 if it fails to hold current demand levels. This breakdown aligns with the overall market weakness, where bulls are struggling to regain control. Despite the bearish outlook, XRP is still holding above the $2.20 mark, where buyers are attempting to defend the price from further declines. Short-term selling pressure seems to be fading, and if bulls can maintain support above this level, a recovery could be on the table. However, if XRP fails to reclaim the $2.40 level soon, bears could take control and push the price further down. The next few days will be critical for XRP’s price action as the market looks for a potential reversal or continued downside. Related Reading: Cardano Remains In Consolidation – Expert Projects 25% Price Move Price Holds Above Key Support XRP is trading at $2.22 after briefly dropping to $2.05, following the recent wave of selling pressure that has shaken the entire crypto market. The price has struggled to reclaim higher levels as fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment. Investors are closely watching for a potential recovery, but bears remain in control for now. For XRP to regain momentum, bulls must hold the price above the $2.20 level and establish it as strong support. A sustained hold at this level could set the stage for a recovery rally, with the next key resistance around $2.40. However, if selling pressure intensifies and XRP fails to maintain its current support, the $2 mark will be the last stronghold for buyers.

On the other hand, a quick bounce above $2.30 could indicate a shift in momentum, allowing bulls to regain control and push the price toward $2.50 and beyond. The next few days will be critical for XRP’s short-term price action, as investors look for signs of strength amid ongoing market volatility.
